sequence_analysis microindel detection in short_read motivation several recent_studies the effectiveness of resequencing and single_nucleotide snv detection by deep short_read sequencing_platforms while several reliable algorithms are available for automated snv detection the automated_detection of microindels in deep short_read presents a new bioinformatics challenge results we systematically_analyzed how the short_read tools maq bowtie burrows_wheeler alignment_tool bwa novoalign and razers perform on simulated_datasets that contain indels and evaluated how indels affect error_rates in snv detection we implemented a simple_algorithm to compute the equivalent indel region eir which can be used to process the alignments produced by the mapping tools in order to perform indel calling using simulated_data that contains indels we demonstrate that indel detection works well on short_read the detection rate for microindels bp is our study provides insights into systematic errors in snv detection that is based on ungapped short sequence read_alignments gapped alignments of short_sequence can be used to reduce this error and to detect microindels in simulated short_read a comparison with microindels automatically identified on the abi sanger and roche platform indicates that microindel detection from short_sequence identifies both overlapping and distinct indels microinsertions and microdeletions indels constitute a class of genetic_mutations that play_an in human genetic disease the reliable_detection of microinsertions and microdeletions is thus a prerequisite for current efforts to assess the medical relevance of genetic_variation including small_indels across the human_genome structural_variations on the order of kilobases whose prevalence has long been underestimated because of the lack of appropriate methods of detection have been recently shown to be responsible for more polymorphism than single_nucleotide snvs as measured by nucleotide content per genome therefore we hypothesized that also on the scale of only a few nucleotides the frequency of microindels might have been underestimated performed an analysis on sequences amplified by long_range pcr to compare three next_generation ngs_platforms illumina ga roche flx and abi solid to the de facto gold_standard of abi sanger_sequencing all three ngs_platforms showed high_sensitivity in variant_calling for sequence sites covered to saturation however for microindel detection they only compared the results of the automated microindel detection pipeline of the roche platform to abi sanger_sequencing currently only few software solutions for microindel detection in short_read are available and they do not yet meet the need for unambiguous microindel positioning in addition the evaluation of automated microindel detection on ngs_data remains difficult as a gold_standard is lackingon the abi sanger platform the automated_detection of heterozygous microindels remains highly error_prone in the targeted sequence analyzed in indels were identified by abi sanger whereas additional indels that were not found by abi sanger were called by roche on the other hand there were five singlebase indels in homopolymers that were called by abi sanger but not by roche this illustrates that the existing_approaches to automated_detection of microindels remain a technological challenge with presumably high false positive_and rates because of the high_error of automated indel detection with the abi sanger platform and the roche technology we were motivated to study the potential to identify microindels in short_read produced on ngs_platforms we introduce a simple indel calling algorithm that is based on the efficient mapping of short_reads and which takes_into the fact that short_sequence containing indels may often not be unequivocally aligned to the reference_genome due to the surrounding sequence our microindel calling algorithm makes use of gapped alignments produced by efficient short_read tools such as burrows_wheeler alignment_tool bwa novoalign or razers in order to call snvs and indels as the true distributions and frequencies of microindels in genomic_sequences remain_unknown due to technological shortcomings we use a simulation approach to perform an analysis for varying microindel sizes and frequencies and study the effect on snvpage due to the large amount of short_read that ngs_platforms produce efficient read_mapping tools quickly narrow down the candidate_regions where a read possibly maps in this candidate_region local alignment_algorithms are used to minimize the mismatched nucleotides and inserted gaps an alignment score is finally used to report the best matching alignment generally two different terms contribute to the alignment score a penalty from mismatched bases and a penalty in case of gap insertions the exact values of and depend on the one hand on global settings of the alignment algorithm that is on the applied similarity matrices and on gap opening and extension penalties quality values of the aligned nucleotides as well as their positions in the reads can be taken into account on the other hand the alignment score is locally influenced by the surrounding sequence it is crucial to understand that the optimal alignment score that is reported for a read depends on the algorithmic parameters as well as on the sequence_context this explains why one and the same read may be aligned to the very same starting and ending positions by twodifferent mapping tools and yet their alignment shapes and score may differ a read that covers a certain microindel of a certain size may also be aligned with a gap in one sequence_context or with mismatches in another depending on the neighboring nucleotides if the position of the inserted or deleted sequence is located at the beginning or end of the short sequence_read or if the surrounding nucleotides are similar to the indel sequence an alignment with partially mismatched bases might yield a better alignment score and thus lead to a false alignment with respect to the true sample sequence the genome_wide frequency of small base_pair insertions_and might have been previously underestimated for a simple reason traditional sequencing_techniques are simply not overly good at automated_detection of short indels especially if they are heterozygous in the abi sanger and roche platforms were used for automated indel detection only out of microindels bp was detected by both platforms suggesting high false_negative and false_positive of both page technologies the pyrosequencing technology of roche uses the fluorescent signal_strength of incorporated nucleotides in a homopolymer to estimate its length however the signal_strength for homopolymer stretches is only linear for up to eight consecutive nucleotides resulting in a higher_error for larger homopolymer stretches five indels detected by abi sanger but not by roche and one indel detected by roche but not by abi sanger are flanked by such homopolymers another issue is whether indels detected in the targeted sequence are actually present in the genomic_dna of the individual or are artifacts of the long_range pcr_amplification process especially sites with short_tandem exhibit_higher mutation_rates in pcr_reactions due to dna slippage mutations that occurred during the sample amplification will thus be present at frequencies far below seven of the indels only detected by roche are such extensions or contractions of short_tandem interestingly four of these seven indels could also be seen in alignments of illumina short_reads however they were not called as indels by our approach as their frequency did not pass the frequency threshold of this might indicate that some indels detected by roche and other ngs_platforms are actually false_positives due to the sample_preparation this error_rate might be reduced if dna enrichment techniques are used that are not based on an in vitro amplification step we analyzed the performance of a indel calling algorithm that uses an unambiguous definition of an indel region on simulated_datasets containing indels with frequencies ranging from f indel kb to f indel kb and demonstrated that the sensitivity and positive_predictive are almost constant over a range of two orders_of our study has provided insight into systematic errors in snv detection that is based on short_read sequence_alignments false_positive error_rates in snv detection can be markedly_reduced by using mapping tools that enable gapped alignments microindel detection in short read_alignments using a simple_algorithm to calculate the equivalent indel region was shown to be technically_feasible in simulated_datasets the sensitivity of automated indel detection from short_reads is comparable with automated indel detection methods on abi sanger or the roche platform continued improvements in our understanding of the technical issues of ngs_platforms will allow the development of more sophisticated analysis methodologies
