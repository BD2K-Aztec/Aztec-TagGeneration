kmad knowledge based multiple_sequence for intrinsically_disordered intrinsically_disordered idps lack tertiary_structure and thus differ from globular_proteins in terms of their sequencestructurefunction relations idps have lower sequence_conservation different types of active_sites and a different distribution of functionally_important regions which altogether make their multiple_sequence msa difficult the kmad msa software has been written specifically for the alignment and annotation of idps it augments the substitution matrix with knowledge about post_translational functional_domains and short_linear results msas produced with kmad describe well conserved_features among idps tend to agree well with biological intuition and are a good basis for designing new experiments to shed light on this large understudied class of proteins availability_and kmad web_server is accessible atmore than of all human proteins contain unfolded regions this stands in marked contrast to how little we know about them intrinsically_disordered idps lack a stable tertiary_structure and thus lack a hydrophobic_core they thus also lack an active_site idps often interact with other proteins by means of short_linear slims which are very abundant in disordered_regions this is a fundamental component of cell_signalling these idp characteristics have many consequences for aligning their sequences and thus for their study in general algorithms underlying existing msa software are directly_or based on knowledge obtained from studying d protein_structures aligning a hydrophobic residue in the protein core with a hydrophilic one is penalized heavily when aligning ordered proteins but this is much less the case when aligning idps simply because idps do not have a hydrophobic_core in addition folded_proteins contain large protein_protein surfaces ion binding_sites active_sites or other d motifs that msa software capitalizes on while idps generally consist of short motifs surrounded by stretches of highly variable_length and composition the main function determinants of idps are slims and posttranslational_modifications ptms for the specific purpose of aligning idps we introduce knowledge based multiple_sequence msa for idps or kmad that incorporates slim domain and ptm annotations in the alignment procedure obviously the inclusion of this knowledge will cause these motifs to line up in the final msa without certainty that this reflects biological reality this way however kmad generates hypotheses that can be validated experimentally to progress for example protein_engineering drug_design or the analysis of genetic_disorders in these research_fields scientists most often are interested in one single protein and want to gather information for this one protein in the particular case of idps such information normally relates to slims and ptms and how conserved these are in an msa in the hssp project the concept of the insertion free msa was introduced specifically for this v c the author published_by kmad overcomes several problems_encountered with other methods when aligning idps two examples are shown_inand the first example illustrates the advantage of kmads use of slims clustal omega spreads out the lig bir ii motif in the kmad alignment the motif is lined up nicely in all sequences but even if this predicted slim should not be aligned as in the b panel of the bioscientist will still benefit from awareness of the presence of this conserved motif in the n_terminal segment the second example illustrates the use of ptms the phosphorylated serines at positions and in the first sequence are shifted to the left relative to the columns of phosphorylated serines at positions and in the other four sequences a gap at position in the query_sequence would be a better solution in this case but because we want to keep the first sequence indel free an insertion is introduced in all other sequences the phosphorylated serine at position in the first sequence seems better aligned with the serines at position in sequences and and indeed kmad finds this solution eventually glycosylated asparagines at position in sequences and should most probably be aligned to asparagines at position from sequences all problems mentioned above are solved by kmad with no harm to the rest of the alignment the problem excerpts from clustal omega and kmad alignments of human sialoprotein sial human with four homologues a clustal omega alignment annotated with ptms b kmad alignment annotated with ptms ptm_sites are highlighted with bright colours red is annotated phosphorylation orange is predicted phosphorylation green is n linked glycosylation further colour details are given on the project website the two serines that seem to appear in the sequences and around position in the kmad alignment are located in the gap indicated with lowercase characters around position in the clustal omega alignment in dna analysis protein_engineering etc this software feature is used frequently the gapped_alignment that provides a more phylogeny oriented view on this sequence family is available at the kmad websitemore balibase results and also prefab benchmarking results are available at the kmad website schematic representation of kmads scoring_function i and j are positions in the profile and in the sequence respectively profile i is a vector of length that contains the frequencies of the amino_acid types m at position i in the alignment that resulted from the previous iteration in the first iteration all profile values are or according to the first sequence d is an idp specific substitution matrix the residue score is the convolution of the profile vector for i and the d column for j x ft are weights for the three feature_types f t x ft weights optionally can be set by the user u f i values for ptms and slims are determined from the conservation of that feature at i u f i values for domains are the conservation of the domain at position i minus the conservation of all other domains at that position the terms r relate to the perceived reliability pr of the feature experimentally_determined ptms for example weigh three times_higher than predicted ones r f i j is the product of the average pr of the feature f at position i in the profile and the pr of this feature at position j in the sequence the metascore for j is the weighted_sum of scores for all observed features that the predicted threonine phosphorylation_sites around position cannot be lined up is beyond kmads reach figures and provide two examples in which knowledge of the presence of sequence_motifs is used to better align those motifs this method is of course highly cyclic and we therefore compared the performance of kmad with five other msa methods using the balibase and prefab suites most proteins in these benchmarks have a stable d structure while kmad was designed for the alignment of idps we therefore used kmad in refinement mode starting with clustal omega alignments to avoid circularity when testing kmad on the balibase motif reference_set we performed a leave_one validation i e in each alignment the motif annotated by balibase was excluded from the kmad annotations the score differences inare all within the margin of error given that noise in the benchmarks www cmbi ru nl kmad balibase contributes a few percent to the scores we chose four sequence families for testing the cpu performance of the six methods the sequences in these families on average are about and amino_acids respectively from each family subsets of k k and k were selected and these groups of sequences were aligned with each of the six methods using each time one core on the same computer that had more than adequate ram so that the wall time of each calculation provided a good measure for the cpu performance of the method the results are visualized in in this plot some points are missing because we stopped each alignment when after week no result had been returned yet clearly kmad outperforms the other methods for large_alignments
