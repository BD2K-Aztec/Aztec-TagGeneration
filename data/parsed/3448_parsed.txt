pathvar analysis of gene_and variance in cellular_pathways using microarray_data finding significant differences between the expression levels of genes or proteins across diverse biological conditions is one of the primary_goals in the analysis of functional_genomics data however existing_methods for identifying_differentially or sets of genes by comparing measures of the average expression across predefined sample groups do not detect differential variance in the expression levels across genes in cellular_pathways since corresponding pathway deregulations occur frequently in microarray gene or protein expression data we present a new dedicated web_application pathvar to analyze these data_sources the software ranks pathway representing gene protein_sets in terms of the differences of the variance in the within pathway expression levels across different biological conditions apart from identifying new pathway deregulation patterns the tool exploits these patterns by combining different machine_learning to find clusters of similar samples and build sample classification_models availability freely_available atin the search for new diagnostic_biomarkers one of the first steps is often the identification of significant differences in the expression levels of genes or proteins across different biological conditions commonly used statistical_methods for this purpose quantify the extent and significance of changes in measures of the average expression levels of single genes proteins see for example smyth or analyze aggregated_data for gene protein_sets representing entire cellular_pathways and processes however since these approaches compare measures of averaged expression levels they cannot study how the variance of expression levels across the genes proteins of a cellular pathway termed pathway expression variance here changes under different biological conditions in this article we present a web_application for microarray_data analysis to identify and prioritize pathways with changes in the pathway expression variance across samples unsupervised setting or predefined sample groups supervised to whom correspondence should be addressed left box plot comparing the median expression levels in the kegg urea_cycle pathway hsa for the prostate_cancer dataset by across healthy_individuals green and tumor patients red right box plot comparing the variance of expression levels in the same pathway and microarray_dataset see also supplementary_material setting in particular we show example cases on cancer data in which significant pathway deregulations manifest themselves in terms of changes in the variance of gene protein expression levels in pathways while no significant changes can be detected in the median pathway expression levels see section results on cancer microarray_data and finally we discuss how the software enables automated sample clustering and classification using the extracted pathway expression variances
