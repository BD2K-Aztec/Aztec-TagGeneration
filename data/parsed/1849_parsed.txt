structural_bioinformatics flexible meccano a tool for the generation of explicit ensemble descriptions of intrinsically_disordered and their associated experimental observables motivation intrinsically_disordered idps represent a significant fraction of the human_proteome the classical structure function paradigm that has successfully underpinned our understanding of molecular_biology breaks down when considering proteins that have no stable tertiary_structure in their functional_form one convenient approach is to describe the protein in terms of an equilibrium of rapidly inter converting conformers currently tools to generate such ensemble descriptions are extremely_rare and poorly adapted to the prediction of experimental_data results we present flexible meccanoa highly_efficient algorithm that generates ensembles of molecules on the basis of amino_acid specific conformational potentials and volume exclusion conformational_sampling depends uniquely on the primary sequence with the possibility of introducing additional local or long_range conformational propensities at an amino_acid specific resolution the algorithm can also be used to calculate expected_values of experimental parameters measured at atomic or molecular resolution such as nuclear_magnetic nmr and small angle scattering respectively we envisage that flexible meccano will be useful for researchers who wish to compare experimental_data with those expected from a fully disordered protein researchers who see experimental_evidence of deviation from random_coil behaviour in their protein or researchers who are interested in working with a broad ensemble of conformers representing the flexibility of the idp of interest availability a fully documented multi_platform executable is provided with examples atthe realization that a significant percentage of the functional proteins encoded in eukaryotic_genomes are fully or partially to whom correspondence should be addressed disordered in their functional state has revolutionized_our of structural and molecular_biology intrinsically_disordered idps or proteins containing long intrinsically_disordered do not adopt a stable d fold and therefore fall beyond the scope of classical structural_biology idps are biologically functional in the disordered state imposing a very different perspective on the relationship between primary protein_sequence and function compared with the standard structure_function that underpins our understanding of molecular_biology idps are implicated in a large number of human_pathologies and the development of pharmacological solutions to these problems awaits a molecular description of the role of flexibility in a number of diseases in order to understand the conformational behaviour of idps it is essential to develop a molecular description of the disordered state the structural_biology paradigm shifts when we consider disordered proteins so that the determination of a single structure has no real physical relevance or at best can only describe isolated sub states on a vast potential energy_landscape a structural description of idps rather aims to determine rules that define the behaviour of the flexible protein in terms of probabilities of populating different regions of conformational_space and to correlate these probabilities with the function of the protein the description of conformational propensities can be conveniently achieved by evoking an explicit ensemble description of interconverting structures in equilibrium due to the very large number of degrees_of available to such a disordered system the problem of defining conformational_space is highly underdetermined requiring extensive experimental_data to delimit the structural propensities of a given protein novel analytical_tools are required to exploit the specific conformational sensitivity of different experimental parameters each experimental nmr parameter for example is sensitive to different aspects of the structural and dynamic behaviour of the disordered state and requires specific consideration of the relevant averaging properties of the physical_interaction is the flexible meccano statistical coil description this can be modified in terms of additional propensities to form secondary_structure by modifying the amino_acid specific potentials or by introducing long_range biophysical parameters radius_of and sampling and expected experimental parameters shown figuratively on the right for example nmr rdcs pres etc are calculated for this conformational regime as well as explicit conformational ensemble of backbone conformers
