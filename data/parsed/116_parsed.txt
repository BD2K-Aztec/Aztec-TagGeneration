adapt mix learning local genetic correlation_structure improves summary_statistics based analyses motivation approaches to identifying new risk_loci training risk_prediction imputing untyped variants and fine_mapping causal_variants from summary_statistics of genome_wide are playing an increasingly important role in the human_genetics community current summary_statistics based_methods rely on global best guess reference_panels to model the genetic correlation_structure of the dataset being studied this approach especially in admixed_populations has the potential to produce misleading_results ignores variation in local structure and is not feasible when appropriate reference_panels are missing or small here we develop a method adapt mix that combines information across all available reference_panels to produce estimates of local genetic correlation_structure for summary_statistics based_methods in arbitrary populations results we applied adapt mix to estimate the genetic correlation_structure of both admixed and non admixed individuals using simulated_and we evaluated our method by measuring the performance of two summary_statistics based_methods imputation and joint testing when using our method as opposed to the current standard of best guess reference_panels we observed a decrease in mean squared error for imputation and a decrease in mean squared error for joint testing summary_statistics of association tests such as effect_size estimates and their standard_errors are becoming the datatype of choice in many genetic_analyses due to two significant advantages first summary_statistics based_methods are generally orders_of than their genotype based counterparts the rapidly increasing size of existing and planned cohorts is causing computational bottlenecks for some standard analyses second analyses of summary_statistics are often a necessity since access to individual_level data is complicated by privacy and other issues publication of summary_statistics is now required for all nature genetics genome_wide gwas papers and these statistics have already been released for a large number of traits for these reasons a growing number of summary statisticsbased methods including imputation of z scores joint testing fine_mapping of causal_variants quality_control of gwas results and gene based tests have recently been published moving_forward the integration of summary_statistics will be vital for increasing our knowledge of various complex_diseases and phenotypes we applied adapt mix to summary_statistics from simulated_and to estimate the pairwise snp correlation_matrix r in this work we use z_score imputation and joint testing for both datasets we used several approaches to estimate r and impute z scores all imputation was done using a window_size of snps and k the values for window_size and k were chosen based on the recommended settings used in we measured the impact of using different methods to estimate r on z_score imputation by computing the mse and pearson_correlation r between the imputed z scores and true z scores in addition to imputation we also performed joint testing in the simulated_data because we had access to the individual genotypes and thus they could compute the true snp correlation_matrix again we measured the effect of several r estimation methods on joint testing by computing the mse and r between the true joint statistics and the estimated joint statistics summary_statistics based_methods requiring an estimate of the genetic correlation_matrix are becoming increasingly popular however very few gwas include ld_information in their released data in prior work this information has been approximated by using ld_information from best guess reference_panels but here we show that this can lead to high_error even when a population closely matching the study population is available our method can be used to improve the accuracy of any summary_statistics based method that requires ld_information by more accurately estimating the local genetic correlation_structure using information available across several reference_populations our simulations have demonstrated the importance of accurately estimating the genetic correlation_matrix using adapt mix to estimate ld for summary_statistics methods can increase their power and decrease their false_positive for example for z_score imputation showed that as long as there is a best guess reference_panel available there is no increase in false_positive when imputing summary_statistics however in the case that there is no best guess panel available we have shown that thereadapt mix learning local genetic correlation_structure improves summary_statistics based analyses i is a potential for increased false_positives by using the wrong reference_panel one of the biggest benefits of our method is allowing the analysis of arbitrary populations when a matching reference_panel is not available we were able impute z scores and compute joint statistics with better precision best guess panels alone even after leaving out the relevant best guess panels from our computation of r for datasets with admixed individuals the high variability of ancestry proportions may make it harder to consistently model ld in an accurate manner with a single reference_panel for example in the native_american component latinos there is a high_level of population_substructure in the genomes reference_panels there are currently no native_american reference_panels available although proxy populations such as chb and jpt are often used they are unlikely to capture the full resolution of each underlying sub population accounting for all the fine_scale differences seen in admixed individuals will improve with the collection of additional reference_panels in this work we aimed to minimize the mse of imputed summary_statistics in our objective_function because imputation was one of our main focuses for other purposes it may be more appropriate to use a different objective depending on how the pairwise correlation estimates will ultimately be used for example use summary_statistics to fine map causal_variants by finding the set of variants that maximize the likelihood of a multivariate_normal in this case optimizing frequencies for reference_panels by using the multivariate_normal likelihood may improve performance improvements to adapt mix may be made by using an out ofsample approach to learning the mixture frequencies due to the potential of overfitting typically overfitting will cause high prediction_error variances we have shown though with the example of joint testing that overfitting should not be a major_concern as the error variances are smaller when using adapt mix compared with a best guess panel another enhancement could be made to adapt mix by using partial correlations often covariates such as principal_components are included in gwas which alter the genetic correlation_structure of the individuals being studied partial correlations which account for these covariates may provide even more accurate estimates of the r for use in summary_statistics methods
