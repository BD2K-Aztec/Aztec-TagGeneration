sequence_analysis a classification model for g to a hypermutation in hepatitis_b ultra deep pyrosequencing reads motivation g a hypermutation is an innate antiviral_defense mechanism mediated by host enzymes which leads to the mutational impairment of viruses sensitive and specific identification of host_mediated g a hypermutation is a novel sequence_analysis challenge particularly for viral deep_sequencing studies for example two of the most common hepatitis_b hbv reverse_transcriptase rt drug_resistance a t and m i arise from g a changes and are routinely detected as low_abundance variants in nearly all hbv deep_sequencing samples results we developed a classification model using measures of g a excess and predicted indicators of lethal mutation and applied this model to unique deep sequencing_reads from plasma virus samples from drug treatment nave hbv infected_individuals the of sequence_reads that were classified as hypermutated by our model included most of the reads with a t and or m i indicating the usefulness of this model for distinguishing viral adaptive changes from host_mediated viral editing availability source_code and sequence_data are available athepatitis b virus hbv is a double_stranded dna_virus that infects more than million people worldwide and is a leading cause of mortality as a result of cirrhosis_and in the past_years five nucleoside_analogs have been licensed for hbv treatment these drugs are capable of fully suppressing hbv_replication but rarely eradicate infection because hbv is converted intra cellularly into a stable covalently_closed form hbv replicates via an rna intermediate and its polymerase enzyme has a high mutation_rate similar to other enzymes with reverse_transcriptase activity it thus generates a quasispecies of innumerable related virus variants from which drug_resistant viruses to whom correspondence should be addressed can arise because hbv drug_resistance is one of the obstacles to successful anti hbv therapy current treatment_guidelines hbv genotypic resistance_testing for patients who experience primary_or virological_failure while receiving nucleoside therapy deep_sequencing is increasingly performed on plasma_samples from clinical_trials to determine the clinical_significance of lowabundance human_immunodeficiency hiv and hepatitis_c drug_resistance prior to starting antiviral_treatment we and others have recently described the use of ultra deep pyrosequencing udps with the life_sciences roche genome sequencer flx platform to detect low_abundance hbv variants we previously showed that nucleoside_analog drugresistance mutations not detected by direct pcr sequencing could be detected by udps in as few as of sequence_reads we also observed that many samples contained sequence_reads with unusually_high numbers of guanine g to adenine a changes relative to the direct pcr sequence consistent with the recently described phenomenon of g a hypermutation g a hypermutation results from an innate antiviral_defense mechanism mediated by the activity of host enzymes belonging to the apolipoprotein b rna_editing catalytic polypeptide like apobec family of cytidine deaminases these enzymes are capable of causing extensive deamination of cytidine bases to uridine in negative stranded dna resulting in g a hypermutation in positive stranded dna although apobecmediated g a hypermutation was first reported to act upon hiv it has also been reported to act upon hbv other retroviruses and retrotransposons because extensive g a editing leads to mutational impairment of viruses distinguishing hypermutated sequence_reads from nonhypermutated reads is necessary for accurate analysis of viral_quasispecies this is particularly important in deep_sequencing studies designed to detect low levels of nucleoside_analog drugresistant viruses because two of these a t and m i primarily result from g a substitutions indeed the creation of sensitive and specific methods for identifying apobec mediated g a hypermutation is a novel sequence_analysis challenge we previously described an ad_hoc method for identifying g a hypermutation in hbv sequences now we develop a data derived method using a probabilisticudps provides insight into the evolutionary_dynamics of the emergence of viral drug_resistance and may eventually prove useful in clinical diagnostic_testing however the biological and clinical_significance of hbv udps results cannot be optimally interpreted without being able to distinguish hypermutated from non hypermutated sequence_reads apobec mediated g a hypermutation results from a host_defense mechanism against viral_genomes and retroelements and therefore mutations caused by this mechanism have different biological and clinical_significance from mutations resulting from viral adaptation three groups have developed methods for identifying hypermutated hiv sequences to our knowledge no such method has been developed for hbv or for deep sequencing_reads identifying g a hypermutation in hbv udps reads is particularly challenging because such reads are shorter and therefore contain fewer informative sites than direct pcr sequences moreover in contrast to hiv hbv hypermutation could potentially be mediated by six of the seven enzymes in the apobec family a a c and f h and does not occur in a consistent dinucleotide context in this study we have demonstrated the use of a novel em based model in assigning probabilistic labels to udps reads in order to
