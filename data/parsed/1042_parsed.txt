combenefit an interactive platform for the analysis and visualization of drug_combinations motivation many drug_combinations are routinely assessed to identify synergistic_interactions in the attempt to develop novel treatment_strategies appropriate software is required to analyze the results of these studies results we present combenefit new free software_tool that enables the visualization analysis and quantification of drug_combination effects in terms of synergy and or antagonism data from combinations assays can be processed using classical synergy models loewe bliss hsa as single experiments or in batch for high_throughput this user_friendly provides laboratory scientists with an easy and systematic way to analyze their data the companion package provides bioinformaticians with critical implementations of routines enabling the processing of combination data availability_and combenefit is provided as a matlab_package but also as stand alone software for windows http sourceforge net_projects combenefit the combination of drugs is an important strategy to treat various diseases the goal is to increase efficacy and through the avoidance of overlapping toxicity improve the therapeutic_index of treatment at the discovery stage research often focuses on the identification of synergistic target effects using in vitro systems large_scale combination screens testing multiple pairwise combinations of drugs across different concentration ranges and cell_lines are being performed with increasing frequency typically the doseresponse data generated during these experiments are then analyzed in terms of synergistic or antagonistic_effects free software were developed in the past but these are limited in terms of data_handling and available options particularly given high_throughput hts requirements http www combosyn com two recent commercial software_packages offer advanced features such as automated analyses choice from a variety of models quality curve_fitting variety of graphical displays and metrics quantification chalice http cwr horizondiscovery com genedata https www genedata com there is a lack of free advanced scalable software for the analysis of drug_combinations as part of the growing effort in the search of effective combinations we present here combenefit combinations benefit a new software_tool that enables the visualization analysis and quantification of drug_combination effects in terms of synergy and or antagonism for single combination experiments but also hts as per commercial packages
