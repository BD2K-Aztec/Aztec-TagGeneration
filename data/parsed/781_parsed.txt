biosynther a customized biosynthetic potential explorer motivation one of the most promising applications of biosynthetic methods is to produce chemical products of high value from the ready made chemicals to explore the biosynthetic potentials of a chemical as a synthesis precursor biosynthetic databases and related chemoinformatics tools are urgently_needed in the present work a web_based biosynther is developed to explore the biosynthetic potentials of precursor chemicals using bkm react rhea and more than in house rxnfinder reactions manually_curated biosynther allows researchers to explore biosyn thetic potentials through so_far known biochemical_reactions step_by interactively which could be used as a useful tool in metabolic_engineering and synthetic_biology biosynthesis has important_applications in producing bulk chemicals biofuels or natural_products there are some biosynthesis informatics tools such as bnice retropath desharky and fmm to design biosynthesis pathways from a start molecule to a target_molecule in industrial biotechnology applications researchers usually plan to get value added chemicals from the ready made molecules that is how to automatically explore the biosynthetic potentials of simple chemical precursors in the present work biosynther is developed to assist researchers to get comprehensive biosynthesis target_molecules based on the bkm react reactions rhea reactions and in house rxnfinder reactions www rxnfinder org in biosynther there are three different kinds of display view options to explore biosynthetic potentials interactively for example after users input a starting molecule vanillin three different view options that is tree circle or plain page are available displays the biosynthetic potentials of vanillin in which each node or edge is clickable when the computer mouse moves on a node the related chemical_structure is shown on the computer screen each edge represents a biosynthetic reaction converting the starting molecule to a target_molecule when an edge is clicked the biosynthetic reactions of this edge are displayed with its original references in another view option such as tree view after users input vanillin as a biosynthesis precursor eight possible chemicals in one reaction step is retrieved each tree node is clickable to explore its biosynthetic potentials according to researchers interest interactively in order to explore the biosynthetic potentials of precursor chemicals a novel web_based biosynther is developed using bkm react rhea and in house rxnfinder reactions biosynther applies an interactive interface for researchers to explore biosynthetic potentials step_by biosynther could be used as a useful tool in metabolic_engineering
