genetics_and espresso taking_into assessment errors on outcome and exposures in power analysis for association studies motivation very large studies are required to provide sufficiently big sample_sizes for adequately_powered association_analyses this can be an expensive undertaking and it is important that an accurate sample_size is identified for more realistic sample_size and power analysis the impact of unmeasured aetiological determinants and the quality of measurement of both outcome and explanatory_variables should be taken into account conventional methods to analyse power use closed form solutions that are not flexible enough to cater for all of these elements easily they often result in a potentially substantial overestimation of the actual power results in this article we describe the estimating sample_size and power in r by exploring simulated study outcomes tool that allows assessment errors in power calculation under various biomedical scenarios to be incorporated we also report a real_world analysis where we used this tool to answer an important strategic question for an existing cohort availability_and the software is available for online calculation and downloads ata critical question to answer when designing or extending large_scale studies and biobanks is what sample_size is required to achieve adequate_statistical i e the ability to detect the true determinants of the outcome for a large study aimed at exploring weak effects the answer can have major implications for funding and resources because the number of participants to be recruited sample_size depends critically on the desired_level of power the higher the desired power the larger the required sample_size among other things the answer also depends on the quality of the measurements of the variables of interest since assessment errors in both outcome and explanatory_variables can substantially reduce the power of association studies failure to take account of such assessment errors in power analyses at the design stage of a study may lead to a serious over estimation of its true statistical_power and result in a research platform that is critically underpowered when it comes to analysis most conventional approaches to estimating the sample_size required to achieve adequate_statistical fail to account rigorously for the sensitivity_and of the assessment of categorical outcome and explanatory_variables or the reliability of quantitative_variables furthermore proper incorporation of the impact of assessment error in multiple variables and of the analytic disturbance that may arise from variables that have not been measured at all generally demands non trivial extension of the methods being used and so is not attempted but given theit is important to understand how the mdes should be interpreted to illustrate the interpretation considerwhich provides an abstract of the power profile of cpt to investigate sbp as a quantitative outcome measured conventionally in a clinic setting the results for all the scenarios onare reported under section of the supplementary_material conventional peripheral blood_pressure is measured as the mean of three measurements the device chosen colin prodigy ii vital_signs monitor om is an automated device that uses the oscillometric method for assessing blood_pressure the population_distribution of the variable reported in sbp is mean mm_hg and sd in the body of the table the mdes for the environmental main effect for the moderately common exposure was reported as mm_hg this scenario invokes a binary environmental_exposure with a prevalence of the reported results therefore imply that if the final sample_size of cpt was participants if conventional clinic blood_pressure was measured using the standard operating protocol sop outlined in the first paragraph above and if scientific interest focused on the impact of a binary environmental_exposure which had realistic characteristics corresponding to those outlined in section the power calculations would indicate that there was an chance of detecting at p value a real effect of that environmental determinant corresponding to an increase or decrease in sbp of mm_hg on average similarly if interest were focused on a moderately common snp in a genome_wide gwas there would be an chance of detecting the effect of a snp with a minor_allele of at p value for genome_wide inference if that snp really increased or decreased sbp by at least mm_hg
