gene_expression rip the regulatory interaction predictor a machine_learning based_approach for predicting target_genes of transcription_factors motivation understanding transcriptional gene_regulation is essential for studying cellular_systems identifying genome_wide targets of transcription_factors tfs provides the basis to discover the involvement of tfs and tf cooperativeness in cellular_systems and pathogenesis results we present the regulatory interaction predictor rip a machine_learning approach that inferred regulatory_interactions ris for human tfs and target_genes with considerably good quality and ris with very high_quality the inference of ris is independent of any specific condition our approach employs support_vector svms trained on a set of experimentally proven ris from a public repository transfac features of ris for the learning_process are based on a correlation meta_analysis of gene_expression from studies in silico predictions of transcription_factor tfbss and combinations of these employing knowledge about co regulation of genes by a common tf tf module the trained svms were applied to infer new ris for a large set of tfs and genes in a case study we employed the inferred ris to analyze an independent microarray_dataset we identified key tfs regulating the transcriptional_response upon interferon_alpha stimulation of monocytes most prominently interferon stimulated gene factor isgf furthermore predicted tf modules were highly associated to their functionally_related pathways conclusion descriptors of gene_expression tfbs predictions experimentally_verified binding information and statistical combination of this enabled inferring ris on a genome_wide scale for human genes with considerably good precision serving as a good basis for expression_profiling studies contacthuman gene_regulation involves numerous mechanisms comprising proteinprotein_interaction dna_binding and transcription epigenetic dna_modifications rna_interference and translation to whom correspondence should be addressed central to this is the specific binding of transcription_factors tfs to promoters of genes to regulate their transcription and the discovery of such regulatory_interactions ris to reconstruct large_scale regulatory_networks is a main focus of systems_biology research so_far several hundreds of tfs have been identified for many species some tfs bind exclusively to distinct dna_sequence at specific conditions whereas others are ubiquitously active chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip assays have been used to infer tf_binding to the promoter of the investigated gene this was scaled up by chip on chip technology to obtain the location of specific tf_binding genome_wide however results from such investigations strongly depend on the studied cellular system and treatment besides this computational_methods were developed and applied to predict transcription_factor tfbss independent from the samples under study these predictions were mainly based on motif searches with position_weight pwms pwms are probabilistic representations of a frequency distribution of nucleotides at each position of a binding_site in contrast to chip on chip assays genome_wide pwm searches detect potential tfbss for any tf for which a pwm has been assembled from experimentally discovered binding_sites independent of conditional restrictions and thus provide information about tfbss in an unbiased manner predictions with pwms have been effectively applied to identify the relevant tfs and their sets of regulated_genes in gene_expression data however tfbs predictions are rather unspecific and therefore come along with high_false several methods have been developed to construct large_scale regulatory_networks using gene_expression data genome_wide chip profiles pwm scans and a combination of these the availability of abundant experimental_data for various model_organisms enabled to infer regulatory_networks for microorganisms explaining and predicting gene_expression e g for escherichia_coli saccharomyces_cerevisiae and the halobacterium nrc i furthermore methods were designed to infer significant ris between tfs and genes using pearsons_correlation and mutual_information of gene_expression e g the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular_networks aracne and the context likelihood of relatedness clr aracne and clr were jointly applied to identify target_genes for nrf nuclear factorpage
