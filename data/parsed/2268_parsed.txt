databases_and icps an integrative cancer profiler system founded upon the database of public signatures icps is a web_based application to obtain biomarker profiles among common cancers by integrating genomic_alterations with transcription signatures on the basis of a previously_developed integrative pipeline icps supports both public data and users in house data and performs meta_analysis at a cancer subtype level by combining heterogeneous datasets finally icps returns the robust gene_signature containing potential cancer biomarkers that may be useful to carcinogenesis study and clinical cancer diagnosis availability dna_microarrays and serial_analysis sage have been applied widely to the measurements of gene_expression in tumor_tissues versus corresponding normal_tissues over the last several years a large amount of resources of global quantitative gene_expression in cancer are now publicly_available such as gene_expression geo http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo stanford microarray database smd http genome www stanford edu and cancer genome anatomy project cgap http cgap nci nih gov however any single high_throughput technology experiment is merely able to capture a snapshot of gene_expression in a specific tumor sample furthermore each high_throughput technique has its own limitations for example the results of microarray are hardly reproducible and the sage and est library techniques are subject to the sizes and reliabilities of the libraries therefore it is essential and still challenging to develop computational integration analysis tools that can discover the robust gene_signature rgs by combining all pieces into a most complete picture of cancer tissues it has been discovered that many genome alterations such as loss_of loh and chromosomal gains_and affect mrna_expressions icps to whom correspondence should be addressed applies a previously_developed integrative pipeline to combine genomic_variations with gene_expressions aiming to discover the rgs in different types or subtypes of cancer our integrative_method had been applied to identify rgs genes in squamous_cell scc as a result rgs genes were obtained and validated by performing lab experiments with reverse_transcription rtpcr method as well as reviewing previous publications icps generates two types of human_genome based visualization i e a heatmap view and an integrative map the global profiling provides great convenience for comparing the elements of genomic_alterations with expression signatures the mean copy_number of all selected acgh datasets is displayed as a virtual sample named summarycgh in order to assist users to obtain the summary_statistics of copy_number and compare it with the expression_profiles the visualization can be constructed in pdf format and used as a database which is convenient for searching genes of interest exemplifies the maps at chromosome in scc in which dna amplifications and up regulations of gene_expression at q red and deletions and down regulations blue are indicated as we know oncomine https www oncomine org is a powerful web_based program processing cancer specific data however it performs normalization and presents the processed data for further integration without any easy means of downloading either raw or processed data in contrast icps starts from the log_ratio value which reflects the gene_expression variations in cancer tissues versus normal_tissues this strategy avoids cross_platform of the signal_intensity which is a proverbial difficulty and may easily induce biases although it is not able to fully eliminate the batch_effects of such normalization on the other hand icps will no longer need login information to access the site one of the most powerful features of icps is its capacity to cover not only transcriptome profiles but also genomic_alterations next generation datasets such as rnaseq will be included in future versions of icps in our opinion a global integration of such datasets at various levels willbe required to expand our understanding of oncology icps provides a useful approach for this integration
