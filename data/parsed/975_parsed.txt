chronos a time varying method for microrna mediated subpathway enrichment_analysis motivation in the era of network medicine and the rapid_growth of paired time series mrna microrna expression experiments there is an urgent need for pathway_enrichment methods able to capture the time and condition specific active parts of the biological circuitry as well as the microrna impact current methods ignore the multiple dynamical themesin the form of enriched biologically_relevant microrna mediated subpathwaysthat determine the functionality of signaling_networks across time results to address these challenges we developed time varying enrichment integromics subpathway analysis tool chronos by integrating time series mrna microrna expression data with kegg_pathway maps and microrna target interactions specifically microrna mediated subpathway topologies are extracted and evaluated based on the temporal transition and the fold_change activity of the linked_genes micrornas further we provide measures that capture the structural and functional features of subpathways in relation to the complete organism pathway atlas our application to synthetic and real_data shows that chronos outperforms current subpathway based_methods into unraveling the inherent dynamic_properties of pathways availability_and chronos is freely_available atin the last decade pathway based_approaches have become the first choice in complex disease analysis for gaining more delicate biological_insights and have enabled the comprehension of the higherorder functions of the biological_systems in parallel the increasing number of time course experiments has opened new avenues for pathway analysis to unravel the dynamic_features of the interdependencies among a cells molecular_components leading to deeper characterization of the functional molecular and causal_relationships among apparently distinct phenotypes toward this direction few approaches have considered the dynamic aspects of pathways and to our knowledge no method has been developed to deal with their context dependent and systematic temporal variations the first generation of pathway based_approaches related expression data to pathways by examining the entire pathway and wellestablished methods in this category are gsea and spia the next generation shifted the focus toward subpathways local areas of the entire biological_pathway which represent the underlying biological_phenomena more accurately and have emerged as even more targeted and contextspecific molecular candidate communities for the treatment of complex_diseases a representative example is the subpathway gm method which identifies key_metabolic subpathways based on information from genes and metabolites by searching for similarities of signature nodes within the pathway structure another relevant method is the topology enrichment_analysis framework teak which extracts linear_and subpathways and scores them using the bayes net toolbox to fit a context specific gaussian bayesian_network for each subpathway however these approaches do not take the temporal aspects of pathways into consideration and ignore possible perturbations on intermediate time points moving_forward timeclip combines dimension_reduction techniques and graph decomposition theory to explore and identify the portion of pathways that is mostly time dependent although the temporal_variation of the pathway is explored so as to identify the most time dependent subpathway information about the regulation between nodes is not included and the exact time period a subpathway is active is not provided in parallel nowadays genome_wide expression studies of the endogenous non coding small_rnas micrornas have given a strong impulse to the comprehension of cell regulatory_mechanisms recent_studies have examined the microrna mirna regulation upon pathways by showing that the perturbations on pathways does not necessarily occur at the overall level but more likely at specific areas of the topology subpathways toward addressing these challenges we introduce the timevarying enrichment integromics subpathway analysis tool chronos which detects significantly_enriched mirna mediated subpathways per time point from paired mirna mrna time series expression_profiles our key assumption is that during the time course different subareas of the pathway topology are active and the transitions of subpathway activity at time t depend solely on time t we illustrate the enhanced_performance of chronos over other state of the art subpathwaybased methods based on synthetic time series expression data finally we evaluate our method on a publicly_available time series microarray_dataset which investigates the transcriptional changes of mirna and mrna_expression levels over time after activation of the janus_kinase signal_transducer jak_stat by interferon_gamma stimulation ifn g of melanoma_cells our results show how timeevolving subpathway analysis generates new robust and dynamically context rich biological_hypotheses that complement those generated by other classical bioinformatics_pipelines chronos is a computationally fast and efficient approach for scanning the complete pathway topology to track the time contextspecific biologically enriched subpathways along with their time context specific mirna regulators the method and the supporting r package are flexible by allowing the user to intervene and adapt all discrete phases to the needs of the study under investigation chronos can assist significantly in complex disease analysis by enabling the experimentalists to acquire a more realistic time varying dynamical view of the involved perturbed mechanisms
