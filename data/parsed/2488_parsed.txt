gene_expression insilicodb an r bioconductor_package for accessing human affymetrix expert curated datasets from geo the insilico database building on geo microarray_technology has become an integral part of biomedical_research and increasing amounts of datasets become available through public_repositories however re use of these datasets is severely hindered by unstructured missing or incorrect biological_samples information as well as the wide_variety of preprocessing methods in use the insilicodb r bioconductor_package is a command_line front end to the insilico db a web_based database currently containing expert curated human affymetrix expression_profiles compiled from geo repository series the use of this package builds on the bioconductor projects focus on reproducibility by enabling a clear workflow in which not only analysis but also the retrieval of verified data is supported the insilicodb r bioconductor_package provides an efficient means of performing large_scale genomic analysis on the large and growing amount of human affymetrix gene_expression using automated scripting the accompanying web_interface insilico db allows search and browsing of curated datasets that can then be automatically retrieved adding a means for reproducible data sourcing to the reproducible analysis platform r bioconductor
