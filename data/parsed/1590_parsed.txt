enviz a cytoscape app for integrated statistical_analysis and visualization of sample matched data with multiple data types enviz enrichment_analysis and visualization is a cytoscape app that performs joint enrichment_analysis of two types of sample matched datasets in the context of systematic annotations such datasets may be gene_expression or any other high_throughput data collected in the same set of samples the enrichment_analysis is done in the context of pathway_information gene_ontology or any custom annotation of the data the recent_emergence of novel high_throughput enables the quantification of different types of biological_features in a genome_wide scale e g mrna_expression levels mirna_expression levels and dna_copy in parallel with these technologies various methodologies have been developed to handle integrated analysis of functional_genomics data mainly by studying the transcriptional_programs and global organization of biological_processes still only a few tools support routine joint analysis of sample cohorts with multiple genomic measurement results even fewer tools provide the visualization strength of cytoscape in this context the enviz approach to integrated data analysis uses the power of enrichment statistics combined with genomic annotation databases to statistically assign relevant function_annotations to explored profiled elements it thus provides a better understating of the relationship between different molecular_entities in cells or organisms visualizing enviz results as cytoscape networks provide compact structured representation of enrichment results even though the development of enviz was motivated by available modern biological measurements joint analysis of two sample matched datasets and systematic annotations may be applied to other similarly structured
