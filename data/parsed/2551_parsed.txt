systems_biology intervention in gene_regulatory with maximal phenotype alteration motivation a basic issue for translational genomics is to model gene interaction via gene_regulatory grns and thereby provide an informatics environment to study the effects of intervention say via drugs and to derive effective intervention_strategies taking the view that the phenotype is characterized by the long_run behavior steady_state distribution of the network we desire interventions to optimally move the probability mass from undesirable to desirable states heretofore two external control approaches have been taken to shift the steady_state mass of a grn i use a user_defined cost_function for which desirable shift of the steady_state mass is a by product and ii use heuristics to design a greedy_algorithm neither approach provides an optimal_control policy relative to long_run behavior results we use a linear_programming approach to optimally shift the steady_state mass from undesirable to desirable states i e optimization is directly based on the amount of shift and therefore must out perform previously_proposed methods moreover the same basic linear_programming structure is used for both unconstrained and constrained optimization where in the latter case constraints on the optimization limit the amount of mass that may be shifted to ambiguous states these being states that are not directly undesirable relative to the pathology of interest but which bear some perceived_risk we apply the method to probabilistic boolean_networks but the theory applies to any markovian grn availability supplementary_materials including the simulation_results matlab_source and description of suboptimal methodsgenetic regulatory_networks grns refer to a class of models describing the multivariate functional_relationships among a cohort of genes or their products from a graphical perspective genes are nodes in this network and edges describe regulatory_relationships between genes these networks aim to model cellular control and how abnormal cell functions result from one or several breakdowns in the regulatory_mechanisms thus grns are an essential part of translational_medicine whose ultimate_goal is to develop therapies based on the disruption or mitigation of aberrant gene function contributing to the pathology of a disease therapies usually involve some procedure and several drug_candidates acting on various gene_products with the aim of mitigating undesirable gene_functions developing therapeutic methods in the context of grns involves designing intervention_strategies to alter the dynamics of the gene activity profiles gaps of the network in some desired manner thereby identifying potential_drug modeling grns via markovian dynamical networks has received much attention because they capture uncertainty intrinsic to the interactions among genes or gene_products at different levels furthermore one can use the rich theory of markov decision_processes mdps to formulate optimal intervention problems in the present article we choose probabilistic boolean_networks pbns as our reference model for grns the transition_probabilities of pbns are characterized by their associated markov_chains and pbns have played the major role in intervention studies assuming that the collection of all possible gaps constitutes the state_space we can partition it into desirable and undesirable cellular_states according to the expression values of a given set of genes an undesirable state can be associated with a phenotype representative of a cancerous state e g cell_growth in the absence of growth_factors is undesirable although there might exist some states in the desirable set that do not represent healthy conditions they can be classified as desirable because they are not associated with the particular pathology defining the undesirable set once a model for the underlying grn is assumed and desirable and undesirable sets are recognized the objective is to find an optimal_therapeutic control policy with respect to a predefined objective_function to drive the dynamics of the network from undesirable states to the desirable ones this problem has been extensively_studied within two basic intervention_approaches in the context of pbns external control and structural intervention external control is generally based on flipping or not flipping the value of a specific gene or possibly more than one called the control gene as the dynamic_behavior of a pbn can be represented by a finite_state markov_chain the first proposed intervention approach was to determine an optimal single gene perturbation to the network based on mean first passage times in markov_chains attention later to whom correspondence should be addressed turned to dynamic_programming based finite horizon and infinite horizon external control in which the steady_state distribution ssd is altered these works were followed by several articles developing approaches to external intervention that take into account practical issues that arise from therapeutic constraints biological_complexity and computational limitations structural intervention on the other hand involves a one time change in the network regulatory structure wiring so that the long_run behavior of the network is altered in a desired manner given a collection of potential structural changes the problem is to find an optimal structural intervention resulting in a maximum alteration of the ssd toward the direction of desirable states and away from undesirable states in the main optimal infinite horizon intervention for grns has involved the specification of a cost_function based on the current state of the system and the desirability of potential transitions thus the long_run effect of the optimal policy on the network_dynamics becomes a by product of this cost functionbased optimization_problem as phenotype is associated with steady_state behavior as in the case of attractor cycles in bns and pbns from a practical perspective it would be better to determine optimality directly in terms of long_run behavior direct optimization has been addressed to some extent in where the authors propose three classes of greedy stationary intervention policies that bypass the need for a user_defined cost_function and directly use long_run behavior as the optimization criterion to reduce the mass of the ssd corresponding to undesirable states and increase the mass corresponding to desirable states in this article we rigorously formulate this intervention problem and provide an optimal intervention policy with a computational_complexity equivalent to solving a linear_program lp optimization_problem in section for a general cost_function and in section for maximal phenotype alteration we also consider a variant of this optimization_problem where one might constrain the steady_state probability mass of some ambiguous states in the network while finding the optimal intervention policy this is especially important in therapeutic methods because it is prudent to avoid introducing new probability mass to states associated with unknown phenotypes we demonstrate the performance of optimal policies using synthetically generated networks and two real_networks derived from the metastatic_melanoma and mammalian cell_cycle
