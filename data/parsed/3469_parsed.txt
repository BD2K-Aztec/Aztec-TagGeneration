paxtoolsr pathway analysis in r using pathway_commons purpose paxtoolsr package enables access to pathway data represented in the biopax format and made available through the pathway_commons webservice for users of the r language to aid in advanced pathway analyses features include the extraction merging and validation of pathway data represented in the biopax format this package also provides novel pathway datasets and advanced querying features for r users through the pathway_commons webservice allowing users to query extract and retrieve data and integrate these data with local biopax datasets availability_and the paxtoolsr package is compatible with versions of r and higher on windows mac os x and linux using bioconductor and is available through the bioconductor r package repository along with source_code and a tutorial vignette describing common tasks such as data visualization and gene_set source_code are at http www bioconductor org_packages paxtoolsr this plugin is free open_source and licensed under the lgpl the amount of biological_pathway data in machine_readable databases and formats continues to increase pathway analysis allows researchers to gain new understanding of the functions of biological_systems a common task has been to aggregate pathway data across databases this task has been simplified through the creation of standardized data representations such as the biological_pathway exchange biopax format pathway_commons is an ongoing effort to aggregate pathway data over a number of databases supporting the biopax notation and webservices to access these data the core component that facilitates the development of projects using data in the biopax format such as pathway_commons has been paxtools a biopax application_programming api written in java although the r programming_language is widely used in areas of computational_biology there is a deficiency in the availability of pathway data provided through r packages a recent review by describes r packages for working with pathway data the majority of these packagesincluding kegggraph pathview and reactomepautilizes and provides data from kegg and reactome a number of the packages are generic parsers for a variety of formats including the systems_biology sbml kegg markup_language kgml and biopax through the paxtoolsr package we extend the literature curated pathway data available to r users we provide a number of paxtools api functions and provide an interface to the pathway_commons webservice through this interface paxtoolsr provides native support for the aggregated pathway_commons database including data imported from the nci pathway interaction_database pid pantherdb humancyc reactome phoshositeplus and hprd the paxtoolsr package extends the available biological_pathway data available to researchers working primarily in an r environment this package makes many of the features available from the biopax paxtools api and the pathway_commons webservice the data and functionality provided here can be used for a wide_range of biological_pathway analysis studies and can be easily integrated with the rich ecosystem of existing r packages future development of this r package is expected as additions are made to the underlying paxtools java_library and pathway_commons webservice furthermore we invite developers of network_analysis r packages interested in the pathway_commons data to work with us to help make the data we provide available to their methodologies pathway_commons graph query of interactions between akt and mtor using paxtoolsr and visualized using igraph data for the figure were retrieved with the command graphpc sourcec akt irs mtor igf r kind pathsbetween format binary sif paxtoolsr
