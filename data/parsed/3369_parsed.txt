optimal structural inference of signaling_pathways from unordered and overlapping gene_sets motivation a plethora of bioinformatics_analysis has led to the discovery of numerous gene_sets which can be interpreted as discrete measurements emitted from latent signaling_pathways their potential to infer signaling_pathway structures however has not been sufficiently exploited existing_methods accommodating discrete data do not explicitly consider signal cascading mechanisms that characterize a signaling_pathway novel computational_methods are thus needed to fully utilize gene_sets and broaden the scope from focusing only on pairwise interactions to the more general cascading events in the inference of signaling_pathway structures results we propose a gene_set based simulated_annealing sa algorithm for the reconstruction of signaling_pathway structures a signaling_pathway structure is a directed graph containing up to a few hundred nodes and many overlapping signal cascades where each cascade represents a chain of molecular_interactions from the cell_surface to the nucleus gene_sets in our context refer to discrete sets of genes participating in signal cascades the basic building_blocks of a signaling_pathway with no prior information about gene orderings in the cascades from a compendium of gene_sets related to a pathway sa aims to search for signal cascades that characterize the optimal signaling_pathway structure in the search_process the extent of overlap among signal cascades is used to measure the optimality of a structure throughout we treat gene_sets as random_samples from a first order_markov model we evaluated the performance of sa in three case studies in the first study conducted on kegg_pathways sa demonstrated a significantly better performance than bayesian_network methods since both sa and bayesian_network methods accommodate discrete data use a search and score network learning_strategy and output a directed network they can be compared in terms of performance and computational time in the second study we compared sa and bayesian_network methods using four benchmark_datasets from dream in our final study we showcased two context specific signaling_pathways activated in breast_cancer the main goal of computational_systems is to reveal and explain general organizing principles of living_systems in particular the structural inference of signaling_pathways is important to better understand fundamental cell functions such as growth metabolism differentiation and apoptosis which are driven by simultaneous action of several cascades of reactions from the cell_surface to the nucleus since signaling_cascades represent the basic building_blocks of signaling_pathways it is necessary to extract useful insights about them from various molecular_profiling data in recent_years gene_set compendiums and tools for their analysis have become increasingly available due to rapid advancements in highthroughput data_acquisition methods e g however challenges remain in exploring signal cascading mechanisms from such data which can be interpreted as discrete measurements emitted from latent signaling_pathway structures many algorithms for biological network_inference accommodate discrete inputs e g altay and emmert streib a discretization has especially proved useful in the structural inference of signaling_pathways which are directed networks containing up to a few hundred nodes and several overlapping signal cascades where each cascade represents a directed or ordered chain of molecular_interactions for example existing non metabolic_pathway structures in the kegg_database contain up to nodes significant efforts in the inference of signaling_pathway structures include boolean or probabilistic boolean_networks e g and bayesian_networks e g which directly benefit from reduced computational_complexity by utilizing discrete inputs even in the inference of large_scale undirected network_topologies using aracne c net clr mrnet and relevance networks or rns discrete measurements are employed to estimate mutual_information mi between gene_pairs therefore it is increasingly clear that discrete measurements hold promises for inferring biological_networks bayesian_network methods are commonly used in the inference of signaling_pathway structures however these methods primarily focus on statistical causal interactions thus the learned networks need not represent signal cascading mechanisms how to better use discrete measurements available in the form of unordered gene_sets which may be thought of as the observed overlapping and incompletepage in this article we presented a novel sa approach to learn the optimal signaling_pathway structures from gene_sets we hypothesized a true signaling_pathway structure as an ensemble of overlapping signal cascades we then translated its reconstruction from unordered gene_sets corresponding to signaling_cascades into a discrete optimization_problem throughout we treated gene_sets as random_variables and their orders as random we also introduced a novel energy
