databases_and the cell_behavior ontology describing the intrinsic biological_behaviors of real and model cells seen as active_agents motivation currently there are no ontologies capable of describing both the spatial_organization of groups of cells and the behaviors of those cells the lack of a formalized method for describing the spati ality and intrinsic biological_behaviors of cells makes_it to adequately describe cells tissues and organs as spatial objects in living_tissues in vitro assays and in computational_models of tissues results we have developed an owl ontology to describe the intrinsic physical and biological_characteristics of cells and tissues the cell_behavior ontology cbo provides a basis for describing the spatial and observable behaviors of cells and extracellular components suitable for describing in vivo in vitro and in silico multicell systems using the cbo a modeler can create a meta model of a simulation of a biological model and link that meta model to experiment or simulation_results annotation of a multicell model and its computational representation using the cbo makes the statement of the underlying biology explicit the formal representation of such biological abstraction facilitates the validation falsification discovery sharing and reuse of both models and experimental_data availability_and the cbo developed using prot eg e is available atalthough all biological_research requires the use of abstract models currently no standard method exists for describing the biological content of microscope images of tissues in vitro experiments or in silico simulations of the tissue dynamics of multicellular systems in the in silico modeling domain each modeling tool e g compucell d chaste and openalea uses its own model description language we include a glossary of terms with hyperlinks in the supplementary_material these model description languages focus on representing the computational implementations simulations of mathematical multicell models and depend on the specific computational methodologies the modeling tools use to implement objects and their dynamic_processes as a result these languages do not adequately document the biology that the computational_model seeks to describe i e you cannot recreate the biological model from the simulation code publications of computational_models usually include a prose description of the biological model in the body of the paper with tables listing key biological_components and processes shows such a table from a publication describing a computational_model of vascular_growth during tumorigenesis this ad_hoc approach to biological model description and distribution has several drawbacks first the entity names cells molecules and process names oxygen_consumption cell_proliferation are not standardized which impedes retrieval of the model in a search and perhaps the understanding and correct reuse of model components once found not portable consistent retrievable or reusable for example the use of the word proliferate to describe cell_growth and division inmeans that searches using mitosis as a query would not locate the model or the publication not retrievable in addition some journals reproduce tables in papers as images preventing a search_engine from indexing the words within the table second the human_readable description of the model in the publication resides separately from its computational instantiation rather than within the executable code that the authors ran to generate their results not retrievable frequently labels in the executable code such as cell_type names are inconsistent with those in the text of the publication not consistent physical separation and inconsistencies both obscure the relationship between the underlying biological model that the authors intended to represent and the computational_methods they used to instantiate the model this article_presents ontological techniques to reduce these difficulties in the description of multicellular experiments and biological_models these tools allow developers of biological_models to directly embed or link to a semantic description of the biologic model based on a new multicell specific ontology when used in conjunction with existing reference naming authority ontologies such as the gene_ontology go chebi foundational model of anatomy fma developers can create fully specified biological_models which will greatly enhance others ability to locate understand validate and redeploy these biological_models to whom correspondence should be addressed this initial release of the cbo provides a framework for describing the objects processes and object to processes links typical of multicell experiments models and simulations auxiliary vtk files provide a convenient standard description of the spatiotemporal aspects of the biological model in future work we will extend the cbo to serve as the basis for a model description language that can describe both the modeled biology and the computational_methods a particular computational implementation uses to model that biology this model description language may be a markup_language based on the cbo similar to the sbo and sbml pair or we may use the cbo in owl in conjunction with appropriate ontologies such as the opb as both the ontological basis language and the executable markup_language we hope that the cbo will lead to the creation of repositories of multicell spatiotemporal models similar to or extending the biomodels repository the creation of such repositories of shareable models will facilitate the creation of new validated computational multicell models in addition annotating a models source_code using the cbo and other bio ontologies and storing it as plain text_files in a publicly_accessible directory on the world_wide would allow the file to be located using standard web search_engines reducing the need for a central model repository
