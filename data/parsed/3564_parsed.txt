piecewise parameter_estimation for stochastic models in copasi motivation computational_modeling is widely used for deepening the understanding of biological_processes parameterizing models to experimental_data needs computationally_efficient techniques for parameter_estimation challenges for parameter_estimation include in general the high dimen sionality of the parameter_space with local_minima and in specific for stochastic modeling the intrinsic stochasticity results we implemented the recently suggested multiple shooting for stochastic systems mss objective_function for parameter_estimation in stochastic models into copasi this mss objective_function can be used for parameter_estimation in stochastic models but also shows beneficial_properties when used for ordinary_differential models the method can be applied with all of copasis optimization algorithms and can be used for sbml models as well availability_and the methodology is available in copasi as of version and can be downloaded fromexperimental data from time series experiments has been widely modeled with ordinary_differential ode due to progress in experimental_techniques e g the possibility to measure small numbers of molecules in single cells raj and van the importance of stochastic modeling is increasing both types of models i e ode and stochastic need to be parameterized to experimental_data this parameter_estimation can be challenging due to local_minima in the parameter search_space in case of stochastic modeling the treatment of the intrinsic stochasticity poses an additional challenge we recently_developed an objective_function multiple shooting for stochastic systemsmss for parameter_estimation that treats the intervals between measurements separately and uses a state updating mechanism for calculating initial_values for the intervals in contrast to a least_squares functional where the states are solely determined by the initial value and the ode system this objective_function allows a more flexible state_estimation this objective_function has shown to be successfully applicable to the estimation of kinetic_parameters in intrinsic stochastic models furthermore the flexibility in the state_estimation also shows beneficial_properties when dealing with ode systems we implemented the mss objective_function for parameter_estimation in copasi it splits the time horizon into intervals between the measurement points and uses state updating mechanism to create initial_values for the intervals this allows more flexible treatment of states as conventional least_squares functional where states only depend on the initial value and the parameterized system this allows us to successfully treat models containing intrinsic stochasticity in addition our functional can be applied to parameter_estimation in ode systems it leads to a reduction of local_minima in parameter_space local_minima are a highly discussed topic but only few methods focus on the influence of the choice of the objective_function such asfor a more detailed discussion our implementation in copasi allows for combining this powerful objective_function with all the feature of copasi such as a variety of optimization algorithms a sbml import export and a graphical_user thus by integrating the newly_developed into a widely used and user_friendly software_package it is made accessible for a wider community for evaluation and practical_application left copasi and a plot of a time series with discrete events describing the measured data middle right plot of the logarithm of the objective_function landscape for a lotka volterra model darker color stands for lower objective_function value middle side shows landscape for the conventional least_squares right side for the new mss functional optimization is easier as there are no local_minima
