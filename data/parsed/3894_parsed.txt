systems_biology rbionet a cobra toolbox extension for reconstructing high_quality biochemical_networks motivation genome_scale are widely used in systems_biology however to date no freely_available tool exists that ensures quality_control during the reconstruction_process results here we present a cobra toolbox extension rbionet enabling the construction of publication level biochemical_networks while enforcing necessary quality_control measures rbionet has an intuitive_user facilitating the reconstruction_process for novices and experts availability the rbionet is freely_available from http opencobra sourceforge net genome_scale reconstructions play_an in molecular systems_biology as they provide a structured format for genomic genetic and biochemical information available for a target_organism a reconstruction often has detailed gene information literature references and reaction metabolite information associated in addition to an organism specific reaction list the reconstruction_process is well established for metabolic_networks and has been applied to organisms on a genome_scale while this approach is widely used no comprehensive easy to use and free of charge software_package exists that ensures quality of the mostly manually_curated reconstruction content existing_tools for metabolic reconstructions include metannogen and memosys however many researchers still use spreadsheets for the reconstruction_process to assemble and monitor the reconstruction content which have the disadvantage of missing quality_control modules a quality check as you go would make the reconstruction effort more efficient and traceable here we present a freely_available software_package that implements important quality_control and assurance measures qc qa which are crucial for the construction of high_quality genome_scale biochemical_networks rbionet is embedded in the matlab programming environment relying on many qc qa measures already present in the cobra toolbox biochemical reconstructions assembled with rbionet can be to whom correspondence should be addressed readily converted into mathematical_models and they can then be interrogated using constraint based_methods rbionet is freely_available permitting the reconstruction of high_quality genome_scale biochemical_networks consistent with established standard_procedures in particular it ensures qc qa measures required for publicationlevel reconstructions rbionet is embeded within the cobra toolbox enabling iterative_approach of reconstruction validation and debugging in particular we put emphasis on an intuitive_interface that allows novices to matlab to perform high_quality metabolic reconstructions the database allows customized inclusion of metabolites and reactions in the corresponding databases but thanks to its import function online_databases e g kegg ligand database may be incorporated into metdb and rxndb a current shortcoming of rbionet includes missing database binding for the metabolite reaction and reconstruction creator nevertheless the current setup enables simultaneous use and modification by multiple users future extensions may include the availability of a globally available and accessible database for metabolites and reactions which could be directly used by any rbionet user and thus would permit ultimatively compability between biochemical_models the creation of such database would require significant work and would need to be coordinated with the existing biochemical databases and efforts
