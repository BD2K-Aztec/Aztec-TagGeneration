gene_expression robust identification of transcriptional_regulatory using a gibbs_sampler on outlier sum statistic motivation identification of transcriptional_regulatory trns is of significant importance in computational_biology for cancer research providing a critical building_block to unravel disease pathways however existing_methods for trn identification suffer from the inclusion of excessive noise in microarray_data and false_positives in binding data especially when applied to human tumor derived cell_line studies more robust_methods that can counteract the imperfection of data_sources are therefore needed for reliable identification of trns in this context results in this article we propose to establish a link between the quality of one target_gene to represent its regulator and the uncertainty of its expression to represent other target_genes specifically an outlier sum statistic was used to measure the aggregated evidence for regulation events between target_genes and their corresponding transcription_factors a gibbs_sampling method was then developed to estimate the marginal distribution of the outlier sum statistic hence to uncover underlying regulatory_relationships to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method we compared its performance with that of an existing sampling based method using both simulation_data and yeast_cell data the experimental_results show that our method consistently outperforms the competing method in different settings of signal_to and network_topology indicating its robustness for biological_applications finally we applied our method to breast_cancer cell_line data and demonstrated its ability to extract biologically_meaningful regulatory_modules related to estrogen_signaling and action in breast_cancer availability_and the gibbs_sampler matlab_package is freely_available atidentification of transcriptional_regulatory trns is essential to understanding the functional_roles of molecules and the to whom correspondence should be addressed mechanisms of complicated biological_processes in cancer research those identified regulatory_networks also referred to as regulatory_modules can give insight into important biological_pathways that drive the development of disease based on which novel drugs or therapies may be developed in addition to high_throughput microarray techniques that profile the entire transcriptome of cells more specific information about regulation can be obtained from proteindna_interaction data derived from dna_motif sequence analyses or chip on chip experiments binding_motif is also called transcription_factor a segment of dna regulatory_sequence to which a specific regulatory protein binds preferentially chip on chip experiments can provide whole genome_analysis of binding_site locations of all regulatory_proteins both binding_motif data and chip on chip data provide an initial structure of the unknown network_topology the availability of the above techniques has promoted extensive researches on regulatory_networks in the last decade and some of which are quite successful in applications such as yeast studies early exploration in gene_modules depends heavily on statistical_methods such as principle_component and independent_component these statistical_methods have strong assumptions that the components are mutually orthogonal or statistically independent which can hardly be satisfied in real biological_systems other statistical_approaches include dynamic_bayesian probabilistic boolean_networks and similarity based_methods in particular has performed a comparative_analysis using different measures and scoring_schemes investigating their ability in reconstructing gene_regulatory many of the earlier mentioned methods either utilize information from gene_expression data alone i e do not utilize prior network knowledge from proteindna binding data or are infeasible for learning large network_structures on the recent integrated use of gene_expression data and binding data such as chip on chip data proposed a computational_method called network_component nca which is based on a log linear_model of the relationship between mrna_abundance and transcription_factor activity subjected to some mild identifiability conditions referred to as nca criteria the nca method can be used to effectively estimate hidden transcription_factor activities later developed a fast version of the nca method with a closed form solution by using matrix_factorization techniques identification of transcriptional regulatory_modules plays_a in understanding the mechanism of cancer_progression however intrinsic defects of microarray_data and chip on chip binding_motif that caused by noise and the discrepancy between gene profiles and prior binding knowledge make it challenging to correctly recover hidden regulation patterns the cn based sampling method proposed byis endeavored to filter out the background genes with no regulation patterns but are falsely introduced by binding data the cn is defined as the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue which may be affected by noise because the smallest eigenvalue typically represents the noise power while the larger eigenvalues represent the signal hence as snr decreases the algorithm suffers from increasingly_large performance degradation on the other hand the cn of a gene profile matrix measures the linear independency of gene_expression levels regardless of which specific genes having linear dependency thus the evaluation of the seed gene for a given tf may be impaired by highly_correlated seeds for other tfs for more robust identification of gene regulatory_modules including both target_genes and transcription_factors we propose a gibbs_sampler based on os of regression t statistic the robustness of the new statistic against experimental_noise in microarray_data is inherited from that the regression t statistic maintains a reasonable statistic power when the data are relatively noisy in real biological_applications such as breast_cancer cell_line study we are fully aware of the fact that a considerable number of genes may be co expressed through some unknown mechanism while only a small portion of them should be the true drivers of cancer_progression under certain condition by using a significance_test on os we are able to identify the tfs that have the maximum consistency between its binding knowledge and the target_genes expression pattern we generate different null distributions associated with different target gene_pool sizes to prevent the algorithm from being biased to tfs with more candidate_genes however we are also aware of one limitation of gibbsos for its relying on a hard threshold to screen binding data for an initial pool of target_genes therefore the proposed gibbs_sampling framework is only aimed to address the problem of false_positive connections not the one of false_negative connections we proposed a gibbs_sampler to identify condition specific transcriptional regulatory_modules based on the os of regression t statistic by utilizing a gibbs strategy we are able to estimate the marginal distribution of the os statistic for each transcription_factor and evaluate the significance of the corresponding regulatory module our proposed method is aimed to extract the true target_genes through the integration of both microarray_gene and chip on chip binding_motif data the simulation_experiments demonstrated the robustness of the method against noise and network_structures while we further validated its efficacy on yeast_cell data moreover we showed that our method could successfully_identify important regulatory_modules related to estrogen_signaling and action in breast_cancer
