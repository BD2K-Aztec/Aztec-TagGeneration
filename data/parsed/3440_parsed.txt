passion a pattern growth algorithm based pipeline for splice_junction detection in paired_end rna_seq motivation rna_seq is a powerful technology for the study of transcriptome profiles that uses deep sequencing_technologies moreover it may be used for cellular phenotyping and help establishing the etiology of diseases characterized by abnormal splicing patterns in rna_seq the exact nature of splicing_events is buried in the reads that span exonexon boundaries the accurate and efficient mapping of these reads to the reference_genome is a major_challenge results we developed passion a pattern growth algorithm based pipeline for splice_site detection in paired_end rna_seq comparing the performance of passion to three existing rna_seq analysis_pipelines tophat mapsplice and hmmsplicer revealed that passion is competitive with these packages moreover the performance of passion is not affected by read_length and coverage it performs better than the other three approaches when detecting junctions in highly abundant transcripts passion has the ability to detect junctions that do not have known splicing motifs which cannot be found by the other tools of the two public rna_seq passion predicted and splicing_events of which on average are known junctions annotated in the ensembl transcript database and are novel in addition our package can discover differential and shared splicing patterns among multiple samples availability the code and utilities can be freely downloaded from https trac nbic nl passion and ftp ftp sanger ac uk pub zn passion contactglobal transcriptome analyses provide_important in the qualitative_and aspects of gene_expression a few years_ago transcriptome composition was mainly measured using microarrays with the development of next_generation a massively_parallel transcriptome sequencing_technology called to whom correspondence should be addressed rna_seq has been developed and widely_applied in transcriptome_profiling compared with microarrays rna_seq measures the transcriptome without prior_knowledge of genome_sequence and enables the detection of previously_unknown transcripts moreover rna_seq is more sensitive toward changes in low abundant transcripts and has a much broader dynamic range t one of the opportunities offered by rna_seq is the detection of novel splice_isoforms splicing is a process in which introns are excised and the flanking exons are joined to form the mature mrna in eukaryotes almost all multi exonic genes undergo alternative_splicing recent_studies have revealed that variations in splicing patterns are associated with alzheimers and other complex_diseases detection of splicing patterns will therefore not only contribute to the characterization of transcript structures but also help to understand cellular and disease_phenotypes discovery of splice_junctions using rna_seq is mainly achieved by aligning the reads that span exonexon junctions to the reference_genome current fast aligners such as bowtie and bwa can efficiently map reads to the exon region but are less efficient in the mapping of reads across splice_junctions recently many dedicated tools for detection of splice_junctions have been developed alexa seq uses an exonexon junction database of all possible pairwise connections of the known exons from ensembl to assess the expression differential_expression and alternative expression of known and predicted transcript_isoforms the obvious limitation is that alexa seq can only detect junctions between known exons but is not able to detect alternative transcripts including yet unknown exons other algorithms do not rely on existing transcript annotations tophat is one of the pioneers in this field it first builds exon islands and connects the potential exons using the known splicing motifs gtag gcag atac and finally realigns previously unmapped reads to the joined parts mapsplice first splits reads into smaller segments and then aligns these to the reference_genome individually a potential junction is detected if a missing segment can be reconstructed by the extension of neighboring exonic segments all the potential junctions are finally evaluated by a score based on anchor significance and entropy hmmsplicer first splits the reads into two fragments and aligns them separately to the reference_genome once a fragment is aligned a hidden_markov hmm is used to detect the most probable splice position and finally all junctions are scored filtered and divided_into canonical and non canonical junction sets however these methods have limitations tophat cannot detect junctions with novel splicing motifs since it requires the guidance of known splice_sites to join exons both mapsplice and hmmsplicer divide reads into small segments and therefore potentially work better for long_reads than for short_reads both studies showed that they perform well on lowly_expressed genes but are less accurate on highly abundance transcripts moreover while mapsplice and hmmsplicer are designed to handle both single_end and paired_end neither of them exploit the paired information in their algorithms here we introduce passion a pattern growth based splice_site detection pipeline developed only for the analysis of paired_end rna_seq passion uses the mapped read in a pair as anchor and then uses a high_resolution algorithm pattern growth to remap the proximal and distal fragments of the unmapped read to a local region of the reference indicated by the mate it is capable of identifying both known and novel canonical and non canonical junctions with snp or sequencing_error tolerance we have presented passion a package that is capable of capturing both annotated and novel splice_junctions with high_accuracy instead of using the popular data_structures applied in nextgeneration_sequencing analysis e g suffixarray and hash_table the key_component of passion is based on pattern growth which has not been applied in rna_seq analysis before in addition passion currently can facilitate the discovery of differential and shared splicing patterns from multiple samples one unique advantage distinguishing passion from tophat mapsplice and hmmsplicer is that passion can detect the splice_junctions with unknown motifs which are missed by the other tools in passion splicing motifs are not used in the main_stages of junction detection which are building exon islands high_resolution remapping and filtering only in the last step of the pipeline canonical and non canonical motifs are applied to finalize the breakpoint within the microhomology range for those without motifs they also will be reported with the leftmost breakpoint as the final location another advantage is that passion is very accurate for highly abundant transcripts it is shown that in sample s a small_fragment of genes are highly_expressed with read_coverage supplementary in the case of pooling rna_seq more transcripts will be highly covered currently many algorithms can accurately analyze low_abundance transcripts but are less efficient for detecting junctions in highly_expressed however passion has a high true_positive for both low and high_abundance transcripts first the application of a local search_strategy helped to rule out potential false locations secondly we used pattern growth a high_resolution algorithm which can be accurate to a single nucleotide level together with the aid of splice_site motifs passion is able to predict precise breakpoints of exonexon junctions without any nucleotide shift the third and most important factor is the read depth_dependent cutoff filtering by default passion reports junctions where the depth of supportive reads is of the average coverage of the more highly_expressed flanking exon it seems quite simple but effective this filtering scheme is similar to the minimum minor isoform frequency parameter in tophat in which junctions are reported if the abundance of the supportive reads is at least of the depth of more deeply covered exons mapsplice and hmmsplicer use very complicated scores to remove the spurious junctions but are less effective for highly abundant transcripts as for the memory_usage passion consumes gb_memory for m pairs of bp long_reads with the default_settings the memory_usage can be improved by setting a smaller bin size parameter since reads are processed per bin theoretically reducing the bin size will increase the frequency of file reading and writing but it will not significantly increase the cpu processing time currently passion is the third fastest method according to the cpu processing time the wall time can be decreased by setting up to eight parallel threads at initial mapping and high_resolution remapping which are the most time consuming steps moreover with computer resources becoming cheaper and cheaper and more computer clouds and clusters becoming available memory and cpu running time will not be the bottleneck for computing accuracy should be the more important concern in data analysis nevertheless we still missed some rare splicings mediating cross chromosome gene_fusion because we assume that both reads in a pair are mapped to the same chromosome it will be one of the tasks to tackle in the near future besides we are also interested in detecting allele_specific and rna_editing events quantification of these post_transcriptional will contribute to study imprinting regulation of differential_expression and differential stability of genes or transcripts eventually such detailed analysis will increase our understanding of cell and disease_phenotypes currently more and more labs prefer to sequence rna using the paired_end protocol due to the obvious advantages provided by paired_end over single_end passions ability to take advantage of paired_end together with its overall high performance will make passion a valuable_tool for rna_seq in the future
