genome_analysis fpsac fast phylogenetic scaffolding of ancient contigs motivations recent_progress in ancient_dna sequencing_technologies and protocols has lead to the sequencing of whole ancient bacterial_genomes as illustrated by the recent sequence of the yersinia_pestis strain that caused the black death pandemic however sequencing ancient genomes raises specific problems because of the decay and fragmentation of ancient_dna among others making the scaffolding of ancient contigs challenging results we show that computational paleogenomics methods aimed at reconstructing the organization of ancestral_genomes from the comparison of extant genomes can be adapted to correct order and orient ancient bacterial contigs we describe the method fpsac fast phylo genetic scaffolding of ancient contigs and apply it on a set of ancient contigs assembled from the recently sequenced black death agent genome we obtain a unique scaffold for the whole chromosome of this ancient genome that allows to gain precise insights into the structural_evolution of the yersinia clade availability_and code data and results are available atpalaeomicrobiology aims at analyzing ancient microorganisms especially pathogens obtained from the remains of infected hosts aside of an historical interest in characterizing precisely past infectious_diseases understanding the evolution of pathogens and their relation with their hosts is of primary interest for modern microbiology initially based on polymerase_chain techniques ancient_dna adna sequencing benefited from advances in sequencing_technologies and the development of new protocols that lead to breakthroughs such as the sequencing of whole molecules from the yersinia_pestis strain that caused the black death pandemic including a plasmid and the main chromosome extracted million short single reads average length of nt from the dental_pulp of an individual infected by the black death pathogen using the genome of an extant y pestis strain co as a bait they were assembled using velvet into contigs including contigs of length nt from the main chromosome of the black death agent this first sequencing of the chromosome of an extinct prokaryote helped to clarify the causes of the black death pandemic however the larger contigs cover only of the expected length of the ancestral chromosome and their organization along this ancestral chromosome is still unknown keeping out of reach a detailed genome_scale study of the evolution of the structural_organization of yersinia genomes whose impact on pathogenicity is still an open question current scaffolding methodologies can hardly be applied to fully assemble and finish an ancient bacterial_genome from a dataset such as the one described by aside of short molecules like plasmids these methods aimed at ordering and orienting the contigs and estimating the lengths of inter contig gaps rely on data such as mate_pair with mixed insert_sizes genome maps or comparison with one or several closely_related genomes owing to the decay and fragmentation of adna molecules whose length depends on many factors but that can be as short as nt reads from ancient genomes are expected to be short and genome maps or mate_pair with long inserts are not available this leaves the comparative_approach as the only possibility the usual setting of the comparative_approach involves the comparison of the contigs with one or a few closely_related genomes sequences or maps for an ancestral_genome comparison with a single reference_genome either a descendant or an outgroup is likely to predict derived syntenic features as ancestral which is a problem for genomes such as the y pestis genomes that contains many repeats and are highly rearranged there exists only one scaffolding method that allows to compare with several related genomes while using a phylogenetic_tree but it is not designed to scaffold an ancient genome we address this specific to whom correspondence should be addressed problem here and describe a phylogenetic_approach to scaffold ancient bacterial contigs that adapts existing_methods initially designed to predict ancestral_genome features from the comparison of extant genomes the design of predictive methods to reconstruct ancestral genomic_features is a relatively ancient field of computational genomics dating back to methods such as fitchs algorithm for reconstructing ancestral genomic_sequences advances in computational paleogenomics include improved methods for reconstructing ancestral genome_sequence gene content and gene_order the latter ones have been used for reconstructing ancestral_genomes organization of bacteria animals plants yeasts or protists recent_developments provide exact and fast algorithms that handle repeats as well as diverse types of genome_rearrangements and chromosome structures we describe here how to adapt and integrate some of these methods to process ancient bacterial contigs we apply our method to the black death agent genome using the genomes of eleven closely_related descendants and outgroups from the y pestis and yersinia_pseudotuberculosis clades whose phylogeny is given in we correct order and orient the ancient contigs of the of the medieval black death agent chromosome into a single scaffold and estimate the inter contigs dna_sequences and we describe a preliminary_analysis of this reconstructed ancestral_genome we describe here the result of our method fpsac applied to the dataset described in followed by a preliminary_analysis of the resulting scaffolded chromosome technological sequencing advances can now provide sequences from whole ancient bacterial_genomes which promises to be an invaluable source of knowledge for understanding pathogen evolution however assembling ancient bacterial_genomes poses specific issues in particular because of high fragmentation in numerous contigs in parallel computational paleogenomics by comparative_methods has grown tremendously and computational_methods can now provide ancestral genome_sequences accounting for substitutions or small_indels ancestral gene content or ancestral_genome organizations at the level of full chromosomes but until now were never combined to scaffold and estimate the sequence of an ancient bacterial_chromosome in the present work we described a general method to combine both sequencing and computational reconstruction and illustrated its potential on a real_dataset
