databases_and literome pubmed scale genomic knowledge_base in the cloud the cost of sequencing a full human_genome has recently dropped below www illumina com systems hiseqx sequencing system ilmn the impending broad availability of genomics data holds the promise of making personalized_medicine a reality there has been a rapid rise of interest in applying sequencing in clinical_applications such as cancer treatment and pediatrics as well as in consumer genomics such as andme however it remains_a to interpret genomics data for identifying causal_genes for diseases and proposing novel drug_targets for complex_diseases like cancer the causal mechanism is complex and involves the synergistic_interactions of many genetic components consequently there has been increasing interest in adopting a systems approach to boost the signal_to by integrating prior_knowledge such as gene_networks of equal importance is to keep up with new genomics findings and automate the process of genomic interpretation as the evidence for diagnosis and treatment has grown from a handful of symptoms into hundreds or even thousands of genome_scale markers the majority of biomedical knowledge resides in free_text publications from online repositories such as pubmed www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed which currently contains million published_articles and is growing by million each year this makes it a priority to automate curation of genomic knowledge for scientific and translational_research in the literome project we have developed a natural_language nlp system to automatically extract biomedical entities and relations from pubmed_abstracts and made the resulting knowledge_base available on the internet currently literome focuses on entities and relations most pertinent to genomic medicine genes single_nucleotide snps diseases and drugs related through genomic interactions e g transcription_factors and kinases and genome_wide associations e g snp drug or genedisease_associations users can browse and search the resulting knowledge_base in the literome web_site which will be kept up to date as new abstracts become available the web_site and the knowledge_base are deployed on azure azure microsoft com it is straightforward to apply literome to full texts e g pubmed central we will pursue this in future work
