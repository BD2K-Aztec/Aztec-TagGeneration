structural_bioinformatics a novel web_server predicts amino_acid protection against hydrogen_deuterium motivation to clarify the relationship between structural_elements and polypeptide_chain mobility a set of statistical_analyses of structures is necessary because at present proteins with determined spatial_structures are much less numerous than those with amino_acid known it is important to be able to predict the extent of proton protection from hydrogendeuterium hd exchange basing solely on the protein primary structure results here we present a novel web_server aimed to predict the degree of amino_acid protection against hd exchange solely from the primary structure of the protein chain under study on the basis of the amino_acid the presented server offers the following three possibilities predictors for users choice first prediction of the number of contacts occurring in this protein which is shown to be helpful in estimating the number of protons protected against hd exchange sensitivity second probability of h bonding in this protein which is useful for finding the number of unprotected protons specificity the last is the use of an artificial predictor also we report on mass_spectrometry analysis of hd exchange that has been first applied to free_amino its results showed a good agreement with theoretical data number of protons for globular_proteins cor relation coefficient because flexible sequence_regions frequently play an important functional role they are currently in the focus of numerous studies the functional properties of a protein molecule are a compromise between flexibility and rigidity it was demonstrated that loops and turns showed a higher mobility than other structural_elements flexibility is also characteristic of epitopes and binding_sites of a number of enzymes modulating the life_span of proteins in vivo the method_combining hydrogendeuterium hd exchange and mass_spectrometry data hdms is widely used to study conformational changes in protein_structures hd exchange studies are mostly focused on the exchange of protons involved in h bonding which contributes to stabilization of secondary and spatial_structures of proteins hdms results have proved to be useful in improving prediction of de_novo protein_structures recently it was demonstrated that the direct contact of an amino_acid with solvent did not guarantee a rapid hd exchange which pointed to the necessity of taking_into the structurerate relationships it should be noted that to predict rigid flexible regions and hd exchange_rates a d structure was typically used as the subject matter of for example the pebble game first method the camp server made for prediction of protection factors solely from an amino_acid and previously available at http wwwalmost ch cam ac uk camp php now does not exist but in we had a chance to make predictions for of proteins the fraction of amino_acid with the correctly camp predicted degree of protection was in spite of the fact that camp was a complex neural_network based method it heavily overpredicted the number of hd exchange protected residues and thus with accuracy of prediction of protected regions that of unprotected ones was as low as we believe that the absence of protection may be explained mostly by large_amplitude of fluctuations of the protein chain regions between packed elements of the secondary_structure which promotes contacts of the fluctuating region with solvent hence prediction of unfolded and flexible regions can reveal those prone to large structural fluctuations and therefore to hd exchange some structural_aspects of local flexibility are outlined in this work we concentrated on the possibility of prediction of polypeptide_chain protection against hd exchange which resulted in the presented here server made for prediction of residues protected unprotected against hd exchange additionally we report on the pioneer use of mass_spectrometry analysis of hd exchange for free_amino and good correlation of its results with theoretical data for globular_proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed
