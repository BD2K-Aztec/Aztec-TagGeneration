a novel approach for determining environment specific protein costs the case of arabidopsis_thaliana motivation comprehensive understanding of cellular_processes requires development of approaches which consider the energetic balances in the cell the existing_approaches that address this problem are based on defining energy equivalent costs which do not include the effects of a changing environment by incorporating these effects one could provide a framework for integrating omics_data from various levels of the system in order to provide interpretations with respect to the energy state and to elicit conclusions about putative global energy related response mechanisms in the cell results here we define a cost measure for amino_acid synthesis based on flux_balance of a genome_scale and develop methods for its integration with proteomics and metabolomics_data this is a first measure which accounts for the effect of different environmental_conditions we applied this approach to a genome_scale network of arabidopsis_thaliana and calculated the costs for all amino_acids and proteins present in the network under light and dark conditions integration of function and process ontology_terms in the analysis of protein abundances and their costs indicates that during the night the cell favors cheaper proteins compared with the light environment however this does not imply that there is squandering of resources during the day the results from the association analysis between the costs levels and well defined expenses of amino_acid synthesis indicate that our approach not only captures the adjustment made at the switch of conditions but also could explain the anticipation of resource usage via a global energy related regulatory_mechanism of amino_acid and protein_synthesis the complexity of a cell is reflected in the necessity to balance the conflicting demands for resources to maintain cell vitality and function with those to support growth the study of cell_metabolism has traditionally focused on determining the factors that influence metabolic_rate at levels of both metabolic_pathway and the whole organism recently assembled condition and tissue_specific metabolic_network models offer means for determining another compelling feature of metabolic pathwaystheir metabolic efficiency in addition the advances in omics_technologies have yielded datasets from various levels of cell organization which could be employed to make more refined biological interpretations to whom correspondence should be addressed by coupling metabolic_rates efficiencies and levels of the key system constituents e g gene proteins and metabolites metabolic efficiency can be regarded as the energy equivalent production of a pathway relative to the energy equivalent costs for maintaining the pathway it is related to the energy_balance of the cell given by the difference of energy_supply and demand the supply is a direct consequence of the environment while the demand is influenced by the processes which ensure cell functions and the mechanisms for adaptation therefore it is necessary that any quantification of the cellular_energy state incorporates the environmental effects plant_growth depends on the photosynthetic assimilation of carbon_dioxide and the uptake and assimilation of inorganic nutrients of which nitrogen is quantitatively most important there is a close interplay between carbon and nitrogen_metabolism in higher plants photosynthesis provides carbon skeletons reducing_equivalents and atp required for assimilating inorganic_nitrogen and synthesizing nucleotides amino_acids and proteins on the other hand nitrogen containing metabolites allow for utilization of carbon in growth amino_acids bridging the carbon and nitrogen utilization pathways and necessary for protein_synthesis thus play_a in coordinating the interactions between these two parts of metabolism the concentrations of amino_acids are likely determined by the interplay of several other processes such as export storage and synthesis of metabolites other than proteins they are also closely_linked with protein_turnover in different nitrogen and carbon starved conditions moreover amino_acid daily balances in conjunction with those of carbohydrates may serve as good indicator of environmental_stress e g water_deficit plants typically grow in a diurnal light_dark providing an amenable system to analyze the temporal_dynamics of changes in amino_acid contents and their effects on metabolism for instance it has been demonstrated that nicotiana_tabacum plants_grown in short days have relatively high levels of glutamate and aspartate and extremely_low levels of most of the minor amino_acids i e amino_acids synthesized by longer and dedicated pathways usually present at lower levels compared with major amino_acids in their source leaves at the end of the night moreover illumination yields to decrease in glutamate and an increase in the minor amino_acids due to the proximal regulation the overall amino_acid level often changes in parallel to those of sugars this observation has led to the suggestion that sugars may exert a global control on amino_acid on the other hand recent_studies point out that in arabidopsis_thaliana fumarate and malate levels show diurnal changes similar
