density based hierarchical_clustering of pyro sequences on a large_scale the case of fungal its motivation analysis of millions of pyro sequences is currently playing a crucial_role in the advance of environmental microbiology taxonomy independent i e unsupervised clustering of these sequences is essential for the definition of operational_taxonomic for this application reproducibility and robustness should be the most sought after qualities but have thus far largely been overlooked results more than million hyper variable internal_transcribed its sequences of fungal origin have been analyzed the its sequences were first properly extracted from reads using generalized profiles then otupipe cd_hit esprit tree and dbc a new algorithm presented here were used to analyze the sequences a numerical assay was developed to measure the reproducibility and robustness of these algorithms dbc was the most robust closely followed by esprit tree dbc features density based hierarchical_clustering which complements the other methods by providing insights into the structure of the data environmental microbiology has advanced greatly in the past_few with the advent_of technologies a microbial_community can now be sampled by the exhaustive sequencing of the pcr_products obtained from a carefully_chosen pair of primers currently the roche pyrosequencing is the favored technology because it produces relatively long and sufficiently numerous reads at an acceptable cost however pyro sequences suffer from a non negligible rate of error which often affects the sequence_regions in which a given nucleotide is repeated several times in this study we have used a dataset of the fungal internal_transcribed its coming from soil_samples obtained from different locations in the western swiss alps each location represented a m of grassland the locations were selected by following a random stratified design and thus are distributed over a great variety of soil_types and altitudes overall more than a million pyro sequences have been obtained with the aim of identifying how biotic_and factors influence the fungal diversity at different scales ecological results of this study will be reported elsewhere the focus of this article being to introduce a novel classification_method capable of robustly analyzing this large_scale dataset there are currently three taxonomy independent i e unsupervised clustering_algorithms that can determine operational_taxonomic otus on a large_scale say in the range of a million of pyro sequences these algorithms are cd_hit otupipe and esprit tree they have been recently reviewed and numerically benchmarked in an article that constitutes an excellent introduction to the field of taxonomy independent microbial_community and that summarizes what is the state of art in the field here we introduce dbc a density based hierarchical clustering_algorithm that departs on several points from the previously mentioned ones it was designed with the following requirements in mind it should i determine the optimal_number ii properly separate arbitrarily shaped distributions iii not be affected by the order in which the data are presented iv be robust and resistant to noise e g not assign outliers to clusters v use intuitive free_parameters vi be capable of clustering millions of observations in thousands of clusters and vii return a solution in a reasonable amount of time we also introduce a new numerical benchmark for unsupervised clustering_algorithms which measures their robustness with respect to the errors that are likely to affect the input_sequences the use of generalized profiles for defining the hyper variable its by its highly_conserved flanking_regions alleviates most of the sensitivity problems_encountered with pattern based search_methods including sequencing_errors such as indels in addition this permits the recovery of all the its from the embl irrespective of the particular primers that have been used by the original authors dbc relies on an arbitrarily defined encoding of every sequence as a point in a dimensional_space when this encoding is used for hierarchical density_based an especially robust partition of the input_sequences is obtained which a posteriori corroborates its relevance dbc uses density_based to identify groups of related sequences that are naturally dense in the input dataset as a density based method dbc places no constraints on the cluster shape and radius and has no concept of a cluster center in contrast to all the other algorithms considered here which remove the redundancy among the sequences as an initial step dbc explicitly uses this information for the clustering see the note on esprit tree below one of the unintuitive aspects of density_based is that its performance tends to improve with the size of the input dataset contrary to many other clustering_approaches our results show that this approach leads to especially robust partitions without being detrimental to the overall accuracy this study demonstrates that dbc and esprit tree at a carefully_chosen level are currently the two most robust_methods for the definition of otus in the dataset we have studied the partitions produced by these two methods are only slightly different and essentially compatible the key observation here is that dbc and esprit tree rely on completely different algorithmic approaches this indicates that both methods are actually capable of recognizing the same structure in the input dataset which is an encouraging result regarding the future reproducibility of the experiments in the field of metagenomics it must be noted that the esprit tree algorithm also includes a density sensitive computation step i e the weighting_scheme that is used to update the probabilistic sequences at level greater than this might help to explain the convergent results obtained for dbc and esprit tree recently much attention has been placed on the benefits of denoising i e correct the suspected sequencing_errors of the pyro sequences before performing the taxonomy independent analysis itself considering their particular sensitivity to the sequencing_errors demonstrated here this recommendation obviously makes sense when cd_hit otupipe or esprit tree at the lowest level is used for the clustering analysis however the introduction of an additional pre_processing implies the optimization of additional parameters and has a cost in terms of cpu which is currently prohibitive for large_datasets instead of requiring two successive steps denoising followed by clustering we have shown here that the clustering process itself can be used at the same time to produce a robust partition insensitive to sequencing_errors and to identify the outlier sequences i e those that were pooled as noise in this article
