improving microrna target prediction by modeling with unambiguously identified microrna target pairs from clip ligation studies motivation micrornas mirnas are small_non that are extensively involved in many physiological and disease processes one major_challenge in mirna studies is the identification of genes targeted by mirnas currently most researchers rely on computational programs to initially identify target candidates for subsequent validation although considerable progress has been made in recent_years for computational target prediction there is still significant room for al gorithmic improvement results here we present an improved target prediction algorithm which was developed by mod eling high_throughput profiling data from recent clipl crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by rna ligation sequencing studies in these clipl seq studies the rna_sequences in each mirna_target pair were covalently_linked and unambiguously determined_experimentally by analyzing the clipl data many known and novel features relevant to target_recognition were identified and then used to build a computational_model for target prediction comparative_analysis showed that the new algorithm had improved_performance over existing algorithms when applied to independent experimental_data availability_and all the target prediction data as well as the prediction_tool can be accessed at mirdbmicrornas mirnas are small_non that play important regulatory_roles in many physiological and disease processes about human mirnas have been reported and collectively these mirnas regulate the expression of thousands of gene_targets at both post_transcriptional and translational levels reliable identification of gene_targets is critical for functional characterization of mirnas currently experimental identification of mirna_targets is a timeconsuming process and thus most researchers rely on computational_tools to first predict a set of promising target candidates for further experimental_validation the first step in computational target prediction is to identify relevant_features that are characteristic of mirna target_recognition in recent_years significant progress has been made on this subject and multiple features that are relevant to mirna targeting have been reported such as target pairing to the end of the mirna i e the seed_sequence and structural accessibility of the target_sites for mirna binding for algorithm development the next step is to combine various target_recognition features in a computational_model for target prediction to achieve thisimportant but challenging objective high_quality experimental training data are usually required to properly weight various target features for development of prediction_models most existing target prediction_algorithms have been developed in this way by training with various high_throughput profiling data such as with microarray profiling data or with clip crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing_data however despite steady progress in computational target prediction available bioinformatics_tools still have sub optimal_performance as revealed by subsequent validation experiments currently one major_obstacle in computational algorithm development is the lack of high_quality training data from experimental_studies in recent_years multiple high_throughput studies have been performed to experimentally identify mirna_targets for example a major experimental strategy clip has been developed to identify transcript targets associated with functional mirna induced silencing complex mirna risc one prominent example is hits_clip which identifies short transcript sequences that are bound to the ago protein by cross_linking the rna strand to the protein followed by immunoprecipitation and high_throughput another widely used experimental strategy for target_identification is to analyze downregulated transcripts by mirna overexpression with microarrays these high_throughput experimental_datasets had previously been utilized to train multiple established algorithms for mirna_target although highly useful there are also major challenges associated with clip_seq or microarray_data for target prediction modeling one major unresolved issue is that the exact target_sequence in each mirna_target pair is unknown as a result computational inference which is an errorprone process is necessary to predict the target_sites from clip_seq or microarray_data to address this challenge experimentally improved clip strategies have been developed to directly identify mirna_target pairs residing in the same risc complexes crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by mirna_target ligation termed clipl in our analysis the first clipl seq method termed clash was reported by helwak and colleagues subsequently another similar clipl seq method was also reported by the cliplseq method can unambiguously identify both a mirna and its cognate target_site in the same risc complex thus allowing direct characterization of mirna target_recognition features with clipl seq thousands of mirna_target pairs have been identified in this study public clipl seq data were systematically_analyzed and used to develop an improved algorithm for mirna_target one major_obstacle in computational target prediction is the lack of reliable experimental_data to guide computational data modeling to map the target_sites for individual mirnas more precisely clipl methods have been developed recently to link a mirna to its target_site in the same risc complex thus clipl seq profiling data have provided an unprecedented opportunity to study mirna target_recognition features in a more precise manner as compared with conventional approaches in particular by analyzing individual nucleotide positions in the target_sites many novel position specific sequence and structural_features have been identified presented inand further clipl analysis also confirmed certain well characterized target features such as cross species_conservation of seed binding_sites and the relevance of target_site location within the transcript by combining both known and newly_identified target_recognition features an improved target prediction model mirtarget was developed by training with clipl seq data the robust performance of mirtarget has also been validated with independent experimental profiling data both canonical and non canonical target_sites have been identified in clipl seq studies however our recent clipl seq analysisimproving mirna_target with identified mrna target pairsindicates that non canonical targeting usually does not lead to target downregulation as such non canonical targeting represents a set of interesting but poorly_understood mirna_target interactions that are not directly related to regulation of target expression in contrast canonical targeting involving perfect seed pairing usually leads to significant target downregulation this raised an interesting question as to how an effective mirna_target should be defined non canonical binding between a mirna and a transcript could be functionally_important but may not involve target downregulation one possibility is that non canonical mirna binding to a transcript may be related to the competing endogenous rnas hypothesis as a way to sequester mirnas from regulating the expression of canonical targets in this study the main focus is to identify mirna_target which leads to significant_downregulation of target expression upon binding by the mirna thus only canonical target_sites are considered by the prediction model however we would like to emphasize that prediction of non canonical binding_sites may also be of practical importance especially when functional_impacts of such non canonical interactions are better characterized in the future
