structural_bioinformatics six rossmannoid folds including the class i aminoacyl_trna share a partial core with the anti codon binding_domain of a class_ii aminoacyl_trna motivation similarities in core residue packing provide evidence for divergence or convergence not reported using other methods results we apply a new method for rapid structure comparison based on simplicial neighborhood analysis of protein packing snapp to the diverse structural_classification of proteins scop class of protein_folds the procedure identifies inter residue packing motifs shared by protein pairs from different folds a threshold of rmsd for all atoms of corresponding residues ensures inclusion of only highly_significant similarities comparable with those observed for identical catalytic_residues in homologues many tertiary packing motifs are shared among the three classical rossmannoid folds as well as thousands of other motifs that occur in at least two distinct folds merging of neighboring packing motifs facilitated recognition of larger recurrent substructures or cores the anti codon binding_domain of an archeal aminoacyl_trna aars was discovered to possess a packed core in which eight identical amino_acid are within rmsd of the comparable structure in the fixj receiver a member of the rossmannoid family that also includes the chey signaling protein and flavodoxin like proteins further investigation identified close variants of this core in five other rossmannoid folds including a functionally_relevant core in class ia aminoacyl_trna although it is possible that the two essentially_identical cores in the prors anti codon binding_domain and the fixj receiver converged to the same structure the consensus core obtained from the structural and sequence_alignments suggests that all the implicated protein_folds descended from a simpler ancestral protein in which this core provided nucleotide_binding and proto allosteric functions demonstrating structural_similarities between proteins has long provided the initial evidence for common structural_motifs to whom correspondence should be addressed representing evolutionary_divergence or convergence most approaches rely on comparing the arrangement of secondary_structures or other local substructures in d considerably less development has been devoted to identifying more precise structural details comparison methods that focus on precise arrangements of amino_acid are usually used to identify catalytic ion binding and small_molecule binding_sites often the aim is to recognize similarities across distinct protein_folds for function prediction or active_site comparisons among homologous protein_structures such atomic_level comparisons have generally not been extended to features outside active_sites yet as distantly_related proteins with different folds usually have substantial active_site differences comparing structural_features outside the active_sites may yield more definitive_evidence for divergence from a common_ancestor for proteins with specific sub structural_motifs central to the present work is identification of tertiary contact motifs found in pairs of proteins from at least two different folds the method identifies recurrent tertiary contacts between protein secondary_structure similarities are observed at the atomic_level of detail where conformations of individual amino_acid are repeated in similarly packed arrangements of side_chains on the secondary_structure faces in conventional analyses the most regularly repeated features of tertiary contacts observed are residue pairs separated as i i in strands and as i i and i i on the surface of helices in this work these residue pairs will be referred to as secondary_structure coupled residues scrs scrs yield knobs and holes that form the close_packed interfaces between secondary_structure the regular spacing in sequence and in d of scrs leads to preferred orientations for the secondary_structures in d that have been observed in similar protein_structures results presented here demonstrate that tertiary i e non sequence local arrangements of residues interacting at the interfaces of secondary_structure yield evolutionary clues that cannot be obtained by comparing one dimensional motifs we analyze the structural_classification of protein scop class of proteins in which motifs are repeated to form layered sandwich structures with helices on both sides of a central parallel sheet the largest related superfamily of proteins in thisprotein structures from the scop class were analyzed for scrapes in recurring packing motifs that might help discriminate between evolutionary_divergence and convergence there were instances of protein_structure pairs from different folds possessing scrape pairs that were within rmsd for all atoms scrapes were combined to form composite motifs revealing a total of similarities between protein pairs from distinct folds in the class the overall motif distribution can be visualized by drawing a graph where edges represent the highly_significant structural_similarities shared by two protein_structures illustrates the protein_structure similarity network obtained for the scop class the network reveals many precise similarities between proteins from different folds suggesting many evolutionary connections between members of the class the most prominent feature of the similarity network is a sub structure formed from edges connecting the three classical rossmannoid folds defined in scop class nad p binding rossmann class fad nad p binding_domains class nucleotide_binding shows connections between c and c connections between c and c and connections between c and c each edge represents similarity of at least four residues between fold representatives the most significant similarities can be observed in graphs that impose a minimum threshold of similar residues shows a graph representing the of comparison used here can reveal relationships among proteins that have diverged to the point of having distinct folds as well as possibly identifying cases of convergence to a common motif residues
