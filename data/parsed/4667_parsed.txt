bioinformatics_discovery sequence_analysis tiki at the head of a new superfamily of enzymes tiki proteins appear to antagonize wnt signalling_pathway by acting as wnt proteases thereby affecting wnt solubility by its amino_terminal cleavage tiki protease_activity was shown to be metal_ion dependent and was inhibited by chelating_agents and thus was tentatively proposed to be a metalloprotease nevertheless tiki proteins exhibit no detectable sequence_similarity to previously described metalloproteases but instead have been reported as being homologues of trab proteins pfam id pf a widely_distributed family of unknown function and structure here we show that tiki proteins are members of a new superfamily of domains contained not just in trab proteins but also in erythromycin esterase pfam id pf duf domain of unknown function pfam id pf and martx toxins that contribute to host invasion and pathogenesis by bacteria we establish the core fold of this enzymatic domain and its catalytic_residues wnt_signalling is a key developmental_pathway controlling both embryonic_development and tissue maintenance by regulation of stem_cell in adults aberrant activation of the wnt signalling_pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell_proliferation wnt related_diseases are extensive in number and include neurodegenerative_disease inflammatory_bowel cleft_lip disorders and various cancers the first wnt gene was discovered years_ago and despite extensive research into this signalling_pathway it has remained_unclear how wnt morphogen levels and activities are regulated in large part this is because of the vast numbers of wnt isoforms receptors co receptors and different secreted antagonists encoded in animal_genomes our understanding of wnt_signalling has recently been advanced substantially by the characterization of tiki a gene which when over expressed in xenopus_embryos results in head enlargement tiki refers to large headed humanoid carvings in polynesian cultures tiki and its paralogue tiki antagonize wnt activity upstream of its receptors
