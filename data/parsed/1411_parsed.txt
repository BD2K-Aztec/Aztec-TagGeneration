genome_analysis discover regulatory_dna using chromatin signatures and artificial_neural motivation recent large_scale chromatin_states mapping efforts have revealed characteristic chromatin_modification signatures for various types of functional dna elements given the important influence of chromatin_states on gene_regulation and the rapid accumulation of genome_wide chromatin_modification data there is a pressing need for computational_methods to analyze these data in order to identify functional dna elements however existing computational_tools do not exploit data transformation and feature_extraction as a means to achieve a more accurate prediction results we introduce a new computational framework for identifying_functional dna elements using chromatin signatures the framework consists of a data transformation and a feature_extraction step followed by a classification step using time delay neural_network we implemented our framework in a software_tool csi ann chromatin signature identification by artificial_neural when applied to predict transcriptional enhancers in the encode region csi ann achieved a sensitivity and positive_predictive a and improvement respectively over the previously best approach availability_and csi ann is implemented in matlab the source_code is freely_available atcis acting regulatory_dna such as promoters enhancers and insulators play_an in establishing precise temporal and tissue_specific gene_expression systematic and precise mapping of these regulatory_dna especially enhancers is a prerequisite for understanding gene_expression programs in both healthy and diseased cells experimentally enhancers can be mapped using the powerful technique chromatin_immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip chip_chip or short_read chip_seq however this approach is limited by the availability of a large number of chip grade antibodies specifically recognizing the to whom correspondence should be addressed transcription_factors tfs of interest on the other hand enhancers can be computationally predicted based on the observation that they often contain dense clusters of tf_binding tfbs in a short stretch of dna bp and are often conserved methods relying on clustering of tfbs require prior_knowledge of the binding_specificities of the tfs involved which is still quite limited methods based on sequence_conservation require precise alignment of regulatory dna_sequences from multiple species which is not necessarily true for all elements histone_proteins in chromatin are subject to a number of covalent_modifications primarily at their n_terminal tails including methylation acetylation phosphorylation ubiquitylation and adp_ribosylation these chromatin_modifications have profound influences on gene_expression numerous genome_wide chip chip_seq studies have provided data on the distribution of histone_modifications in various model_organisms and cell_types a picture is now emerging in which distinct genomic_regions such as enhancers promoters and gene_bodies both protein_coding and non coding rna genes have distinct histone_modification signatures for example high levels of histone_lysine have been found at gene_promoters and at many enhancers in addition it has been shown that many regulatory_elements carry these epigenetic_modifications only in specific cell tissue_types or according to environmental_conditions which cannot be determined by comparative_genomics based on sequence alone collectively these observations suggest that epigenetic signatures could be an alternative and powerful way to pinpoint regulatory_dna in the genome given the rapid_growth of genome_wide chromatin_modification data from different species and cell_types there is now a pressing need for computational_tools capable of integrating various histone_modification maps to discover regulatory_dna recently several groups have started to develop computational_tools to address this need were the first to develop a computational_tool for predicting promoters and enhancers in hela_cells using six histone_modification maps covering of the human_genome their algorithm predicts promoters and enhancers based on correlation to the average histone_modification profiles trained on known examples in spite of the success of the profilebased method it is limited in two aspects i the contribution of each histone_modification mark to the classification methodwe introduced a novel computational framework to identify enhancers using chromatin histone_modification signatures an important component of this novel approach is the introduction of data transformation and feature_extraction to epigenomic data analysis although these concepts are not new in the field of pattern_recognition to the best of our knowledge they have not been applied to epigenomic data unlike genomic_sequences that are sequences of discrete alphabets four nucleotides epigenomic signals could be described as a continuous real valued signal analog nature it bears a striking_similarity to physiological signals such as electroencephalographic signals and nmr_spectra thus it could be beneficial if we use data transformation techniques to reveal hidden patterns in complex and high_dimensional epigenomic data for instance raw histone_modification signal in an input window can be described using its mean skewness and kurtosis that are different mathematical functions these functions allow us to capture different aspects of chromatin_modification signals many of which may be missed by previous_approaches that only use arithmetic mean for example different shapes of histone_modification peaks e g symmetric versus asymmetric could be captured by the skewness measure these differences in peak shape might reflect yet undiscovered differences in the underlying_molecular that create the modifications in the first place besides data transformation feature_extraction is arguably the most important component of a pattern_recognition system by combining all histone_modifications features we are exploiting a data space where irrelevant features are discarded and noise is decreased to demonstrate the utility of data transformation and feature_extraction for analyzing epigenomic data we showed that csi ann outperformed two existing_methods in the task of identifying_functional dna elements using histone_modification data in this study we compared the performance of hmm with that of ann although a powerful framework for biological sequence_analysis hmms assume that states are independent which may not hold true for histone_modification data given the combinatorial nature of histone tail post_translational also the maximum_likelihood criterion of the training algorithm leads to poor discrimination i e it maximizes the probability of a given model generating the observed sequence but does not minimize the probability of the other models generating the same sequence because anns can be trained with a discriminative criterion these systems could perform better than those based on hmms in addition given its nature anns offer a potential of providing massive parallelism adaptation and efficient algorithms for solving classification_problems which could be very beneficial when analyzing multi_dimensional and huge datasets such as epigenomic data nonetheless there still is room from improvement first in this study we processed histone_modification data using only two mathematical functions mean and energy additional functions from domains such as statistics and information_theory could be added to create additional features using raw histone_modification data second although a linear feature_extraction method such as fda produced satisfactory_results we would expect a nonlinear combination method to provide better results than that from linear transformations third for this study we only used chromatin histone_modification data other data_sources such as nucleosome_positioning tfbs and gene_expression can also be included we could input all those different data_sources into a feature_extraction step to create even better informative feature s for the classifier
