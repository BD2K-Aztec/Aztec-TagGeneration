gene_expression optimization of gene_set annotations via entropy minimization over variable clusters emvc motivation gene_set has become a critical tool for interpreting the results of high_throughput genomic experiments inconsistent annotation_quality and lack of annotation specificity however limit the statistical_power of enrichment_methods and make it difficult to replicate enrichment results across biologically similar datasets results we propose a novel algorithm for optimizing gene_set annotations to best match the structure of specific empirical data_sources our proposed method entropy minimization over variable clusters emvc filters the annotations for each gene_set to minimize a measure of entropy across disjoint gene_clusters computed for a range of cluster sizes over multiple bootstrap resampled datasets as shown using simulated gene_sets with simulated_data and molecular_signatures collections with microarray_gene the emvc algorithm accurately filters annotations unrelated to the experimental outcome resulting in increased gene_set power and better replication of enrichment results availability_and http cran r project org web pack ages emvc index html gene_set is widely used for the analysis and interpretation of the large molecular datasets generated by modern biomedical_science despite the development of robust statistical enrichment_methods and extensive functional ontologies such as the gene_ontology go the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg and the molecular_signatures msigdb with annotations for many biological_molecules across numerous species the results of enrichment_analysis are too often overly general inaccurate or non reproducible across experiments although changes to statistical_methods or refinements of functional ontologies can improve enrichment performance annotation completeness and quality is often a dominant_factor driving enrichment accuracy and reproducibility the annotation of most genes and gene_products is incomplete with only a sparse set of annotations to generic high_level categories available for those annotations that do exist the overwhelming_majority are automatically generated on the basis of sequence or structural_similarity without any curatorial review du such automatically generated annotations have known quality_issues relative to manually_curated annotations especially those based on published experimental_findings electronic annotations are slowly being replaced with higher quality annotations backed by experimental_evidence however given the slow pace of experimental_validation and manual_curation the preponderance of unreviewed computational annotations and continual generation of new automated annotations annotation_quality will remain a challenge into the foreseeable_future current approaches to annotation_quality fall into one of several groups those that create a filtered version of existing annotations those that subset and or restructure existing functional ontologies and those that define new customized gene_sets in the context of go automatic_annotation filtering includes methods that use evidence codes e g the msigdb c collection as well as approaches that use the ontology hierarchy to identify and remove redundant annotations methods that subset or restructure ontologies include tools for the manual or automatic generation of go slims as well as techniques for the information_theoretic optimization of the entire go taxonomy the process used to generate the msigdb c cancer modules combines both automatic gene_set generation with gene_set refinement in the cancer module process modules are generated by merging and then refining existing gene_sets with gene_clusters computed from a large collection of tumor gene_expression although manually customized annotation collections can achieve high_specificity they require domain expertise to create and suffer from ad_hoc methods that limit the relevance of any subsequent analysis results while automatic_methods for annotation filtering and ontology sub setting do not suffer from individual researcher bias their general_purpose nature can prevent them from aligning with the narrow scientific to whom correspondence should be addressed this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com domain under investigation an important limitation of many current automatic_annotation filtering and ontology subsetting methods is the fact that analysis is only based on the structure of the ontology and the content of the underlying annotation databases the experimentally_observed abundance of the annotated_genes and gene_products is not used to help identify low quality annotations or guide ontology restructuring by focusing on just ontological and annotation data these methods provide information about the general quality of the annotations and ontology structure information that is equally relevant to any dataset measuring the annotated_genes given the large number of proteins with incomplete and therefore coarse_grained functional_annotations a general measure of annotation_quality may be a poor predictor of how well annotations will perform within a narrow domain even for those approaches that use experimental_data like the process used to create the msigdb c cancer modules the focus is usually on a broad collection of experimental_data e g microarray_data for tumor_types in the case of the c cancer modules and the output typically combines synthesis of new gene_sets with gene_set refinement rather than focusing solely on refinement of existing gene_sets for a specific experimental context development of high_quality annotations that are specialized to a research domain yet free from researcher bias requires techniques that automatically refine annotations using machine_learning based on representative experimental_data while statistical_learning methods are commonly used to predict new annotations from biological data effective tools are not currently available that apply these techniques for the refinement of existing gene_set annotations to address this gap and enable more accurate and reproducible gene_set we have developed a novel bioinformatics method entropy minimization over variable clusters emvc that automatically customizes existing functional_annotations for specific sets of biological data as we demonstrate using simulated gene_sets with simulated_data and msigdb collections with microarray_gene the emvc method accurately filters annotations unrelated to the experimental outcome resulting in increased gene_set power and better replication of enrichment results gene_clusters and gene_set the emvc algorithm performs annotation optimization on variable clusters computed using an unsupervised view of experimental_data by minimizing the entropy for each variable group relative to disjoint variable clusters the annotations for variables that tend to cluster with other variable group members are kept and annotations for variables that cluster apart are filtered a key_advantage of this unsupervised_approach is that emvc optimized annotations can be used for subsequent variable group enrichment without biasing the computed enrichment statistics however the unsupervised emvc approach can only successfully filter inconsistent annotations improve gene_set power and improve enrichment replication if the structure of genomic_data as represented by gene_clusters can be used to identify the genomic variables most likely to contribute to gene_set in other words the genes that contribute strongly to the enrichment signal for significantly_enriched gene_sets must be more likely to cluster together than the genes whose expression is not consistent with gene_set open circles represent the fdr values computed using the unoptimized cancer module annotations and solid squares represent the fdr values computed using optimized cancer modules if the optimized fdr value is less than the unoptimized value a solid line is used otherwise a dotted line is used an aml prefix is used for gene_sets enriched using the unoptimized annotations for the acute_myeloid and an all prefix is used for gene_sets enriched for the acute_lymphoblastic phenotype the ratio of optimized to unoptimized annotations for each of the top cancer modules is displayed after each module name along with the symbols for the filtered genes cropped at an asterisk follows the symbol for filtered annotations that were designated as core genes by the gsea algorithm for the displayed contingency_table filtered annotations were removed by emvc in more of the cluster results in bootstrap resampled data_sets resulting in an odds_ratio of ci when all filtering thresholds are considered the area_under is h r frost and j gene_set has become a central element in the analysis and interpretation of genomic_data although significant progress has been made building gene_set collections and developing statistical enrichment_methods annotation_quality remains a critical challenge because of the broad scope of many gene_set collections and the large number of lowquality annotations enrichment_analysis results are frequently inaccurate and non reproducible current approaches to annotation_quality are mainly general_purpose largely driven by just the structure and content of the gene_set ontology and when experimental_data are considered focus on gene_set synthesis over refinement to address the annotation_quality issue and limitations of current approaches we have developed a novel annotation optimization method emvc which is available as an r package from cran on both simulated gene_sets with simulated_data and msigdb gene_sets with real_gene the emvc algorithm has been shown to effectively filter inconsistent annotations improve enrichment power and improve enrichment replication
