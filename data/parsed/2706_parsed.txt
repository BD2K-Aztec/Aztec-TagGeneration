library of binding_protein scaffolds libbp a computational platform for selection of binding_protein scaffolds motivation developments in biotechnology have enabled the in vitro evolution of binding_proteins the emerging limitations of antibodies in binding protein_engineering have led to suggestions for other proteins as alternative binding_protein scaffolds most of these proteins were selected based on human intuition rather than systematic analysis of the available data to improve this strategy we developed a computational framework for finding desirable binding_protein scaffolds by utilizing protein_structure and sequence_information results for each protein its structure and the sequences of evolutionarily_related proteins were analyzed and spatially contiguous regions composed of highly_variable residues were identified a large number of proteins have these regions but leucine_rich lrrs histidine_kinase domains and immunoglobulin domains are predominant among them the candidates suggested as new binding_protein scaffolds include histidine_kinase lrr titin and pentapeptide repeat protein availability_and the database and web_service are accessible via http bcbl kaist ac kr libbp the development of recombinant dna technologies and binding_protein screening methods has enabled researchers to imitate in vivo adaptive immune_processes in the laboratory and thereby engineerspecific protein binders this in vitro protein evolution is composed of two steps generation of a large span of diversified proteins and selection of proteins with high_affinity to the target_molecules various combinations of protein diversification and selection technologies such as phage_display yeast surface_display and ribosome display are currently applied to perform in vitro protein evolution except for the development of peptide epitopes these technologies require scaffold proteins where the epitope recognition_sites are randomized antibodies are the key_component of the adaptive_immune and have highly_variable complementarity_determining consequently they have been widely engineered as the scaffolds for binding_proteins however the limitations of antibodies as scaffold proteins such as their high_molecular multi chain nature and overly large variable_regions have emerged and alternative proteins have therefore been sought to date more than alternative binding_proteins composed of a structurally stable region and a variable region where diverse amino_acids can be placed have been identified specifically described three desirable properties for scaffolds in a binding_protein library they must have a compact and rigid core a contiguous surface region where the amino_acids can be replaced and exposure of hydrophobic_residues in the variable region for many scaffold proteins their loop_regions are selectedas the variable_regions and structural_components are rarely considered during scaffold_protein selection the exceptions are repeat proteins in which repetitive patterns constitute specific horseshoe shapes and their concave regions are used as the variable_regions however most binding_protein scaffolds were selected for their native functions and little attention has been paid to their diversity and structure along with exponential_increase in protein_sequence recent_advances in structural_genomics have expanded our understanding of proteins and their structures this information can be utilized to systemically identify new candidates for binding_protein scaffolds in this study we computationally analyzed the structures and sequences of proteins to discover scaffolds with desirable properties for binding_protein libraries first the sequences of evolutionarily_related proteins were collected and their amino_acid diversity was evaluated to establish the variable residues the spatial_relationship among the variable residues was evaluated using the protein_structures a scoring_function combining the sequence and structure information was employed to determine highly_variable and contiguous regions consequently we were able to identify new candidates for binding_protein scaffolds along with previously_developed binding_proteins in addition we provide a web_based database for the binding_protein scaffolds found in this analysis as well as a web_based analysis tool that can be used to detect the variable region of any protein_structure in this study we developed a computational_method that utilized residue variability and connectivity to evaluate proteins as scaffolds for binding_proteins lrr folds histidine_kinase domains and immunoglobulin domains were found to possess desirable variable patches the lrr fold and immunoglobulin domain have previously been reported as good scaffolds for binding_proteins the high rank of these structures in our study suggests that our method identified structures that could be used as binding_protein scaffolds considering our results and several other relevant_features of the proteins we selected five new binding_protein scaffolds these five proteins can be used to construct binding_protein libraries and we expect that the systematic evaluation of protein_structure as conducted here will facilitate the development of additional new binding_protein libraries
