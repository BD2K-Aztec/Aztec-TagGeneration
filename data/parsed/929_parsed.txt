characterization and improvement of rna_seq precision in quantitative transcript expression_profiling motivation measurement precision determines the power of any analysis to reliably identify significant signals such as in screens for differential_expression independent of whether the experimental_design incorporates replicates or not with the compilation of large_scale rna_seq with technical replicate samples however we can now for the first time perform a systematic analysis of the precision of expression_level estimates from massively_parallel sequencing_technology this then allows considerations for its improvement by computational or experimental means results we report on a comprehensive study of target_identification and measurement precision including their dependence on transcript_expression read_depth and other parameters in particular an impressive recall of of the estimated true transcript population could be achieved with million bp reads with diminishing returns from longer read_lengths and even less gains from increased sequencing_depths most of the measurement power is spent on only of the known transcriptome however making less strongly expressed transcripts harder to measure consequently of all transcripts could be quantified reliably with a relative_error based on established tools we then introduce a new approach for mapping and analysing sequencing_reads that yields substantially improved_performance in gene_expression increasing the number of transcripts that can reliably be quantified to over extrapolations to higher sequencing_depths highlight the need for efficient complementary steps in discussion we outline possible experimental and computational strategies for further improvements in quantification precision rna_seq is a novel method for gene_expression by next_generation of transcripts the technology has been applied to gain global views of the complex transcriptomes of mammalian samples including human_embryonic and b cells mouse_embryonic blastomeres and different mouse_tissues an advantage of rna_seq over to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address institute of molecular_pathology dr bohr gasse vienna austria other profiling technologies is that it allows a comprehensive assay of gene_expression that is not reliant on probes for targets that must be specified in advance it is particularly well suited for the de_novo detection of splice_junctions and allows genome_wide qualitative expression_profiling of organisms with unknown genome_sequence transcript detection obviously benefits from the digital nature of counting sequence_reads the observed identification_rate increases with additional sequencing but is partly determined by the non random nature of biological_sequences and the highly_skewed distribution of transcript_abundances we can extrapolate an expected achievable identification_rate from the observed dependency on experimental parameters like read_depth and read_length in addition we examine the effects of random read sampling on the identification of low copy_number transcripts as resulting from the distribution of reads_mapped to different spliceforms with many transcription_factors being biologically_active in low copy_numbers this is particularly topical for studies of gene_regulation increasingly there has been an interest in applying rna_seq not only for qualitative transcriptome_profiling but also for the quantification of gene_expression using raw read_counts mapped to individual targets however can result in length_dependent bias and see_supplementary a common approach for the quantification of gene_expression in an rna_seq experiment thus computes the number of reads per kilobase of exonic sequence per_million rpkm to produce a gene_expression measure which overall correlates well with measurements from microarrays such normalization is also necessary to allow the combination or the comparison of rna_seq runs while earlier work has focused on reads that unambiguously identify a transcript current_developments extend data analysis to complex gene models of alternative_splicing also taking_into the many reads that may come from different spliceforms a popular recently emerging approach is to align_reads to the genome and then use this information to assemble transcripts de_novo and calculate their abundances as implemented by the tophat cufflinks tools despite or perhaps even because of the fast pace of development of both the measurement technology and the associated novel analysis tools the central_question of measurement reliability or of how precisely we can actually quantify transcript_expression has received relatively little attention beyond initial_observations of overall good correlation simple correlation_coefficients however can be misleading as they are dominated by a small number of very highly_expressed see supplementary section s for discussion examples despite the excellent overall correlation reproducibility seems to be lower for gene classes that are less strongly expressed we will examine this in greater detail to show that as a consequence some transcripts can be assessed with extremely good precision whereas a large number of transcripts are hard to measure reliably it is therefore interesting to consider measurement precision for all targets individually similar to the early microarray_data however there has been a lack of large rna_seq with the necessary technical_replicates now a comprehensive analysis of the reproducibility of gene expression_level measurements by rnaseq has become possible and constitutes a necessary complement to characterizations of systemic measurement bias in next_generation measurement precision in particular determines the power of any analysis to reliably identify relevant signals or changes such as in screens for differential_expression independent of whether replicates are employed or not compiled one of the first large rna_seq with technical_replicates million_reads per sample reporting reduced precision for less strongly expressed transcripts we here provide a systematic study of the reliability of expression_level estimates from an extended dataset with technical_replicates million_reads based on our observations we then introduce a hybrid_approach in the analysis of sequencing_reads for which we can demonstrate substantially improved quantification performance we performed three replicate measurements of mrna extracted from a human hmec a cell_line culture with a total of million bp reads corresponding to an entire abi solid flowcell per measurement sample this constitutes one of the largest rna_seq featuring technical_replicates to date as a first step for estimating expression levels different methods for mapping these reads to targets were considered while bowtie directly aligned about half of the collected reads to all the known transcript spliceform sequences only unique reads identified spliceforms unambiguously because for targets with many common sequence_regions only a fraction of aligned_reads will be discriminative these can then be used to estimate gene_expression levels alternatively tophat first aligns reads to the genomic_sequence estimating expression levels using gene models to explain the observed read_alignments arising from different spliceforms then allows the exploitation of non unique reads which make up of all the mapped_reads we want to know how reliable these estimates are shows the influence of alignment choices and the exploitation of gene models on the number of genes for which transcript_expression can be estimated reliably with a relative_error of or less the unique reads_mapped by bowtie identified spliceforms of all known transcripts of these spliceforms could be measured reliably in contrast tophat and cufflinks set to discover spliceforms de_novo identified spliceforms of these could be measured reliably it is interesting to consider if providing cufflinks with a set of known gene models can improve on this result while one loses the capability of detecting novel spliceforms assignments to known spliceforms will improve particularly for spliceforms covered by fewer reads for the ensembl gene models spliceforms could then be identified of all known transcripts of these could be measured reliably note that this now also includes spliceforms with non unique reads considering this marked improvement we suggest an exploitation of gene models already at the alignment stage by directly mapping reads to the known transcriptome by bowtie combined with i cufflinks analysis employing the underlying gene models that also permits the use of non unique reads interestingly this requires less disk_space and also runs about an order of magnitude faster which can be a relevant concern for ultra_deep sets nevertheless the total mapped read_counts are comparable while a genome level alignment by tophat detects additional transcripts de_novo the bowtie alignment of reads to the given spliceform sequences is much more sensitive in the identificationwith each discernible dot representing a transcript target in shaded areas the grey level represents density with dark shading indicating higher_densities the standard_deviation is in general larger for transcripts with lower mean expression_level x axis more strongly expressed transcripts could often be measured reliably with a relative_error of or less interestingly just of all transcript targets could be measured that precisely below the horizontal dashed_line of the most strongly expressed transcripts to the right of the vertical dashed_line on the other hand could be measured reliably below the horizontal dashed_line this is reflected by the high_density of targets on the right dark shading falling largely below the horizontal line which is not the case to the left of the vertical dashed_line of known junctions almost threefold better see these junctions however often play_a in identifying the expression of a particular spliceform we could thus identify spliceforms of all known transcripts of which could be measured reliably that means we could assess of all known spliceforms with a relative_error of these fall below the horizontal dashed_line of which plots the measurement standard_deviation versus transcript expression_level the scatter clearly decreases with higher transcript_abundance in view of the of all spliceforms achieving good reproducibility we can also consider the of targets with the highest expression_level they are found to the right of the vertical mark of these the vast_majority could be measured reliably below the horizontal line this is a direct consequence of the sampling nature of rna_seq as discussed below many modern applications in the life_sciences rely on accurate profiles of gene_expression supporting as diverse areas as functional_genomics and systems_biology gene_expression by nextgeneration_sequencing protocols like rna_seq now promises to discriminate alternative spliceforms assess allele_specific and detect transcript fusion with a growing interest in applying rna_seq for the quantitative assessment of expression levels the questions of systemic bias and random noise become particularly topical while systemic deviations due to length bias lane effects and processing artefacts are increasingly being investigated reproducibility has in general received much less attention measurement precision however determines the power of most analyses including screens for differential_expression whether they exploit replicates or not as illustrated however high correlation_coefficients and the perceived tightness of scatter plots alone can be misleading supplementary section s indeed despite overall good correlation between replicates in one of the first large rna_seq studies with technical_replicates million_reads per sample observed reduced precision for less strongly expressed transcripts we here report on a comprehensive systematic study of the reliability of expression_level estimates from an extended dataset with technical_replicates million_reads the observations and trends apparent from this large abi solid dataset are the direct result of the uniform sampling_approach of rna_seq they are therefore of generic nature and independent of a particular sequencing_platform or analysis particulars see supporting complementary results for illumina genome analyser data and an experiment with paired_end from a second generation illumina device supplementary sections s and s respectively considering the first step in estimating expression levels we examined alternative ways of read_alignment similar to other recent rna_seq analyses only a proportion of the collected reads could ever be mapped to known transcript sequences even allowing for multiple mismatches supplementary tables s and s it is noteworthy that at present there is no explanation for the remaining unmapped reads these constitute a substantial_proportion of reads that cannot be identified even by modern alignment_algorithms and that are also not due to contamination with sequences from other organisms data not shown the unmappable reads may reflect errors specific to certain sequencing kits mortazavi personal communication as well as artefacts from the processing of rna for massive_parallel for the simple identification of transcripts a further increase of read_depth may show diminishing returns as saturation effects were already apparent in the detection rate for higher read_depths pooling all million_reads yielded a target recall of of the estimated true transcript population in the profiled sample a single flowcell already achieved a considerable extension beyond that can still be expected from longer read_lengths supplementary especially up to lengths of bp per fragment or from the application of advanced sequencing strategies like paired_end supplementary sections s and s while on one hand the reads of massively_parallel are getting longer on the other hand the sequencing_depth achieved by longer read technologies is continuously being improved with some approaches claiming fulllength reads a comprehensive identification of collected reads may become feasible in the future depending on the dataset at present only of the collected reads could be mapped to known spliceforms unambiguously modern algorithms therefore exploit gene models of alternative spliceforms to infer expression levels that explain both unique and ambiguous read_alignments we next investigated how well the expression levels of individual identified transcripts could be quantified in general the more strongly expressed transcripts could be measured more reproducibly it is interesting to consider the mechanism behind the larger technical scatter for the less strongly expressed transcripts earlier sage studies have already shown that a small proportion of genes can be responsible for the majority of a cells mrna mass with just of measured genes contributing of the expressed mrna while it is thus recognized that abundant transcripts can dominate collected_samples of expressed mrnas the consequences of this effect for genome_wide studies are remarkable even for deep_sequencing here we find that over of all read_alignments concentrate on just of the known transcriptome similarly the more abundant transcripts in the remaining transcriptome received most of the remaining reads and so on most of the measurement power was thus spent on a small number of highly abundant transcripts thus explaining the higher sampling noise for the remaining targets with new technologies promising ever higher read_depth we examined its effect on measurement precision although the achievable dynamic range of rna_seq increases linearly with higher sequencing_depths most of the additional reads will again hit already extensively sampled transcripts as a result the number of spliceforms that can be measured reliably follows a sigmoid shape indicating that even at higher read_depths transcripts with low to moderate expression levels are difficult to quantify at good precision with current rna_seq protocol as the cost of next_generation drops and new advanced platforms and protocols emerge it will be interesting to see the results of full scale comparisons with sufficiently elaborate replication structures in their experimental_designs similar to recent efforts for a number of microarray_technologies in lieu of such an elaborate comparison was can still consider the measurementpage i i i
