identifying kinase dependency in cancer_cells by integrating high_throughput drug_screening and kinase inhibition data motivation targeted kinase_inhibitors have dramatically improved cancer treatment but kinase dependency for an individual patient or cancer cell can be challenging to predict kinase dependency does not always correspond with gene_expression and mutation status high_throughput drug screens are powerful_tools for determining kinase dependency but drug polypharmacology can make results difficult_to results we developed kinase addiction ranker kar an algorithm that integrates high through put drug_screening data comprehensive kinase inhibition data and gene_expression to identify kinase dependency in cancer_cells we applied kar to predict kinase dependency of lung_cancer cell_lines and leukemia patient samples using published datasets we experimentally_validated kar predictions of fgfr and mtor dependence in lung_cancer cell_line h showing synergistic reduction in proliferation after combining ponatinib and azd availability_and kar can be downloaded as a python function or a matlab script along with example inputs and outputs at http tanlab ucdenver edu kar kinases play_essential in cell_survival growth and proliferation and are currently the largest protein class in clinical_trials kinases are frequently mutated in cancer and acquire oncogenic properties to drive tumorgenesis these cancer_cells are often addicted to the mutated oncogenes e g kinases targeted_cancer have exploited this oncogene_addiction concept and deployed small_molecules that could inhibit these oncogenic kinases while kinases are predominantly targeted for cancer_therapy they are also implicated in immunological neurological metabolic and infectious_diseases induction of cell_death through inhibition of a specific essential kinase creates selective_pressure for cancer_cells to develop resistance_mechanisms cancer_cells often acquire resistance through mutations that interfere with drug binding other resistance mechanisms_include target amplification upregulation of alternative kinase pathways and intrinsic resistance of a subset of cells in the larger_population combination of kinase_inhibitors could limit development of these resistance pathways and dramatically improve v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com cancer_therapy in order for combination_therapy to be more widely_adopted new systems approaches are needed to prioritize target combinations for experimental_validation before targeted kinase_inhibitor therapies can be applied kinase dependency within a cancer cell needs to be established highthroughput pharmacological screening is a powerful method for determining kinase dependency however due to unexpected drug kinase interactions polypharmacology target deconvolution for drug_screening data remains a challenge in chemical systems_biology moreover highly_expressed kinases are not always effective molecular_targets in cancer unfortunately the large number off target interactions of most kinase_inhibitors can lead to misinterpretation of drug_screening results for example the commonly_reported targets of fda_approved drug bosutinib are src and abl however bosutinib also inhibits another kinases by more than inhibition at nm while this poses a challenge for target deconvolution it also provides a unique_opportunity to study the effects of a more comprehensive set of kinases as well as combinations of kinases in a given screen as quantitative kinase inhibition data is becoming increasingly available it can be used to better identify critical kinases following drug screens here we developed kinase addiction ranker kar an algorithm that integrates high_throughput drug_screening data comprehensive kinase inhibition data and gene_expression to determine kinase dependency in cancer_cells this algorithm was inspired by previous work using kinase inhibition profiles and drug_sensitivity data to predict kinase targets for leukemia patients using publicly_available data we demonstrated the utility of kar in ranking kinase targets for lung_cancer cell_lines and used statistical clustering to group cell_lines by kinase dependency we experimentally_validated kar predictions for nonsmall_cell cell_line h we also applied this approach to previously published_data from leukemia patient samples we developed and validated kar a novel algorithm to improve interpretation of high_throughput drug screens by incorporating comprehensive drug kinase binding_profiles and transcriptomics_data kar takes_advantage of drug polypharmacology to study a larger variety of kinases as well as combinations of kinases two major factors that could influence kar data analysis are the i number of effective drugs and ii diversity of drug_targets influential kinases cannot be rapidly identified without multiple inhibitors in your drug set that target a given kinase the kar percent effective scores from a preliminary screen can be used to identify kinases with potential associations with drug_sensitivity for further analysis with other drugs moreover many kinase pairs are uncommonly inhibited together e g fgfr and mtor and must be hypothesized based on the single kinase scores while our algorithm most directly applies to studying kinase dependence it could be easily modified to study other targets if inhibition data for these targets is available other approaches have been developed that use overlap in drug kinase profiles to identify key targets gujral et_al used principal_component to identify an optimal set of kinase_inhibitors for profiling and then used elastic_net regularization to identify key kinases influencing cell_migration similar to kar they also used gene_expression data to filter kinases from analysis tran et_al also applied elastic_net regression to identify important kinases for cancer_cell following an in vitro screen another algorithm based on set theory uses drug_screen data and kinase_inhibitor profiles to predict the most influential kinases and produce circuit diagrams illustrating if the kinase is effective inhibited alone or if it needs to be inhibited with other kinases compared to these approaches kar benefits from producing straightforward scores and p values that could be readily interpreted by scientists without computational backgrounds moreover the drug lists do not need preliminary optimization as chi_square and fishers_exact p values take differences in the number of inhibitors that target each kinases and the total number of sensitive drugs into account we applied kar to leukemia patient samples profiled with kinase_inhibitors demonstrating the applicability of the tool for predicting patient therapy given resource limitations when working with patient samples it may not be possible to screen patient biopsies with large_numbers of compounds therefore future_studies could benefit greatly from prior optimization of the set of drugs used for profiling one recent example of this is gujral et_al s use of principal_component to reduce the number of kinase_inhibitors profiled to an optimal set of from moreover instead of using ic measurements of drug_sensitivity which requires measurements at multiple concentrations experimental_validation of kar prediction of fgfr and mtor dependence for lung_cancer cell_line h a nm ponatinib fgfr inhibitor and azd mtor_inhibitor were applied to h cells and cell_proliferation was measured with the cyquant assay_kit the combination of ponatinib and azd was synergistic by bliss independence additive prediction actual bar graphs display mean percent of control poc sem b western_blots showing changes in signaling with ponatinib azd and the combo ponatinib decreases erk_activation and azd decreases signaling downstream of mtor c signaling_network diagram for pathways targeted by ponatinib and azd in h cell_viability measurements at single concentrations can be considered kar was inspired by a previous algorithm implemented using excel visual basic and macro code compared to the tyner algorithm we introduced tiering score values based on drug_sensitivity instead of target inhibition strength percent effective scores optional incorporation of gene_expression data stronger penalties for insensitive drugs and calculation of p values we also made the algorithm more accessible by providing matlab and python functions calculation of p values helps decrease potential for false_positives as kinases targeted by more drugs have the potential for higher raw scores incorporation of gene_expression data helps ensure that highly ranked kinases are translationally meaningful moreover we found that tiering kinase scores based on target inhibition strength instead of drug_sensitivity resulted in much lower percent effective scores indicating that weaker targets of the inhibitors may not be accurate indicators of kinase dependency in the samples moreover a single threshold for kinase inhibition allows for easier incorporation of kinase inhibition data from multiple_platforms with different inhibition measurement types e g percent inhibition compared to control k d and ic allowing for more drugs to be included in analysis we believe that integrating high_throughput drug_screening data and in vitro kinome inhibition data as demonstrated in this study could be a useful systems approach to identify novel targets and kinase dependency in cancer_cells
