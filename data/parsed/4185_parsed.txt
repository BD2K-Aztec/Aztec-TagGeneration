semi_supervised multi task learning for predicting interactions between hiv and human proteins motivation proteinprotein_interactions ppis are critical for virtually every biological_function recently researchers suggested to use supervised_learning for the task of classifying pairs of proteins as interacting or not however its performance is largely restricted by the availability of truly interacting_proteins labeled meanwhile there exists a considerable amount of protein pairs where an association appears between two partners but not enough experimental_evidence to support it as a direct interaction partially labeled results we propose a semi_supervised multi task framework for predicting ppis from not only labeled but also partially labeled reference sets the basic idea is to perform multi task learning on a supervised_classification task and a semi_supervised auxiliary task the supervised classifier trains a multi_layer perceptron network for ppi predictions from labeled examples the semi_supervised auxiliary task shares network layers of the supervised classifier and trains with partially labeled examples semi supervision could be utilized in multiple_ways we tried three approaches in this article i classification to distinguish partial positives with negatives ii ranking to rate partial positive more likely than negatives iii embedding to make data clusters get similar labels we applied this framework to improve the identification of interacting pairs between hiv and human proteins our method improved upon the state of the art method for this task indicating the benefits of semi_supervised multi task learning using auxiliary information identifying proteinprotein_interactions ppis in a comprehensive manner is essential for understanding the molecular_basis biological_functions because of their importance in development and disease ppis have been the subject of intense research in recent_years both computationally and experimentally experimental_techniques for detecting ppis have been reviewed in shoemaker and panchenko a traditionally ppis have been studied individually through the use of genetic biochemical and biophysical experimental_techniques also termed small_scale methods experiments in this paradigm are typically expensive_and months for detecting just one ppi in recent_years large_scale biological ppi experiments have been introduced to directly detect hundreds_or of protein interactions at a time the two hybrid y h screens and complex to whom correspondence should be addressed purification detection techniques using mass_spectrometry are the two most popular approaches thus far applied successfully on a large_scale however their resulting data_sets are often incomplete and exhibit high false_positive von computational_methods have been successfully_applied to predict protein interactions reviewed in taking_into that indirect sources may contain partial evidence about protein interations several approaches derive their predictions on particular types of information such as overrepresented domain pairs in interacting_proteins an alternative attractive approach is to integrate various indirect or direct sources of evidence in a statistical_learning framework a classifier is trained to distinguish between positive examples of truly interacting_protein and negative_examples of non interacting pairs various methods have been explored in this framework including naive_bayes classifier by decision_tree from kernel based_methods from ben hur and noble and random_forest based method logistic_regression and the strategies of summing likelihood_ratio scores most of these studies have been carried_out in yeast or human they aimed to predict ppis within a single_organism termed intra species ppi prediction recent work extends to predicting ppis between organisms inter_species ppi prediction especially between host and pathogens extended the supervised_learning framework to predict ppis between hiv and human proteins a random_forest based_classifier was used to integrate_multiple biological information_sources and defined the state of art performance for this task additionally studied hostpathogen ppis using structural_information later searched for host protein motifs along virus protein_sequences to obtain a list of host_proteins highly_enriched with those targeted by hiv proteins while the supervised framework was shown to enrich current ppi data with additional inferred ppis its applicability is still limited supervised ppi detection requires a large number of labeled training examples truely interacting_proteins in order for the statistical classifier to predict with proper accuracy except several well studied organisms such as yeast or human most inter or intraspecies ppi prediction tasks do not have a large number of reliable ppis available as training data for instance no reliable global set of interacting pairs exist between hiv and human proteins see section this limitation largely restricts the prediction ability of current computational ppi algorithms to conquer thisproblem predicting protein interactions between hiv organge squre and human gray circle there exist weakly labeled interaction pairs from niaid dashed blue edges and labeled interaction pairs from experts annotation solid blue edges we aim to predict whether a given unknown human to hiv protein pair dashed green interacts or not limitation recently semi_supervised approaches were proposed for computational ppi predictions yip andproposed to improve supervised predictions by adding pseudo examples from previous runs of predictions however the predictions are prone to noise using this strategy it is sometimes possible to infer a relatively larger number of potentially interacting_proteins which may not have enough evidence to be confirmed as true_positive labels for instance in the task of predicting ppis between hiv and human proteins niaid database retrieved protein pairs between hiv protein and human protein from the scientific_literature details in section the extracted pairs are not experimentally confirmed ppis but are very likely to have interaction relationships from a machine_learning perspective these pairs are weakly labeled positive examples see in this case an interesting question to ask is how to detect and add weakly labeled pairs to improve computational ppi predictions in this article we present a multi task learning framework to make use of weakly labeled examples together with conventionally labeled ppi pairs a semi_supervised task is introduced in a network consisting of multiple layer perceptron as an auxiliary task we train supervised ppi classification and the semi_supervised auxiliary task under the same network simultaneously we apply our method to predict the set of interacting_proteins between hiv and human proteins by information integration of multiple biological_sources our method improves upon the previous approach applied for this task the results indicate that with the proposed semi_supervised multi task approach auxiliary information weak labels is able to improve the accuracy of the predictive_models for ppis between hiv and human proteins the rest of the article is structured as follows section_describes the task of predicting ppis between hiv and human proteins and the available interacting data_set in more details section_describes the semi_supervised multi task learning framework section_presents the experimental_results
