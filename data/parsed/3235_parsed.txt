data_and network clustering probing biological_heterogeneity by sparse graphical models_motivation networks and pathways are important in describing the collective biological_function of molecular_players such as genes or proteins in many areas of biology for example in cancer studies available data may harbour undiscovered subtypes which differ in terms of network phenotype that is samples may be heterogeneous with respect to underlying molecular_networks this motivates a need for unsupervised methods capable of discovering such subtypes and elucidating the corresponding network_structures results we exploit recent results in sparse graphical_model learning to put forward a network clustering approach in which data are partitioned into subsets that show evidence of underlying subset level network_structure this allows us to simultaneously learn subset specific networks and corresponding subset membership under challenging small sample conditions we illustrate this approach on synthetic and proteomic_data availability networks and pathways are important in understanding the collective biological_function of molecular_components such as genes or proteins the importance of network based thinking in current biology has motivated a rich body of work in bioinformatics on modelling approaches for biological_networks including networks involved in gene_regulation and protein signalling including most studies have focused on the case in which biochemical data are treated as homogeneous with respect to an underlying biological network_structure that is the assumption is made that a single network model is broadly appropriate for a given set of data this is a reasonable_approach in many cases where it is clear that biological_samples share overall phenotype or where data can be filtered into roughly homogeneous_groups using appropriate markers however in many scenarios available data may contain subtypes which differ to whom correspondence should be addressed in terms of underlying network_structure a topical example comes from cancer_biology molecular studies have revealed a number of subtypes of cancer that have been found to differ markedly in terms of both biology and response to treatment the genomic_aberrations harboured by such subtypes may in turn be manifested in terms of differences in gene regulatory or protein signalling_networks in settings where subtypes have already been characterized this observation may simply motivate stratification by subtype in advance of network modelling or supervised network based_approaches e g however when such biological_heterogeneity has not been characterized a priori this is not possible moreover if there are hitherto_unknown subtypes which differ at the level of network_structure discovering the subtypes and elucidating their corresponding networks itself becomes an important biological goal this article develops an unsupervised analysis called network clustering which seeks to partition data that is heterogeneous in the sense described above into subsets showing evidence of shared underlying network_structure this is an approach which we believe has broad utility for example in the study of human_diseases it is becoming clear that traditional diagnostic classifications may in many cases understate underlying molecular_heterogeneity often with therapeutic_consequences indeed in the cancer arena the task of discovering cancer_subtypes and developing treatment regimes that are subtype specific is emerging as one of crucial importance of course biological subtypes may differ dramatically at the level of mean response say in terms of gene or protein expression in such cases existing clustering_methods are well suited to probing heterogeneity and have successfully done so in many studies and indeed a small number of key biomarkers may be sufficient to discover and discriminate subtypes but when differences are truly at the network or pathway level conventional clustering_approaches are likely to prove inadequate for reasons we discuss below however the network clustering problem stated here is a challenging one network inferencefrom a single homogeneous datasetitself remains a non trivial task and the subject of much ongoing work the learning of network_structure within an unsupervised framework is doubly challenging because multiple rounds of network_inference are likely to be needed often at small_sample in the same way that a standard clustering method typically involves multiple rounds of estimation on data subsets or soft equivalents thereof we discuss below how we address these concerns by using undirected graphical_models and exploiting recent work on penalized inference the manner in which molecular_players vary in concert i e their covariance is central to the statistical description of the networkswe show results on synthetic data mixed data in which phosphoproteomic data were combined with synthetic data and on proteomic_data obtained from cancer_cell that are part of the nci panel we are interested in examining the ability of penalized network clustering to carry out two related_tasks first to discover data subsets defined by network_structure i e to cluster with respect to underlying covariance_structure second to recover such subsetspecific network_structure we assess the performance on both tasks below
