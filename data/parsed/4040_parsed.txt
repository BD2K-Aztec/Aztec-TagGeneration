bioinformatics_discovery gene_expression rna_seq differential_expression studies more sequence or more replication motivation rna_seq is replacing microarrays as the primary tool for gene_expression studies many rna_seq studies have used insufficient biological_replicates resulting in low_statistical and inefficient use of sequencing resources results we show the explicit trade_off between more biological rep licates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially_expressed de genes in the human cell_line mcf adding more sequencing_depth after m reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect de genes whereas adding biological_replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing_depth we also propose a cost_effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large_scale rna_seq de studies our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large_scale differential_expression rna_seq studies and provided new insights into efficient experiment_design of rna_seq studies rna_seq has been widely used for differential_expression studies despite the large number of studies performed for transcriptome comparisons little empirical optimization has been made for rna_seq based experimental_designs critical issues include biological replication and sequencing_depth and inefficient designs of rna_seq studies can lead to suboptimal power and waste of resources especially in large_scale treatment control studies although for most rna_seq studies high technical reproducibility means that technical_replicates are not necessary this fact does not ameliorate the need for biological_replicates in making statistical inferences yet frequently large_scale rna_seq studies with extensive differential_expression have used limited biological replication instead favoring a strategy of low_level biological replication with deep_sequencing e g in addition to replication number the choice for sequencing_depth is often unguided it is clear that higher sequencing_depth generates more informational reads which increases the statistical_power differentially_expressed de genes however high sequencing_depth comes with cost and resources will be wasted in scenarios where more sequencing brings diminishing returns as a saturation_level is approached to achieve maximum power to detect de genes within a budget a compromise must be made between sequencing_depth and biological replication there are a few previous_studies on experimental design_issues for rna_seq studies but they do not empirically address the specific question raised here of the trade_offs in power between replication sequencing_depth and cost should we sequence more samples with low depth or should we sequence fewer samples with high depth we conclude that in a typical de study using rna_seq sequencing deeper for each sample generates diminishing returns for power of detecting de genes once beyond a certain sequencing_depth instead increasing the number of biological replications consistently increases the power significantly regardless of sequencing_depth additionally estimation accuracy for logfc and absolute expression levels greatly improve across the board when more biological_replicates are added whereas sequencing_depth improves the accuracy of these estimations only in some situations so when possible using more biological replication with lower sequencing_depth instead of sequencing few samples in great depth is a more efficient strategy for rna_seq de studies in the specific case of mcf breast_cancer cell samples our cost metric suggests that sequencing m reads sample gives diminishing returns compared with adding replication obviously for other species and perhaps other samples such as heterogeneous tumor_samples the exact sequencing_depth will be different but the overall guideline of replication rather than deeper sequencing should still remain a similar set of standard_curves could be constructed for each type of sample to guide experimental_designs particularly for large_scale genomic studies where optimization for cost_effectiveness can have a significant impact almost all individual laboratories are mindful of budgets but the stakes are particularly high in studies such as encyclopedia of dna elements encode or the cancer_genome tcga where millions of dollars are being spent on sequencing we have focused on differential_expression studies using rnaseq with the aim to improve a single target power to detect de genes between samples of course there are cases where sequencing deeply is advantageous such as differential_expression of exons and transcript specific expression in these applications much higher sequencing_depths are required because the informative genomic_regions are much shorter however if gene differential_expression is the primary goal it would be a sensible choice to optimize sequencing_depth and number of biological_replicates according to the simple guidelines we propose here
