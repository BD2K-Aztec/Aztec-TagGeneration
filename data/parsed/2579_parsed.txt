data_and isocor correcting ms data in isotope labeling experiments mass_spectrometry ms is widely used for isotopic_labeling studies of metabolism and other biological_processes quantitative applicationse g metabolic_flux analysisrequire tools to correct the raw ms data for the contribution of all naturally abundant isotopes isocor is a software that allows such correction to be applied to any chemical_species hence it can be used to exploit any isotopic tracer from well known c n o etc to unusual fe se etc isotopes it also provides new featurese g correction for the isotopic purity of the tracerto improve the accuracy of quantitative isotopic studies and implements an efficient algorithm to process large_datasets its user_friendly interface makes isotope labeling experiments more accessible to a wider biological community availability isocor is distributed under opensource license atmass spectrometry ms is extensively used for stable isotopic studies of metabolism during the last decade quantitative approachessuch as c metabolic_flux analysishave been increasingly used in the fields of systems_biology and biotechnology to provide novel biological_insights and improve industrial processes in such experiments the different labeled formsor isotopologuesof metabolites are quantified by the fine exploitation of isotopic clusters in ms spectra these clusters also contain information on all other isotopes that occur naturally in the molecules to extract meaningful labeling informationi e isotopologue distributionthe contribution of naturally_occurring isotopes first has to be subtracted this can be achieved using publicly_available software such as mscorr developed under matlab or the algorithm developed in perl by however the former software is only applicable to c labeling experiments and the latter is restricted to the correction of ultra_high ms data for natural abundance of c or n here we present a novel software to correct ms data isocor which includes the following features for molecules containing a high number of atoms the number of possible combinations to be calculated is high which can cause a bottleneck in the correction process in probability theory the probability_distribution of the sum of independent_variables is the convolution of their individual distributions therefore the calculation can be performed faster by iteratively convolving the isotopic vectors v a p a p a x of all the atomsexcept those of the label tracerwhere p a x denotes the natural abundance of the x th isotope of the atom a finally the contribution of the tracer is added by convolving the previous isotopic cluster i times by the purity vector of the tracer e g for a purity of and n i times by its natural abundance e g in a c labeling experiment when it has to be corrected
