hierarchical boosting a machine_learning framework to detect and classify hard selective_sweeps in human populations downloaded from motivation detecting positive_selection in genomic_regions is a recurrent topic in natural_population genetic_studies however there is little consistency among the regions detected in several genome_wide using different tests and or populations furthermore few methods address the challenge of classifying selective events according to specific features such as age intensity or state completeness results we have developed a machine_learning classification_framework that exploits the combined ability of some selection tests to uncover different polymorphism features expected under the hard sweep model while controlling for population specific demography as a result we achieve high_sensitivity toward hard selective_sweeps while adding insights about their completeness whether a selected variant is fixed or not and age of onset our method also determines the relevance of the individual methods implemented so_far to detect positive_selection under specific selective scenarios we calibrated and applied the method to three reference human populations from the genome_project to generate a genome_wide classification map of hard selective_sweeps this study improves detection of selective_sweep by overcoming the classical selection versus no selection classification strategy and offers an explanation to the lack of consistency observed among selection tests when applied to real_data very few signals were observed in the african_population studied while our method presents higher sensitivity in this population demography availability_and the genome_wide results for three human populations from the genomes_project and an r package implementing the hierarchical boosting framework are available atover the past_decades many different methods to detect positive_selection from polymorphism data in genomic_regions have been developed for reviews see such methods rely on the different genomic patterns left by a hypothetical selection event occurring in an idealized population a beneficial de_novo mutation arises and increases in frequency in relatively few generations until eventually it reaches population fixation this specific mode of positive_selection is known as the hard sweep model maynard through the effect of genetic hitchhiking this process leaves some characteristic_patterns in the region_surrounding the beneficial allele selective_sweep such as skewed site_frequency toward low_frequency variants strong linkage_disequilibrium ld patterns leading to extended haplotype homozigosity ehh and population_differentiation computational_methods developed to distinguish such patterns have helped to identify the genetic_basis of some examples of human adaptation such as the lactase_persistence allele or the malaria resistance gene variants however most of those methods usually lack consistency in reporting the same selective events along the genome causing a loss of confidence in the approach this disagreement was thought to appear due to specific power of the different methods to uncover selection patterns under some local_features of a given genomic_region such as specific recombination map or due to specific demographic dynamics of the studied_populations thus during the last decade special effort was made to incorporate population specific demographic models and region specific recombination maps to approximate the neutral model to more complex and realistic scenarios while these approaches clearly improve the sensitivity to detect positive_selection they did not explain the continued lack of concordance between methods which raised concerns on false_positive recently a new family of selection tests started to appear statistics based on composite approaches combining different positive_selection tests and tuned using neutral and selection simulations individual_tests are sensitive to different modes and tempos of adaptation according to the specific molecular pattern they are aimed to identify however individual positive_selection tests and most of the composite methods implemented so_far address the selection analysis as a binary classification_problem i e selection versus no selection ignoring the specific features of the analyzed selective_sweeps such as the extent of completeness i e final frequency of the selected allele or the time depth of the event recent versus ancient selective events in this study we developed a hierarchical classification_framework based on a boosting algorithm using a similar approach to that presented in to scan the whole_genome for several evolutive scenarios we trained the algorithm with simulations under different selective scenarios considering different final allele_frequencies faf for the selected allele completeness of a selective_sweep and with different timespanning selective events age of a selective_sweep we demonstrate that our approach achieves high_sensitivity toward general hard selective_sweeps and can provide information about their relative age of onset once calibrated we applied it to empirical genome_wide data from the genomes_project the genomes_project consortium we provide the results of our analysis for three continental human populations as ucsc tracks that can be easily loaded in any ucsc_genome server and an r package implementing the hierarchical boosting framework http hsb upf edu we detected a fold and fold decrease in significant signals in the african_population as compared with the european and east_asian respectively while our method showed better sensitivity in african_ancestry simulations
