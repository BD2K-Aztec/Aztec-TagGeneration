genome_analysis a distance based test of association between paired heterogeneous genomic_data motivation due to rapid technological_advances a wide_range of different measurements can be obtained from a given biological_sample including single_nucleotide copy_number gene_expression levels dna_methylation and proteomic profiles each of these distinct measurements provides the means to characterize a certain aspect of biological_diversity and a fundamental problem of broad interest concerns the discovery of shared patterns of variation across different data types such data types are heterogeneous in the sense that they represent measurements taken at different scales or represented by different data_structures results we propose a distance based statistical_test the generalized rv grv test to assess whether there is a common and non random_pattern of variability between paired biological measurements obtained from the same random_sample the measurements enter the test through the use of two distance measures which can be chosen to capture a particular aspect of the data an approximate null_distribution is proposed to compute p values in closed form and without the need to perform costly monte_carlo permutation procedures compared with the classical mantel test for association between distance_matrices the grv test has been found to be more powerful in a number of simulation_settings we also demonstrate how the grv test can be used to detect biological_pathways in which genetic_variability is associated to variation in gene_expression levels in an ovarian_cancer sample and present results obtained from two independent cohorts a proliferation in the development and application of highthroughput measurement platforms in biological_research has resulted in the increasing availability of multiple levels of molecular data available for the same biological sampling units for a range of human tumour_types for instance the cancer_genome tcga consortium have made available genome_wide snp genotypes dna_copy genome_wide gene and mrna_expression dna_methylation and proteomic profiles as well as a range of mutation calls arising from deep_sequencing such comprehensive molecular_profiling of biological sampling units provides opportunities for gaining insight into the mechanisms by which different molecular_entities interact with one another to influence the overall state of the cell s in question this is possible through comparing the different types of observations on each biological sampling unit via some means of paired analysis of the individual_datasets a certain degree of complexity is inherent in this type of analysis because the measurements that are being compared are heterogeneous one well studied example of the task of analysing paired heterogeneous_biological data is gene_expression quantitative_trait eqtl_mapping which seeks to find associations between snps and transcript_expression a particularly interesting application of multivariate eqtl_mapping relates to the discovery of association between biomarkers for ovarian_cancer which is treated as a case study in this work the application of paired analysis of heterogeneous_biological data types is not limited to eqtl_mapping and involves the common problem of discovering shared patterns of variation across different biological measurements other areas that have seen considerable interest include the association of genetic copy_number with gene_expression levels and identification of genes for which dna_methylation is associated to gene_expression in these and related studies the problem of comparing heterogeneous data types can be approached using a notion of distance between pairs of biological_samples distances are scalar valued measures of dissimilarity between two input observations with greater values indicating greater dissimilarity between them for a given application a suitable semi metric or metric distance measure can generally be defined depending on the nature of the data and on the specific_objectives of the study such distances computed between all pair_wise combinations of samples are arranged in square symmetric matrices these matrices then quantify the variability in the random_sample according to that particular distance measure and can be directly compared using an appropriate statistical_test distance based_approaches offer a number of advantages compared with direct comparisons involving the original measurements firstly distances can overcome limitations of to whom correspondence should be addressed traditional multivariate approaches when dealing with highdimensional random vectors observed on a much smaller number of sampling units secondly distance measures can be appropriately defined for data generated under different experimental_conditions and are not confined to data types represented only by vectors a number of distance measures are readily available for several types of biological data including dna_sequences genetic_markers such as snps gene_expression data longitudinal gene_expression data and proteins moreover for a specific data type more than one distance measure can be deployed to capture different aspects of the data this can ultimately lead to the discovery of different types of associations it should be noted however that in the case of multivariate measurements interpretation with respect to individual variables is lost because we are interested in the combined behaviour of all variables comprising such vectorial measurements we do not consider this issue further only a handful of statistical_procedures are currently available to determine_whether there is an association between paired distance_matrices and they all rely on computationally_intensive procedures for statistical_inference the most commonly used and well known procedure is the mantel test a generalization of pearsons_correlation the test has already been found useful in many applications arising in bioinformatics this testing procedure however has some limitations firstly when used to compare paired scalar valued observations using the euclidean_distance the test exhibits less power than pearsons_correlation test i e it is a poor test of the null_hypothesis of no correlation between scalar valued variables secondly computationally_intensive monte_carlo permutations are required to assess significance this procedure which assumes exchangeability of the sampling units under the null_hypothesis of no association introduces sampling errors that leads to inaccurate estimation of small p values this is especially true when too few permutations are used generally between o and o for example to obtain a permutation p value within of a true p value of it has been shown that o permutations are required which is computationally infeasible without access to specialized high performance computational_resources this is the case in all situations where thousands or even millions of tests are required such as in eqtl_mapping studies in which the entire_genome is scanned in search of potential associations in such large_scale applications it is not uncommon to settle for a much smaller number of monte_carlo permutations per test which in turn can lead to inflated familywise type_i in this article we propose a novel test the generalized rv grv test to detect association between paired distance_matrices this test is derived as a generalization of the classical multivariate rv test of no correlation between paired random vectors originally proposed by escoufier while inference can be performed via computationally_intensive monte_carlo permutations we also derive an approximation to the exact null_distribution which would be obtained by enumerating all permutations using the proposed null_distribution approximate p values can be estimated in closed form without the need for computationally_intensive procedures the proposed grv test is introduced in section in section we describe power studies showing that the grv test can offer_greater statistical_power than that achieved by the mantel test even when many millions of monte_carlo permutations are performed section_presents an application of the grv test in cancer research where the interest lies in detecting biological_pathways characterized by a non random association between genetic and gene_expression sample variability concluding_remarks are presented in section in this work we have presented the grv test as a novel procedure to detect association between paired distance_matrices which is applicable in any setting where suitable distance measures can be defined similarly to the widely used mantel test the grv test can be directly applied whether the distance measures are metric or semi metric but overcomes the limitation of the mantel test that where paired data is vector valued a hypothesis of no correlation between the vectors of interest can be tested as a further advantage of the grv test over existing distance based tests an approximate null_distribution is proposed such that inference can be performed without expensive monte_carlo permutation procedures through extensive simulations we have demonstrated that the grv test achieves greater_power than the popular mantel test this greater_power is exhibited even when many millions of permutations are used for the mantel test thus demonstrating its suitability as a tool for use in multiple testing settings were many tests need to be simultaneously performed the grv test was applied to paired ovarian_cancer datasets in which genome_wide profiles of snp genotypes and gene_expression levels were available for each patient across two independent cohorts n and n the paired datasets were split into subsets in which the features all mapped to the same pathway using mappings from the consensus pathway db so that each grv test result would indicate the statistical_significance of the similarity between the tumour wise distance_matrix derived from the genotype data and the distance_matrix derived from the gene_expression data for each cohort a meta_analysis was performed across the grv test results from different combinations of distance measures and the pathways were ranked according to their significance across all distance measures permutation_based estimates of the significance of the overlapbetween the ranked lists of pathways from the two independent cohorts revealed a highly_significant agreement in the two rankings indicating a degree of robustness in the results of our analysis this application of the grv test has demonstrated that the transcriptional_activity of a number of pathways seem to be reliably predicted by sequencing a limited set of genetic_markers that could be detected in circulating tumour dna obtained from patients serum this relationship was particularly pronounced for the pathway aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis for which the genotypes and the gene_expression were strikingly associated in two independent cohorts of patients the association between genotypes and pathway level gene_expression is of particular interest in the case of the platinum response pathway which is clearly clinically_important in eoc given that the only standard treatment involves platinum_based following further investigation these observations could potentially lead to development of non_invasive biomarkers that could predict patient response to front line chemotherapy and serve to stratify patients for selection into clinical_trials involving alternative treatments as individual distance measures can yield different results in the analysis of associations across gene_expression unless a single distance measure is selected a priori as the most appropriate for each dataset combining results of multiple tests of association using different distance measures may provide more reliable results than a single test a key_advantage of the grv test in our application to multivariate eqtl_mapping of pathways in ovarian_cancer is that it enables a meta_analysis of the associations between genetic_distance and gene_expression distance for different combinations of distance measures having a test for these associations that does not require expensive permutations enables a fast estimation of the robustness of the genotype expression pathway level associations against quirks of particular definitions of distance given the robust associations discovered in this analysis we suggest that it may be possible to predict the mode of activation of a pathway in terms of which members are transcriptionally activated in cancer patients based on the genotype of the tumours dna across a limited panel of snps
