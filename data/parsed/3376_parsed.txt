structural_bioinformatics optimized atomic statistical_potentials assessment of protein interfaces and loops motivation statistical_potentials have been widely used for modeling whole proteins and their parts e g sidechains and loops as well as interactions between proteins nucleic_acids and small_molecules here we formulate the statistical_potentials entirely within a statistical_framework avoiding questionable statistical_mechanical assumptions and approximations including a definition of the reference_state results we derive a general bayesian_framework for inferring statistically optimized atomic potentials soap in which the reference_state is replaced with data_driven recovery functions moreover we restrain the relative orientation between two covalent_bonds instead of a simple distance between two atoms in an effort to capture orientation dependent interactions such as hydrogen_bonds to demonstrate this general approach we computed statistical_potentials for proteinprotein_docking soap pp and loop modeling soap loop for docking a near native model is within the top scoring models in of the patchdock benchmark cases compared with and for the state of the art zdock and firedock scoring_functions respectively similarly for modeling residue loops in the plop benchmark the average main_chain root_mean of the best scored conformations by soap loop is a close to the average root_mean of the best sampled conform ations a and significantly better than that selected by rosetta a dfire a dope a and plop scoring_functions a our bayesian_framework may also result in more accurate statistical_potentials for additional modeling applications thus affording better leverage of the experimentally_determined protein_structures availability_and soap pp and soap loop are available as part of modellerwe developed a bayesian_approach to optimizing statistical_potentials based on probability theory and without recourse to questionable statistical_mechanical assumptions and approximations we also applied this approach to calculate optimized statistical_potentials for assessing protein interactions soappp and loops soap loop these two statistical_potentials perform better than others in their class for patchdock and zdock decoys the top success_rate of soap pp is higher than that of firedock and zrank for residue loops in the plop benchmark the average main_chain rmsd of the best scored conformations by soap loop is a close to the average rmsd of the best sampled conformations a and significantly better than that from dope a dfire a rosetta a and plop scoring_functions a the relative accuracy of soap pp and soap loop results primarily from normalizing the raw distributions by the recovery functions instead of a reference_state restraining of orientation instead of only distance and thoroughly optimizing parameter_values while avoiding overfitting next we discuss three points in turn first we describe our recovery functions and compare them with the reference states used for other statistical_potentials second we discuss the importance of restraining orientation and using covalent separation as an independent variable finally we conclude by commenting on future improvements of our bayesian_approach and its applications
