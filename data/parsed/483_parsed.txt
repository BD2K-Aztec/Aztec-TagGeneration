sequence_analysis a robust model for read count_data in exome sequencing_experiments and implications for copy_number variant_calling motivation exome_sequencing has proven to be an effective tool to discover the genetic_basis of mendelian_disorders it is well established that copy_number cnvs contribute to the etiology of these disorders however calling cnvs from exome_sequence is challenging a typical read_depth strategy consists of using another sample or a combination of samples as a reference to control for the variability at the capture and sequencing steps however technical variability between samples complicates the analysis and can create spurious cnv_calls results here we introduce exomedepth a new cnv_calling algorithm designed to control for this technical variability exomedepth uses a robust model for the read count_data and uses this model to build an optimized reference_set in order to maximize the power to detect_cnvs as a result exomedepth is effective across a wider_range of exome datasets than the previously existing_tools even for small e g one to two exons and heterozygous deletions we used this new approach to analyse exome data from patients with primary_immunodeficiencies depending on data_quality and the exact target_region we find between and exonic cnv_calls per sample our analysis identified two novel causative deletions in the genes gata and dock availability the code used in this analysis has been implemented into an r package called exomedepth and is available at the comprehensive_r cran the improvement of dna_sequencing in recent_years has radically changed the identification of genetic_variants associated with human_diseases and in particular rare_disorders the use of sequence capture technologies to target protein_coding in the human_genome followed by high_throughput known as exome_sequencing currently provides a cost efficient approach to discover causal_mutations in patients with mendelian_disorders the majority of published work using exome_sequence focuses on single_nucleotide snps or small insertions_deletions indels mostly because short_read dna_sequencing are best suited to call these variants nevertheless copy_number cnvs e g larger chromosomal indels also significantly contribute to the aetiology of mendelian_disorders three general strategies exist to call cnvs from short_read split_reads paired_end and read_depth approaches read_depth analysis is particularly effective for exome data as it does not rely on sequencing into or near the cnv breakpoints generally_speaking read_depth based_approaches for cnv_calling compare the number of reads mapping to a chromosome window with its expectation under a statistical_model deviations from this expectation are indicative of cnv_calls similar to the array_comparative acgh methodology the ratio of read_count between a test and a reference_sample is usually preferred to a single sample analysis in order to control for the typically extensive variability in capture efficiency across exons most of the existing_tools for cnv_calling that are based on read_depth such as exomecnv and cnv seq make gaussian assumptions about the distribution of read count_ratio in the absence of technical variability the proportion of reads matching to a specific sample should follow a binomial_distribution whose success_rate is determined by genome_wide read count_ratio between the test sample and the reference_set as well as the potential presence of cnvs additional covariates such as gc_content can alter this success_rate in situations where the effects of these covariates vary across samples here we evaluate two different exome sequence_datasets and show that gaussian assumptions generally do not hold technical variability at the library_preparation capture and sequencing creates noise that affects the numbers of reads matching to to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an

particular exons in a sample specific_manner as a result the observed variance exceeds what is predicted by a binomial model that affects the cnv_calls motivated by this observation we propose a modified and more robust statistical_framework for cnv_calling we apply this model to provide guidelines for the construction of an optimized reference sequence_dataset for cnv_calling purposes as well as realistic power estimates we find that two main factors improve statistical_power increasing the read_depth and controlling for any source of technical variability across samples at the capture and sequencing steps we have developed and coded a new set of tools in an r package called exomedepth we then illustrated its efficiency by discovering novel small causative cnvs in two patients with primary_immunodeficiencies a heterozygous_deletion of two exons of the gata_gene and a single_exon homozygous_deletion in the dock gene
