classifying short gene_expression time courses with bayesian_estimation of piecewise_constant functions motivation analyzing short time courses is a frequent and relevant problem in molecular_biology as for example of gene_expression time course experiments span at most nine time points the biological or clinical_questions addressed are elucidating gene_regulation by identification of co expressed genes predicting response to treatment in clinical trial like settings or classifying novel toxic_compounds based on similarity of gene_expression time courses to those of known toxic_compounds the latter problem is characterized by irregular and infrequent sample times and a total lack of prior assumptions about the incoming query which comes in stark_contrast to clinical_settings and requires to implicitly perform a local gapped_alignment of time series the current state of the art method scow uses a variant of dynamic time warping and models time series as higher_order polynomials splines results we suggest to model time courses monitoring response to toxins by piecewise_constant functions which are modeled as leftright hidden_markov a bayesian_approach to parameter_estimation and inference helps to cope with the short but highly multivariate time courses we improve prediction_accuracy by and respectively when classifying toxicology and stress_response data we also reduce running_times by at least a factor of note that reasonable running_times are crucial when classifying response to toxins in conclusion we have demonstrated that appropriate reduction of model_complexity can result in substantial improvements both in classification_performance and running time availability a python_package implementing the methods described is freely_available under the gpl fromtime course experiments reflecting the dynamics of transcription are among the most intriguing but at the same time one of the most challenging sources of data in molecular_biology intriguing because they offer views of the temporal_dynamics of life at the molecular level we see for example gene_expression change over time in the cell_cycle or on a larger time scale during development as part of the normal regulatory_process we also see changes as a response to an external stimulus leading to a quick_response as in the case of plants exposed to sunlight or a slower response as in disease_progression or an exposure to toxins these dynamic changes and their intricate regulatory_control mechanisms are of fundamental interest in the study of biological_systems with inference of regulatory_mechanisms as a main goal however these time course experiments are also very challenging one of the reasons is rather simple timecourses data in other disciplines such as finance astronomy or climate literally span years at second interval resolution as a consequence it is reasonable to consider the data for all practical purposes continuous under weak assumptions such continuous representations have their advantages when filling in missing_values through interpolation or obtaining future predictions through extrapolation however in gene_expression time courses are often sampled at very low frequencies and at irregular intervals indeed a query in the gene_expression geo database reveals that of all time courses have less than time points implying that the name short time courses is well deserved as a consequence in such cases a discrete time view and a discrete representation might be more appropriate this dichotomy between discrete and continuous view has implications with respect to imputing missing_values taking derivatives or measuring slopes and choosing appropriate functional_classes for fitting and interpolation more generally it determines how appropriate the use of classical tools from timecourses analysis for each specific biological dataset is interpolation might sometimes overstate the case the data make see simply plotting the time courses joined by lines might lead to a false impression of continuous time and a false sense of security in choosing methods undersampling gives biological reasons to question smooth interpolations between gene_expression levels at sparsely sampled time points additionally sampling frequencies often do not allowpage we show the gene_expression time courses of two genes on the left joined by a bspline of order three and as points on the right depicted here are expression measurements for genes and from the data used byafter treatment with mg_kg ketoconazole to monitor the very processes one attempts to understand for example transcriptional on and or offset happens often within h or less in particular as a response to stress and treatment signals while this is sometimes accounted for in the experimental_design see e g yeast_cell data due to it is not economical nor feasible particularly in a clinical_setting to collect samples in minute_intervals over several hours missing the transient part of such gene_expression curvesthe rapid rise and overshoot and sampling the steady_state instead does indeed lead to gene_expression curves which are approximately piecewise_constant also called step functions instead of polynomials of higher degrees short time courses are the predominant form of temporal gene_expression information however their analysis poses particular challenges as short usually translates to infrequent samples often drawn at irregular time intervals the inherent noise is another central concern here we focused on toxicity assays and responses to stress the challenge was to classify incoming short time courses reflecting a response to toxins stress in changes in gene_expression over time by assigning them to existing labeled time courses incoming queries possibly have been sampled at intervals which cannot be straightforwardly aligned with the labeled time course in contrast to prior approaches we opted to have a discrete view on the problem by modeling these time courses as stochastic piecewise_constant functions implemented as hmm with a leftright topology building on an established statistical_framework we estimate_parameters with a bayesian_approach and use maximum_likelihood for classification on the edge experiments we outperform the best known prior approach scow with an increase in accuracy exceeding overall an increase of over over scow for queries with three or more time points clustered alignments only have an advantage of about over scow for such queries on the arabidopsis experiments the increase in accuracy was at the same time our method is at least times_faster to compute we additionally show that a one nearest_neighbor classifier on the genewise time averages of the expression time courses outperforms or matches scow while it is times_faster to compute one reason for our superior_performance is likely the coarse time resolution of queries indeed the method of correlation optimized warpings on which scow is built was developed for as many time points as the average query of length we are dealing with the timecourses of the transcriptional_response rather reflect sequences of steady_states while missing the very dynamics behind them another reason is that scow relies on continuous polynomial time course representations and interpolation in particular the results of nn also indicate that correlation might not be the right objective_function to optimize indeedspend some effort on trying to avoid alignments of high correlation but with large difference page
