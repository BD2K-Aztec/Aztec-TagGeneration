bayesian mixture analysis for metagenomic community profiling motivation deep_sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens with direct medical_applications the large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels provided that computational_tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short_sequencing can match multiple_organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases in particular for viral_pathogens here we present metamix a bayesian mixture_model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures we show that the use of parallel monte_carlo markov_chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture results we demonstrate the greater_accuracy of metamix compared with relevant methods particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species we designed metamix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing_datasets with a focus on viral pathogen_detection however the principles are generally_applicable to all types of metage nomic mixtures availability_and metamix is implemented as a user_friendly r package freely_available on cran http cran r project org_web metamix contact sofia morfopoulou metagenomics can be defined as the study of dna_sequences from environmental or community samples while metatranscriptomics is the analysis of rna sequence_data from such samples the scope of metagenomics metatranscriptomics is broad and includes the analysis of a diverse set of samples such as gut_microbiome environmental or clinical samples among these applications the discovery of viral_pathogens is clearly relevant for clinical practice the traditional process of characterizing a virus through potentially difficult and time consuming culture techniques is being revolutionized by advances in high_throughput potential benefits of sequence driven methodologies include a more rapid turnaround time combined with a largely unbiased approach in species detection including the opportunity for unexpected discoveries the analysis of shotgun sequencing_data from metagenomic mixtures raises complex computational challenges part of the difficulty stems from the read_length limitation of existing deep dnasequencing technologies an issue compounded by the extensive level of homology across viral and bacterial_species another complication is the divergence of the microbial dna_sequences from the publicly_available references as a consequence the assignment of a sequencing read to a database organism is often unclear last the number of reads originating from a disease_causing pathogen can be low the pathogen contribution to the mixture depends on the biological_context the timing of sample_extraction v c the author published_by we first applied metamix on a popular benchmark_dataset for which the community_composition and the read assignment is known we then analyzed rna_seq from two clinical samples that were generated for diagnostic purposes we compare our results with the ones produced by megan version andpathoscope both methods are similarity based this property and more specifically their flexibility to work with blastx output makes them better candidates for viral discovery compared with composition based_methods from the mixture_model methods we have chosen pathoscope we were also interested in comparing our results to the ones by grammy which was the first similaritybased method to use the idea of the mixture_model however grammy is designed for nucleotide nucleotide comparisons blastn which is suboptimal for viral discovery grammy also only considers unassembled reads and requires that these are of the same fixed_length for these reasons grammy was not included in the comparison default_parameters were used for all methods unless stated otherwise for the metamix output we reported organisms with a posterior_probability p default the metamix read support parameter r which essentially sets the sensitivity_specificity of the method has an impact on the number of reported species a large r value can result in the method merging together strains that are differentiated by fewer reads than r on the other hand a low r can have the opposite effect whereby the methods splits a strain into two or more strains by moving a few reads from one strain to a very similar one with which they have equally good matches the users choice for this key_parameter r should be informed by the biological_context as an example for the typical human clinical sample where the sample_collection might have occurred some time after the infection has taken place a low value in order to adopt a sensitive approach is reasonable hence for viral identification in human clinical samples a low and sensitive value r is a reasonable choice in a highly complex environmental metagenomic community where there is a plethora of species of similar abundances the choice becomes less straightforward especially in the case of closely_related strains we set the default value for general_community profiling in environmental_samples at r we also compare the output of metamix for different values of this parameter as well as for different posterior_probability cutoffs supplementary methods presents a discussion on the metamix settings as well as practical_considerations
