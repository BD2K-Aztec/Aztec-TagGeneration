nanook multi reference alignment analysis of nanopore sequencing_data quality and error profiles motivation the oxford nanopore minion sequencer currently in pre release testing through the minion access programme map promises long_reads in real_time from an inexpensive compact usb device tools have been released to extract fasta q from the minion base_calling output and to provide basic yield statistics however no single tool yet exists to provide comprehensive alignment based quality_control and error profile analysissomething that is extremely_important given the speed with which the platform is evolving results nanook generates detailed tabular and graphical output plus an in depth multi page pdf report including error profile quality and yield data nanook is multi reference enabling detailed analysis of metagenomic or multiplexed samples four popular nanopore aligners are supported and it is easily extensible to include others availability_and nanook is an open_source implemented_in with supporting r scripts it has been tested on linux and mac os x and can be downloaded from https github com tgac nanook a virtualbox vm containing all dependencies and the dh b read set used in this article is available from http opendata tgac ac uk nanook a docker image is also available from docker hubsee program documentation https documentation tgac ac uk display nanook the oxford nanopore technologies ont minion is one of the latest of a new generation of single_molecule sequencing_technologies originally revealed at the advances in genome biology and technology conference it arrived in the labs of minion access programme map members in may offering multi kilobase reads the minion attracted interest due to its compact size usb connection relatively inexpensive expected purchase price and a streamed mode of operation that enables analysis of data as it generated though not out of pre release testing the device is in the hands of research groups around the world who are evaluating the performance and suitability of the platform for a wide_range including medical_diagnostics environmental surveillance and de_novo sequencing onts technology involves the detection of current changes across biological nanopores through which dna_molecules move the degree of current change depends on the bases mer present in the pore at any given time and multiple measurements are made as the molecule advances resulting in a characteristic squiggle plot which onts basecalling software metrichor processes to a nucleotide_sequence the minion will read both strands of dna the supplementary_material contains an example nanook report for a run of escherichia_coli k substr dh b produced using an r flow cell the report contains data on the whole run as well as separate sections for each reference in this case control sequence and e coli at the run level data include bullet pre alignment summaryincluding pass fail counts and read_length distributions for template complement and d reads bullet alignment summaryincluding counts of reads aligning to each reference mean length aligned bases coverage bullet substitution analysislike we observe smaller percentage of a to t and t to a substitutions bullet error kmers mers occuring before substitutions insertions_and along with error motif images here we find a high_abundance of low complexity kmers indicative of homopolymer problems as observed in
