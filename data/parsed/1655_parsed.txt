event_extraction across multiple levels of biological_organization motivation event_extraction using expressive structured representations has been a significant focus of recent efforts in biomedical information_extraction however event_extraction resources and methods have so_far focused almost exclusively on molecular level entities and processes limiting their applicability results we extend the event_extraction approach to biomedical information_extraction to encompass all levels of biological_organization from the molecular to the whole organism we present the ontological foundations target types and guidelines for entity and event annotation and introduce the new multi level event_extraction mlee corpus manually_annotated using a structured representation for event_extraction we further adapt and evaluate named entity and event_extraction methods for the new task demonstrating that both can be achieved with performance broadly comparable with that for established molecular entity and event_extraction tasks availability the resources and methods introduced in this study are available from http nactem ac uk mlee a detailed understanding of biological_systems requires the ability to trace cause and effect across multiple levels of biological_organization from molecular level reactions to cellular tissue and organ_level effects to organism level outcomes consequently any effort aiming to comprehensively represent biological_systems must address entities and processes at all of these levels this challenge has so_far been only partially met in biomedical information_extraction ie and text_mining which aim to improve access to domain_knowledge by automating aspects of processing the literature until recently efforts in domain ie were primarily focused on the basic task of recognizing mentions of relevant entities such as genes and proteins in text and on the extraction of pairwise relations between these representing for example protein_protein such representations lack the capacity to capture any but the simplest of associations in recent_years there has been increasing interest in the extraction of structured representations capable of capturing associations of arbitrary numbers of participants in specific roles such approaches to whom correspondence should be addressed to ie frequently termed event_extraction are capable of representing complex associationssuch as the binding of a protein to another inhibiting its localization to a specific cellular compartment and open many new opportunities for domain text_mining applications ranging from semantic search to database and pathway curation support there is significant momentum behind the move to richer representations for ie more than groups have introduced methods for biomedical event_extraction in shared tasks b event annotated corpora have been introduced for many extraction targets including dna_methylation protein_modifications and the molecular_mechanisms of infectious_diseases event_extraction methods have been applied to automatically analyze all million pubmed_abstracts and event_extraction analyses are being integrated into literature_search systems such as medie and applied in support of advanced tasks such as pathway curation while the event_extraction approach has been demonstrated to be applicable to a variety of extraction targets across different subdomains of biomedical_science related efforts all share a key restriction nearly exclusive focus on molecular level entities and events entities such as proteins and genes and events such as binding and phosphorylation are an important part of the picture of biological_systems but still only a part and any ie approach aiming to capture the whole picture must also consider other levels of biological_organization in this study our aim is to extend the scope of existing event_extraction resources and methods to levels of biological_organization ranging from the subcellular to the organism level as a step toward developing the capacity for the automatic extraction of these targets from the entire available literature toward this end we propose relevant entity and event_types for annotation across these levels with reference to community standard ontologies develop a set of detailed guidelines for their annotation in text and create structured event annotation marking over entities and events in abstracts relevant to cancer_biology previously annotated by domain_experts to identify spans of text relevant to their interests using this data we perform experiments using state of the art methods for both entity mention detection and event_extraction to analyze example sentence with event annotation prot reg and cell comp abbreviated for protein negative regulation and cell component respectively the feasibility of extraction using existing_tools further evaluating the benefits of specific adaptations of such tools to the novel task we have presented the mlee corpus a resource aiming to extend the coverage of resources and methods for structured event_extraction from the molecular level to encompass all levels from the subcellular to the organism experiments using state of the art entity mention detection and event_extraction methods demonstrated that the newly_proposed extraction targets can be met with reasonable performance using the mlee corpus with approximately overall f score for entity mention detection and over f score for event_extraction using standard evaluation criteria in future work we will focus on the extension of the annotations and extraction methods to improve the domain independence of
