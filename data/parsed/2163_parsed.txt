genetics_and hapgen simulation of multiple disease snps motivation performing experiments with simulated_data is an inexpensive approach to evaluating competing experimental_designs and analysis methods in genome_wide simulation based on resampling known haplotypes is fast and efficient and can produce samples with patterns of linkage_disequilibrium ld which mimic those in real_data however the inability of current methods to simulate multiple nearby disease snps on the same chromosome can limit their application results we introduce a new simulation algorithm based on a successful resampling method hapgen that can simulate multiple nearby disease snps on the same chromosome the new method hapgen retains many advantages of resampling methods and expands the range of disease_models that current simulators offer availability hapgen is freely_available fromgenome wide association studies have become a powerful approach for uncovering the genetic_variants that impact human phenotypes simulation_studies are a popular and inexpensive approach to evaluate new methods for statistical_analysis and to examine the power of different experimental_designs the traditional approach of simulating a population forwards or backwards in time ignore the large amount of observed genetic data that are available can be computationally_intensive and can struggle to match real ld patterns to overcome these problems introduced a novel simulation approach hapgen which uses an alternative resampling approach given a reference_panel of haplotypes this method_produces a sample of haplotypes with patterns of ld similar to those in the reference_panel using the hapmap and g haplotype_data as reference_panels hapgen is able to simulate data for many populations in addition it is fast and can simulate a single disease snp under a general disease model allowing the user to specify the risk_allele and heterozygote and to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors homozygote relative_risks other resampling methods also exist but they and hapgen can only simulate a single disease snp on the same haplotype there are many complex_diseases with multiple associated loci on the same chromosome some of them in close_proximity e g so the ability to simulate multiple disease snps on the same chromosome would be desirable to address_this we have devised a new approach extending hapgen to simulate multiple nearby disease snps on the same chromosome
