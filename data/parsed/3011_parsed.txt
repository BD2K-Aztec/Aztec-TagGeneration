mitrata a web_based for microrna truncation and tailing analysis we describe mitrata the first web_based for microrna truncation and tailing analysisthe analysis of modifications of micrornas including the loss or gain of nucleotides relative to the canonical sequence mitrata is implemented in python version and employs parallel processing modules to enhance its scalability when analyzing multiple small_rna srna sequencing_datasets it utilizes mirbase currently version as a source of known micrornas for analysis mitrata notifies user s via email to download as well as visualize the results online mitratas strengths lie in i its biologist focused web_interface ii improved scalability via parallel processing and iii its uniqueness as a webtool to perform microrna truncation and tailing analysis availability_and mitrata is developed in python and php it is available as a web_based application from https wasabi dbi udel edu apps ta revolutionary changes in next_generation and its everdecreasing cost have driven a growing need for bioinformatics_tools and algorithms molecular analysis of plant micrornas mirnas has demonstrated their protection by action of the methyltransferase hua enhancer hen which adds a o methyl_group to the terminal ribose of mirnas and other small_rnas such modification protects plant mirnas from uridylation addition of uridine u nucleotides we and others have previously demonstrated via sequencing studies and comparative_analysis that mirnas in a hen mutant and to a much less extent in wild_type arabidopsis demonstrate an array of modifications include loss of nucleotides truncation and an addition of one to several non templated nucleotides predominantly uridines u previous_reports described varying_degrees of modifications that differ among mirna families yet are conserved for a given mirna across plant_species with advancements in highly productive forward and reversegenetics approaches additional genes important to modifications of small_rnas are being characterized deep_sequencing in these mutants is providing insights into the mechanisms by which these genes function or at least fail to function in the mutants for example analysis of the hen heso double_mutant revealed a reduction in uridylation relative to hen recent genetic_analysis identified a heso ortholog urt with a similar but non redundant role as a nucleotidyl transferase that uridylates mirnas thus both genetic_analysis and sequencing have demonstrated the complexity of truncation and tailing interestingly these end modifications can alter the nature of interaction with a target while the pairing of a mirna with its targets has been proposed to play critical role in the v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com extent of modifications further insights into these mirna_target interactions and the influence of modifications could be gained via a new generation of computational_tools in analysis of ends from srna sequencing_data computational_tools separate the template mirna from the non templated additions while also assessing truncation yet there are no online web_based tools for these measurementstheyre run from a command_line hence we aimed to provide biologists with an automated parallelized web_based for these analyses in plants and animals mitrata for microrna truncation and tailing analysis new algorithms are emerging in the study of modifications of srnas for example end seq is an experimental_protocol for high_throughput of rnas in which the modifications of the captured rna is sequenced separately from the end this technique is partnered with an algorithm append that describes these end modifications from the end seq derived data our approach differs from that ofin that our algorithm uses standard srna sequencing_data it characterizes the extent of truncation a common modification of srnas and it generates a graphical output for the results of each mirna or srna of interest another tool may be a better comparison to ours tailor is specialized for srna analyses and it characterizes both biological alterations such as rna_editing events and technical confounding_factors such as sequencing_errors although poor_quality nucleotides will be removed by fastq processing our approach does not characterize sequence_polymorphisms generated by rna_editing however we have emphasized truncation as this modification is a common source of variation in srnas and a unique graphical output finally to make our tool less prone to the inclusion of sequencing_errors and make more easily_accessible we provided users with a standalone and python based fastq processing script to produce the tag count formatted files required as input to our webtool the processing script performs trimming and chopping taking the raw fastq file s single or paired_end and a set of user_defined parameters that include adapter sequences that may vary from default illumina adapters the parameter file also determines whether the fastq processing yields a fastqc report and whether it generates the graphs after trimming and chopping for which the genome_sequence must be provided these details are described in a readme file this processing script is available from the web_page or can be downloaded from https github com atulkakrana helper github git in summary we have built a biologist friendly web_tool that provides easy access to our previously described algorithm for
