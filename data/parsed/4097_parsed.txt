genetics_and rvtests an efficient and comprehensive tool for rare_variant analysis using sequence_data motivation next_generation have enabled the large_scale assessment of the impact of rare and low_frequency genetic_variants for complex human_diseases gene level association tests are often performed to analyze rare_variants where multiple rare_variants in a gene region are analyzed jointly applying gene level association tests to analyze sequence_data often requires integrating_multiple heterogeneous sources of information e g annotations functional prediction scores allele_frequencies genotypes and phenotypes to determine the optimal analysis unit and prioritize causal_variants given the complexity and scale of current sequence_datasets and bioinformatics databases there is a compelling need for more efficient software_tools to facilitate these analyses to answer this challenge we developed rvtests which implements a broad set of rare_variant association_statistics and supports the analysis of autosomal and x linked variants for both unrelated and related individuals rvtests also provides useful companion features for annotating sequence_variants integrating bioinformatics databases performing data quality_control and sample_selection we illustrate the advantages of rvtests in functionality and efficiency using the genomes_project data availability_and rvtests is available on linux macos and windows source_code and executable files can be obtained at https github com zhanxw rvtests contact next_generation and microarray genotyping have enabled the cost_effective interrogation of a full spectrum of sequence_variants there is considerable interest in understanding the functional role of rare and low_frequency variants in the etiology of complex_diseases efficient software programs for sequence_based association analysis are in great demand however several computational challenges must first be addressed first to determine the optimal analysis units and prioritize causal_variants in sequencewe summarize supported features for rvtests vat and pseq in supplementary table s as stated in methods rvtests uniquely supports the analyses of related individuals as well as the analyses of x linked_genes to our knowledge both vat and pseq in their current implementations can only analyze unrelated samples for the shared_features of all three tools e g managing sequence_datasets and association_analyses of unrelated samples we compared the computational_efficiency for data preparation and association_analyses using the genomes_project phase dataset this dataset consists of individuals genotyped on million markers we simulated continuous phenotypes based on the null_model of no genotypephenotype associations to prepare sequence_data for association_analyses vat and pseq require building databases while rvtests requires annotating sequence_variants vat and pseq took and cpu hours respectively on a desktop with intelv r xeonv r cpu e v ghz to prepare and import data into sqlite databases as a comparison annotating the whole_genome datasets required only h for rvtests it is clear that rvtests offers considerable improvement in time complexity next we compared the association_analyses results on simulated_datasets we performed single_variant tests as well as simple burden skat and vt tests analyzing rare_variants with maf rvtests attains a good balance of time and memory_usage compared with other tools e g completing the simple burden test took rvtests pseq vat a h and required gb of ram supplementary finally we evaluated time and memory complexity for linear_mixed analyses of individualsa unique feature of rvtests the analyses using single_variant simple burden skat and vt tests took cpu hours on a workstation with gb ram our tool can handle datasets with genotyped individuals given that the lmm analyses have linear complexity with respect to the number of genes and quadratic complexity with respect to the number of samples after spectral decompositions it is clear that rvtests can handle large_datasets genotyped on tens of millions of markers supplementary in summary rvtests is an efficient and comprehensive tool for sequence_based association_analyses as the cost of sequencing continues to decrease e g a milestone of whole_genome for has been recently attained population_based genetic_studies will soon reach another scale the speed and scalability advantage of rvtests will be even more critical when applied to these ultralarge scale datasets we envision that our program will continue to make valuable contributions to the study of rare genetic_variants in complex human_diseases
