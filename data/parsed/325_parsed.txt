gene_expression an ensemble biclustering approach for querying gene_expression compendia with experimental lists motivation query_based techniques allow interrogating a gene_expression compendium with a given gene or gene_list they do so by searching for genes in the compendium that have a profile close to the average expression_profile of the genes in this query list as it can often not be guaranteed that the genes in a long query list will all be mutually coexpressed it is advisable to use each gene separately as a query this approach however leaves the user with a tedious post_processing of partially redundant biclustering results the fact that for each query gene multiple parameter_settings need to be tested in order to detect the most optimal bicluster size adds to the redundancy problem results to aid with this post_processing we developed an ensemble approach to be used in combination with query_based the method relies on a specifically_designed consensus matrix in which the biclustering outcomes for multiple query genes and for different possible parameter_settings are merged in a statistically_robust way clustering of this matrix results in distinct non redundant consensus biclusters that maximally reflect the information contained within the original query_based results the usefulness of the developed approach is illustrated on a biological case study in escherichia_coli availability_and compiled matlab_code is available fromwith the large body of publicly_available gene_expression data compendia are being compiled that assess gene_expression in a plethora of conditions comparing ones own experimental_data with these large_scale gene_expression compendia allows own findings to be viewed in a more global cellular_context and inconsistencies between public data and own experiments to be pinpointed query based search approaches such as to whom correspondence should be addressed prioritization based_methods and query_based techniques have been developed to query a gene_expression compendium for genes that are coexpressed with a given gene or gene_list the query these approaches generally combine gene with condition selection to identify genes that are coexpressed with the query in a subset of the compendium conditions query based_methods usually work well when the query list contains one gene only or a set of genes that are mutually tightly coexpressed since they query the expression compendium with the average expression_profile of the query set however when querylists are compiled from the output of experimental assays this list will often contain genes with diverse expression_profiles for instance a query list derived from a chip_chip experiment might partition into different coexpressed groups depending on which other trancription factors tfs the chip assayed tf is interacting with hence when faced with a query set that is heterogeneous in its expression the query profile will be deteriorated and query based_methods will fail to output meaningful clustering_results running query based_methods on each gene from the query list separately circumvents this problem but will inevitably result in at least partially redundant bicluster solutions as mutually coexpressed genes within the query will output similar biclusters a second issue when using query_based relates to the definition of a threshold on the minimal level by which the bicluster genes should be coexpressed with the query gene indeed it is often not a priori known how tightly a set of genes should be coexpressed to be biologically_meaningful in addition this level of coexpression might depend on the biological_process the querygenes are involved in some processes are more tightly coexpressed than others to allow for a maximum flexibility some query_based methods offer the possibility to use a resolution sweep in which a whole range of possible threshold_values is scanned the most relevant solutions can then be selected a posteriori either based on the intuition of the user or by using other ad_hoc defined selection_criteria such as functional over representation the combined effect of having to run query_based on each of the genes from the query list separately with the fact that for each of these single runs also an optional parameter sweep can be performed will result in a whole set of highly redundant biclustering results in this work we developed an ensemble approach to merge such multiple query_based results into a few non redundantstep genes from an input list are each taken separately as a query for qdb for each query gene qdb results in a gene score and condition score matrix g and c refer respectively to the gene and condition dimension of the matrices containing for each value of the resolution parameter indicated with res a score that reflects to what extent the respective gene or condition belongs to the bicluster shades of grey are representative for the magnitude of the gene scores and condition scores step constructing the consensus matrix proceeds in two steps in which first for each query a gene specific consensus matrix is constructed from its gene score matrix this gene specific consensus matrix summarizes for each query gene the biclustering solution obtained at different values of the resolution parameter in the second step the gene specific consensus matrices for all genes in the query list are merged into a single consensus matrix representing the frequency of co occurrence again indicated by shades of grey of two genes in the different biclustering solutions that contain at least one of the genes of the pair step next by applying graph_clustering the consensus matrix is partitioned into consensus clusters step eventually consensus biclusters can be obtained by retrieving for each consensus cluster the corresponding conditions from the original qdb solutions consensus biclusters the usefulness of the developed approach is illustrated on a biological case study in this article we developed an ensemble approach to be used in combination with query_based methods for the
