data_and application and evaluation of automated methods to extract neuroanatomical connectivity statements from free_text motivation automated annotation of neuroanatomical connectivity statements from the neuroscience literature would enable accessible and large_scale connectivity resources unfortunately the connectivity findings are not formally encoded and occur as natural_language text this hinders aggregation indexing searching and integration of the reports we annotated a set of abstracts for connectivity relations to facilitate automated extraction of connectivity relationships from neuroscience literature we tested several baseline_measures based on co occurrence and lexical rules we compare results from seven machine_learning adapted from the protein interaction extraction domain that employ part of speech dependency and syntax features results co occurrence based_methods provided high recall with weak precision the shallow linguistic kernel recalled of the sentence level connectivity statements at precision owing to its speed and simplicity we applied the shallow linguistic kernel to a large set of new abstracts to evaluate the results we compared extracted connections with the brain architecture management system an existing database of rat connectivity the extracted connections were connected in the brain architecture management system at a rate of compared with for co occurring brain_region pairs we found that precision increases with the recency and frequency of the extracted relationships availability_and the source_code evaluations documentation and other supplementary_materials are available atthe brain is a vast interconnected network each neuron communicates with many others through chemical and electrical_synapses to integrate_information groups of neurons in structures such as nuclei or layers make diverse connections across the brain forming pathways of information_flow this structural connectivity is a major_determinant of brain_function and is frequently used by neuroscientists and clinicians to interpret physiological data examples_include understanding strokes and interpreting brain_imaging results evidence for connectivity abnormalities has been found in bipolar autism alzheimers and schizophrenia patients a major_goal of modern neuroscience is to understand the organization of the brain at all levels in as much detail as possible and to understand how this networked organization relates to brain_function and ultimately behaviour and human_health the characterization of the connectivity network or wiring diagram of the brain is incomplete in part this is due to the complexity of the brain and the difficulty in collecting data however we suggest that informatics technologies can be used to leverage existing knowledge that has already been collected to make new discoveries and guide further experimentation in this work we are primarily concerned with macroconnections or connections that can be identified between small brain_regions as opposed to microcircuitry which describes the connections among neurons per se these macroconnections between groups of neurons are predicted to number between and this suggests a high_level of complexity although comfortably placed between the more gross levels of brain organization and the microarchitecture which encompasses billions of neurons and quadrillions of synapses furthermore this estimated number of macroconnections is smaller in scale than estimates of the human protein interactome at interactions among proteins connectivity between brain_regions can be assayed using tract_tracing or electrophysiology tract_tracing typically involves injecting a dye or other tracer e g horseradish_peroxidase into one brain_region and tracking the fate of the tracer as it follows axonal pathways electrophysiological_methods use electrical or other stimulation in one site along with electrical recording at a second site to test the functional_connectivity of regions using these methods a researcher can determine connections that send signals to the region afferent or away from the region efferent over many years thousands of connectivity studies have been performed each of which typically elucidates at most a few connections the presence of a deep literature on neuronal to

to turn this huge accumulation of knowledge into an omics scale database have been limited despite the potential value of such a resource previous_efforts have primarily used manual reviews of the literature to laboriously generate connectivity maps for limited parts of the brain in felleman and van essen published a connectivity matrix of the macaque visual_cortex covering pathways between areas currently a large number of collated connections are stored in the collations of connectivity data on the macaque brain database cocomac cocomac contains detailed information from literature_reports regarding macaque brain_regions a fourth model_organism with large_scale connectivity data is the rat with more than formalized reports of connections in the brain architecture management system bams information is added to these databases manually and therefore they are accurate but sparse currently the only complete connectome scale database is the neuron level wiring diagram of caenorhabditis_elegans determined from electron_micrographs we sought to extend and complement manual efforts with automated text_mining techniques more than years of efforts to recognize gene and protein mentions and their interactions inspire our work in the gene interaction task one must extract information from sentences such as gene a interacts with gene b to give a toy example despite the difficulty of this task great progress has been made a comprehensive evaluation of kernel methods for extracting proteinprotein_interactions detailed precision and recall values ranging from to by varying experiment_design dataset and method tested at the second critical assessment of information_extraction systems in biology biocreative ii the top team was able to extract normalized directed interaction pairs from full_text with precision of and recall of the analogy to brain_connectivity is tight we wish to extract information from sentences akin to brain_region a connects to brain_region b this related research gives us hope that the approaches applied to extracting gene interaction information can successfully mine connectivity relations to our knowledge there have been no previous attempts to extract connectivity_information using text_mining the closest work to our own is that of which was aimed at extracting information about tract_tracing experiments trained and evaluated with a manually_annotated corpus of sentences from documents although burns et_al describe named_entity e g identification of label injection_sites they did not report extraction of connectivity statements themselves for the work presented here we have simplified the problem by limiting our input dataset and output results we focus on abstracts from one journal the journal of comparative neurology jcn because it is enriched for tract_tracing studies we used abstracts rather than full text documents because they are enriched for high_level summary statements and are more accessible we also break our task into several subtasks isolating the steps of brain_region term recognition and normalization from the evaluations we only consider the presence of connectivity relations ignoring the type strength or direction of the connection these limitations make the task simpler and set the stage for future more detailed studies our results show that text_mining approaches previously used to analyse protein networks can be usefully applied to brain_connectivity our large manually_annotated corpus allowed testing and training of various techniques possible and we also perform extensive manual validation of the results beyond the corpus based evaluations we compared a large set of automatically extracted connectivity statements with an existing connectivity database with favourable_results together with our previous work on term recognition and normalization we present a completely automated system for extraction of brain connectivity_information from abstracts our gold_standard is a set of manually_annotated brain_region connectivity relations across a corpus of abstracts to gauge interannotator agreement a second curator l x annotated a random subset of documents roughly of the second curators annotations matched the primary curator recall at precision unlike the automated methods that predict relations between given brain_region mention spans this evaluation required both annotators to mark the same spans and relationships by removing this restriction and allowing partially matching spans the precision and recall reach and respectively we used a co occurrence analysis to reveal the proportion of brain_region mention pairs that are co mentioned and described as connected co occurrence assumes the relation is a connectivity statement at the abstract level this yields a precision of only at recall and a f measure of within a sentence co occurrences between all pairs predict connected pairs at precision and recall the remaining relations span sentences this level of recall means that more than of all annotated connectivity relations are formed with regions in different sentences owing to the difficulty in extracting connections spanning sentences all of our subsequent evaluations are performed at the sentence level with the relations spanning sentences excluded under this evaluation framework sentencelevel co occurrence recalls of the remaining relations we tested two simple modifications of the sentence level co occurrence technique the first reduces co occurrence predictions to sentences with a limited number of brain_region mentions by extracting co occurring pairs from sentences with only two brain_region mentions precision reaches and recall f measure this means that an average sentence with two brain_region mentions is reporting a connection in almost one of four cases by varying this threshold the f measure increases until sentences with six or more brain_region mentions are included we observed that some of these larger sentences merely list brain_regions involved in the study and not their relationships by limiting the threshold at five brain_region mentions or less per sentence co occurrence provides precision and recall the second rule tested requires the sentences contain connectivity related keywords see methods section this keyword based rule increases recall to and precision to f measure we created a new approach named keyword threshold by combining these two rules this again provides improvement with f measure reaching as expected rule_based methodswe reported a complete system for extracting connectivity statements from biomedical abstracts the method provides high recall of manually_annotated connectivity relations described in single sentences precision from two separate evaluations reached and by comparing with an independent source of rat connectivity we found that precision increases with the recency and frequency of the extracted relationships a limitation of our work is that we did not consider the direction of connectivity although most of the relationships we extracted have a direction described in the sentence in addition we did not consider negation region a does not project to region b extracting this information by extracting keywords such as afferent not or input will require additional work these relationship modifiers are manually_annotated in our training corpus and can be used to design more complex rules our methods also did not attempt to extract the large number of relations that span_multiple sentences when these connections are taken into account the slk method provides only recall of annotated connections application of advanced natural_language techniques may be necessary to bridge the sentences e g anaphora resolution the comparison of seven previously_published kernel based_approaches mirrored the previous results from the protein interaction relationship extraction domain further we note that the slk parser was applied to the drug_drug domain with similar results several of the kernel methods have lower performance than our simple rule_based technique effort spent crafting more complex rules may yield higher_precision at the cost of lower recall the top three kernel methods slk all paths graph k band shortest_path spectrum kernel all have similar accuracy auc and f measure scores but vary in precision and recall this difference suggests higher performance may be achieved by combining the methods our results suggest a larger set of input abstracts will yield a larger number of precise connections the largest extension set is medline with more than million abstracts and million sentences tikk and colleagues calculated that the slk parser could process all of medline in days a two step process may reduce runtime and increase accuracy by first identifying abstracts with connectivity statements and then by extracting the specific connections with slk in natural_language it has been observed that simple statistical_models e g co occurrence can outperform more complex models based on less data our experiments_confirm this we found that brain_region pairs with many co mentions tend to be connected this simple technique produces a larger set of potential connections with reasonable precision although this will produce a larger set of results than the slk method it does not target connections that can be directly curated in light of experimental_evidence because the co mentions may or may not describe connectivity further such co occurrences may result from region proximity or biases i e popularity that may influence research_attention both in the literature and in bams however such co occurrence networks show valuable areas of focus when combined with comentions of genes and diseases one of the most serious challenges we encountered was in mapping extracted brain_region mentions to standardized lexicons in our previous work we reported resolution rates of with the major_limitation being gaps in the lexicons for the current work the resolution rate is greatly_reduced as both brain_region mentions of a connectivity relation must be mapped it also appears that regions forming connectivity relations are harder to resolve or map on average for this work we managed to double the resolution rate to the bams lexicon by adding synonyms additional work to improve the lexicons will lead to better resolution of connectivity statements allowing validation and linking to other resources for our evaluation to an outside database we focused on bams although rat is the most frequent mentioned organism other evaluations could compare the connectivity results with the cocomac or the avian brain circuitry database beyond evaluation our dataset and method can provide a large set of extracted connectivity relationships for other species specific databases in conclusion we provide the first application of large_scale text_mining to neuroanatomical connectivity extraction we demonstrated that machine_learning tools designed for extraction of proteinprotein_interactions are generalizable to mining brain_region connections from an information_retrieval perspective our large set of predicted connections can aid neuroscientists in forming hypotheses and models future work will be aimed at further evaluating and disseminating the results before extending the analysis paul pavlidis the funders had no role in study_design data_collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript
