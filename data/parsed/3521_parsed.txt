phangorn phylogenetic_analysis in r phangorn is a package for phylogenetic_reconstruction and analysis in the r language previously it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic_trees with distance methods in r phangorn now offers the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based_methods maximum_parsimony or maximum_likelihood ml and performing hadamard conjugation extending the general ml framework this package provides the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models furthermore phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees phylogenetic_models or splits simulating character data and performing congruence analyses availability phangorn can be obtained through the cran homepage http cran r project org_web phangorn index html phangorn is licensed under gpl with more than packages devoted to phylogenetics the r software r development core has become a standard in phylogenetic_analysis see http cran r project org web views phylogenetics html for an overview however so_far it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic_trees with distance methods in r the phangorn package permits to estimate maximum_likelihood ml and maximum_parsimony mp trees besides reconstructing phylogenies the package also focuses on assessing the congruence of different trees
