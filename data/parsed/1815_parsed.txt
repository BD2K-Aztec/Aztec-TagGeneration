genome_analysis filling annotation gaps in yeast genomes using genome_wide contact_maps motivations de_novo sequencing of genomes is followed by annotation analyses aiming at identifying_functional genomic_features such as genes non_coding or regulatory_sequences taking_advantage of diverse datasets these steps sometimes fail at detecting non coding functional sequences for example origins of replication centromeres and rdna positions have proven difficult to annotate with high_confidence here we demonstrate an unconventional application of chromosome_conformation c technique which typically aims at deciphering the average d organization of genomes by showing how functional information about the sequence can be extracted solely from the chromosome contact_map results specifically we describe a combined experimental and bio informatic procedure that determines the genomic positions of centro meres and ribosomal_dna clusters in yeasts including species where classical computational_approaches fail for instance we determined the centromere positions in naumovozyma castellii where these coordinates could not be obtained previously although computed centromere positions were characterized by conserved synteny with neighboring species no consensus_sequences could be found suggesting that centromeric binding_proteins or mechanisms have significantly diverged we also used our approach to refine centromere positions in kuraishia capsulata and to identify rdna positions in debaryomyces_hansenii our study demonstrates how c data can be used to complete the functional_annotation of eukaryotic_genomes availability_and the source_code is provided in the supplementary_material this includes a zipped file with the python code and a contact matrix of saccharomycesde novo sequencing of genomes is typically followed by analyses aiming to identify functional genomic_features such as genes non_coding or regulatory_sequences this important socalled annotation step raises non trivial questions and led to the development of complex bioinformatics approaches taking_advantage of multiple datasets for instance transcriptome_analysis is conveniently used to annotate expressed coding_sequences and synteny conservation between related species can reveal or confirm the presence of regulatory_elements complementary to automated annotation through comparative_approaches experimental_approaches such as chip_seq or mnase seq have been conveniently used to map epigenetic_marks replication_origins or other functional_elements of the genome however such tools are sometimes unable to detect noncoding functional sequences for example origins of replication centromeres and rdna positions have sometimes proven difficult to annotate with a high degree of confidence in genomes a compelling example is the failure of comparative_genomics to identify the centromeres of the hemiascomycetes species naumovozyma castellii through comparative_genomics as another example the number of rdna clusters in the genome of debaryomyces_hansenii is not known precisely but only estimated to lie between one and three and not currently annotated in the genomic_sequence genomic chromosome_conformation c assays measure the physical_contact frequencies between dna_sequences providing important insights into both genomic_organization and topological changes of chromatin domains that accompany cell_differentiation or development c data are typically analyzed in light of epigenetic_marks and other genomic_annotations in an alternative application d contact can be interpreted as an indicator of co linearity of two dna_segments and was recently used to improve the scaffolding of the human_genome kaplan and ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be addressed here we use genome_wide c data to unveil functional_elements of eukaryotic_genomes that escape comparative_genomic specifically we take advantage of nuclear architecture features to precisely determine the positions of centromeres in the yeast_species n castellii we show that this bioinformatic approach discriminates ambiguous results from bioinformatics_analysis such as in k capsulata finally it also allowed us to complete the annotation of rdna in the d hansenii genome and confirm its centromere annotation
