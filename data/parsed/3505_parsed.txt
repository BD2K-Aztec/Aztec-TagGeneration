genome_analysis permory mpi a program for high_speed parallel permutation_testing in genome_wide permory is software for accelerated permutation_testing of genome_wide gwas we have parallelized permory using the message_passing resulting in a nearly linear speedup furthermore we added accelerated analysis of gwas using quantitative phenotypes and an accurate estimation of the effective number of independent_tests availability_and free download from http a genome_wide gwas nowadays involves the statistical_analysis of millions of single_nucleotide snp markers for the calculation of adjusted p values for genome_wide testing the bonferroni method is highly conservative because it ignores the correlation of markers caused by linkage_disequilibrium in contrast a permutation_based correction of p values fully accounts for this correlation and provides the highest statistical_power among the procedures controlling genome_wide type_i risk while conventional permutation algorithms often required prohibitively long computation times for large_datasets the permory algorithm of pahl and schfer has made permutation_testing feasible for large_scale gwas analysis in time snp_chips with larger numbers of markers such as illumina human omni with mio snps are available and the nextgeneration sequencing_techniques will open the way for full sequence association studies adding another or million of rare_variants we therefore have undertaken one step further and developed the first freely_available parallel algorithm for permutation_testing in gwas based on the original permory algorithm the computation process now can be spread to multiple processors in a cluster using mpi message_passing forum in addition we have further developed the original algorithm being restricted to the analysis of dichotomous phenotypes now to handle quantitative phenotypes as well moreover for each dataset permory now also provides an accurate estimate of the effective number of independent_tests to whom correspondence should be addressed
