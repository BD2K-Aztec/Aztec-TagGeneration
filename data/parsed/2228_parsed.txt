how networks change with time motivation biological_networks change in response to genetic and environmental_cues changes are reflected in the abundances of biomolecules the composition of protein_complexes and other descriptors of the biological state methods to infer the dynamic_state of a cell would have great value for understanding how cells change over time to accomplish biological goals results a new method predicts the dynamic_state of protein_complexes in a cell with protein expression inferred from transcription profile time courses and protein_complexes inferred by joint analysis of protein co expression and proteinprotein_interaction maps two algorithmic advances are presented a new method dhac dynamical hierarchical agglomerative clustering for clustering time evolving networks and a companion method match em for matching corresponding clusters across time points with link prediction as an objective assessment metric dhac provides a substantial advance over existing clustering_methods an application to the yeast metabolic cycle demonstrates how waves of gene_expression correspond to individual protein_complexes our results suggest regulatory_mechanisms for assembling the mitochondrial ribosome and illustrate dynamic changes in the components of the nuclear_pore current views of biological_networks and pathways are primarily static comprising databases of curated pathways or of pairwise interactions primarily between proteins many methods have been developed to cluster partition or segment an interaction_network into putative complexes recent comparisons suggest that hierarchical stochastic block models provide the most accurate reconstruction of real protein_complexes from interaction data these static views however fail to capture the rich dynamic structure of a cell accounting for dynamic changes in protein_complexes is crucial to building accurate_models of cellular state high_throughput measurements of protein_abundance are possible through label_free quantitative mass_spectrometry but may be limited to the most highly abundant proteins in contrast transcript_abundance is more readily available and is often used as a proxy for protein_abundance previous methods combined transcript dynamics with interaction_databases to create a moving picture of the cell state to whom correspondence should be addressed under the crude assumption of a fixed number of protein_complexes and with ad_hoc criteria to match protein complex membership across time points the problem considered here is also distinct from evolutionary_dynamics where algorithms have been developed to estimate ancestral networks and infer the most likely evolutionary_mechanisms this work in contrast uses a rigorous probabilistic_framework to translate a hierarchical stochastic block model to the dynamic domain the number of protein_complexes can increase or decrease at each time point and individual complexes can grow shrink or swap components with other complexes the resulting network_dynamics reveals the temporal_regulation of cell protein state the starting_point is our previous static clustering method hierarchical agglomerative clustering or hac the hac method maximizes the likelihood of a hierarchical stochastic block model also known as the likelihood modularity hac has the appealing features of automatic selection of model size and multi_scale networks views furthermore it out performs leading methods in the task of link prediction an objective performance metric when true group assignments are unknown extending hac to dynamic networks requires a solution to the identifiability problem how complexes inferred at one time point correspond to complexes inferred at other time points furthermore transitions of a protein from one complex to another must be permitted by the model requiring dynamical coupling between network snapshots in this work we address these points first we convert likelihood modularity from maximum_likelihood to fully bayesian statistics which automatically accounts for model_complexity and provides well founded criteria for selecting the correct number of clusters second we kernelize the likelihood modularity with an adaptive bandwidth to couple network clusters at nearby time points similar to methods for regulatory_network we term this the dynamical hierarchical agglomerative clustering dhac method finally we solve the general_problem of matching clusters across time points with a new belief_propagation method match em that extends expectation_maximization and belief_propagation for bipartite matching to consistently match multiple time evolving clusters we apply these methods to real_biological to discover the dynamical structure of protein_complexes dynamic_network clustering is an increasingly important problem across diverse disciplines our algorithm optimizes the likelihood modularity which is asymptotically consistent other machine_learning and physics approaches are based on probabilistic_graphical such as latent_dirichlet lda dynamic extensions have been proposed but prior to our work have been impractical except for very small networks with around vertices and under latent_classes even efficient variational methods such as vbm have scaling that is far worse than a near linear or at least quadratic run time in the number of nodes and edges our dhac algorithm scales as o ej lnv the same as hac with a constant prefactor for the number of time points this provides an excellent trade_off for genome_scale problems networks considered here with vertices required about min on a single ghz processor a full genome network with to vertices could be analyzed in a day to a week on single processor but in practice would be much faster because each time point could be run in parallel the cluster matching algorithm match em is a second contribution that provides a solution to the general_problem of tracing the evolution of a set of groups or clusters over time it generalizes a previous belief_propagation method for bipartite matching the bipartite max product algorithm is exact with a worst_case run time of o k for k classes our generalization has an additional linear factor of the number of time points while it is no longer guaranteed to converge to the exact solution for biological_networks here it converges rapidly with good results our methods applied to real_biological provide new insight many transcription time course experiments reveal waves of correlated gene_expression with no standard methods to parse a large set of correlated genes into well defined protein_complexes the dhac method is a general solution to this problem and provides a multi resolution view of dynamic expression and organization of the proteome focusing on specific predicted complexes reveals possible mechanisms of regulation and control our analysis of the yeast metabolic cycle identifies protein_complexes with asynchronous gene_expression which suggests rsm as an rna methyltransferase whose early expression may be required to assemble and stabilize the mitochondrial ribosome our methods permit proteins to switch between complexes over time which we see in the dynamics of the nuclear_pore hierarchical methods like dhac also provide a natural multi_scale description of complexes subcomplexes and proteins a separate challenge is introducing mixed membership with the same protein serving as a subunit in two distinct protein_complexes several improvements to dhac are possible previous work showed that the hierarchical_structure inferred from static networks corresponds to levels of biological_organization pathway to complex to subcomplex and the fine_structure underneath a collapsed complex can also be used to improve link prediction in the current work however we lacked a method to match the dynamically evolving hierarchical_structure across snapshots consequently the focus here is on the bottom level clusters rather than the hierarchical_structure this work assumes that the population average transcription data is a good representation for the transcriptional state of each cell in reality individual cells may differ from the mean in the yeast metabolic cycle for example about half of the cells undergo cell_division per metabolic cycle potentially yielding two distinct cell_populations more advanced methods have been proposed to increase resolution and drive toward single_cell models direct measurements of protein_abundance through quantitative mass_spectrometry could improve the analysis and would be intriguing to combine with expression data for transcription data protein_abundance may be better estimated by a transcriptiontranslation model p t r t p t where r t is the measured transcriptional abundance p t is the abundance of the corresponding protein and and are production and degradation_rates this model generates exponentially weighted smoothing of protein_abundance similar to the exponential kernel we used for smoothing since the exponential smoothing kernel already works well we anticipate that results should be robust to choices of and with the possibility of using consensus values for most proteins
