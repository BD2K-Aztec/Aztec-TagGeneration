computational inference of grammars for larger than gene structures from annotated gene sequences motivation larger than gene structures lgs are dna_segments that include at least one gene and often other segments such as inverted_repeats and gene_promoters mobile_genetic mge such as integrons are lgs that play_an in horizontal_gene primarily in gram_negative known lgs have a profound effect on organism virulence antibiotic_resistance and other properties of the organism due to the number of genes involved expert compiled grammars have been shown to be an effective computational representation of lgs well suited to automating annotation and supporting de_novo gene_discovery however development of lgs grammars by experts is labour_intensive and restricted to known lgs objectives this study uses computational grammar inference methods to automate lgs discovery we compare the ability of six algorithms to infer lgs grammars from dna_sequences annotated with genes and other short_sequences we compared the predictive_power of learned grammars against an expert developed grammar for gene cassette arrays found in class and integrons which are modular lgs containing up to of about cassette types results using a bayesian generalization algorithm our inferred grammar was able to predict of mge structures in a corpus of sequences obtained from genbank f score even with noise added to the training and test_sets we obtained an f score of indicating that the method is robust and has the potential to predict de_novo lgs structures when the underlying gene features are known availability http www the study of dna has particularly focused on regions that code rna primarily genes and regions that interact with proteins such as transcription_factor in jacob andpublished the first example of a gene regulation_mechanism that exploits the position of genes to simultaneously control the expression of genes that are part of the same metabolic_pathway list classes of larger than gene structures lgs that can transfer regions of dna to whom correspondence should be addressed containing one or more genes between dna_molecules in a cell or through conjugation between organisms many examples of each class of these mobile_genetic mges are found in genbank these mges have all been discovered after initial_observations of unexpected phenomena integrons for example were first identified when manual observations found a similar sequence pattern restriction_enzyme sites repeatedly flanking a variety of quite different antibiotic_resistance the development of a systematic method for making such observations would potentially reveal new structures and new mechanisms for gene_regulation and transposition methods of computational support for mge discovery typically focus on a subset of mges called genomic islands these methods include bullet methods that use sequence_similarity either through wholegenome alignment or clusters of genes these methods depend on having similar genomes that differ by inserted genomic islands they cannot discover the structure of the inserted sequence bullet methods that rely the on similarity of genomic_sequence properties of such as gc_content or oligonucleotide frequencies these methods can discover insertions with limited accuracy and also do not identify sequence structure bullet methods based upon the occurrence of direct_repeats dr and trna_genes to identify mge insertions however as many mge are not inserted in trna_genes nor have dr this approach is not generalizable all of these methods have been designed for bacterial chromosomal_dna and not plasmids an important class of tools can identify new mge from known classes of mge these methods require the creation a priori of computational_models of mge structures to permit automatic mge annotation we present a method to support de_novo discovery of lgs based upon computational grammars short_sequences e g genes recurring motifs dr and inverted_repeats are annotated by other methods our method then identifies recurring patterns in these annotations to infer new lgs and represents them as grammatical models the grammar is then used to provide a second level ofpage the results indicate that at least in our domain inferring grammars for lgs can be achieved with a moderate training_set size selecting sequences for the sdb from genbank may have worked in our favour as genbanks bias is likely to over represent class integrons compared with the general bacterial_population this bias is unavoidable and may work against not for de_novo structure discovery however the relatively small training_set needed to identify a recurring structure and the high tolerance to noise are encouraging and mean that despite this bias new structures may yet be found in genbank further experiments are required to test algorithm performance on sequences from natural_populations in this article we have set a framework for such evaluation we have used two methods to evaluate the ability of the generated grammars to identify structures correctly proportional matching of the grammar accounts for structures that were partially discovered for example when a sequence of five tokens leaves has a gold_standard cassarray annotation but only four were annotated with a structure predicting token in this case the annotation itself is not exactly right but the correct region was indeed identified we have shown that our method outperforms hmms using this evaluation we also report a measure based upon whole structure identification hmms predict arrays very poorly in particular when negative predictions are assigned the same weight as positive ones f score a possible explanation to hmms poor_performance is the small training_set and we have shown that adding generalization improves_performance among horizontal_gene mechanisms gene cassette arrays are the most modular with the highest variability in the type and number of antibiotic_resistance we therefore believe that our algorithm will be able to identify other structures such as transposons and insertion_sequences much more accurately the noise experiments simulate a de_novo discovery scenario where not all annotations processed by the system belong to a single structure in these experiments we needed to ensure integrons remain the dominant structure for a meaningful comparison with the gold_standard we thus added noise annotations from several other structures to the annotation set ensuring that relevant annotations are always at least of the annotations our system sees leaving integrons as the dominant structure in a de_novo discovery scenario we expect that annotations of parts of known structures will be removed from the annotations before the system is run so that the remaining most dominant structure is discovered de_novo discovery of lgs using our methods relies on previously known component features e g gene cassettes but does not require prior_knowledge of their relationship in a structure existing_methods for prediction of component genes inverted_repeats and other features can be used in conjunction with our method we have shown that novel lgs can be discovered in dna_sequences in which relevant_features of the structure are annotated even using a relatively small training_set and large_amounts of noise an important aspect of this approach is that the inferred grammar represents a general model that accurately identifies structures without referring to prior_knowledge about them hence this method seems promising for de_novo discovery even if only a few examples exist in the corpus
