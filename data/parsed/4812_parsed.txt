gene_expression using coalitional games on biological_networks to measure centrality and power of genes motivation the interpretation of gene interaction in biological_networks generates the need for a meaningful ranking of network elements classical centrality analysis ranks network elements according to their importance but may fail to reflect the power of each gene in interaction with the others results we introduce a new approach using coalitional games to evaluate the centrality of genes in networks keeping into account genes interactions the shapley value for coalitional games is used to express the power of each gene in interaction with the others and to stress the centrality of certain hub_genes in the regulation of biological_pathways of interest the main improvement of this contribution with respect to previous applications of game theory to gene_expression analysis consists in a finer resolution of the gene interaction investigated in the model which is based on pairwise relationships of genes in the network in addition the new approach allows for the integration of a priori_knowledge about genes playing a key function on a certain biological_process an approximation_method for practical computation on large biological_networks together with a comparison with other centrality_measures is alsogene expression data may be collected by means of microarray_technology within a single experiment of this sophisticated technology the level of expression of thousands of genes is estimated in a sample of cells under given conditions genetic_diseases environmental exposition pharmacologic_treatment levels of activation of a given pathway of genes etc several approaches have been proposed to identify central genes of different biological_pathways within the huge amount of information provided by this technology gene_co and other biological_networks e g representing proteinprotein_interactions are increasingly used to explore the system level to whom correspondence should be addressed functionality of genes and proteins co expression networks for instance are connection situations based upon the extent of correlation between pairs of genes across a gene_expression dataset nodes are genes and connections are defined by co expression of two genes often the pearsons_correlation is the initial measure of gene co expression this measure is then transformed into an adjacency_matrix according to different alternative statistical_procedures depending on the aims of the study weighted or unweighted networks generated by the dichotomization of the corresponding correlation_matrix may be considered analytical_methods for network elements ranking are an important tool for the interpretation of gene interaction in co expression networks centrality analysis ranks single elements according to their importance within the network_structure and different measures of centrality focus on various aspects of the structure of a network e g most central elements of protein networks were essential to predict lethal mutations highly_connected hub_genes largely responsible for maintaining network_connectivity were likely essential for yeast survival although standard centrality_measures may fail to reflect the power of each gene to interact with the others cooperative game theory may also be used to analyze gene_expression data see for instance in the class of microarray games has been introduced to quantitatively evaluate the relevance of each gene in generating or regulating a condition of interest e g a disease taking_into the observed relationships in all subgroups of genes in the framework of microarray games the relevance of genes is expressed in terms of the shapley value the shapley value attributed to a certain gene in a given microarray game corresponds to the relevance of that gene for the mechanisms_governing the genomic effects of the condition under study this game theoretic approach has been successfully_applied to real_datasets and provides a characterization of a relevance index for genes which is mainly based on the role they play inside gene regulatory_pathways a comparison between the results provided by the analysis of the shapley value of microarray games and the results provided by classic statistical_testing is discussed in connection with the pathogenesis of neuroblastic tumors in in this article a new measure of the importance of genes in biological_networks based on coalitional games is introduced the new measure calculated from the shapley value of two coalitional games has been used to express the centrality of each gene in interaction with the others and keeping into account a priori_knowledge about genes playing a key function on a certain biological_process the use of index as a centrality measure is supported by the basic intuition that it is a difference of power indices between a page an interaction_network network network thick lines and the interactions of a gkg situation described with only one keygene k thin lines note that the subgraphs individuated by paths and satisfy the hypothesis and of the tam property so the tam property would require that the sum of centrality values of nodes which are in is larger or equal than the sum of nodes in it is easy to check that according to relations and
