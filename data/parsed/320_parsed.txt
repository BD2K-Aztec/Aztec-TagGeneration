an empirical_bayes change_point model for identifying and alternative_splicing by next_generation motivation next_generation rna_seq has been widely used to investigate alternative isoform regulations among them alternative splice_site ss and ss account for more than of all alternative_splicing as events in higher_eukaryotes recent_studies have revealed that they play_important in building complex organisms and have a critical impact on biological_functions which could cause disease quite a few analytical_methods have been developed to facilitate alternative ss and ss studies using rna_seq however these methods have various limitations and their performances may be further improved results we propose an empirical_bayes change_point model to identify alternative ss and ss compared with previous methods our approach has several unique merits first of all our model does not rely on annotation_information instead it provides for the first time a systematic framework to integrate various information when available in particular the useful junction read information in order to obtain better performance second we utilize an empirical_bayes model to efficiently pool information across genes to improve detection_efficiency third we provide a flexible testing framework in which the user can choose to address different levels of questions namely whether alternative ss or ss happens and or where it happens simulation_studies application have demonstrated that our method is powerful and accurate availability_and the software is implemented_in and can be freely down loaded from http ebchangepoint sourceforge net with continued development and improvement next_generation rna_seq has become more and more popular owing to its affordable cost and advantages over existing technologies in addition its superiorities in detecting transcripts in undetermined genomic_sequences and very accurate digital resolution make it a more attractive technology which is expected to gradually replace microarray_technology many compelling biological_problems once hard to tackle can be solved by new methods built upon rna_seq in particular alternative_splice play_important in building complex organisms from a limited number of genes they provide a major mechanism for enhancing transcriptome and proteome diversity and critically regulate various biological_functions using rna_seq people observe that more than of human genes undergo alternative_splicing a much higher percentage than anticipated of various alternative_splice alternative ss and ss are particularly important and constitute more than of all as events as revealed by rna_seq several studies have v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com found that alternative ss and ss events are relevant to many diseases by analyzing alternative ss and ss events we can obtain precious diagnostic and prognostic_information for therapies thanks to high_throughput rna_seq genome_wide quantitative_studies on as events become feasible quite a few computational_methods have been developed to detect and identify as events these methods can be roughly classified into three categories based on their strategies the first category represented by cufflinks performs differential splicing detection based on transcript quantification which is the most challenging short_reads sampled from rna_seq can be aligned to multiple_transcripts due to the similarity and overlaps between alternative transcripts it makes the expression estimation of individual transcript an undetermined problem in addition various sampling_biases including position specific_biases bohnert and r atsch and sequencespecific biases in the rnaseq_data incur daunting difficulties for accurate transcript quantification consequently the efficiency of these methods is diminished by the uncertainty in transcript quantification the second category of methods aims to detect differential splicing by testing differential_expression of the annotated events obtained from existing splicing databases representative examples in this category include alexa seq miso mats and splicetrap among them miso employs a statistical_model to estimate expression of alternatively_spliced exons and isoforms mats leverages a bayesian statistical_framework to flexibly test the hypothesis of differential alternative_splicing patterns these methods may work well when splicing_events are well and accurately annotated they are not applicable to detect novel as events not cataloged yet in existing annotation databases the third category of methods including diffsplice dexseq and fdm utilizes splice_junction read information to overcome the annotation dependency limitation the performances of these methods are highly dependent on the number and quality of splice_junction reads sequencing_costs often set limits to sequencing_depth and coverage of rna_seq and consequently performance of these junction read based_methods furthermore the number and quality of aligned splice_junction reads will also rely on sequencing_technology as well as read_mapping tools very recently propose a change_point model which requires no annotation_information it relies on characterizing the coverage change for detecting alternative_polyadenylation apa in principle it can be applied for detecting as events however compared with apa a key difference for alternative_splicing is that junction read information can be useful and utilized for locating splice_sites for example a simple strategy for calling as events is to identify locations supported by at least n independent splice_junction reads with different alignment start positions it is noted that when sequencing_depth is not enough a significant proportion of as events may not be covered by junction reads in particular when using a stringent n threshold for ensuring quality due to the junction read_coverage limitation there is room for improvement even when sequencing_depth is high exon read_coverage may be used as clues for as events we expect that using both coverage and junction read information will improve both sensitivity_and of as calls compared to relaying solely on junction reads or read_coverage it is therefore desirable to develop a method that can systematically integrate both junction read information and coverage_information from a methodology point_of weis method is a frequestist approach and fails to pool and exploit information across many genes under investigation in addition it tests only whether there is a change_point but not where the change_point is thus its changepoint location estimation does not guarantee any multiplicity control in this paper we develop an empirical_bayes change_point model for identifying as events our approach_requires no annotation_information and is applicable to detect novel aberrant splicing_events compared with previous methods our approach has several unique merits first of all our model does not rely on annotation_information instead it provides for the first time a systematic framework to integrate read coverage_information and junction read or annotation_information when available in order to obtain better performance secondly we utilize an empirical_bayes model to efficiently pool information across genes for improving detection_efficiency thirdly we provide a flexible testing framework in which the user can choose to address different levels of questions namely whether alternative_splicing happens and or where it happens simulation_studies and applications to real_data have demonstrated that our method is powerful and accurate
