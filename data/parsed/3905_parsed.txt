databases_and rcpedia a database of retrocopied genes motivation retrocopies are copies of mature rnas that are usually devoid of regulatory_sequences and introns they have routinely been classified as processed pseudo genes with little or no biological_relevance however recent_findings have revealed functional_roles for ret rocopies as well as their high_frequency in some organisms such as primates despite their increasing importance there is no user_friendly and publicly_available resource for the study of retrocopies results here we present rcpedia an integrative and user_friendly database designed for the study of retrocopied genes rcpedia contains a complete catalogue of the retrocopies that are known to be present in human and five other primate genomes their genomic_context inter species_conservation and gene_expression data rcpedia also offers a streamlined data representation and an efficient query system availability_and rcpedia is available at http www bioinfo retrocopies are gene_copies that are generated by reverse transcription and genomic integration of transcribed mrnas although retrocopies have been described since the early s their functional_roles have only recently been revealed retrocopies occur frequently in many genomes including those of primates and some retrocopies are transcribed and have putative functions see for a review interestingly retrocopies have idiosyncrasies that simplify their identification the four main characteristics are as follows i an original multi exonic parental gene copy in the genome ii a mono exonic region without intronic_regions iii a poly a stretch located in the most region or iv direct_repeats of nucleotides nt flanking them see for a review these characteristics make retrocopy identification through computational_pipelines reasonably straightforward especially for species for which well assembled_genomes and transcriptomes are available despite this there is still a lack a publicly_available and easy to use resources dedicated to the study of retrocopies making it necessary either to use manual and multi_step approaches to explore retrocopies or to use non specialized databases such as the pseudogene databases e g http www pseudogene org that contain only basic and or restricted information here we describe rcpedia a publicly_available database that was developed for the study of retrocopies rcpedia contains a myriad of information on retrocopied genes from six primate genomes human chimp gorilla orangutan rhesus and marmoset as well as a streamlined graphical data representation and an efficient information query system because there are many unnamed retrocopies the search output results in rcpedia are based on parental gene names the results of a query can be presented from two data visualization perspectives i the parental gene perspective which helps the user to visualize all retrocopied events of a given parental gene as well as their genomic_loci and their identity to retrocopies for example for the full dataset see the website and ii the retrocopy perspective which displays information such as their genomic_context identity to the parental gene conservation in other species and retrocopy expression see supplementaryfor a schematic view rcpedia is a well organized user_friendly and streamlined graphical_representation resource dedicated to the study of retrocopies in primate genomes to the best of our knowledge rcpedia is the most comprehensive and publicly_available database in this field although some resources providing similar information we strongly believe that rcpedia will significantly improve the annotation and functional characterization of retrocopies present in primate genomes
