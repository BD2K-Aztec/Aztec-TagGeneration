gene_expression cplexa a mathematica package to study macromolecular assembly control of gene_expression macromolecular assembly coordinates essential_cellular such as gene_regulation and signal_transduction a major_challenge for conventional computational_methods to study these processes is tackling the exponential_increase of the number of configurational states with the number of components cplexa is a mathematica package that uses functional programming to efficiently compute probabilities and average properties over such exponentially large number of states from the energetics of the interactions the package is particularly suited to study gene_expression at complex promoters controlled by multiple local and distal dna binding_sites availability cplexa is freely_available together with documentation at http sourceforge net_projects cplexa the study of the cellular_behavior from the molecular_components often requires approximations in terms of chemical_reactions however there are many instances such as combinatorial macromolecular assembly that cannot be efficiently described in terms of chemical_reactions macromolecular_complexes are typically made of smaller building_blocks with a modular_organization that can be combined in a number of different ways the result of each combination is a specific molecular_species therefore there are potentially as many reactants as the number of possible ways of arranging the different elements which grows exponentially with the number of the constituent elements several approaches have been developed to tackle this exponentially large multiplicity in the number of states they involve a diversity of methodologies that range from stochastic configuration sampling le to automatic generation of all the underlying equations the complexity of the general_problem makes each of these approaches work efficiently only on a particular type of problems be it conformational changes multi_site phosphorylationthe package cplexa provides the function avconfthat computes the thermodynamic average illustrates the use of cplexa with mathematica to compute the effective transcription_rate at the p rm promoter of phage this system consists of two sets of three contiguous binding_sites for the ci dimer the two sets known as left and right operators are kb for details see_supplementary apart from each other ci dimers bound at different operators can interact with each other by looping the intervening dna in this case just a few lines of code from lines in to in in can achieve the same results as a table with entries for each of the states the state of the system s is described by six binding and one looping state_variables in line in the free_energy g s in line in includes in a very compact manner binding to each of the six sites as a function of the dimer concentration interactions between neighboring dimers dna looping and the formation of octamers and tetramers between dimers bound at different sets of binding_sites the transcription_rate s as a function of the binding and looping state is given in line in its average value avconf closely matches the experimental_data on the transcriptional_activity of the promoter cplexa also provides the function dgtable which constructs a table with the free_energy and statistical weight boltzmann factor of each state that has a non zero probability
