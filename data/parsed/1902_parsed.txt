functional_classification of cath superfamilies a domain based_approach for protein_function motivation computational_approaches that can predict protein functions are essential to bridge the widening function_annotation gap especially since of all proteins in uniprotkb have been experimentally_characterized we present a domain based method for protein_function classification and prediction of functional sites that exploits functional sub classification of cath superfamilies the superfamilies are sub classified into functional families funfams using a hierarchical clustering_algorithm supervised by a new classification_method funfhmmer results funfhmmer generates more functionally coherent groupings of protein_sequences than other domain based protein classifications this has been validated using known functional information the conserved positions predicted by the funfams are also found to be enriched in known functional_residues moreover the functional_annotations provided by the funfams are found to be more precise than other domain based resources funfhmmer currently identifies funfams in superfamilies which can be used to functionally annotate million domain_sequences availability_and all funfam annotation data are made available through the cath webpages http www cathdb info the funfhmmer webserver http www cathdb info search by funfhmmer allows users to submit query_sequences for assignment to a cath funfam the rapid increase in sequencing and structural_genomics initiatives have provided us with a wealth of data to unravel the complex sequence structure and function relationships in proteins however of this data are functionally annotated from experimental_studies the most commonly used methods for protein_function often exploit a sequence or structure homology_search of a query_protein against a protein database although more sophisticated approaches which also exploit heterogeneous data e g gene_expression and proteinprotein_interaction data etc and combine this diverse information using machine_learning have also been developed for a review of current approaches see it has been observed that proteins_sharing high sequence or structural_similarity can often evolve different sub functions these functionally diverse relatives perform distinct functions even though they may share a general functional feature e g for enzymes this may be a common step along their reaction_pathways such groups of homologous proteins_sharing the same function will be referred to as functional families hereafter the cath gene d resource provides a comprehensive classification of structure and sequence domains into structure basedsuperfamilies we have developed a novel method funfhmmer for functional_classification of these superfamilies the aim of this classification is manifold for example to improve our understanding of the sequence and structure mechanisms of functional_divergence within a superfamily during evolution and to improve the functional_annotation of uncharacterized protein domain_sequences assigned to an annotated functional family within the superfamily to our knowledge no other such comprehensive functional_classification of domain_sequences linked to structural data exists here we show that our novel functional_classification protocol has resulted in funfams that are significantly more functionally pure than in our previous classification reported in dfx this was demonstrated using an assessment protocol based on the ec classification and the manually_curated sfld superfamilies we also demonstrate that this enhanced functional purity translates into better performance in functional prediction for uncharacterized sequences using a uniprotkb_swiss rollback assessment funfhmmer clearly generates more functionally pure families than other domain based resources and outperforms dfx in protein_function as assessed by the uniprotkb_swiss rollback assessment moreover the performance of funfhmmer in the preliminary_results of cafa have been very encouraging funfhmmer which only uses domain information was featured among the top five among automatic function prediction_methods some of which use information from heterogenous data_sources for making predictions in predicting biological_process go terms and among the top in predicting molecular_function terms cafa results can be accessed from https github com idoerg cafa results the cafa assessment protocol provides independent_validation that the funfams in cath gene d are of reasonable functional purity and valuable for providing functional_annotations for novel uncharacterized sequences cath currently identifies funfams and for the most populated of these having high information content accounting for of cath gene d sequences residues implicated in functional sites can be predicted our assessment of functional purity of the funfams has shown that our new families can be used to identify a higher proportion of known functional_residues associated with a particular functional grouping than our previous method dfx a web_server has been set up to allow users to submit query_sequences for assignment to a cath funfam where possible the server http www cathdb info search by funfhmmer takes a protein_sequence in the fasta_format as input and scans it against the cath funfam hmms the funfam matches for the constituent domains of the query_sequence are reported when they achieve the inclusion threshold score of the corresponding funfam hmm information on the highly conserved_residues identified for those cath funfams having msas with sufficient information content is also available on the cath gene d website these positions are highlighted on a representative d structure for the funfam where available we also provide network visualizations of the relationships between funfams within each superfamily these images provide_valuable the functional_diversity across a superfamily and reveal where particular functions dominate the superfamily therefore cath funfams are useful for analysing the variation in functions across a superfamily and since functional sites can be identified for many funfams they allow a structurally informed analysis of the mechanisms of this divergence in summary we have shown that a novel approach to sub classifying funfams in cath gene d based on the difference in sdps between functional_groups is able to separate funfams exploiting different conserved_residues to perform their functional properties this approach provides a domain classification that is able to provide accurate functional_annotations than broader groupings of relatives
