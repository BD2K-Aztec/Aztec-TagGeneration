phenoscanner a database of human genotype_phenotype phenoscanner is a curated database of publicly_available results from large_scale genetic_association this tool aims to facilitate phenome scans the cross_referencing of genetic_variants with many phenotypes to help aid understanding of disease pathways and biology the database currently contains over million association results and over million unique genetic_variants mostly single_nucleotide it is accompanied by a web_based that queries the database for associations with user specified variants providing results according to the same effect and non effect alleles for each input variant the tool provides the option of searching for trait associations with proxies of the input variants calculated using the european samples from genomes and hapmap availability_and phenoscanner is available at www phenoscanner to illustrate the use of phenoscanner we ran the program with rs an intronic variant in swap using proxies from genomes and a r cut_off of the program found and aligned over associations with either rs or a proxy of rs r in s and supplementary data hence even though associations between rs and phenotypes are mostly unavailable we were able to obtain a range of related associations using proxies e g rs in in summary phenoscanner is a large curated database of publicly_available summary results from genetic_association this database extends current catalogues of genetic data by including all available results as opposed to filtering on strength of association moreover phenoscanner aligns genotypephenotype associations across traits and proxies providing the user with an easily_interpretable formatted output_file we anticipate that this tool will make cross_referencing genetic_variants with many phenotypes faster and more efficient
