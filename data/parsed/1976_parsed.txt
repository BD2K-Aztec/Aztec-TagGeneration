gener a minimal programming module for chemical controllers based on dna_strand gener is a development module for programming chemical controllers based on dna_strand gener is developed with the aim of providing a simple interface that minimizes the opportunities for programming errors gener allows the user to test the computations of the dna programs based on a simple two domain strand_displacement algebra the minimal available so_far the tool allows the user to perform stepwise computations with respect to the rules of the algebra as well as exhaustive_search of the computation space with different options for exploration and visualization gener can be used in combination with existing_tools and in particular its programs can be exported to microsoft researchs dsd tool as well as to latex one of the goals of synthetic_biology is constructing information_processing systems for controlling biochemical_systems at the molecular level such an achievement would pave the way for applications e g to smart therapeutic devices that are capable of sensing their environments within a broad_spectrum various technologies are being developed to address different aspects of this vision applications in dna nanotechnology aim at harnessing the complexity of biochemical dynamics to control active molecular devices in vivo technologies based on dna_strand algebras in particular the double_stranded architecture with nicks on one strand is proving to be effective also in wet_lab implementations of formally designed experiments the double_stranded dna_strand algebras perform computations as a result of the interactions between single and double_stranded structures the single_stranded structures act as signals that are processed by double_stranded structures that act as gates the mechanism with which the signals are processed by the gates is toehold mediated branch migration and strand_displacement by using this machinery one can program e g systems of chemical reaction_networks that operate at the molecular level in this setting a single chemical_reaction step is emulated by a sequence of dna_strand operations because an increase in additional steps introduces more opportunities for errors in design simpler schemes for designing these molecular programs become more favorable in this respect two domain dna_strand scheme provides a good platform for developing molecular programs as it is minimal in design while being sufficiently expressive for describing chemical reaction_networks that are of interest from the point_of of molecular programming gener is developed for performing in silico experiments in design and debugging of dna_strand systems potential applications include designing dna_sequences from desired dna domain structures the search feature is useful for verification and analysis of reachable states of the designed systems the sequences can then be ordered from integrated dna technologies idt and executed in a basic wet_lab with a fluorometer for reading the output the features of gener are only limited by its minimalistic design avoiding duplication of effort and imagination we thus foresee extensions as they will be required one of the two composed domains can be a short domain denoted with t any other string consisting of letters denotes a long domain complemented double strands are written in angle brackets and and they denote double strands consisting of strands and their watsoncrick complements we denote nicks on double strands with which are the interruptions on one side of the double strand that make the interactions between the signals and gates possible a screenshot of a search performed on an example for the search all paths option is chosen together with the display options search tree and equal nodes the gray lines between the nodes denote equal nodes
