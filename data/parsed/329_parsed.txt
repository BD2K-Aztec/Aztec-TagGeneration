an event driven approach for studying gene block evolution in bacteria motivation gene blocks are genes co located on the chromosome in many cases gene blocks are conserved between bacterial_species sometimes as operons when genes are co transcribed the conservation is rarely absolute gene loss gain duplication block splitting and block fusion are frequently observed an open question in bacterial molecular_evolution is that of the formation and breakup of gene blocks for which several models have been proposed these models however are not generally_applicable to all types of gene blocks and consequently cannot be used to broadly compare and study gene block evolution to address this problem we introduce an event based method for tracking gene block evolution in bacteria results we show here that the evolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a small set of events those include the insertion of genes into or the splitting of genes out of a gene block gene loss and gene_duplication we show how the event based method of gene block evolution allows us to determine the evolutionary rateand may be used to trace the ancestral states of their formation we conclude that the event based method can be used to help us understand the formation of these important bacterial genomic structures availability_and the software is available under gplv_license on http github com reamdc gene block evolution git supplementary online material http iddo friedberg net operon evolutionin bacterial and archaeal genomes gene blocks are sequences of genes co located on the chromosome whose evolutionary_conservation can be conservation of gene blocks can be strikingly apparent and has been used in phylogenetic and functional studies conservations across numerous taxa indicate that at least some conserved blocks are operons a special_case of gene blocks where the genes are cotranscribed to polycistronic mrna and are often associated with a single function such as a metabolic_pathway or a protein complex it is estimated that of bacterial genes reside in operons typically operons are under the control of one or more regulator proteins which facilitate co regulated_transcription from an evolutionary point_of there are several questions that are asked about operons and gene blocks how did these units evolve what confers fitness upon genes in an operon or block structure as opposed to not being neighboring are certain operons more or less evolutionarily_conserved in bacteria what affects the conservation of the operon or gene block structure in different taxa several models exist to explain gene block evolution for more extensive reviews see one of the first models proposed for biopathway evolution v c the author published_by the results of this study show an interesting variety in gene block evolution first we show the gene block tree diagrams in a phylogenetic_tree these diagrams show the gene blocks as we find them in the different species we examine the lack of a gene in the gene block phylogenetic_tree does not mean the homolog does not exist in that taxon but rather that it is no longer detectable by blast at the threshold of further if a gene block is missing from the phylogenetic_tree it means that there are no two genes in the gene block that are neighboring in the genome within a distance of bp to visualize the frequency of events we generate gene block event frequency matrices or colored phylomatrices as described in section the value of each matrix is a z_score shows two conserved gene blocks andshows two non conserved gene blocks
