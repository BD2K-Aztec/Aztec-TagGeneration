systems_biology cellpublisher a web platform for the intuitive visualization and sharing of metabolic signalling and regulatory_pathways systems_biology relies increasingly on collaborations between several groups with different expertise therefore the systems_biology community is adopting standards that allow effective_communication of concepts as well as transmission and processing of pathway_information the systems_biology sbgn is a graphical language for biological_pathways that has both a biological as well as a computational meaning the program celldesigner allows the codification of biological_phenomena in an sbgn compliant form cellpublisher is a web_server that allows the conversion of celldesigner files to web_based navigatable diagrams based on the user_interface of google maps thus cellpublisher complements celldesigner by facilitating the understanding of complex diagrams and by providing the possibility to share any celldesigner diagram online with collaborators and get their feedback due to the intuitive_interface of the online diagrams cellpublisher serves as a basis for discovery of novel properties of the modelled networks availability the freely_available web_server and the documentation can be accessed at http cellpublisher gobics de the source_code and the offline version for microsoft windows are freely_available sourceforge net_projects cellpublisher the detailed understanding of biological_pathways and the design of novel molecular_pathways with engineered properties lies at the core of systems_biology to meet these goals two complementary approaches are combined in modelling simulation and graphical_representation while the former aims to mimic the behaviour of the pathway in silico the latter aims to make the pathway properties and structure understandable to humans the pace of discovery in systems_biology has been greatly accelerated by the adoption of standards by the community e g sbml the systems_biology sbgn le is likely to become the standard for graphical_representation adequate software_tools such as celldesigner are freely_available and actively used to whom correspondence should be addressed while several online_databases such as kegg biocyc reactome panther pathway projector or subtipathways exist for visualizing centrally curated pathways only few of them are adopting a standard graphical language e g moreover as novel pathways are constantly discovered or designed there is a specific need for presenting custom pathways and receiving feedback from other scientists so_far authoring diagrams for online sharing is possible using the web_servers biopp payao and wikipathways however these servers do not allow the generation of easily navigatable diagrams which are required for the evaluation of pathway maps by the non specialist busy lab scientist with the advent of asynchronous javascript and xml ajax technologies in the web which have given rise to applications such as google maps the possibilities for navigation of graphical information have been greatly_improved to complement the powerful authoring capabilities of celldesigner with an improved visualization interface and to overcome the limitations of the existing pathway presentation tools we have developed cellpublisher a web_server for the intuitive visualization sharing and discussion of metabolic signalling and regulatory_pathways based on the interface of google maps
