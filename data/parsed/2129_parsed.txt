grid computing for improving conformational_sampling in nmr_structure calculation motivation methods for automatic nuclear_magnetic nmr_structure need to face a high_level of ambiguity encountered in nmr_spectra recorded by solid_state and by solution nmr of partially unfolded_proteins leading to time consuming calculations the software_package ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment aria allows for straightforward parallelization of the calculation as the conformers can be generated in parallel on many nodes results due to its architecture the adaptation of aria to grid computing can be easily achieved by using the middleware glite and jdl job description language scripts this adaptation makes it possible to address highly ambiguous datasets because of the much larger conformational_sampling that can be generated by use of the grid computational power availability the version
