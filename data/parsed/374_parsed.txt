data_and anonymous nuclear loci in non model_organisms making the most of high_throughput genome surveys motivation when working with non model_organisms few if any species specific markers are available for phylogenetic phylogeographic and population studies therefore researchers often try to adapt markers developed in distantly_related taxa resulting in poor amplification and ascertainment_bias in their target taxa markers can be developed de_novo and anonymous nuclear loci anl are proving to be a boon for researchers seeking large_numbers of fast evolving independent loci however the development of anl can be laboratory intensive and expensive a workflow is described to identify suitable low_copy anonymous loci from high_throughput shotgun sequences dramatically reducing the cost and time required to develop these markers and produce robust multilocus datasets results by successively removing repetitive and evolutionary conserved_sequences from low coverage shotgun libraries we were able to isolate thousands of potential anl empirical testing of loci developed from two reptile taxa confirmed that our methodology yields markers with comparable amplification rates and nucleotide diversities to anls developed using other methodologies our approach capitalizes on next_generation to enable the development of phylogenetic phylogeographic and population markers for taxa lacking suitable genomic resources contact in a recent review noted that next_generation methodologies make the acquisition of many marker datasets readily feasible the ability to generate libraries of random_sequence from across the genome at a relatively low expense has already changed the way that markers are developed for phylogenetic and population genetic_studies in particular the use of the roche platform for generating large fragments of randomly sheared genomic_dna has already provided a wealth of markers most marker development studies have focussed on the large number of microsatellites that can be readily obtained from partial_sequencing runs on non model_organisms e g to whom correspondence should be addressed and large_numbers of species can be analysed simultaneously on this platform in addition almost entire mitochondrial_genomes and a number of protein_coding have been recovered from these kind of data one class of marker that should be present in high numbers but has yet to be exploited from these data are anonymous nuclear loci anl anl represent randomly_selected fragments of dna that by chance are likely to be from non coding_regions of the genome given that a large percentage of eukaryotic_genomes comprise non coding_regions the advantages of these markers are numerous they are likely to be independent not biased to a single area of the genome and unlikely to be under selection and so free to accumulate mutations at varying_rates providing a suite of sufficiently fast evolving markers useful for phylogenetics phylogeography and population_genetics anl have been successfully used in multilocus reconstruction of phylogenetic and phylogeographic histories a criticism of using anonymous markers is that paralogous loci and repetitive_elements may go undetected potentially confounding phylogenetic and phylogeographic inferences in addition the development of these markers has required intensive laboratory_methods including a substantial amount of cloning during development from small insert libraries bacterial_artificial libraries and amplified_fragment fragments herein we describe the development of anl from randomly_generated sequences produced by the roche platform and provide empirical data to evaluate the methods the use of low coverage genome surveys has revolutionized microsatellite development in non model_organisms and we have now developed a workflow to further exploit these genomic resources to develop markers suitable for phylogenetic phylogeographic and population studies our approach targets low copy_number sequences which due to the nature of the data and the methodology we have chosen are likely to be from non coding_regions of the genome although these regions are likely to accumulate mutations relatively quickly they are also rich in repetitive_elements found that repetitive_elements still posed a problem after screening against genbank and known repeat libraries although we have also utilized known repeat libraries in our methodology our approach further minimizes potential problems caused by repetitive_elements by de_novo determination and exclusion of sequences that are repetitive within the dataset this effectively removes species specific sines and other high_copy elements not present in repeat libraries or in public_databases paralogous sequences are more difficult to detect but removing loci with sites that are heterozygous across all sequenced individuals has been demonstrated as a practical solution and this is the approach we used for the sea snake analysis even though we tested a small number of loci successful amplification in the reference taxa and for g lazelli and h spiralis respectively is comparable to amplification success reported in other studies in in during the screening process the attrition_rate of markers was high but the reasons for attrition varied primarily based on the phylogenetic span of trialled taxa in the gehyra study of the markers did not amplify in the outgroup and only one of the four sequenced products was invariant in contrast within the more recently diverged hydrophis group of the loci tested were invariant and a further showed evidence of paralogs nevertheless the relatively high attrition_rate of loci during screening is more than offset by the large number of sequenced fragments suitable for screening if a larger pool of potential loci are desired increasing the size_range of fragments considered or altering primer design_parameters will increase the yield of potential markers
