data_and a principal skeleton algorithm for standardizing confocal_images of fruit_fly nervous_systems motivation the_fruit is a commonly used model_organism in biology we are currently building a d digital atlas of the fruit_fly larval nervous_system lns based on a large collection of fly larva gal lines each of which targets a subset of neurons to achieve such a goal we need to automatically align a number of high_resolution confocal image_stacks of these gal lines one commonly_employed strategy in image pattern registration is to first globally align images using an affine transform followed by local non linear warping unfortunately the spatially articulated and often twisted lns makes_it to globally align the images directly using the affine method in a parallel project to build a d digital map of the adult fly ventral_nerve vnc we are confronted with a similar problem results we proposed to standardize a larval image by best aligning its principal skeleton ps and thus used this method as an alternative of the usually considered affine alignment the ps of a shape was defined as a series of connected polylines that spans the entire shape as broadly as possible but with the shortest overall length we developed an automatic ps detection algorithm to robustly detect the ps from an image then for a pair of larval images we designed an automatic image_registration method to align their pss and the entire images simultaneously our experimental_results on both simulated images and real_datasets showed that our method does not only produce satisfactory_results for real confocal larval images but also perform robustly and consistently when there is a lot of noise in the data we also applied this method successfully to confocal_images of some other patterns such as the adult fruit_fly vnc and center brain which have more complicated ps this demonstrates the flexibility and extensibility of our method availability the supplementary movies full size figures test data software and tutorial on the software can be downloaded freely from our website_http penglab janelia org proj principal skeletonthe fruit_fly drosophila_melanogaster is one of most studied model_organisms in biology it is currently widely used to understand how a real nervous_system works a systems_biology approach that we are taking to study the fruit_fly brain is to produce d digital atlases of this animals nervous_system at various developmental time points including adult larval and embryonic stages we have been taking_advantage of an on going effort to generate a collection of enhancer_trap gal lines that would have their neuronal patterns cover the entire set of neurons in the fruit_fly nervous_system high_resolution d confocal_images of these gal lines were produced the scale of the problem is large in terms of both the large size of each d confocal image hundreds of megabytes to multi gigabytes each and the large number of the images in the database two to five times the number of gal lines as multiple flies of the same gal line need to be imaged therefore an informatics challenge is how to map the neuronal patterns onto a standard brain in an accurate reliable and automatic way a brain_mapping study needs several enabling techniques including d image_registration alignment neurite tracing neuronal pattern_classification visualization and mining methods it is often critical to align image patterns that have various orientations sizes shape deformations and intensity changes a classic routine for d image pattern registration is to first align patterns globally followed by a local_alignment to transform one pattern to the other for a pair of image patterns the purpose of the global_alignment is to standardize the patterns as a whole so that they possess similar scales positions and directions the affine transformation is commonly used for global_alignment once two patterns have been roughly aligned globally it is much easier to use the more sophisticated local_alignment e g which is often non linear and deformable to register the patterns precisely the affine alignment was already successfully used in recent efforts to build digitized atlases for model animals such as the allen mouse_brain atlas the adult fruit_fly brain atlas unpublished work of peng lab and the singlenucleus resolution atlas of the nematode_caenorhabditis however for the alignment problem of the fruit_fly larval nervous_system lns in this article we found that the global affine alignment can hardly be used as shown in in the lns the two brain hemispheres and the ventral_nerve vnc form an articulated structure which is flexible and often skews toward one side this deformation cannot be described using globalrotation translation scaling and shear as used in the affine transform which is an example of the adult vnc displays a similar deformation of the shape therefore we need a more sophisticated global alignment_method to standardize the shape of these patterns before we can proceed further to the local_alignment intuitively we considered aligning the backbone or mid line of a curved fruit_fly lns or an adult vnc red skeletons in a related study was to straighten the strongly curved body of c elegans by first detecting the curved anterior_posterior axis of a worm and then restacking the resampled image data on the entire series of pixel spacing cutting planes orthogonal to such a detected backbone this earlier method is very efficient for c elegans confocal_images and other similar cases where the backbone is a simple smooth curve and the body of the pattern is not fat wide enough so that the slightly non parallel cutting planes next to each other will not intersect within the pattern unfortunately this method cannot be directly used in standardizing a fruit_fly larval pattern because the articulated pattern cannot be described as a simple curve and the fruit_fly patterns are often fat wide enough so that restacking the cutting planes may introduce artifacts especially in the articulated image regions there are several other skeleton extraction methods however they cannot easily produce skeletons of the same topological_structure for different input images and thus will not be very useful for the registration therefore in this work we proposed a new approach to standardize the confocal_images of fruit_fly lns and adult vnc we detected the principal skeleton ps of a shape using an automatic skeleton deformation algorithm section then we designed a smooth warping method to best align the ps of a pair of image patterns section our method introduces a minimum amount of degradation of the image_quality during the standardization it is also robust under a variety of conditions in addition our method is general it is not limited to fly larval patterns indeed it can be applied to any image patterns that have a reasonable ps section
