cardinal an r package for statistical_analysis of mass_spectrometry based imaging_experiments cardinal is an r package for statistical_analysis of mass_spectrometry based imaging msi experiments of biological_samples such as tissues cardinal supports both matrix_assisted maldi and desorption electrospray_ionization based msi workflows and experiments with multiple tissues and complex designs the main analytical functionalities include image_segmentation which partitions a tissue into regions of homogeneous chemical_composition selects the number of segments and the subset of informative ions and characterizes the associated uncertainty and image classification which assigns locations on the tissue to pre defined classes selects the subset of informative ions and estimates the resulting classification error by cross_validation the statistical_methods are based on mixture modeling and regularization contact o vitek neu edu availability_and the code the documentation and examples are available open_source at www cardinalmsi org under the artistic license the package is available at www bioconductor org mass_spectrometry based imaging msi experiments characterize the chemical_composition of biological_samples such as tissues or non biological_samples at spatial_resolution the experiments repeatedly acquire mass_spectra at gridded locations on a tissue two typical goals of statistical_analysis of msi are image_segmentation which partitions a tissue into regions of homogeneous spectral profiles and image classification which assigns locations of the tissue to pre defined classes based on their spectral profiles however achieving these goals is often quite difficult due to the large and complex nature of the datasets and due to the biological and technical variation in intensities of spectral_features statistical_inference is key for distinguishing the systematic signals in the spectra from noise the availability of statistical_methods and software for msi experiments is currently limited we introduce cardinal an open_source r based software_package for processing and visualization of mass_spectra and for statistical segmentation and classification of the resulting images cardinal differs from other publicly_available software_tools such as biomap datacube explorer and msireader in its emphasis on statistical_modeling and inference it differs from commercial tools such as scils lab scils fleximaging bruker hdi waters and tissueview ab sciex in being open_source it differs from the
