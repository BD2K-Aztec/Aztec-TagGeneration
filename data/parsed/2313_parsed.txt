genome_analysis identifying biologically_relevant differences between metagenomic communities motivation metagenomics is the study of genetic_material recovered directly from environmental_samples taxonomic and functional differences between metagenomic_samples can highlight the influence of ecological_factors on patterns of microbial life in a wide_range of habitats statistical hypothesis_tests can help us distinguish ecological influences from sampling artifacts but knowledge of only the p value from a statistical hypothesis_test is insufficient to make inferences about biological_relevance current reporting practices for pairwise comparative_metagenomics are inadequate and better tools are needed for comparative metagenomic_analysis results we have developed a new software_package stamp for comparative_metagenomics that supports best practices in analysis and reporting examination of a pair of iron mine metagenomes demonstrates that deeper biological_insights can be gained using statistical_techniques available in our software an analysis of the functional potential of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis in two enhanced_biological metagenomes identified several subsystems that differ between the a phosphatis stains in these related communities including phosphate metabolism secretion and metal transport availability python source_code are freely_available from our website atwith its focus on ecologically_relevant assemblages of microorganisms metagenomicsthe assessment of randomly collected dna_fragments from a microbial communityhas revealed a new world of microbial_diversity and complexity metagenomic_studies can be motivated by several goals including the discovery of novel genes of interest validation of metabolic hypotheses profiling of the relationship between microbial_community and variation in environmental to whom correspondence should be addressed or geographic parameters and assessment and comparison of the global metabolic complement found in one or more habitats detailed_assessment of communities requires intensive sequencing effort and careful experimental_design to ensure that experimental questions can be adequately_addressed a common outcome of a metagenome project is a set of functional_predictions for the collected and assembled dna_reads assigned via homology_search and classified using a scheme such as the seed or kegg when multiple samples are collected functional_classes can be organized into contingency_tables that allow the assessment of statistically_significant differences in the relative_abundance of these classes for example sampled communities from an oxidized and anoxic environment within the soudan iron mines and found evidence that these two communities preferentially utilize different respiratory pathways several dedicated bioinformatics applications have been developed for the statistical_analysis of metagenome pairs including xipe totec shotgunfunctionalizer and megan packages focusing on the complementary problems of assessing differences between groups of metagenomes have also been developed while such comparisons are informative it is vital to distinguish results that are biologically_relevant i e truly different in frequency between two or more sites due to some underlying taxonomic or ecological phenomenon from those that are merely statistically_significant statistical_significance is neither a necessary nor a sufficient criterion for biological_relevance but is typically used as a filter to remove uninteresting features where the observed difference can reasonably be attributed to being a sampling artifact reasoning about the biological_relevance of a feature requires consideration of effect_sizes and their associated confidence_intervals interpretation of statistical results can also benefit from transforming raw p values to alternative measures with possibly superior interpretations and by allowing interactive filtering that permits focusing on features with specific statistical_properties here we present a discussion of the key statistical concerns in metagenomic_data analysis and introduce a new application stamp statistical_analysis of metagenomic profiles which provides a user_friendly graphical environment for performing the statistical_techniques discussed in this article it is essential to consider potential_sources and how they can influence the results of statistical_techniques when making inferences about biological_relevance comparative_metagenomics relies heavily on a guilt by association paradigm where the function or taxonomic origin of reads is assigned according to similarity with sequencing from a reference_databases this leads to four notable sources of error in metagenomic profiles i assuming sequence_similarity implies functional_similarity ii database bias favoring certain functional subsystems or taxonomic units iii misannotations resulting in reads being incorrectly associated with a specific functional or taxonomic category and iv reads with no reliable match in a database being effectively discarded investigating the seriousness of these sources of errors is an active area of research knowledge of effect_size ci width and number of sequences assigned to a feature is essential when deciding if these sources of error have the potential to explain the observed enrichment or depletion of a statistically_significant subsystem or taxonomic unit for statistical_techniques to aid biological inference they must be interpreted and reported correctly stamp provides a graphical environment for performing statistical_analyses and interactively exploring results through publication quality plots with sufficient information to inferring biological_relevance these capabilities make stamp a valuable_tool that will aid researchers in interpreting and communicating the results of their statistical_analyses
