probabilistic single individual haplotyping motivation accurate haplotypingdetermining from which parent particular portions of the genome are inheritedis still mostly an un resolved problem in genomics this problem has only recently started to become tractable thanks to the development of new long_read sequencing_technologies here we introduce probhap a haplotyping algorithm targeted at such technologies the main algorithmic idea of probhap is a new dynamic_programming that exactly optimizes a likelihood_function specified by a probabilistic_graphical and which generalizes a popular objective called the minimum error_correction in addition to being accurate probhap also provides confidence_scores at phased positions results on a standard benchmark_dataset probhap makes fewer errors than current state of the art methods this accuracy can be further increased by excluding low_confidence positions at the cost of a small drop in haplotype completeness availability our source_code is freely_available at https github com kuleshov probhap although modern sequencing_technology has led to rapid advances in genomics over the past_decade it has largely been unable to resolve an important aspect of human_genetics genomic phase each human_chromosome comes in two copies one inherited from the mother and one inherited from the father despite the fact that differences between these copies play an important biological role until recently decoding these differences a process known as haplotyping or genome phasing has been a major technological challenge in recent_years however we have seen an emergence of new long_read technologies that may one day enable routine cost_effective haplotyping because a long_read comes from a single chromosome copy it reveals the phase of all heterozygous genomic positions that it covers by connecting long_reads at their overlapping heterozygous positions it is possible to extend this phase_information into haplotype_blocks in a process referred to as single individual haplotyping sih although from the molecular_biology side routine haplotyping seems close to becoming a reality dealing with long_read data remains non trivial computationally under most formulations of the problem it is np_hard to recover the optimal haplotypes from noisy sequencing_reads this has led to a vast literature on heuristics for dealing with this problem as accurately as possible here we propose a new algorithm probhap which offers an improvement in accuracy over the current leading method refhap unlike most other algorithms probhap also provides confidence_scores in addition to genomic phase these scores can be used to prune low accuracy positions and further improve haplotype quality at the cost of phasing fewer variants the main algorithmic ideas of probhap are a new dynamic_programming and a probabilistic_graphical the dynamic_programming determines the haplotypes that maximize the likelihood_function preadsjtrue haplotypes specified by the probabilistic_model as well as the probability that these haplotypes are correct it can be seen as a special_case of the well known variable elimination algorithm from a theoretical point_of the likelihood_function specified by our probabilistic_model generalizes a well known objective called the minimum error_correction mec previously_proposed exact dynamic_programming for the mec can be easily derived as special cases of the general variable elimination algorithm within our model more interestingly alternative formulations of this algorithm corresponding to different variable orderings result in novel exact algorithms that are significantly_faster than previous ones thus our work generalizes several previous_approaches and provides a systematic way of deriving new haplotyping algorithms given comparable phasing rates and n block lengths probhap produced haplotype_blocks with more accurate longrange phase the long_range switch error of probhap was lower than that of the second best algorithm refhap in addition probhap also produced fewer short switch errors than refhap note that long switch accuracy is substantially more important than short switch accuracy as it drastically changes the global structure of haplotypes short switch errors on the i in summary we have introduced a new single individual phasing algorithm probhap that offers an improvement in accuracy over the current state of the art method refhap in addition it is one of the only methods to provide the user with confidence_scores at every position these confidence_scores can be used to prune positions whose phase is uncertain and thus substantially_increase the overall accuracy the advances behind probhap are made possible by framing the phasing problem within a probabilistic_graphical framework this framework makes it particularly easy to reason about the problem in fact all our algorithms are special cases of standard_procedures for optimizing graphical_models on the theoretical side this work generalizes the mec criterion used by existing_methods our approach allows us to obtain existing algorithms as special cases of well known optimization procedures and also easily derive new more efficient algorithms it may thus serve as a foundation for further algorithmic insights
