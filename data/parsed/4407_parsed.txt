structural_bioinformatics statalign combining statistical alignment with rna_secondary motivation comparative modeling of rna is known to be important for making accurate secondary_structure rna_structure prediction_tools such as ppfold or rnaalifold use an aligned set of sequences in predictions obtaining a multiple_alignment from a set of sequences is quite a challenging_problem itself and the quality of the alignment can affect the quality of a prediction by implementing rna_secondary in a statistical alignment framework and predicting structures from multiple_alignment samples instead of a single fixed alignment it may be possible to improve predictions results we have extended the program statalign to make use of rna specific features which include rna_secondary from multiple_alignments using either a thermodynamic approach rnaalifold or a stochastic_context scfgs approach ppfold we also provide the user with scores relating to the quality of a secondary_structure such as information_entropy values for the combined space of secondary_structures and sampled alignments and a reliability score that predicts the expected number of correctly_predicted base_pairs finally we have created rna_secondary visualization plugins and automated the process of setting up markov_chain runs for rna alignments in statalign availability_and the software is available fromour recently created statistical alignment package statalign performs simultaneous multiple_sequence and phylogenetic_tree using a statistical alignment strategy this method operates in a bayesian_framework and uses the markov_chain mcmc method to sample from the joint posterior space of alignments trees and model_parameters it works with a realistic insertiondeletion model on the gene level tkf and offers a selection of substitution models the clear advantage of this approach is that the complete evolutionary_history is modelled and estimated in a single sound statistical_framework rna_secondary is an important problem in molecular biologythe function of the rna_molecule depends on the way it folds stochastic_context scfgs have been used to great effect in programs such as pfold which has recently been reimplemented they use the homology of rna_sequences to help make accurate_predictions as the base_pair complementarity must be kept for structural conservation multiple_sequence in itself is a challenging_problem as most multiple_alignment programs rely on score based heuristics rather than attempting to model the underlying biological_process of substitution insertion and deletion it is therefore desirable to implement rna_folding in a statistical alignment framework to gain the advantages from statistical alignment including being able to predict from multiple_alignment samples and statistical_measures associated with the probabilistic_model
