sequence_analysis computational_identification of natural peptides based on analysis of molecular_evolution motivation many secretory peptides are synthesized as inactive precursors that must undergo post_translational to become biologically_active attempts to predict natural peptides are limited by the low performance of proteolytic site predictors and by the high combinatorial complexity of pairing such sites to overcome_these we analyzed the site wise evolutionary mutation_rates of peptide_hormone precursors calculated using the rate site algorithm results our analysis revealed that within their precursors peptide residues are significantly more conserved than the pro peptide residues this disparity enables the prediction of peptides with a precision of at a recall of receiver_operating roc auc subsequently combining the rate site score with additional features and training a random_forest enable the prediction of natural peptides hidden within secreted human proteins at a precision of at a recall of roc auc the high performance of our method allows it to be applied to full secretomes and to predict naturally_occurring active_peptides our prediction on homo_sapiens revealed several putative peptides in the human secre tome that are currently unannotated furthermore the unique expression of some of these peptides implies a potential hormone function including peptides that are highly_expressed in endocrine_glands many secretory_proteins and peptides are initially synthesized as larger precursors usually in the form of pre pro proteins note that the term peptide is sometimes used also to describe a protein_fragment this study however focuses on endogenous peptides that are synthesized by translation of messenger_rna mrna followed by proteolysis to generate the mature form such precursor_proteins undergo post_translational proteolysis the n_terminal pre region known as signal_peptide is cleaved by a well characterized signal_peptidase whereas various proteases liberate the active_peptides from the pro proteins they are often subjected to proteolysis to generate the mature form examples of peptide_hormones whose proteolytic_processing regulates their activities include insulin somatostatin parathyroid_hormone glucagon and glp many of these are used as therapeutic peptides for treating various disorders the importance of identifying mature peptides fuels both experimental and computational_approaches aimed at discovering and predicting proteolytic sites traditionally the main method for discovering short_peptides such as hormones or gpcr ligands was performed through biochemical separation coupled with functional_assays this approach is challenging as peptides often have restricted_expression exist at low_abundance in complex biological matrices together with other secreted and shedded proteins and have highly_diverse physiological_functions in recent_years there have been several attempts based on biochemical separation and purification coupled with various mass_spectrometry today prediction of natural peptides is possible because of advancements in computational_biology algorithms enabling the analysis of the fast_growing genome and proteome databases nevertheless many computational_approaches are limited to the classical furin and dibasic proteolytic sites which can be identified through the use of simple regular expressions whereas predictors aiming to treat more complex pro hormone convertase cleavage_sites have relatively low performance which leads to many falsely predicted peptides approaches where putative peptides are computationally identified directly based on a hidden_markov or machine_learning are limited to cases where sequence_similarity to known peptides is significant we speculate that sequence and structural divergence impairs the computational_identification of many peptides using this approach thus we looked for methods that can circumvent these obstacles in this study we test the hypothesis that the amino_acid of functional peptides is more conserved among orthologous_proteins in comparison with the rest of the precursor sequence this is true in several well known examples like corticoliberin tachykinin and insulin using a secretomewide analysis we demonstrate that the relative conservation of peptide_sequences is high enough to allow prediction of peptides to whom correspondence should be addressed to the best of our knowledge usage of evolutionary profile to predict functional native peptides has not been studied before although it has been implemented in the past to uncover functional_residues and functional patches on protein_surfaces we can speculate that others have not chosen this approach for peptide_identification because of the concern that functional native peptides could not be distinguished from functional segments or domains within proteins which reside between falsely predicted proteolytic sites on the basis of their relative sequence_conservation our study found that in many cases peptides can be separated from functional segments a reasonable_explanation for this success is that although there are few constraints on sequences that are removed during peptide maturation propeptides there are many more constraints applied to sequences adjacent to functional segments and domains as these segments are part of a mature_protein sequence_based for peptide_identification whether based on hmm or other techniques can only find novel peptides with some sequence_similarity to known ones one of the advantages of the approach described in this study is that its learning_phase is sequence_independent and therefore can identify peptides that have no sequence_similarity to any known peptide for example we predicted the existence of a few peptides in the cf human and f b human precursors in both cases there is no sequence_similarity to any known peptide in cf human we predict that there is a proteolytic site between residues and rkgr jc followed by the removal of r by carboxypeptidase e and amidation of k note that c terminal amidation is a well known post_translational that increases the stability of many native peptides there are two options for the n terminus of this potential peptideg and y which cannot be easily distinguished by this approach according to proteinatlas the precursor of this potential peptide is highly_expressed in the testis leydig_cells the placentas trophoblastic cells melanocytes some neuronal_cells and glandular cells of various tissues including gall_bladder digestive_tract uterus fallopian_tube parathyroid_gland and adrenal_gland for f b human we predict a peptide at the c terminus bottom panel it is an interesting peptide because it possesses two cysteines that might form a stabilizing intra peptide disulphide bridge the expression of this precursor in the adrenal_gland duodenum and small_intestine glandular cells supports the functionality of this peptide as genuine it is noteworthy that a similar predicted peptide appears in the paralogous f a human precursor another potential benefit of the peptide classifier described here is to determine_whether currently annotated peptides possess a function i e detecting false_positive in the scientific_literature and databases notably calcitonin calc human residues is conserved relative to the upstream pro peptide whereas katacalcin calc human residues is variable thus we posit that katacalcin is not a functional peptide top similarly we suggest that the highly_variable potential peptide residues and and f b human where we suggest a novel peptide at a conserved segment between a predicted proteolytic site and the c terminus of the protein bottom seefor details of pro_opiomelanocortin coli human are not functional peptides bottom in this study we preferred rate site over entropy because the former takes_into the topology and branch_lengths of the phylogenetic_tree thus rate site accounts for sequence redundancy without discarding part of the data and is therefore expected to be more accurate than entropy demonstrates that rate site has a stronger predictive_power than entropy at a recall of rate site gives a precision of compared with that of given by entropy in conclusion this study highlights how evolutionary_analysis can be instrumental in functional_annotation
