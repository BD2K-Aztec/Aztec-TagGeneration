gene_expression myfx a turn key software for laboratory desktops to analyze spatial_patterns of gene_expression in drosophila_embryos spatial_patterns of gene_expression are of key importance in understanding developmental networks using in situ_hybridization many laboratories are generating images to describe these spatial_patterns and to test biological_hypotheses to facilitate such analyses we have developed biologist centric software myfx that contains computational_methods to automatically process and analyze images depicting embryonic gene_expression in the_fruit it facilitates creating digital descriptions of spatial_patterns in images and enables measurements of pattern similarity and visualization of expression across genes and developmental_stages myfx interacts directly with the online flyexpress database which allows users to search thousands of existing patterns to find co expressed genes by image comparison availability_and myfx is freely_available www flyexpress net
