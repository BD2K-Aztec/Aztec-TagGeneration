bioimage_informatics improved image alignment_method in application to x_ray images and biological images motivation alignment of medical_images is a vital component of a large number of applications throughout the clinical track of events not only within clinical diagnostic settings but prominently so in the area of planning consummation and evaluation of surgical and radio therapeutical procedures however image_registration of medical_images is challenging because of variations on data appearance imaging artifacts and complex data deformation problems hence the aim of this study is to develop a robust image alignment_method for medical_images results an improved image_registration method is proposed and the method is evaluated with two types of medical data including biological microscopic tissue images and dental x_ray images and compared with five state of the art image_registration techniques the experimental_results show that the presented method consistently performs well on both types of medical_images achieving and averaged registration accuracies for biological_tissue images and x_ray images respectively and outperforms the benchmark methods based on the tukeys honestly significant_difference test and fishers least square difference test tests the presented method performs significantly better than all existing_methods p for tissue image alignment and for the x_ray image_registration the proposed method performs significantly better than the two benchmark b spline approaches p image_registration is the process of systematically placing separate images in a common coordinate system so that the information they contain can be optimally integrated or compared this is becoming the central tool for image_analysis understanding and visualization in both medical and scientific applications time series of images are acquired for various reasons such as monitoring of bone_growth in children monitoring of tumor_growth post_operative monitoring of healing or observing the passing of an injected bolus trough a vessel tree and image_registration plays an important role for these medical_applications however alignment of medical_images is challenging because of variations on data appearance imaging artifacts and complex data deformation problems making existing registration approaches unstable and performs poor section shows the experimental_results of four existing registration methods although there has also been substantial progress in non rigid registration algorithms that can compensate for tissue deformation or align images from different subjects many registration problems remain_unsolved from literature_review the raw_data tends to be carefully prepared showing little morphological distortions or stain variation to simplify the registration task in addition they tend to work with low_resolution images without dealing with high_precision tissue or cell level registration the aim of this work is to investigate a robust and fully_automatic image_registration method for medical_images two types of medical data are included in this study one is serial microscopic tissue images with conventional histopathological hematoxylin_and h e staining and the other is dental x_ray images_acquired using different radiation time from to s with slightly different capturing views illustrates challenges with respect to data variations in our experimental_data for image alignment there are various types of image_registration techniques which can be categorized into area based_methods and feature based_methods zitova and flusser suggested that feature based_methods are recommended if the images contain enough distinctive and easily detectable objects which is usually the case of applications in remote_sensing and computer vision and area based_methods are usually used for medical_images which are not so rich in such details in this study we first evaluated five existing image_registration techniques on the collected medical_images they are one featurebased method i e surf which is popularly adopted for remote_sensing and general computer vision applications and four area based_methods demonstrated to be useful for biological images including a unidirectional elastic b spline model unwarpj an improved bi_directional elastic b spline model bunwarpj a state of the art d reconstruction system to whom correspondence should be addressed trakem and mutual_information based image_registration approach using the matlab_implementation mathworks the five benchmark methods surf unwarpj bunwarpj trakem and mutual_information are briefly described later in the text surf speeded up robust features is a scale and rotation nvariant detector and descriptor based on sums of d haar wavelet responses and the method is a popularly adopted technique and widely_applied to general computer vision applications such as remote_sensing image alignment and object_recognition task however as for medical_images local image_features can appear confusing to one another surf does not perform well on corresponding feature identification thus this method tends to fail in our experiment see section shows the results of corresponding landmark detection by surf in application to general computer vision images and in biological images for general computer vision applications surf is able to identify corresponding features but for biological_tissue images surf performs poor on corresponding landmark detection unwarpj unidirectional elastic b spline model is introduced byby combining and extending some of the best techniques in the context of medical_imaging they use b splines to model the deformation field and solve the registration problem by minimizing a pixelwise mean square distance measure between the target image and the transformed source images with vector spline regularization constraints this method is demonstrated to be effective on the elastic registration of images of electrophoretic gels and fly embryos later based on unwarpj argandadeveloped an improved bi_directional elastic b spline model bunwarpj to perform better registration of histopathological tissue images however quantitative evaluations of the method were not provided in to show the performance of bunwarpj on alignment of tissue images trakem is a recent development for d medical image_registration and or d image_reconstruction butpointed out that trakem acknowledges that any automatic procedure such as image_registration and image_segmentation will eventually fail partially or fully and will require manual correction by a human_operator mutual_information techniques measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images and use mutual_information or relative entropy as the matching criterion the method has been validated for rigid_body registration of computed_tomography magnetic_resonance and photon emission tomography images here recent matlab r a implementation mathworks of the mutual_information based method is adopted for evaluation in our experiments see section the five existing techniques do not deal with either tissue deformations or stain variation problems and perform poor obtaining registration accuracies on average for biological_tissue images and for x_ray images the two b spline models produce poor results with accuracy hence a robust and fully_automatic registration method is highly_desirable in this work an improved image alignment approach that is a combination of feature_based and area based elastic registration method and a tissue pattern extraction_technique is introduced here and the presented method is fully_automatic and performs consistently well in our experiments for both biological_tissue images and x_ray images detailed quantitative evaluations with statistical_analysis were conducted showing that the presented method achieves and averaged registration accuracies for biological_tissue images and x_ray images respectively and outperforms the benchmark methods based on the tukeys honestly significant_difference test hsd and fishers least square difference test lsd tests the presented method performs significantly better than all existing_methods p for tissue image alignment and for the x_ray image_registration the proposed method performs significantly better than the two benchmark b spline approaches p the outline of this article is as follows the materials and results are presented in section and the proposed methods are described in section information regarding the a for general computer vision applications surf is able to identify corresponding features but b for biological_tissue images where local_features can be confusing surf performs poor on corresponding landmark detection implementation of the presented method is provided in section and a discussion is given in section image_registration is the process of overlaying two or more images of the same scene taken at different times from different viewpoints or using different capturing modules and a good image alignment_method has to take a number of issues into consideration including imperfect inputs such as aberrations and artifacts occlusion issues where many pixels in one image may not match with any pixel in another image and uniqueness issues where each pixel in an image has to uniquely map to a pixel of another image alignment of biological images is challenging as local image_features may appear confusing to one another and imperfect inputs are inevitable in this article a robust and fully_automatic registration method has been presented and demonstrated to be promising for aligning biological_tissue images and dental x_ray images moreover for the tissue image alignment the presented method outperforms five popularly adopted existing_approaches p based on tukeys hsd and lsd tests and performs consistently well for both types of data in our experiments and averaged registration accuracies for biological_tissue images and x_ray images respectively the presented image_registration algorithm is not limited to tissue images or dental x_ray scans but can also be applied to other anatomically or histologically defined medical data moreover as complex deformation problems are unavoidable in real_life data the presented technique will prove to be a substantial advantage for any application that requires image_registration
