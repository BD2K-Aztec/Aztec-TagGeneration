mass_spectrometry based protein identification with accurate statistical_significance assignment motivation assigning statistical_significance accurately has become increasingly important as metadata of many types often assembled in hierarchies are constructed and combined for further biological analyses statistical inaccuracy of metadata at any level may propagate to downstream_analyses undermining the validity of scientific conclusions thus drawn from the perspective of mass_spectrometry even though accurate statistics for peptide_identification can now be achieved accurate protein level statistics remain challenging results we have constructed a protein id method that combines peptide evidences of a candidate protein based on a rigorous formula derived earlier in this formula the database p value of every peptide is weighted prior to the final combination according to the number of proteins it maps to we have also shown that this protein id method provides accurate protein level e value eliminating the need of using empirical post_processing methods for type_i control using a known protein mixture we find that this protein id method when combined with the soricformulasoricsoricformula yields accurate values for the proportion of false_discoveries in terms of retrieval efficacy the results from our method are comparable with other methods tested

mass_spectrometry ms have become the central component in modern proteomics this component combined with additional_analyses routinely yields pragmatic metadata including protein id protein quantification protein_structure and protein associations these metadata especially the associated statistical_significance assignments need to be as accurate as possible because they often form the building_blocks for investigations at the systems_biology level and influence the scientific conclusions drawn henceforth in this article we focus on protein id in particular on improving the accuracy of statistical_significance assigned to proteins identified the need for robust developments towards accurate statistical_significance assignments has been advocated despite the existence of many protein id methods it has also been suggested that the primary cause of unreliable significance assignmentpublished by oxford university press this work is written by us government employees and is in the public_domain in the us the results will be described in the following order first we illustrate that our e value assignments are accurate at both the peptide and the protein levels we further show that using the formula proposed by soric soricsoric our reported pfds agree well with the targetdecoy pfds second our protein e value accuracy is compared with that of using the formulas in by extending the formula of soricforsoricsoricfor the method of we also evaluate the agreement between their reported pfds and the targetdecoy pfds benchmarking with some of the existing protein id methods will be described in the third part our investigation indicates that it is possible to achieve faithful protein p value assignment hence accurate type_i control in protein id since our approach is founded on a derived mathematical formula that requires accurate peptide e values as input it is evident that accurate protein p values require accurate statistical_significance at the peptide id level the discrepancy between the computed protein p value and the pfd results in our implementation of the method ofis interesting based on the results in the peptide p values are reasonably accurate albeit exhibiting slightly larger fluctuations than the results from raid dbs in addition to the possibility of accumulating uncertainty of peptides p values the other possibility is that the iterative procedure to choose the combination yielding the most significant z_score may skew the p values toward the significant side investigation of the origin of the pfd and p value discrepancy when using the method of however is beyond the scope of this study and might be most appropriately done by the authors of as explained earlier we allow more than one candidate peptide per spectrum to accommodate cofragmentation of multiple precursor ions with proximate masses when a low_resolution mass analyzer is used it can happen that more than one underlying peptide appears significant however readers may ask why do we choose to use dpvs for lower ranking peptides per spectrum instead of using ordered statistics the reason is that in this context using ordered statistics beyond the first is not meaningful the nth ordered statistics assumes that for a given query spectrum the best n scored peptides are spurious while the rank n peptide is the underlying peptide whose fragmentation yields the query spectrum this contradicts the general idea of using a scoring_function among candidate peptides of a query spectrum the better a peptide scores the more likely it is the underlying peptide on the other hand when using the dpv for the rank n peptide we are essentially assuming that the top n candidate peptides of the query spectrum are cofragmented underlying peptides and are not considered to be spurious the protein id method proposed in this article illustrates the possibility of accurate type_i control providing a theoretically sound significance assignment method that is also pragmatically simpler than the target_decoy approach this is particularly important since the number of identified proteins versus pfds provides trustworthy retrieval results only if the reported pfds truly reflects the proportion of false_discoveries evidently to achieve accurate type_i control is a task best done by developers of individual software only when this is accomplished can a true retrieval comparison among different methods be done since we did not focus on type_ii error there is definite room for improvement in terms of retrieval efficacy we note that the information of negatives segments of a candidate protein not covered by the proteins evidence peptides is not used we also believe that in principle scoring_functions for peptide id can also be improved to better separate true underlying peptides from false_positives currently we are using a flat peptide weight by the number of proteins a peptide covers it is perceivable that more sophisticated weighting may be useful in better separating true_positive proteins from false_positives it is our plan to investigate these avenues of improvement in the near future
