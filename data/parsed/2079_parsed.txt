glycomine a machine_learning based_approach for predicting n c and o linked glycosylation in the human_proteome motivation glycosylation is a ubiquitous type of protein post_translational ptm in eukaryotic_cells which plays vital roles in various biological_processes bps such as cellular_communication ligand recognition and subcellular recognition it is estimated that of the entire human_proteome is glycosylated however it is still a significant challenge to identify glyco sylation sites which requires expensive laborious experimental research thus bioinformatics approaches that can predict the glycan_occupancy at specific sequons in protein_sequences would be useful for understanding and utilizing this important ptm results in this study we present a novel bioinformatics tool called glycomine which is a comprehensive tool for the systematic in silico identification of clinked n linked and o linked glycosyla tion sites in the human_proteome glycomine was developed using the random_forest algorithm and evaluated based on a well prepared up to date benchmark_dataset that encompasses all three types of glycosylation_sites which was curated from multiple public resources heterogeneous sequences and functional features were derived from various sources and subjected to further two step feature_selection to characterize a condensed subset of optimal features that contributed most to the type specific prediction of glycosylation_sites five fold_cross and independent_tests show that this approach significantly_improved the prediction_performance compared with four existing prediction_tools netnglyc netoglyc ensemblegly and gpp we demonstrated that this tool could identify candidate glycosylation_sites in case study proteins and applied it to identify many high_confidence glycosylation target_proteins by screening the entire human_proteome availability_and the webserver java_applet user instructions datasets and predicted glycosylation_sites in the human_proteome are freely_available www structbioinfor org lab glycomine glycosylation is a dynamic enzymatic process where glycans or carbohydrates are attached selectively to proteins or lipoproteins glycosylation is an important and ubiquitous post_translational ptm and numerous studies have shown that glycosylation plays_a in various bps ranging from protein_folding subcellular_localization and degradation to extracellular recognition and cellcell interactions it is commonly understood that glycosylation occurs in all cellular_compartments and that of all polypeptides are covalently_modified serine s threonine t asparagine n and tryptophan w are the usual targets of protein_glycosylation glycosylation can modulate the physicochemical_and of proteins for example glycan_occupancy in a protein can influence the ligand binding_mode and affect its biological_activity it can also influence protein_stability and solubility as well as modifying the susceptibility to proteolysis glycosylation can be divided_into four main categories according to the chemical linkage between the specific acceptor amino_acid and the glycan i e n glycosylation o glycosylation cglycosylation or c mannosylation and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor attachment each of these types has characteristic sequons or sequence_motifs the three most abundant types of glycosylation i e n o and c glycosylation are of particular interest during n glycosylation the glycan is linked to the amide nitrogen in n residues the sequon for n glycosylation is n x t s or n x c in some rare cases where x can be any residue except proline during o glycosylation the glycan is attached to the hydroxy_groups of s and t side_chains no specific sequence_motifs are defined for o glycosylation although experimental_studies indicate that most o linked glycosylation_sites occur on s or t residues with a beta conformation that are in close_proximity to proline_residues in addition o glycosylation is frequent in secretory and membrane binding_proteins in a number of mammalian_species c glycosylation involves the attachment of the glycan to the carbon of the first w residue in the following sequence_motifs w x x w w x x c or w x x f the key to understanding the mechanisms and other functional_roles of glycosylation is identifying its substrates and the corresponding glycosylation_sites however the experimental detection of glycosylation_sites is still a challenging_task which often requires extensive laboratory work and considerable expense thus computational_approaches that accurately_predict the glycan_occupancy at specific sequons based on protein_sequence would be highly_valuable and they may provide_important the functional_roles of glycosylation this is very important because sequence_based analyses are currently the simplest and most readily deployed approach for predicting glycosylation targets and their respective glycosylation_sites a number of computational_approaches based on sequences or sequence derived information have been developed to address this task gupta and brunak developed netnglyc which is a web_tool based on neural_networks that predicts n glycosylation_sites from protein_sequences developed netoglyc based on sequence_context and surface_accessibility cornelia et_al used ensembles of support_vector svm classifiers to predict amino_acid that were likely to be glycosylated and implemented the ensemblegly web_server the svm classifiers were trained using a dataset of experimentally_determined n o and c linked glycosylation_sites in proteins extracted from the o glycbase database version hamby and hirst identified the pairwise patterns around glycosylation_sites and combined these with the predicted_secondary predicted surface_accessibility and hydrophobicity of the amino_acids to train random_forest rf based predictors in an effort to improve_the the developed gpp tool had an accuracy of for s for t and for n sites respectively based on an evaluation using a dataset of proteins and glycosylation_sites developed an svm based approach_called cksaap oglysite which employed a sequence_encoding scheme based on the composition of k spaced amino_acid cksaap to predict o linked glycosylation trained svm models using the local sequence_features around glycosylation_sites and the characteristic subcellular_localization of glycoproteins and achieved_accuracy for both n linked and o linked glycosylation_sites incorporation of structural_features around the glycosylated sites including the local contact order surface_accessibility and secondary_structure have proved useful for improving the prediction_accuracy of n glycosylation more recently developed an svm based tool glycoep based on the datasets with eukaryotic_proteins of c nand o linked glycosylation_sites glycoep yielded accuracy of and for prediction of n o and c linked glycosylation_sites respectively there has been considerable success in the development of useful approaches for glycosylation site prediction but several problems still exist in most of the currently available methods that need to be addressed to develop better methods as follows i the datasets used for model training are relatively small which limits the predictive_power of the method in particular many of the experimentally_verified novel glycosylation_sites that were discovered recently using high_throughput proteomic techniques were not included in the curated datasets ii the majority of the available methods only predict specific types of glycosylation_sites such as n or o glycosylation few methods exist that predict all three of the major types of glycosylation_sites with the exceptions of netnglyc netoglyc and svmglyc although they are outdated iii the feature_space used by existing_methods to construct models is incomplete and not comprehensive other potentially useful features also remain that need to be characterized iv biological_features are intrinsically heterogeneous noisy and multidimensional but most existing_methods do not employ feature_selection techniques to quantify the importance and the contributions of the features used for the model performance thereby leading to only a partial understanding of the sequence glycosylation relationships given these deficiencies it would be very useful to develop more accurate tools that facilitate the systematic prediction of all the major types of glycosylation in this study we propose a novel bioinformatics approach_called glycomine that addresses these problems and significantly_improves the prediction_performance for c n and o linked glycosylation by integrating various informative features derived from protein_sequences glycomine uses the rf algorithm coupled with a novel feature selection_strategy to boost the performance specifically an effective two step feature_selection method based on information_gain ig and minimum redundancy maximum relevance mrmr is used to determine the features that are important for glycosylation site_specificity as well as identifying condensed subsets of optimal features that contribute most to the prediction a fold_cross and independent_tests using curated datasets demonstrated that glycomine outperformed other tools including netnglyc netoglyc ensemblegly and gpp two case studies demonstrated that glycomine can be applied rapidly to accurately identify potential novel glycosylation_sites in a protein of interest in this study we developed a novel machine_learning approach_called glycomine for predicting c n and o linked glycosylation_sites in the human_proteome glycomine combines various informative features from multiple sources a two step feature_selection method based on mrmr or ig with ifs is used by glycomine to select the most contributory and useful features extensive crossvalidation and independent_tests using benchmark and independent datasets suggested that glycomine outperformed existing_tools gpp ensemblegly and netnglyc this study represents the first systematic effort to select and characterize the most important features that are relevant for predicting the three major types of glycosylation using intensive feature_selection techniques a_user and a java_applet are available as an implementation of this approach compared with experimental_approaches bioinformatics_tools such as glycomine can provide a powerful and cost_effective approach that allows the proteome_wide prediction of potential glycosylation_sites these predictions are likely to have a number of important_applications such as identifying novel glycosylated substrate proteins examining the effect of point_mutations on the gain or loss of glycosylation_sites and the rational_design of glycoproteins by inserting neo glycosylation_sites we consider that the web_server and java program will be useful tools for large_scale glycosylation site prediction and they may facilitate hypothesisdriven experimental_design
