fast and accurate prediction of protein side chain conformations we developed a fast and accurate side chain modeling program optimized side chain atomic energy oscar star based on orientation dependent energy_functions and a rigid rotamer model the average computing time was s per protein for test proteins with higher prediction_accuracy increase for and increase for than the best performing program developed by other groups we show that the energy_functions which were calibrated to tolerate the discrete errors of rigid rotamers are appropriate for protein loop selection especially for decoys without extensive structural refinement availability oscar star and the test proteins are available for download at http over the past_two much effort has been spent improving the accuracy or speed of side chain modeling_methods most methods exploit a limited number of representative conformations called rotamers at each residue position and use efficient_search algorithms to find a low_energy rotamer combination for the whole protein in spite of their efficiency rigid rotamers are inherently accompanied by a discrete error and not suited for physics based force_fields which are sensitive to small atomic_clashes the calculated energies can be quite different for the native_conformation and near native rotamers force_fields thus have to be modified by either scaling the atomic radii or using softer lennard_jones repulsive terms to reduce the influence of the steric clashes alternatively knowledge based coarse_grained energy_functions have been developed that can tolerate rigid rotamers while achieving high_accuracy a third approach is to use extremely detailed rotamer libraries or flexible rotamer models in combination with accurate energy_functions at the cost of speed recently we developed a side chain modeling program combining accurate orientation dependent optimized side chain atomic energy oscar o with a flexible rotamer model the prediction_accuracy was significantly_higher to whom correspondence should be addressed for and for than that of the next best method but the run time was as long as min for a single protein in this study we adopted oscar to a rigid rotamer model by modifying the distance_dependent component for fast side chain modeling the parameters of the orientation dependent functions were optimized so that decoy proteins with low rmsd root_mean from native structures could be distinguished from a pool of decoys obtained by perturbing the energy_functions and then modeling the entire protein the proposed methodology oscar star is very fast while maintaining high_accuracy
