gs align for glycan_structure alignment and similarity measurement motivation glycans play_critical many biological_processes and their structural_diversity is key for specific protein glycan recognition comparative structural studies of biological_molecules provide useful insight into their biological_relationships however most computational_tools are designed for protein_structure and despite their importance there is no currently available tool for comparing glycan_structures in a sequence_order and size independent_manner results a novel method gs align is developed for glycan_structure alignment and similarity measurement gs align generates possible alignments between two glycan_structures through iterative maximum clique search and fragment superposition the optimal alignment is then determined by the maximum structural similarity_score gs score which is size independent benchmark tests against the protein_data pdb n linked glycan library and pdb homologous non homologous n glycoprotein sets indicate that gs align is a robust computational_tool to align glycan_structures and quantify their structural_similarity gs align is also applied to template based glycan structure_prediction and monosaccharide substitution matrix generation to illustrate its utility availability_and http www glycanstructure org gsalign glycans are one of the four fundamental components of cells along with nucleic_acids proteins and lipids and the most abundant and diverse biopolymers in nature they are not only conjugated to proteins glycoproteins or lipids glycolipids but also exist as diffusible ligands protein_glycosylation is one of the most important post_translational with more than half of all proteins expected to be glycosylated protein_glycosylation falls into two general_categories n and o linked glycosylation n glycosylation links glycans to asn residues in the sequon asn x thr ser where x can be any amino_acid except pro of a nascent polypeptide n glycans whereas o linked glycosylation attaches glycans to ser and thr residues at sites which do not have a well defined sequence_motif o glycans in particular nglycosylation is needed for proper_folding of a protein as well as quality_control in the endoplasmic_reticulum based on the lipid type glycolipids can be classified into three main groups glycoglycerolipids glycosylphosphatidylinositols gpi and glycosphingolipids hyaluronic_acid is one of glycan diffusible ligands which is not linked to either proteins or lipids and is secreted into extracellular compartments glycans play_critical many biological_processes through covalent addition and or specific protein glycan recognition_events for example they interact with diverse proteins and are involved in cell_growth and development tumor_growth anticoagulation inflammation immune_tolerance intercellular_adhesion cell_cell and microbial attachment glycans come in a diversity of sequences and structures by linking individual sugar units in a multitude of ways they can be broadly classified as linear and branched sugars in terms of their sequence and both forms are present in glycoconjugates the majority of the linear sugars are glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronic_acid due to their flexible glycosidic_linkages glycans have an ensemble of diverse conformations and such a structural_diversity is essential for specific binding to their receptor_proteins for example the pentasaccharide of ganglioside_gm has different conformations upon binding to galectin and cholera_toxin in contemporary structural_biology the comparison and alignment of protein_structures are widely_employed in studies such as hierarchical classification of the known structural space of protein_domains inference of protein_function from structure and protein_structure modeling protein_structure comparison and alignment is a well established area and there are currently many publicly_available tools such as dali ce and tm_align the mammalian glycome encompasses a diverse and abundant repertoire of glycan_structures and could be larger than the proteome because of their significant roles in biology understanding glycan_structure and function in the context of their d structure is central to understanding biology despite the difficulties in crystallization the rate of deposition of glycan containing structures in the protein_data pdb has been steadily_increasing as demonstrated in protein structural_biology fast and accurate computational_tools for comparison and alignment of glycan_structures are crucial to take an integrated approach to advance glycan structure_function however developing a glycan_structure alignment_tool is challenging given the unique structural_features of glycans through different linkages and branching resulting in a tree like structure unlike proteins to the best of our knowledge there have been no such tools published to date to make a progress in the structural glycobiology field we introduce a novel method gs align for glycan_structure alignment and similarity measurement in particular gs align provides a sizeindependent structural similarity_score gs score below we first describe the alignment and scoring algorithms in details benchmark tests and representative examples are then presented to illustrate reliability and applicability of gs align finally we discuss both the advantages and limitations of our approach
