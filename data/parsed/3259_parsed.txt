sequence_analysis ngscat a tool to assess the efficiency of targeted enrichment sequencing motivation targeted enrichment sequencing by next_generation is a common approach to interrogate specific_loci or the whole exome in the human_genome the efficiency and the lack of bias in the enrichment process need to be assessed as a quality_control step before performing downstream_analysis of the sequence_data tools that can report on the sensitivity specificity uniformity and other enrichment specific features are needed results we have implemented the next_generation data capture assessment_tool ngscat a tool that takes the information of the mapped_reads and the coordinates of the targeted_regions as input_files and generates a report with metrics and figures that allows the evaluation of the efficiency of the enrichment process the tool can also take as input the information of two samples allowing the comparison of two different experiments availability_and documentation and downloads for ngscat can be found at http www bioinfomgp org ngscat next_generation ngs_technologies have opened new opportunities for inspecting and understanding genomic and transcriptomic sequences providing a wealth of new data whole_genome is now technically_feasible however it is still expensive to run and in many cases only specific_genomic are being sequenced for instance whole_exome is being extensively used to discover gene_mutations for hereditary diseases and high_throughput of gene panels is starting to be explored as a molecular diagnostic_tool thus targeted ngs has become a common tool for interrogating at once several loci or all coding_regions of the genome at a relatively low_cost target enrichment for high_throughput includes a capture step where probes are hybridized to complementary fragments of genomic_dna successful sequencing is highly dependent on the efficiency of this target enrichment procedure the degree of enrichment can be estimated before sequencing by quantitative_polymerase of a few target_regions only the analysis of the sequence_data can reveal the degree of enrichment for all regions of interest rois and can provide information on the whole capture process showing if any bias is present comparative_studies for target enrichment experiments have been carried_out by a number of works that allow to identify some critical aspects to evaluate i sensitivity to assess the quality of the coverage on target_regions ii specificity to measure the proportion of off target reads and iii uniformity to detect sequencing biases in the targeted_regions systematic detection of biases owing to the capture step is critical to save time and to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions from downstream_analysis currently the number of software_packages that allow systematic_assessment of the enrichment process is limited for instance there are some tools that may be used to get some general statistics for the coverage on off target reads and gc metrics like bedtools or picard tools http picard sourceforge net the functionality of these tools for capture efficiency assessment is limited and requires the implementation of complex scripts to produce informative results limiting their use to researchers with knowledge on scripting languages a more specific tool called teqc has recently been implemented in r but it has high requirements of ram memory when target_regions of the size of current exomes mb are analyzed ngsrich is another recent tool implemented_in intended to be used as part of a pipeline in a high_performance environment but it lacks of some functionality and its reporting is limited a comparison of ngs_data capture assessment_tool ngscat teqc and ngsrich is provided in the supplementary data we here present ngscat a linux command_line that allows a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the capture step in terms of sensitivity specificity and uniformity ngscat can be run on a standard computer and integrates the functionalities of the aforementioned tools extending them to generate a detailed report with metrics summary tables figures and plots that evaluate the efficiency of the targeted enrichment process to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com ngscat is a command_line application written in python that only requires as input a binary alignment map bam_file and a browser_extensible bed file describing the rois therefore the tool can handle data from all sequencing_platforms and can be easily integrated as part of automated analysis_pipelines ngscat implements an efficient multi_threaded processing enabling even a full execution for human exome data in a standard computer intel core duo gb ram the software calculates a number of graphs and statistics that allow to assess the performance of the enrichment steps thus ngscat reports the number and percentage of reads on off target the percentage of target bases covered at different coverage thresholds the number of duplicated reads on off target bedgraph tracks of off target_regions with high coverage the distribution of the coverage in the rois the variability of the coverage within the rois and the distribution of the coverage as a function of gc_content the program can also draw a saturation curve of the coverage as a function of the number of reads that can serve to estimate whether sequencing a higher number of reads will produce a significant increase of the coverage in the rois ngscat can also process two samples at a time which allows a simple comparison of two samples it can be used for the analysis of small target_regions as well as for larger regions like whole exomes see supplementary data the output is integrated in a concise and self explanatory html report for each report section a minimum threshold value can be set to produce a warning if the values of the tested experiment are beyond the preset threshold further documentation examples and updates can be found at http www bioinfomgp org ngscat to show how ngscat can assess the performance of the capture process three in house datasets targeting mb of the human_genome were used see supplementary data for analysis_pipeline details ngscat was used taking as input the bam_file and the bed file that describes the targeted_regions first we could check the percentage of target bases covered at different coverage thresholds and supplementary interestingly we found that of the targeted bases have at least a coverage which is a relatively low percentage and that the percentage of reads on target is which is a typical value for capture experiments suggesting that reads were properly enriched the coverage saturation curve tends to plateau at of covered positions and supplementary indicating that no more target bases with a coverage will be obtained by increasing sequencing_depth when ngscat was run with probe coordinates instead of roi coordinates of the bases were covered at in addition the inspection of the off target information files showed the presence of a number of off target_regions with a coverage higher than thus ngscat results allowed us to hypothesize that the low percentage of covered target bases could be due to the capture probe tiling and to an off target effect see supplementary data
