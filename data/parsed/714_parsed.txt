sequence_analysis betaseq a powerful novel method to control type_i inflation in partially sequenced data for rare_variant testing despite its great capability to detect rare_variant associations next_generation is still prohibitively_expensive when applied to large samples in case_control it is thus appealing to sequence only a subset of cases to discover variants and genotype the identified_variants in controls and the remaining cases under the reasonable assumption that causal_variants are usually enriched among cases however this approach leads to inflated_type if analyzed naively for rare_variant several methods have been proposed in recent_literature to control type_i at the cost of either excluding some sequenced cases or correcting the genotypes of discovered rare_variants all of these approaches thus suffer from certain extent of information_loss and thus are underpowered we propose a novel method betaseq which corrects inflation of type_i by supplementing pseudo variants while keeps the original sequence and genotype data intact extensive simulations and real_data analysis demonstrate that in most practical situations betaseq leads to higher testing powers than existing_approaches with guaranteed controlled or conservative type_i recent_advances in next_generation have made it possible to detect rare_variant associations in genetic_studies of complex_diseases while rare_variants tend to exert stronger_effects on complex_traits than common_variants accurate detection of rare_variant typically requires sequencing at least hundreds_or of individuals at high coverage which remains cost prohibitive for most investigators in the literature a two stage design is often adopted in rare_variant studies to reduce costs in the two stage design a subset of individuals are sequenced in stage to discover variants and the identified_variants are then genotyped on the remaining individuals in stage with a fixed budget this two stage design enjoys the advantage of increased sample_size at potentially influential variants and thus may achieve a higher testing power than a one stage approach in which all individuals used for association analysis are sequenced under the reasonable assumption that causal_variants are enriched in cases it is appealing to sequence only cases to improve power of association testing in the two stage design however as has been shown sequencing only cases leads to inflated_type if stage sequence and stage genotype data are simply combined because this partial_sequencing strategy causes the distribution of detected and thus tested variants to be different between cases and controls several methods have been proposed to correct this inflated_type among them using genotyped samples only gso and removing one variant carrier from the sequenced sample per variant nucleotide site rops manage to control type_i by dropping all or a subset of cases sequenced in stage gso and rops do not make full use of the genetic_information in a sample and thus inevitably incur loss in efficiency a more powerful method seqchip was proposed recently to correct the inflation created by such two stage partial_sequencing design instead of discarding some sequenced cases seqchip corrects genotypes of sequenced individuals in terms of the genotypes of genotyped individuals such that the corrected genotypes of sequenced individuals follow an almost identical distribution as those among genotyped individuals seqchip does not drop any individuals in the analysis and thus is potentially more efficient than gso and rops however seqchip suffers from abandoning some identified rare_variants during the correction process and is thus still underpowered moreover the minor_allele maf in seqchip can be slightly underestimated which may further impair the performance of seqchip clearly and intrinsically the inflated_type is due to only a portion of cases being sequenced motivated by the intuition that more variants would be discovered if the un sequenced individuals were also sequenced we propose betaseq a beta_distribution based method to correct inflation of type_i to whom correspondence should be addressed when sequencing only a subset of cases unlike existing_methods betaseq keeps all original sequence and genotype data intact and corrects inflation of type_i by supplementing pseudovariants to the original data the pseudo variants are meant to mimic the extra variants that would be discovered under the counterfactual situation where individuals genotyped in stage were also sequenced since no sequencing information is dropped betaseq has the potential to be more powerful than existing_methods the number of pseudo variants added by betaseq and their mafs are estimated on the basis of the algorithm proposed by ionita laza et_al betaseq can work with any existing rare_variant methods that use genotypes or imputed genotypes as input_data moreover unlike seqchip betaseq can be applied in situations where not only cases but also a small number of controls are sequenced extensive simulations were carried_out to evaluate the performance of betaseq and seqchip with three typical rare_variant methods the cumulative minor_allele test cmat extensions of the aggregated number of rare_variants anrv test and the variable threshold vt test in addition we also applied both betaseq and seqchip to a real sequencing dataset from the population_based colaus study with the three rare_variant tests results from simulations and real_data application demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing ones and establish that betaseq is effective for combining sequence and genotype data from the two stages for rare_variant testing in this article to control type_i of rare_variant testing a novel method is proposed to correct partially sequenced data in case_control in which only a subset of individuals mainly cases are sequenced to detect_variants and the discovered variants are genotyped in the remaining individuals different from all the existing_methods in literature which drop either some sequenced cases or some detected variants to control type i errors our method betaseq conducts an in silico sequencing on the un sequenced individuals by supplementing pseudo variants into them such that the spectrum of mafs in controls becomes approximately the same as that in cases meanwhile the original sequence and genotype data are keptintact all the existing rare_variant methods that use genotypes or imputed genotypes as input_data can be applied directly on the dataset corrected by betaseq besides the situations where only cases are sequenced betaseq can be applied when not only cases but also a small number of controls are sequenced betaseq can also be applied when study sample is stratified by some confounders and cases within each subgroup are partially selected out to sequence in that situation betaseq can be used within each subgroup stratified by confounders we demonstrated the performance of betaseq by three typical rare_variant tests vt anvr and cmat extensive simulations showed that when betaseq is used to correct partially sequenced data the inflation of type i errors of all the three variant association tests is well corrected type i errors under betaseq can be conservative when q percentage of sequenced cases is small but the conservativeness alleviates substantially as q increases the powers of the three tests under betaseq increase with q and are higher than those under seqchip in most scenarios when seqchip is used to integrate sequence and genotype data type i errors keep decreasing and eventually become conservative as q increases meanwhile powers increase first and then decrease under seqchip there exists an optimal fraction of cases to sequence to maximize testing power sequencing a larger number of samples may discover more causal_variants but does not necessarily improve testing power the optimal q depends on the underlying_disease model and other factors of the settings and needs to be decided on a case by case basis which renders explanation difficult and limits the practical utility of seqchip in this article we assume rare_variants in a genomic_region are deleterious if rare_variants are protective or exert_effects in both directions sequencing only cases may decrease testing power if rare_variants are assumed to be protective we should sequence only controls in stage because causal_variants are enriched in controls under that situation our algorithm can still be applied by supplementing pseudo variants to cases if we assume rare_variants exert_effects in both directions it is more appropriate to sequence both cases and controls in stage for causal_variant detection in that case variant ascertainment_bias and subsequently type_i control are likely no longer issues because betaseq and all other correction methods reviewed including seqchip is proposed under the design where corrections are unidirectional we have found not surprisingly that one sided tests benefit more from our method than quadratic methods like skat supplementary appendix i there is still room to improve the algorithm of supplementing pseudo variants into un sequenced individuals currently our method is based on a parametric beta_distribution to approximate the maf spectrum of biallelic variants in a given genomic_region in some situations real maf spectrum can depart from the beta_distribution assumption and then prediction of potential snps may become inaccurate a nonparametric approach may be adopted to improve prediction_accuracy moreover in step iii of our algorithm we simply make the number of variants
