data_and grammr graphical_representation and modeling of count_data with application in metagenomics motivation microbiota compositions have great implications in human_health such as obesity and other conditions as such it is of great_importance to cluster samples or taxa to visualize and discover community substructures graphical_representation of metagenomic count_data relies on two aspects measure of dissimilarity between samples taxa and algorithm used to estimate coordinates to study microbiota communities unifrac is a dissimilarity measure commonly used in metagenomic research but it requires a phylogenetic_tree principal coordinate analysis pcoa is a popular algorithm for estimating two_dimensional d coordinates for graphical_representation although alternative and higher dimensional representations may reveal underlying community substructures invisible in d representations results we adapt a new measure of dissimilarity penalized kendalls s distance which does not depend on a phylogenetic_tree and hence more readily_applicable to a wider class of problems further we propose to use metric multidimensional_scaling mds as an alternative to pcoa for graphical_representation we then devise a novel procedure for determining the number of clusters in conjunction with pam mpam we show superior performances with higher dimensional representations we further demonstrate the utility of mpam for accurate clustering analysis especially with higher dimensional mds models applications to two human_microbiota datasets illustrate greater insights into the subcommunity structure with a higher dimensional analysis the underlying subcommunity structure of data provides vital_information about the diversity of microbial_composition within the communities it is well established that human_microbiota samples collected from different body habitats show differences in bacterial composition microbiota in the same body habitat say gut may also vary wildly within and across populations which may have great implications in human_health such as on obesity and other conditions as such it is of great_importance to cluster samples or taxa to visualize and discover community substructures assigning the recorded gene sequences into different taxonomic ranks yields a matrix consisting of non negative integer values typically known as the metagenomic count matrix given a measure of distance between samples e g dissimilarity between counts in different rows see below principal coordinateanalysis pcoa is a standard_technique to place the samples on an euclidean coordinate space the aim is to represent the samples as points in a coordinate space so that under a specified metric the distance between any two points is representative of the dissimilarity between the samples which they represent the amount of information in the dissimilarity that is conveyed by pcoa is through the principal_components pcs which increases as the dimension of the coordinate space number of pcs increases however in practice a vast_majority of researches construct only two_dimensional d pcoa models for ease of presentation in several studies that used pcoa models the amount of variance explained by the first two pcs is very small and does not exceed this is because the dimension of the distance_matrix is equal to the sample_size which is typical high and thus it is very unlikely that two or three directions can explain a huge proportion of the variability an alternative to pcoa is metric multidimensional_scaling mds which is modeled by optimizing the difference between true dissimilarity and distance between estimated coordinates where the distance estimate is determined by the metric specified in fact when the metric is euclidean metric mds is equivalent to pcoa thus metric mds is a general class of dimension_reduction models that includes pcoa as a special_case for different metrics the shape of representation of the data is different for example in two dimensions the shape of the pcoa model is a circle while that of the l metric based mds model is a square studying graphical_representation of the samples under different norms might reveal features in the data that are not detected by pcoa an important aspect that drives pcoa representation of the data is the measure of dissimilarity between samples a popular measure of dissimilarity used in the metagenomic research_community is unifrac distance which is calculated by placing the samples on a phylogenetic_tree and counting the number of unshared branches between the two samples calculation of unifrac distance requires the phylogenetic_information in addition to the taxonomic count matrix as such unifrac is the measure of choice in studies where the s_rrna are recorded because the phylogenetic_tree an important feature of the s data can reveal relevant biological_signals when used appropriately this approach however is not practicable for studies in which the phylogenetic_tree is not readily available such as in shotgun_sequencing where one can only construct operational_taxonomic otus that best represent the samples for example through matching the shotgun sequences to a reference_database this calls for the development of a dissimilarity measure that can be used in the absence of a phylogenetic_tree since the data matrix comprises integer valued counts with some extreme_values regular l p norms may not be appropriate as an alternative we propose to use kendalls s distance as the measure of dissimilarity while s distance is originally proposed to compare two sets of rankings it can be easily extended to counts properties of the kendalls s distance are studied extensively and can be penalized to be applicable even when there are ties depending on the penalty imposed the kendalls distance may also be a metric hence metric mds models can be constructed without compromising the information although mds models are used mainly for graphical_representation of data they can also be used to study clustering given the true community membership of samples it is of interest to see if the graphical_models can visually separate the clusters for example in the metagenomic count_data described in body habitats from which the samples are collected can be used to aid visualization of the aptness of the estimated clusters for the gut_microbiome data of obese twins as another example attributes of the individuals such as ethnicity zygosity and obesity can be used to cluster samples to visually correlate with estimated clusters based on metagenomic count_data an interesting question that arises is to see how accurately clustering techniques such as partitioning around medoids pam perform as a follow_up step after metric mds modeling when clustering using pam the optimal_number is determined using the average silhouette width standard practice is to use the number of clusters that results in maximum silhouette width this however can result in introduction of uninformative clusters with minute increase in the silhouette width as an illustration consider supplementarywhich shows the silhouette width plot constructed for a dataset whose generating model was constructed based on the costello data as detailed in section the graph shows that maximum silhouette width is not the best representative of the optimal_number for this dataset for example consider the d l mds model in the graph the maximum silhouette width is obtained at clusters however the model attains a width of for clusters the last big jump before the increases become incremental gaining only in width while creating additional clusters similar phenomenon is observed for all the pcoa models in this article we propose to use the kendalls s distance as a measure of dissimilarity for metagenomic count_data when a phylogenetic_tree is not readily available we then construct metric mds models for varying dimensions focusing on dimensions for feasibility of visualization to study their aptness for representing metagenomic community substructures a modified silhouette width plot in conjunction with pam mpam is proposed as a novel measure for determining the number of clusters that discounts incremental increases these results are compared with their counterparts based on the pcoa models we would like to emphasize that the primary aim of this article is not to determine which of these methods is the best unequivocally but to carry out a comparison between them to make informed recommendations as an illustration to demonstrate the methods especially the outcomes when a higher dimension is used we applied the methods to analyzing two datasets in this article we present a novel tool for graphical_representation and clustering of metagenomic count_data in particular we propose mpam a modified silhouette width measure for determining the number of clusters in conjunction with the pam clustering method in addition we investigated and compared two methods for dimension_reduction with different number of dimensionality in the projected space results from simulation clearly indicate the need to explore projections to a dimension greater than two we further demonstrate the use of the novel tool for two datasets that would benefit from being considered from a higher dimensional perspective while the original distance_matrix without being projected into a lower dimensional_space can be used directly for clustering mpam clustering based on the projected data is in fact advantageous due to better separation obtained from minimizing the stress function in l mds especially if the projected dimension is relatively large say d we illustrate this using data generated from model ii supplementary_materials s and kendalls s distance is proposed to be used as a measure of dissimilarity for metagenomic count_data which is a useful tool for multidimensional modeling when the phylogenetic_tree is not available however calculation of the s distance is computationally_intensive with the computation time being on k where n is the number of samples and k is the number of otus a study on the computational time taken to compute the kendalls s distance using grammr for various sample_sizes and otus is provided in supplementary_materials s and for example for a dataset with samples and otus it took a little bit over min to complete the computation we note that there are several potential methods that can lead to speed up of the computation which will be considered in a future release of grammr a general class of metric mds models is proposed for dimension_reduction enabling informative graphical visualization of data side_by barplots of the relative_frequencies of biases in the estimated numbers of clusters mpam left bar and pam right bar for d l mds two_dimensional l mds models displaying the four estimated clusters for taxa using the gut samples name of the taxa corresponding each sample point are provided as labelsthe popular pcoa model with two_dimensional projection is in fact a special_case of this class comparison of pcoa and another metric mds model l mds for two simulation_models appears to show that pcoa frequently underestimate the true number of clusters although the biases tend to get smaller with a higher dimensional projection regardless of which metric mds model is used the benefit of using a dimension greater than two is clearly demonstrated in both the simulation and the real_data applications while twodimensional models are easier to present on paper and thus popular we would like to emphasize the benefit of higher dimensional representations and that our method and accompanying software provide an interactive visualization_tool for examining results for dimensions up to four as seen in simulation_studies higher dimensional models reduce error of misclassification also the optimal_number used in these models gets closer to the true number of clusters with an increase in dimension while a single graphical_representation of a dimension greater than three is not feasible one can construct representations selecting three directions at a time to get a series of rotatable d plots for closer examination this however is not recommendable for dimensions much greater than as the number of such representations increases at a polynomial rate
