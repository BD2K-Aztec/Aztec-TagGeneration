the mi bundle enabling network and structural_biology in genome visualization_tools prioritization of candidate_genes emanating from large_scale screens requires integrated analyses at the genomics molecular network and structural_biology levels we have extended the integrated genome_browser igb to facilitate these tasks the graphical_user greatly_simplifies building disease networks and zooming in at atomic_resolution to identify variations in molecular complexes that may affect molecular_interactions in the context of genomic_data all results are summarized in genome tracks and can be visualized and analyzed at the transcript_level availability_and the mi bundle is a plugin for the igb the plugin help video and tutorial are available atlarge scale genomics initiatives aim at systematically cataloguing the complete spectrum of genomic changes in diverse biological and clinical conditions and to elucidate the contribution of those changes to the pathogenesis of disease these initiatives routinely produce long lists of candidate_genes that must be prioritized before more detailed functional studies are warranted prioritization of candidates ideally should take advantage of the entire range of available data and produce an integrated picture that permits evaluating the contribution of individual genes to the pathogenic_process on a data_driven basis however the heterogenic nature of data and bioinformatics_tools to manipulate them places numerous hurdles on the way in particular for biologists with limited bioinformatics skills we have developed a plug in for integrated genome_browser igb to facilitate candidate prioritization based on network and structural_biology criteria in the context of diverse genomic_data types that can be loaded as browser tracks the plugin permits analyzing how genomic_variations in particular missense_mutations may affect the interaction between gene_products and other molecules as well as their interference with biological_pathways based on the most updated standards and resources available for network and structural_biology based on their observation of the property of disease_causing mosca et_al developed dsysmap a web_server that allows mapping mutations provided as amino_acid to the structures and models of human proteinprotein_interactions structureppi propose a similar strategy that mechismo extends to proteinnucleic acid and protein_ligand and an assessment of the impact of the mutation on the binding_properties of the molecules the integration of our plugin into a genome_browser provides genome biologists access to network and structural analysis the analyses start from genomic_regions allowing their integration with sequencing pipelines managed by igb and to be independent of any preliminary mapping to the protein_sequences the possibility to select the source database extends the range of possible analyses even when no structures are available it helps identifying new connections and functional_relationships between target_genes moreover each new session queries public online_databases each query can be repeated to benefit from new data released in molecular_interaction and structure databases finally the bundle benefits from all the features and future_developments of igb including the many species available e g mouse a thaliana and e coli
