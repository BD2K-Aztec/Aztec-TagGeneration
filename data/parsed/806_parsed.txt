data_and bnfinder faster bayesian_network learning and bayesian classification bayesian_networks bns are versatile probabilistic_models applicable to many different biological_phenomena in biological_applications the structure of the network is usually unknown and needs to be inferred from experimental_data bnfinder is a fast software implementation of an exact algorithm for finding the optimal structure of the network given a number of experimental_observations its second version presented in this article represents a major improvement over the previous version the improvements include i a parallelized learning algorithm leading to an order of magnitude speed ups in bn structure_learning time ii inclusion of an additional scoring_function based on mutual_information criteria iii possibility of choosing the resulting network specificity based on statistical criteria and iv a new module for classification by bns including cross_validation scheme and classifier quality measurements with receiver_operator scores availability_and bnfinder is implemented in python and freely_available under the gnu_general at the project_web https launchpad net bnfinder together with a users manual introductory tutorial and supplementary methods
