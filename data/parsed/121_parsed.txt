sequence_analysis a deeper look into transcription regulatory code by preferred pair distance templates for transcription_factor motivation modern experimental methods provide_substantial information on proteindna recognition studying arrangements of transcription_factor tfbss of interacting transcription_factors tfs advances understanding of the transcription regulatory code results we constructed binding_motifs for tfs forming a complex with hif at the erythropoietin enhancer corresponding tfbss were predicted in the segments around transcription_start tsss of all human genes using the genome_wide set of regulatory_regions we observed several strongly preferred distances between hypoxia responsive_element hre and binding_sites of a particular cofactor protein the set of preferred distances was called as a preferred pair distance template ppdt ppdt dramatically depended on the tf and orientation of its binding_sites relative to hre ppdt evaluated from the genome_wide set of regulatory_sequences was used to detect significant ppdt consistent binding_site pairs in regulatory_regions of hypoxia responsive_genes we believe ppdt can help to reveal the layout of eukaryotic regulatory segments contact the regulatory code controlling gene_expression in higher_eukaryotes still remains_elusive it is challenging to understand how a d dna text directs formation of the protein complex that controls gene_expression in a particular cell_type in specific conditions some insight is gained by using the well known concept of composite elements consisting of binding_sites for different regulatory_proteins separated by specific distances despite more than years of study information about the scale and specificity of possible distances between binding_sites remains insufficient to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address computational bioscience research_center king abdullah university of science and technology kaust thuwal saudi_arabia new technologies like chip_seq have dramatically_increased the quality of identification of tfbss both in vitro and in vivo recently it was shown that in some cases there are several preferred distances between binding_sites of some tfs here we illustrate that distance preferences themselves are extremely well exhibited and that this phenomenon appears to be much more common at least in the case of homo_sapiens tfs involved in regulating responses for hypoxic_conditions we studied distributions of distances between tfbss identified in silico for tfs involved in known proteinprotein_interactions as a case study we took tfs participating in the regulation of the erithropoetin epo gene_expression in hypoxia response in human cells hypoxia regulated set is enriched with ppdt consistent binding_site pairs shows k n ratio p values for the pairs of hre hre and hresp binding_sites estimated using genome_wide ppdts supplementarydisplay similar graphs for hre and other cofactor binding_sites in different orientations better lower p values are exhibited for small k n threshold levels specifically this means that regulatory_regions of hypoxia dependent genes often exhibit at least one ppdt consistent pair of hrecofactor tfbs the k n ratio test demonstrated that positioning of the following tfbs pairs can be used to distinguish the hypoxia regulated set from page the genome_wide set hre p direct orientation hrehre direct orientation hresp both orientations hresmad reverse orientation preferred locations of other tfbs pairs were not exhibited in the hypoxia regulated gene_set which may indicate that the binding of these tfs in such an orientation is not characteristic for regulation of hypoxia response or that in this case tf_binding pattern is so complex that it cannot be easily recovered with the help of hre centered ppdts intersite distance preferences are stable and prevalent ppdds are obviously sensitive to motif modifications or changes of pwm score threshold still general patterns of distance preferences are quite stable and seem not to be a specific feature of the particular model for the hre or another tfbs supplementaryshows the hrehre and hresp ppdds for different motif thresholds supplementaryshows the comparison for ppdds obtained for transfac pwms and our pwms constructed with chipmunk supplementaryshows genome_wide ppdds centered at sp_binding instead of hre used as the anchoring element elsewhere in this article mystery of low transcription regions in fact hif can regulate hundreds of genes different studies report dramatically different sets of hif a targets see e g venn_diagram in since we could not reliably guess which genes were not regulated by hif and thus could be taken as the negative control set we tried to compare our findings with dna sequence_segments performing low transcription activity or no transcription activity at all to this end we selected a set of dna_segments located far from any dna region for which transcription activity was demonstrated in tss calling experiments see the description of the set in the section and section in supplementary_material surprisingly in the low transcription regions ppdd peaks were exhibited even more explicitly than in the genome_wide set supplementary meanwhile the relative number of binding_site pairs in this case was much lower than in the genome_wide set supplementary we failed to provide an exhaustive explanation of a clearer ppdd for the low transcribed dataset yet it is noteworthy that preparation of the genome_wide dataset included the merging of regions centered at closely located alternative tsss it is possible that the genomewide ppdd includes distances measured between tfbss belonging to different homotypic clusters which regulate_transcription from different tsss and this interference smears the ppdd moreover we counted the number of cage tags located in three subsets of low transcription regions set the first having no hre hre or hresp binding_site pairs the second having pairs at any distance not consistent with ppdt within bp hre centered windows and the third having pairs of tfbs at ppdt consistent distances according to ppdt evaluated from the genome_wide set supplementarydisplays the median of the number of cage tags per sequence the sequences with binding_site pairs located at ppdt consistent distances tend to be relatively enriched with cage tags thus we suggest that the ppdt consistent binding_site pairs found in low transcription regions are somehow linked to nearby transcriptionally active_regions in our previous work we reported the observation that a large genome_wide set of long segments exhibits some peaks in the distribution of distances between tfbss of interacting tfs in this study we introduce the concept of ppdt a set of selected preferred distances between tfbss which as we demonstrate are expected to be found in the regulatory_regions of genes regulated by the corresponding tfs preferred distances between tfbs for different tf pairs form substantially different sets but in all cases a general_pattern of a peak comb over a background of more or less random distances is observed it is tempting to believe that binding_sites found at ppdt inconsistent distances are likely to form complexes with tfs other than hif or simply are false_positives of pwm scanning yet ppdt found in the low transcribed regions allows the conclusion that there might be some yet unknown factor_controlling possible tfbs positioning in dna obviously ppdd ts provide_additional on the specificity of tf_binding especially when the total number of putative tfbss in the regulatory_regions is small however the difficulties of using ppdd ts for identification of functional_binding should not be underestimated binding_site arrangements in regulatory dna_segments are complex with sites often overlapping each other most of the sequences in the hypoxia regulated dataset contain homotypic clusters of hre so when one calculates all pairwise_distances between binding_sites of two transcription_factors the number of observed intersite distances becomes large paradoxically the worst display of preferred distances is in the hypoxia regulated dataset supplementary this happens because this dataset is rather small containing only sequences of which do not contain any hre elements many sequences contain only one or two pairs of binding_sites of the specified type in the hypoxia regulated dataset each distance is rarely found more often than five times thus most numbers of preferred distance occurrences are statistically_insignificant and the ppdd t pattern is unclear this makes_it to conclude whether the hypoxiaregulated set really has some major characteristic differences in ppdds when compared with the genome_wide set another paradox is that ppdts for hresp and hrehre homotypic site pairs estimated on the genome_wide gene_set can be efficiently used to distinguish the hypoxia regulated set this page
