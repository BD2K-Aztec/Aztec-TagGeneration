a time varying group sparse additive_model for genome_wide of dynamic complex_traits motivation despite the widespread popularity of genome_wide gwas for genetic_mapping of complex_traits most existing gwas methodologies are still limited to the use of static phenotypes measured at a single time point in this work we propose a new method for association_mapping that considers dynamic phenotypes measured at a sequence of time points our approach relies on the use of time varying group sparse additive models tv groupspam for high_dimensional functional regression results this new model detects a sparse set of genomic_loci that are associated with trait dynamics and demonstrates increased statistical_power over existing_methods we evaluate our method via experiments on synthetic data and perform a proof_of analysis for detecting single_nucleotide associated with two phenotypes used to assess asthma_severity forced_vital a sensitive measure of airway_obstruction and bronchodilator response which measures lung response to bronchodilator drugs availability_and source_code for tv groupspam freely_available for download atthe goal of genome_wide gwas is to analyze a large set of genetic_markers that span the entire_genome in order to identify loci that are associated with a phenotype of interest over the past_decade gwas has been used to successfully_identify genetic_variants that are associated with numerous_diseases and complex_traits ranging from breast_cancer to blood_pressure however a significant challenge in performing gwas is that the studies are often vastly under powered due to the high_dimensionality of the feature_set relative to the small number of human samples available traditional gwas methodologies test each variant independently for association with the phenotype and use a stringent significance threshold to adjust for multiple_hypothesis although this approach works well for traits that depend on strong effects from a few loci it is less suitable for complex polygenic traits that are influenced by weak effects from many different genetic_variants more recently a significant body of work has emerged on penalized_regression approaches for gwas that capture the joint effects of all markers the majority of these methods model the phenotype as a weighted_sum of the genotype values at each locus and use a regularization penalty such as the norm to identify a sparse set of single_nucleotide snps that are predictive of the trait although this technique helps to reduce overfitting and detect fewer spurious snp trait associations the lack of statistical_power to identify true associations persists here we aim to further boost the statistical_power of gwas by proposing a new model that leverages dynamic trait data in which a particular trait is measured in each individual repeatedly over time as depicted in such datasets are often generated by longitudinal_studies that follow participants over the course of months years or even decades though broadly available dynamic trait datasets are frequently underutilized by practitioners who ignore the temporal_information we believe that leveraging time sequential trait measurements in gwas can lead to greater statistical_power for association_mapping to illustrate this concept consider the hypothetical patterns of snp influence on the phenotype shown in as in traditional gwas an association between a snp and the phenotype exists if the three snp genotypes which we denote aa aa and aa have differential_effects on the trait in the first example the effects of the three snp genotypes only differ in the t time interval a static method that uses data from an arbitrarily chosen time point or simply treats the time series as i i d samples could easily miss this association whereas a dynamic method that considers the entire dataset would detect it the second example shows a snp in which the difference between the effects of the three genotypes is small but consistent over time although this signal could be too weak to be interpreted as a significant association in the static case it gets much stronger once evidence from the entire time series is considered the longitudinal data setting is challenging because traits are measured at irregularly spaced time points over subject specific intervals one approach that has been proposed for performing gwas of dynamic traits called functional gwas or fgwas constructs a separate model to estimate the smooth time varying influence of each snp on the phenotype once the mean effects have been estimated for each genotype at each time point a hypothesis_test is performed to determine_whether the snp has any additive or dominant effect on the trait although the use of dynamic trait data gives fgwas more statistical_power than a standard hypothesis_test on static data the principal drawback of this method is that it is inappropriate for modeling complex_traits that arise from interactions between genetic effects at different loci a related approach extends the fgwas framework to model multiple_snps at once using a bayesian group_lasso framework although this approach seems promising it is severely limited by its very slow mcmc inference procedure there are a number of other methods that have been developed for dynamic trait gwas including and li and sillanp a a however the majority of them either perform single locus analysis as in fgwas or fail to learn an explicit interpretable representation of the dynamic effects of the genetic_variants at each locus the notable_exception to this is fgwas with bayesian group_lasso which we directly compare to our approach in a later section in this work we introduce a new penalized multivariate regression_approach for gwas of dynamic quantitative_traits in which the phenotype is modeled as a sum of nonparametric time varying snp effects we call this time varying group sparse additive models or tv groupspam our method is based on groupspam a non parametric regression_model with a groupstructured penalty over the input_features which we extend to capture the dynamic effects of snps this model has three major_advantages over existing_approaches i we leverage dynamic trait data ii we model the contribution of each snp to the phenotype as a smooth function of time and explicitly learn these influence patterns iii we model the combined effects of multiple_snps on the phenotype and select a sparse subset that participate in the model thereby identifying meaningful snp trait associations we show that tv groupspam exhibits desirable empirical advantages over baseline methods on both simulated_and in this work we propose a new approach to gwas that bridges the gap between existing penalized regression_methods such as the lasso and group_lasso and dynamic trait methods such as fgwas our approach uses penalized_regression to identify a sparse set of snps that jointly influence a dynamic trait this is a challenging_task for several reasons first we must contend with high_dimensional which necessitates that we regularize the model to perform variable_selection second we do not know the true underlying model by which each snp acts on the phenotype and therefore we must avoid making parametric assumptions about these patterns third we assume that snp effects vary smoothly over time which means that we cannot apply a standard multi task regression_model that treats the time series as a set of unordered traits although tv groupspam achieves significantly better performance on synthetic data than existing_methods there are still certain challenging aspects of genome_wide association_mapping that are not addressed by this approach one of these is the task of rare_variant detection although our method is robust to detecting spurious effects from rare_variants we are also not able to detect true effects from rare_variants with high power this is due to the lack of data available for the aa_genotype in snps with very low minor allelegrowth factor b has pro_inflammatory as well as anti_inflammatory and has been linked to asthma and airway_remodeling cyp a cyp a rab b mia eglndgenes located in a known copd locus a time varying group sparse additive_model for gwasfrequency because we estimate a separate effect function for each snp genotype we are unable to accurately estimate f aa when there are very few data_points corresponding to this genotype modifying tv groupspam to more accurately detect the effects of rare_variants would be an interesting direction for future work
