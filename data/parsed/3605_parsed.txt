structural_bioinformatics pool server machine_learning application for functional site prediction in proteins we present an automated web_server for partial order optimum likelihood pool a machine_learning application that combines computed electrostatic and geometric information for high performance prediction of catalytic_residues from d structures input_features consist of thematics electrostatics data and pocket information from concavity thematics measures deviation from typical sigmoidal titration behavior to identify functionally_important and concavity identifies binding_pockets by analyzing the surface geometry of protein_structures both thematics and concavity structure only do not require the query_protein to have any sequence or structure similarity to other proteins hence pool is applicable to proteins with novel folds and engineered proteins as an additional option for cases where sequence homologues are available users can include evolutionary_information from intrepid for enhanced accuracy in site prediction availability the web_site is free and open to all users with no login requirements at http www pool over the past_decade structural_genomics sg projects have accumulated structural data for over proteins but most of them are of unknown or uncertain function thus there is high_demand for computational_methods to predict function from structure computational site predictors provide_valuable for function_annotation and they are also useful to guide and accelerate mechanistic ligand_binding and protein_engineering studies a variety of sequence_based exist but these often suffer from poor precision compared with structure based_methods modern_methods use both sequence and structural_information to enhance the performance of active_site prediction recently we have reported a new machine_learning partial order optimum likelihood pool which uses input_features from thematics and outperforms many of the best prior methods thematics for theoretical microscopic anomalous titration curve shapes uses computed electrostatic properties and identifies functionally_important ionizable residues based on their deviation from hendersonhasselbalch hh titration behavior in addition we have also shown that integration of other structure and sequence_features along with thematics data can further boost the performance of pool with the combined input of electrostatic information from thematics evolutionary_information from intrepid and pocket information from concavity pool achieves and recall of annotated functional_residues at and false_positive respectively on a standard test_set of unique wellcharacterized enzymes using the top of pool ranked residues the functionally_important are predicted with recall and specificity the top of the pool ranked residues yields a prediction with recall and specificity furthermore information about the verification and performance of the pool method is provided in the supplementary_material herein we describe a web_server for pool the user submits a protein_structure and the server automatically performs thematics and concavity calculations to obtain the input_features for pool calculations intrepid is a separate web_server and hence cannot be integrated automatically but users are provided with the option to obtain the results from intrepid and include them in the submission to the pool server the pool server returns a list of all residues rank ordered according to their probability of functional_importance the top_ranked residues constitute the functional site prediction
