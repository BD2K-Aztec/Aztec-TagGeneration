efficient spatial segmentation of large imaging mass_spectrometry datasets with spatially aware clustering motivation imaging mass_spectrometry ims is one of the few measurement technology s of biochemistry which given a thin sample is able to reveal its spatial chemical_composition in the full molecular range ims produces a hyperspectral image where for each pixel a high_dimensional mass_spectrum is measured currently the technology is mature enough and one of the major problems preventing its spreading is the under development of computational_methods for mining huge ims datasets this article proposes a novel approach for spatial segmentation of an ims dataset which is constructed considering the important issue of pixel to pixel variability methods we segment pixels by clustering their mass_spectra importantly we incorporate spatial relations between pixels into clustering so that pixels are clustered together with their neighbors we propose two methods one is non adaptive where pixel neighborhoods are selected in the same manner for all pixels the second one respects the structure observable in the data for a pixel its neighborhood is defined taking_into similarity of its spectrum to the spectra of adjacent pixels both methods have the linear complexity and require linear memory space in the number of spectra results the proposed segmentation_methods are evaluated on two ims datasets a rat_brain section and a section of a neuroendocrine_tumor they discover anatomical_structure discriminate the tumor region and highlight functionally_similar regions moreover our methods provide segmentation maps of similar or better quality if compared to the other state of the art methods but outperform them in runtime and or required memory contact theodore math uni bremen degiven a thin sample usually a tissue slice imaging mass_spectrometry ims measures high_dimensional mass_spectra at its spatial points providing a hyperspectral image with a mass_spectrum measured at each pixel each mass_spectrum dimension represents the abundance of molecules with this molecular_mass currently ims is one of the few biochemical technologies able to establish the spatial biochemical composition of the sample in the full molecular range small and large_molecules e g metabolites lipids and proteins since s secondary_ion was the main ims technique for surface analysis although being unable to measure large_molecules e g peptides and proteins with the to whom correspondence should be addressed advent of matrix_assisted maldi imaging mass_spectrometry the measurement of peptides and proteins became possible what opened ims a door to the variety of biological and biomedical problems currently ims is one of the most promising innovative measurement techniques in biochemistry ims has proven its potential in discovery of new drugs and cancer biomarkers just to mention a few important_applications ims was used in numerous studies leading to understanding chemical_composition and biological_processes see recent_reviews on this topic amstalden van as for many modern biochemical_techniques in particular in proteomics the development of computational_methods for ims is lagging behind the technological_progress two unsupervised problems are currently considered in ims data_processing i data representation using principal_component pca and its variants the technique standardly used for processing sims data and ii spatial segmentation of an ims dataset by means of spectra or pixels clustering concerning the second problem the spatial segmentation of an ims dataset several approaches have been proposed first straightforward clustering of mass_spectra e g k means second feature_extraction with pca and then hierarchical_clustering of features hierarchical_clustering has an advantage of interactive analysis of the clustering dendrogram but needs to keep in memory the full distance_matrix several work arounds have been proposed but none is accepted as a standard the main_drawback of using straightforward clustering of mass_spectra is that it is negatively_affected by the pixel to pixel variability issue which is especially serious in the most popular ims techniques sims and maldiims underestimation of this issue leads to strong noise in the resulted segmentation maps as we show later the method_combining pca with hierarchical_clustering is also prone to this problem we have recently_proposed a spatial segmentation_method solving this important issue where edge preserving spatiallyadaptive denoising is applied to gray_scale images of selected masses prior to clustering the produced segmentation maps are significantly better than those produced without using denoising in terms of lack of noise discrimination of anatomical and histological details and the number of visible regions however these improvements are achieved in full at a cost of using a computationally intensivepage i i i in this section we analyze in detail the results for the rat_brain dataset then we show segmentation maps for the neuroendocrine_tumor dataset clustering_algorithm k means was selected as a clustering_algorithm after the fastmap projection because it is a fast and reliable algorithm moreover k means optimizes the euclidean_distances between the points see e g chapter of publicly_available online thus performing k means in the space after fastmap projection for both sa and sasa is equivalent to minimize the within point scatter between spectra where the distance between two spectra is calculated using equations or no mass wise processing in denoising of each gray_scale image corresponding to a mass channel selected after peak_picking is performed naturally a channel wise processing may be criticized as being prone to lose information presented in a combination of channels in our methods sa and sasa we never do channel wise processing but consider the full spectra fastmap dimension q as discussed in section the fastmap dimension q is the most tricky parameter we have done a computational study_investigating the properties of the fastmap projection and observed that increase of q changes the distances between projections but only until some value after this value the distances between projections stay almost unchanged investigating this question can lead to a way of choosing q and more generally to the way of finding the intrinsic dimension of a set of points evaluation the evaluation of produced results is an important problem especially in an unsupervised framework where no simple criterion like total recognition_rate can be computed we have tested the silhouette criterion of separation between found clusters but have not found correspondence between the value of criterion and the visual_quality of the maps probably this might be explained by no clear separation between clusters in general the evaluation of a spatial segmentation remains an important and unsolved_problem in imaging mass_spectrometry data_processing where no reference or simulated_data are provided yet other publications on ims segmentation e g do not consider this question and present their methods as a data_mining tool with extensive support from histologists or biologists estimating the quality of the produced segmentation maps this is explained by the novelty of this problem and the lack of existing problems and research groups solving this problem certainly in the nearest future the formal evaluation will be necessary in particular for comparing results of different segmentation however any formal evaluation is a complicated task since it requires the ground_truth maps for a complex enough dataset we are working in this direction and hope to present some results soon in this article which is based mostly on work by our aim was to construct an efficient algorithm delivering segmentation maps of at least comparable quality for the datasets fromwhere comparison is done visually i
