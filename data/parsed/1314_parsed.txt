sequence_analysis deml robust demultiplexing of illumina sequences using a likelihood_based approach_motivation pooling multiple samples increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of dna sequenc ing one approach to multiplexing is to use short dna indices to uniquely identify each sample after sequencing reads must be assigned in silico to the sample of origin a process referred to as demultiplexing demultiplexing software typically identifies the sample of origin using a fixed number of mismatches between the read index and a reference index set this approach may fail or misassign reads when the sequencing quality of the indices is poor results we introduce deml a maximum_likelihood algorithm that demultiplexes illumina sequences deml computes the likelihood of an observed index sequence being derived from a specified sample a quality_score which reflects the probability of the assignment being correct is generated for each read using these quality_scores even very problematic datasets can be demultiplexed and an error threshold can be set availability_and deml is freely_available for use under the gplwhile the high_throughput of next_generation is beneficial for many applications such as high coverage whole_genome it may be economically disadvantageous for the sequencing of small numbers of loci it is possible to sequence large number of samples in a single run by incorporating unique_sequence indices for each sample a process referred to as multiplexing current illumina protocols allow for or index sequences to be used the computational process by which reads are assigned to the sample of origin is called demultiplexing the default demultiplexer provided by illumina in the casava package allows for or mismatches between the sequenced index and the user supplied reference indices various heuristics have been proposed to assign reads to their sample of origin although these methods perform well for sequencing_reads with high_quality poor demultiplexing remains a common reason for low retrieval or misassignment of sequences from a multiplexed run increased error ratesparticularly during sequencing of the index can lead to a higher number of mismatches and hinders assignment to the correct sample for some applications high read error_rates can be tolerated as long as the reads can be mapped to the reference e g transcriptome quantification we introduce deml a new approach to demultiplexing samples based on likelihood of assignment to a particular sample and provide a freely_available open_source c implementation briefly we compute the likelihood of a read to originate from each of the original samples assign reads to the most likely sample of origin and compute the overall confidence in this assignment we show that by using thresholds on these confidence values even very problematic datasets can be safely demultiplexed by simulating increasing error in the indices we show that especially at high_error deml with default quality cutoffs enables the user to demultiplex several fold more sequences than the vendors default demultiplexer or other methods based on fixed mismatches the false_discovery fdr remains below that of other tools based on hamming_distance deml licensed under the gpl can run on aligned or unaligned bam_files or fastq_files of the total of clusters that were detected in our test_dataset clusters had both forward and reverse reads aligning to the human control region and to the phix using the sample assignment provided by deml for the reads mapping to the phix the rate of false assignment was computed as a functionresults as z measures the probability of misassignment given the potential index sequence set on a phred scale the relationship between the misassignment rate on a log scale and the z_score should be linear for reads where both mates aligned to the phix the misassignment rate was computed by considering any read_pair not assigned by deml to the phix as a mislabeling as z can take many discrete values the misassignment rate was plotted for multiple z value bins see deml retrieves more sequences and achieves a lower fdr than currently available approaches seeand supplementary results
