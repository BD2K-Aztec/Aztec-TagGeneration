sequence_analysis latcom a web_server for visualizing rare_codon in coding_sequences we present latcom a new web_tool which offers several alternative_methods for rare codon cluster rcc identification from a single and simple graphical_user in the current version three rcc detection schemes are implemented the recently described minmax algorithm and a simplified sliding_window approach along with a novel modification of a linear time algorithm for the detection of maximally scoring subsequences tailored to the rcc detection problem among a number of user tunable parameters several codon based scales relevant for rcc detection are available including trna abundance values from escherichia_coli and several codon_usage tables from a selection of genomes furthermore useful scale transformations may be performed upon user request e g linear sigmoid users may choose to visualize rcc positions within the submitted sequences either with graphical_representations or in textual form for further processing availability latcom is freely_available online at the url http troodos biol ucy ac cy latcom html trna abundance is asymmetric non uniform in cells of different organisms and can cause variation in the translation rate for each codon it has been suggested that rare codons and their clusters are associated with translational pausing the translational rate can be maximized at mrna regions with codons read by high cellular levels of cognate trna species and minimized at sites corresponding to rare trnas rccs a critical issue is that the concentration of isoaccepting trnas for a set of synonymous codons varies among organisms tissues and stages of differentiation moreover different organisms show specific preferences for codons encoding the same amino_acid codon_bias reflected in the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in genomic_dna in escherichia_coli it has been shown that the nonrandom choice of codons is mostly attributable to the availability of transfer_rna within a cell however more recent to whom correspondence should be addressed work byhas shown that the correlation of codon_usage and trna level is not perfect in principle the rcc detection process is the identification of codon clusters corresponding to rare trna species along mrnas as quantified using scales of experimental cellular trna levels a complete dataset of this type is only available for e coli therefore approaches based on codon_usage scales are alternatively used recently two different methods have been developed for identifying rccs in coding_sequences the minmax algorithm http www codons org and ribotempo an obvious limitation of window based_methods is the detection of rccs with length at least equal to the applied window_size we present latcom a novel flexible web_server aiming to address shortcomings of the existing_methods and to also provide new tools and features for rcc detection latcom offers users the option to use the minmax and ribotempo methods along with a new window less rcc detection approach based on the linear time maximal scoring subsequences algorithm mss in addition both trna abundance and codon_usage scales are supported including the option for users to enter their own scales and a selection of novel transformations that may prove useful for rcc analyses moreover the ability to choose different values of w for window based rcc detection schemes the explicit report of rcc coordinates and simulation based p values as a measure for statistical rcc validation enable more sophisticated analyses of rccs
