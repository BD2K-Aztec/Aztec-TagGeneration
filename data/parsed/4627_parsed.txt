bioinformatics_discovery motivation fronto_temporal dementia ftd and amyotrophic_lateral als also called motor_neuron mnd are severe neurodegenerative_diseases that show considerable overlap at the clinical and cellular_level the most common single mutation in families with ftd or als has recently been mapped to a non coding repeat expansion in the uncharacterized gene c orf although a plausible mechanism for disease is that aberrant c orf mrna poisons splicing it is important to determine the cellular function of c orf about which nothing is known results sensitive homology_searches showed that c orf is a full_length distant homologue of proteins related to differentially_expressed in normal and neoplasia denn which is a gdp_gtp factor gef that activates rab gtpases our results suggest that c orf is likely to regulate membrane_traffic in conjunction with rab gtpase switches and we propose to name the gene and its product denn like dennl fronto_temporal dementia ftd and amyotrophic_lateral als are major neurodegenerative_diseases that occur in sporadic and familial forms which show overlap in clinical_presentation and cytopathology the commonest cause of familial_als accounting for maps to a mutation in the gene c orf at p mutation of c orf is also common in patients with familial ftd sporadic ftd and alzheimer like dementia a single mutation is found a massively expanded ggggcc hexanucleotide repeat in an intronic portion of the untranslated_region in the general_population alleles have a median of two repeats range which are expanded in pathogenic alleles to repeats the pathogenetic_mechanism is unknown but other neurological syndromes arise from non coding expansions pathology could occur via poisoning of splicing_factors in particular tdp with non coding repeats inducing toxic rna foci that sequester splicing_factors and other nuclear_proteins as in fragile x tremor ataxia syndrome fxtas and myotonic_dystrophy tdp deposits and aberrant cytoplasmic mrna foci in c orf mutant cells both support a role for splicing however these are not universal findings and alternative_mechanisms should be considered one possibility is that the expansion reduces translation as in fragile x consistent with reduced levels of c orf_protein in mutant cells despite its clinical_relevance the normal function of the c orf_protein has remained_obscure a powerful way to determine protein_function is to find homologies to proteins of known function the sensitivity of the basic_local blast has been increased in several ways position specific iterative psi_blast creates a profile of key_residues from blast and then searches with increasingly_large profiles to converge on a final stable alignment sensitivity is improved by profileprofile comparison using profiles for every database entry because structure diverges far slower than primary sequence a further enhancement is to include secondary structural prediction in all profiles the tool hhpred allocates of the profile weighting at each residue to predicted structure helix sheet or loop importantly hhpred searches targets not only in the protein database pdb of solved structures other databases of domains but also through proteome_wide libraries of model eukaryotes its enhanced profileprofile searches can find homologues that lack significant amino_acid conservation even where no structure is solved and no domain recognized denn domain proteins standing for differentially_expressed in normal and neoplastic_cells are highly_conserved rab gefs with large_numbers of homologues in some species humans have in subgroups using psi_blast several denn like families have been identified dennd fam avl fam a lchn afi p and anr p some of which have gdp_gtp factor gef activity all denn like proteins contain a domain of aa the structure of which consists of two lobes that associate intimately with each other and rab the tripartite domains of u denn c denn

components of the trapp complex both of mon ccz and fuzzy fuz lds particularly as dimers are highly_conserved platforms for gtpases deriving from their circularly_permuted ancestral roadblock domain found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes recently folliculin flcn a tumour_suppressor mutated in birthoggdubesyndromedubesyndrome leading to renal cancers which had no homologies according to psi_blast was identified as a structural and functional homologue of denn thus denn is the founder of a family that is wider than can be appreciated using psi_blast here we show that c orf is one of several previously_unrecognized full_length homologues of denn proteins suggesting that c orf is a member of the denn like superfamily and hence a regulator of membrane_traffic we have found strong structural_homology between c orf and full_length gef domains in the denn like superfamily at its n terminus c orf is most related to lchn avl at its c terminus c orf aligns very well with fnip which shows strong homology to denn and flcn independent of hhpred multiple independent structural prediction engines suggested denn as a possible homologue of c orf despite only two denn structures being solved to date as a benchmark to gauge the strength of the matches we obtain they have higher scores than the matches between denns and flcn in the future our prediction can be verified in ways that have been applied to flcn solving the structure and showing gef activity of purified protein our predictions would be helped by including data on the rab binding_site however the lack of conservation of any potential rabbinding residues between dennd b and flcn suggests that it is unlikely that c orf shares these residues because at least one denn like protein afi p in budding_yeast binds an arf gtpase it is not certain solid arrows join elements aligned by hhpred and other alignments were made by hand dashed arrows variations in c orf are indicated by numbers above large brackets indicate

the denn like superfamily diverse members of sub families of denn like proteins excluding ld only nprl s were tested for all versus all similarity iterations of psi_blast and clustered by clans all
