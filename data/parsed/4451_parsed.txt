structure based kernels for the prediction of catalytic_residues and their involvement in human inherited_disease motivation enzyme catalysis is involved in numerous biological_processes and the disruption of enzymatic_activity has been implicated in human disease despite this various aspects of catalytic reactions are not completely_understood such as the mechanics of reaction chemistry and the geometry of catalytic_residues within active_sites as a result the computational_prediction of catalytic_residues has the potential to identify novel catalytic pockets aid in the design of more efficient enzymes and also predict the molecular basis of disease results we propose a new kernel_based algorithm for the prediction of catalytic_residues based on protein_sequence structure and evolutionary_information the method relies upon explicit modeling of similarity between residue centered neighborhoods in protein_structures we present evidence that this algorithm evaluates favorably against established approaches and also provides insights into the relative importance of the geometry physicochemical_properties and evolutionary_conservation of catalytic residue activity the new algorithm was used to identify known mutations associated with inherited_disease whose molecular_mechanism might be predicted to operate specifically though the loss or gain of catalytic_residues it should therefore provide a viable_approach to identifying the molecular basis of disease in which the loss or gain of function is not caused solely by the disruption of protein_stability our analysis suggests that both mechanisms are actively involved in human inherited_disease availability_and source_code for the structuralenzymes are critically_important macromolecules that accelerate chemical_reactions with high_efficiency and rate enhancement driven by accumulating structural and functional data as well as by increasing computational power to whom correspondence should be addressed various general mechanisms to account for the molecular basis of enzyme catalysis have been proposed despite this many enzymes have still not been functionally annotated and many aspects of enzyme catalysis remain_unclear including the precise details of reaction chemistry or the geometry of the active_sites thus computational_methods for the identification of active_sites and their catalytic_residues have the potential to identify novel catalytic pockets aid the design of more efficient enzymes and in some instances predict the molecular basis of disease catalytic_residues are typically defined as amino_acid directly involved in the chemistry of catalysis hence those residues involved in substrate_binding and protein_stability or simply supporting the geometry of the active_site are not regarded as catalytic_residues sensu_stricto despite being vital for catalytic_function aided by the growing number of annotated enzymes the signatures of catalytic_sites have been extensively_studied yielding new insights into protein_structure to function principles catalytic_residues are known to be enriched in polar_residues and depleted in hydrophobic_residues but most are not directly exposed to water resulting in belowaverage relative accessible surface areas and b factors catalytic_residues have also been highly_conserved over evolutionary time both structurally and sequence wise as a result their disruption is expected to result in greatly_reduced or complete loss of catalytic_activity various computational_methods have been proposed to facilitate the task of predicting catalytic_residues from protein_structure the earliest published work employed spherical neighborhoods around catalytic_residues to define structural neighborhoods and used conservation of both sequence and structure to investigate the properties of catalytic_residues although this study was only based on the structures of proteins catalytic_residues its conclusions were supported by subsequent work indeed to this end other groups have exploited the increasing number of annotated catalytic_residues and more advanced computational_techniques these methods are all based on vector representations of various sequence structural and evolutionary features from which a machine_learning model is trained catalytic residue prediction is bound up with the broader issue of residue function prediction from protein_structures therefore in principle other approaches can also be used for this task most of these methods can be categorized into template based residue microenvironment based or graph_theoretic methods in addition structural_alignment programs can provide baseline annotation of catalytic_sites such methods can readily incorporate the structural_similarity of larger and non spherical neighborhoods however they may be less sensitive to evolutionary_conservation or to changes in physicochemical_properties than the geometry of the sites finally whole molecule protein_function prediction_algorithms combined with methods for predicting functional_residues in general can also be exploited from the machine_learning perspective kernel based_methods have recently gained importance in computational_biology in part because of their solid theoretical_foundations in kernel based_methods a similarity function is created between pairs of objects such as amino_acid secondary_structure or residue neighborhoods and then used in a supervised_learning scenario kernel methods can be advantageous in cases where a relationship between pairs of objects can be hypothesized to explicitly incorporate_prior into the similarity function in contrast non kernel_based classification_models e g neural_networks typically construct features that are considered important for the prediction step these models do not naturally permit the explicit encoding of prior_knowledge such as pairwise object similarities furthermore kernel based_approaches can benefit from the large margin classification algorithms such as support_vector svms but can also be used in combination with simpler methods such as k nearest_neighbors in this study we developed a novel kernel based_approach for the prediction of catalytic_residues and functional sites in general the predictor was extensively_evaluated against established approaches and used to identify instances where the loss or gain of catalytic residue activity could plausibly represent the molecular basis of disease our results suggest that the loss and interestingly also the gain of catalytic_residues may be actively involved in human inherited_disease
