revisiting the negative example sampling problem for predicting protein_protein motivation a number of computational_methods have been proposed that predict proteinprotein_interactions ppis based on protein sequence_features since the number of potential non interacting_protein negative ppis is very high both in absolute terms and in comparison to that of interacting_protein positive ppis computational_prediction rely upon subsets of negative ppis for training and validation hence the need arises for subset sampling for negative ppis results we clarify that there are two fundamentally different types of subset sampling for negative ppis one is subset sampling for cross_validated testing where one desires unbiased subsets so that predictive_performance estimated with them can be safely assumed to generalize to the population level the other is subset sampling for training where one desires the subsets that best train predictive algorithms even if these subsets are biased we show that confusion between these two fundamentally different types of subset sampling led one study recently_published in bioinformatics to the erroneous conclusion that predictive algorithms based on protein sequence_features are hardly better than random in predicting ppis rather both protein sequence_features and the hubbiness of interacting_proteins contribute to effective prediction of ppis we provide guidance for appropriate use of random versus balanced sampling availability the datasets used for this study are available atproteinprotein interactions ppis underlie many processes essential to living_organisms years of small_scale experimental work along with genome_wide studies powered by high_throughput techniques e g have generated significant numbers of known ppis which provide a good foundation on which to learn protein to whom correspondence should be addressed sequence_features that distinguish interacting_protein from noninteracting ones in general this has been a difficult and largely unsolved computational_problem exascerbated by strong biases in available datasets including redundant interactions and skewed amino_acid in well represented protein_complexes e g the ribosome nonethless diverse computational_methods have been developed that predict ppis using protein sequence_features ben as with all computational_prediction improvements to datasets used for testing and training can strongly_affect the quality of the predictions it is thus critical that protein_sequence feature_based ppi prediction_methods be validated with appropriate positive_and datasets since the numbers of high_confidence positive ppis are still relatively modest especially in comparison to the numbers of potential negative_examples most studies have used as much of the positive ppi data as possible high_quality negative ppi data are equally_important for learning and validation processes unfortunately such data are not widely available although a new database has begun to archive such data therefore a typical strategy has been to employ protein pairs that are not previously known to interact as the set of negative ppis this is generally a reasonable assumption given that negative ppis outnumber positive ones by a factor of hundreds to thousands more specifically let us say that we have p protein pairs known to interact and the p protein pairs involve k different proteins then there are k k possible protein pairs the p pairs known to interact serve as positive examples for predicting new interactions the remaining n protein pairs dominated by true negative interactions are assumed not to interact in general and serve as negative_examples where n k k p usually p n and p is of a manageable magnitude whereas n is not for many algorithms cross validating predictive algorithms on the complete set of k k protein pairs consisting of p positive ppis and n negative ones is not feasible simply because it is too immense thus sampling subsets especially of negative ppis is routine_practice typically one might want an unbiased subset of negative ppis of size n where n is of a manageable magnitude cross_validated test results on the set combining p positive ppis and n negative ones are then assumed to generalize to the whole set of k k protein pairs because the negative subset used for cross_validation is an unbiased representative of the n negative ppis this typein this study we clarified a critical distinction between subset sampling for algorithm training and for cross_validated estimates of predictive_performance we showed that a balanced sampling technique recently_proposed byto prevent representational bias driven learning of proteinprotein_interactions is suitable for subset sampling during training but not for crossvalidated testing and that its use for cross_validation leads to significant underestimates of predictive_performance and to erroneous_conclusions regarding the value of protein sequence_features for predicting ppis in contrast when used only for training use of the balanced sampling technique allows for estimates of the relative_contributions of representational bias driven learning as compared to learning based on protein sequence_features we observe both to contribute significantly to the prediction of ppis funding national_institutes gm gm to e m welch f and packard foundations
