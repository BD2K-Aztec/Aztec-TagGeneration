leveraging reads that span_multiple single_nucleotide for haplotype inference from sequencing_data haplotypes defined as the sequence of alleles on one chromosome are crucial for many genetic_analyses as experimental determination of haplotypes is extremely expensive haplotypes are traditionally inferred using computational_approaches from genotype data i e the mixture of the genetic_information from both haplotypes best performing approaches for haplotype inference rely on hidden_markov with the underlying assumption that the haplotypes of a given individual can be represented as a mosaic of segments from other haplotypes in the same population such algorithms use this model to predict the most likely haplotypes that explain the observed genotype data conditional on reference_panel of haplotypes with rapid advances in short_read sequencing_technologies sequencing is quickly establishing as a powerful approach for collecting genetic_variation information as opposed to traditional genotyping array technologies that independently call genotypes at polymorphic_sites short_read often collects haplotypic information a read spanning more than one polymorphic locus multi single nucleotide poly morphic read contains information on the haplotype from which the read originates however this information is generally ignored in existing_approaches for haplotype_phasing and genotype_calling from short_read results in this article we propose a novel framework for haplotype inference from short_read that leverages multi single nucleotide polymorphic reads together with a reference_panel of haplo types the basis of our approach is a new probabilistic_model that finds the most likely haplotype segments from the reference_panel to explain the short_read sequencing_data for a given individual we devised an efficient sampling method within a probabilistic_model to achieve superior_performance than existing_methods using simulated sequencing_reads from real individual genotypes in the hapmap data and the genomes projects we show that our method is highly_accurate and computationally_efficient our haplotype predictions improve accuracy over the basic haplotype copying model by with comparable computational time and over another recently_proposed approach hap seqx by with significantly_reduced computational time and memory_usage humans are diploid organisms with two copies of each chromosome one inherited from the father and the other from the mother the two copies are similar to each other and only differ at a small fraction of sites most of the variation is contained at single nucleotide polymorphic snp sites the sequence of alleles on each chromosome is referred to as the haplotype haplotype_information is centrally important for a wide_variety of applications including association studies and ancestry_inference unfortunately standard methods for probing genetic_variation are able to collect only genotype_information but not haplotypes a large number of computational_methods referred to as haplotype_phasing approaches have been proposed to infer haplotypes from genotypes the most successful methods use a set of reference haplotypes to build a probabilistic_model of the haplotypes in the population using a population_genetics model for the haplotype distribution these models predict the most likely haplotype_data that can explain the observed genotypes rapid advances in high_throughput hts technologies_provide new opportunities for haplotype_phasing methods hts yields short segments of the dna_reads where each read originates from one of the pair of chromosomes therefore all the alleles in this read are from the same haplotype although reads that cover multiple_snps multi snp reads could be used to improve haplotype inference existing_methods generally ignore this information partially owing to computational difficulty associated with modeling such reads several methods have been proposed to predict haplotypes directly from the reads these methods referred to as haplotype_assembly methods use overlapping reads to construct the haplotype the most commonly used objective_function for haplotype to whom correspondence should be addressed assembly is the minimum error_correction mec the mec objective_function aims at finding the minimum number of edits such that the reads can be partitioned into two disjoint sets and each set of reads originates from one of the haplotypes however as these methods do not use the information in the reference haplotype panel they significantly underperform standard phasing methods that ignore read information but use reference_panel recently one of these methods has been extended to use the reference unfortunately this method has prohibitive memory and time requirements thus making it unfeasible for moderate to large_datasets here we propose a novel approach_called haplotyping with reference and sequencing_technology harsh for haplotype_phasing we use a probabilistic_model to incorporate the multisnp read information together with a reference_panel of haplotypes we use an efficient gibbs_sampling method to find sample from the posterior_distribution this algorithm has the advantages of being computationally_efficient scalable in memory_usage and accurate in genotyping and phasing prediction we evaluate our method on simulations from real haplotypes from the hapmap project at coverage harsh gives improvement in terms of total error_rate compared with standard phasing approaches that do not use the multi snp read information thus showing the benefits of modeling multi snp reads we also evaluate harsh and the basic model for varying coverage and read_length showing the benefits of our approach in higher_coverage and longer read_length additionally we test our method on simulations starting from real sequencing_data of genomes_project where the density of snps is much higher than that in hapmap data through extensive simulations we show that the gain in performance of our approach over existing_models extends to realistic read_lengths e g bp making our approach readily_applicable to existing sequencing_datasets with recent works showing that short_read can dramatically_increase association power in genome_wide over genotyping_arrays we expect our approaches to further increase power in genome_wide by increasing accuracy in genotype_calling and phasing from short_read
