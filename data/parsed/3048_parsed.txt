gene_expression modeling risk_stratification in human cancer motivation despite huge prognostic promises gene_expression based survival assessment is rarely used in clinical_routine main reasons include difficulties in performing and reporting analyses and restriction in most methods to one high_risk group with the vast_majority of patients being unassessed the present study aims at limiting these difficulties by i mathematically defining the number of risk groups without any a priori assumption ii computing the risk of an independent cohort by considering each patient as a new patient incorporated to the validation_cohort and iii providing an open_access web_site to freely compute risk for every new patient results using the gene_expression of patients with multiple_myeloma with breast_cancer and with glioma we developed a model combining running log_rank under controlled chi_square conditions and multiple testing corrections to build a risk_score and a classification algorithm using simultaneous global and between group log_rank chi_square maximization for each cancer entity we provide a statistically_significant three group risk_prediction which is corroborated with publicly_available validation cohorts conclusion in constraining between group significances the risk_score compares_favorably with previous risk classifications prediction of cancer patients survival is one of the most challenging tasks in daily_practice in oncology gene_expression gep has been used in cancer to look for cancer heterogeneity and predict for corresponding classification outcome while the main clinical prognostic_factor of multiple_myeloma mm is the international staging system iss based on serum b microglobulin and serum_albumin two high_risk scores have combined gep with overall survival os as input_data and outcome issue several other gep based signatures using either tumor_progression or cell_cycle associated indexes at diagnosis or relapse have been published gene_expression were early used to identify breast_carcinoma subtypes and outcome van t intrinsic molecular groups recurrence metastasis and survival reis gene_expression based profiling of malignant_gliomas has been recognized to produce a more robust classification than the conventional histological_diagnosis and also to directly predict for survival despite a huge prognostic promise in a wide_range of malignant_diseases gep is rarely used in clinical_routine to assess outcome main reasons include difficulties in performing the analysis and reporting of the data in clinical practice inability of direct_application of defined groups and frequently arbitrary assumptions in expression based scores e g risk group size and number most gep based risk scores in mm delineate a group of patients with adverse_prognosis but using arbitrary quartile cutoffs on gene_expression or index calculation most reports of breast_cancer survival_prediction still consider only two risk classes using semi_supervised predictive methods we present here a novel survival_prediction model termed rs for risk_score built on gene_expression of patients suffering from mm n breast_cancer n or glioma n prognostic genes were selected without arbitrary cutoffs a score summing up the risk information of these prognostic genes identified the maximum number of patients groups showing a statistically_significant different os without a priori assumption the rs score allowed successfully classification within three groups of two independent cohorts of patients with mm breast_cancer or glioma and correlated with classification features like conventional prognostic_factors molecular_subtypes or pathological grades in both training and validation cohorts finally we provide an open_access web_site to compute risk rs for any novel patient the aim of this study was to create an easy to use gene_expression based score allowing a multi group stratification for os while minimizing a priori assumptions one mandatory assumption is that gep of a tumor sample can predict for risk provoked by a whole tumor in addition tumor_samples contain tumor_cells but also cells of the tumor environment except for cancers such as mm for which tumor_cells can be easily purified this bias in using a sample partly representative of the whole tumor to assess risk cannot be easily cleared owing to ethical and economical reasons avoiding multiple tumor_samples harvesting and introduces artifactual variation in gep weakening the risk information another assumption is that gene_expression could feature risk_stratification it is clear that the best approach will be to monitor protein_function which is a consequence of gene_transcription translation and further protein_modifications likely the method to measure gene_expression with microarrays will be shortly greatly_improved using rna_sequencing and lead to a better model of risk_stratification but the principles developed here will still be applicable whatever the method used to generate the score scale despite these biases the current method made it possible to classify independent cohorts of patients with mm breast_cancer or glioma into three risk groups defined by different os between two consecutive groups the number of risk groups that could be predicted is dependent on the number of patients in the training cohorts in the current study we used publicly_available cohorts of patients with gep and prognostic_information as well as a several year follow_up leading to the finding of three prognostic_groups both the cohort size and the homogeneity of the treatments per disease influenced the cutoffs stability larger_series of previously_untreated patients should provide more information about molecular_heterogeneity and allow investigating how the rs methodology will translate this heterogeneity into additional groups of patients with different os particularly in interestingly considering homogeneous populations like healthy bone_marrow plasma cells or human myeloma_cell the s score was as expected at low_risk rs for healthy plasma cells or at high_risk rs for myeloma_cell supplementary for building rs score prognostic probe_sets were identified by splitting training cohorts into two prognostic_groups maximizing a log_rank statistics the selection of this probe set list could be further refined according to the final criteria here three significant prognostic_groups using for instance backward selection the fact that the proportion of patients to split the cohort was not fixed arbitrarily may explain why the currently identified prognostic rs genes poorly overlap with previously_published prognostic genes in mm half of the rs genes were relevant to cell_cycle and mitosis supplementary only one of these genes was common to the genes risk signature from uams gep and none with the intergroupe francais du myelome ifm genes comparably none of the genes of the seminal signature of poor_prognosis breast_cancer van t was found in the current rs genes this lack of overlap was confirmed with subsequent signatures in the same way none to only one of the prognostic genes reported for glioma were shared with the present rs genes moreover training and validation cohorts were swapped to test for overfitting and the whole process including initial normalization batch correction and survival significant probe set selection was run again noteworthy new and gene_signatures supplementary tables s s were obtained respectively for mm breast_cancer and glioma although these signaturesshared no common gene except one phf for breast_cancer and three fkbp mtpap and rab for glioma with the initial ones they could predict for three significantly different risk groups close to the ones before swapping both in the training and validation cohorts supplementaryand this is in line with microarray quality_control comments emphasizing that prognostic genes are mainly useful to build scores to identify patients with various risks but are not relevant to understand tumor_biology in vivo maqc the prognostic genes the computation of the rs and cutoffs are valuable only for patients treated with therapy lines which have been validated in the current study these parameters will likely change according to treatment improvement and should be updated regularly with publication of new data however rs score remains significant in mm treated with novel agents supplementary it is important to stress that gep raw files and patients clinical data used in various publications should be publicly_available according to miame recommendations minimum information about a microarray experiment http www mged org workgroups miame miame html another advantage of the present methodology is that rs score was validated without using gene_expression variance or structure information from the validation cohorts except for batch correction each patient of a validation_cohort was considered as a single patient data_normalization computed and batch adjusted using affymetrix parameters from the training cohort and rs score and risk groups computed using cutoffs defined with the training cohort this is another major difference with previously_published transcriptome based rs in mm the gep score was delineated on the tt cohort using expression quartiles and was validated on their more recent treatment improved tt cohort using an adapted cutoff value the same holds true for ifm score which was validated arbitrarily using the top of patient scores on tt cohort finally rs remained_significant when compared with the currently used iss rs in mm both in terms of multivariate_analysis and survival expression especially for rs populations supplementary gep has largely been used in breast_cancer over the past_decade in search for classification patterns and survival signatures reis most studies have sought a dichotomic risk in bulk patient populations without addressing disease complexity although built using different gene_sets most behave_similarly in outcome_prediction a few used tumor_subtypes to create survival indexes from clinical and molecular data namely the risk of relapse and the recurrence both studies delineated a globally significant three group model but with pre specified cutoff_points and no evidence for between group significance our rs score based on mathematical criteria only also allowed delineating three risk groups in both training and validation breast_carcinoma cohorts a high_risk group of up to and two similarly sized intermediate and low_risk groups with significant successive differential survival although a number of four group models were delineated in mm and breast_cancer training cohorts not shown the number of patients with simultaneously available clinical and microarray_data has not permitted to validate survival models beyond three groups for these diseases when affecting the molecular taxonomy to the various rs groups of the training cohort we found a survival distribution perfectly consistent with the clinical_outcome and respecting the disease heterogeneity the poor_outcome intrinsic basl and mapo subtypes constitute the rs high_risk group and part of the intermediate rs group the latter encompasses most of the er her poor_prognosis lumc and er lumb whereas the good prognosis norml and luma subtypes constitute most of the low_risk rs group of note this remarkable correlation between molecular_classification and prognosis was achieved without a proliferative signature our gene_list containing none of the supposedly necessary proliferation components reis to the exception of mki a gene enrichment_analysis was unable to correlate with previously described pathways whatever the significance threshold data not shown this tight subtypeoutcome association was propagated to the validation_cohort just using the training s score cutoff_points the rs poor_prognosis group contains the subtypes i er her and ii er her equivalent respectively to the basl and mapo subtypes the her subtype iii is included in rs and the er subtypes v and vi again constitute the good prognosis rs group thus the present algorithm delineates a comprehensive os model and suggests that with a large enough number of documented patients both the molecular_heterogeneity and its outcome_prediction could be simultaneously addressed gliomas the most common primary_brain are currently classified according to largely variable interpretations of histopathological_features and graded following the who classification from the grade i best prognosis astrocytic tumor through the anaplastic transformation between grades ii and iii to the highly_malignant grade_iv glioblastoma in both training and validation glioma cohorts our method perfectly depicts this hierarchy in detecting a majority of highly_malignant glioblastomas in the rs group glioblastoma and grade_iii anaplastic gliomas in rs but still some glioblastomas and a comparable number of grade_ii and iii gliomas in rs reflecting the weakness of the current_classification to clearly separate intermediate grade_ii iii gliomas thus our classification brings benefit to a fraction of grade_iii and iv gliomas which may present a better outcome than expected contrarily to mm and breast_carcinoma a four group survival model was significantly delineated in the training glioma cohort and applied to the validation_cohort with marginal significance not shown in this case the large high_risk glioblastoma containing group with a median_os of months was further split into a small very poor_prognostic group with an month_survival and a better one with a median_os of years glioblastoma subtypes have been defined by gene_expression implications like a differential_expression in the mgmt enzyme repairing chemotherapy induced dna_damage could be tested with larger data meanwhile fitting a regression_model on the survival of training and validation cohorts and their combination in every tumor_type allow to approximate the life_expectancy of patients in each risk group namely from high to low_risk and years for myeloma and years for breast_cancer and and years for gliomas supplementary finally we think it is essential to provide easy to use tools that will allow clinicians to compute individual gep based rss without heavy computation a molecular_classification of glioma is already provided with a similar input thus we provide the open_access prognoweb web_site to automatically compute the rs score for any single oncology patient with available affymetrix files any report about a gep based rs should provide such an open_access helping to integrate as currently developed the molecular prognosis assessment into the standard investigations at diagnostic or relapse but the user has to be aware that the way to compute the rs and the cutoffs is valuable only for patients treated with therapy lines which has been validated in the current study the computation of rs and cutoffs will change likely according to treatment improvement this recommendation is indicated in the web_site
