systems_biology exhaustively characterizing feasible logic models of a signaling_network using answer set programming motivation logic modeling is a useful tool to study signal transduc tion across multiple pathways logic models can be generated by training a network containing the prior_knowledge to phospho prote omics_data the training can be performed using stochastic optimization procedures but these are unable to guarantee a global optima or to report the complete family of feasible models this however is essential to provide precise insight in the mechanisms underlaying signal_transduction and generate reliable predictions results we propose the use of answer set programming to explore exhaustively the space of feasible logic models toward this end we have developed caspo an open_source python_package that provides a powerful platform to learn and characterize logic models by lever aging the rich modeling language and solving technologies of answer set programming we illustrate the usefulness of caspo by revisiting a model of pro growth and inflammatory_pathways in liver cells we show that if experimental_error is taken into account there are thousands of models compatible with the data despite the large number we can extract structural_features from the models such as links that are always or never present or modules that appear in a mutual exclusive fashion to further characterize this family of models we investigate the inputoutput behavior of the models we find behaviors across the models and we suggest new experiments to discriminate among them our results underscore the importance of characterizing in a global and exhaustive manner the family of feasible models with important implications for experimental_design availability caspo is freely_available for download license gplv and as a web_service at http caspo genouest org predictive_models of biological_networks are a main_component of systems_biology for a certain system of interest if enough information is available about the biomolecules that constitute it and their interactions one can convert this prior_knowledge into a mathematical_model e g a set of differential_equations or logic rules that can be simulated if experimental_data are available the model can be fitted trained to the data that is one determines the model_parameters for example kinetic_constants in a biochemical model to obtain the most plausible model given the data this is normally achieved by defining an objective_function that describes the goodness of the model based on the data that is subsequently optimized this training_process is not a trivial task owing to factors including experimental_error limitations in the amount of data available incompleteness of our prior_knowledge and inherent mathematical properties of the models thus in general there is no single solution but rather multiple models that describe the data equally or similarly well in those cases the model is said to be non identifiable in some cases deterministic methods that guarantee the identification of the optimal models can be applied but these methods are often limited by the exponential_growth of the search_space thus usually one needs to use stochastic_methods that may identify the optimum or at least exhibit suboptimal models however an incomplete characterization of the set of plausible models limits significantly the insight that can be gained about the underlying_molecular in this article we investigate this issue in the context of logic modeling of signaling_networks these models have been applied recently to analyze signal_transduction in a variety of contexts in particular given a network encoding our knowledge of signal_transduction and a dataset measuring the activation of proteins in this network on various perturbations one can derive from the network boolean logic models fitted to the data models are simulated assuming that the network reaches a pseudo steady_state at a certain time on stimulation and the identification of the network that best fits the data is posed as an optimization_problem this problem can be solved using meta heuristics e g a genetic_algorithm and their application suggests that there are multiple alternative_models that explain the data however stochastic search_methods cannot characterize the models precisely they are intrinsically unable not just to to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as provide a complete set of solutions but also to guarantee that an optimal_solution is found to overcome_this approaches based on integer_linear ilp and answer set programming asp have been applied providing a proof_of that a global optimum can be identified here we present caspo a free open_source tool to learn boolean logic models of signal_transduction in a complete and global fashion caspo uses cellnopt pre_and processing routines it can handle feedback_loops in the prior_knowledge network pkn numerical datasets and tolerance in the score owing to experimental uncertainty we use caspo to exhaustively explore the space of optimal and suboptimal models for a real case describing pro growth and inflammatory_pathways in a liver_cancer cell we find that even with small tolerance thousands of models can be compatible with the data and use asps flexibility to further analyze them we categorize them according to their inputoutput behavior and identify subsets of modules that are interchangeable with respect to the score the multiple possible combinations of these modules are responsible for the large number of models found to illustrate the use of caspo we use a model of pro growth and pro_inflammatory model in liver cells the model is trained to phospho proteomics_data generated in the liver_cancer cell_line data are generated on perturbation with combination of ligands and small_molecule blocking the activities of specific kinases the dataset contains measurements using the luminex technology of species under experimental_conditions this model was introduced in and here we use a variation from in this case there are possible hyperedges and thus the number of possible logic models i e search_space of the combinatorial_optimization is given by a useful approach to model large_scale signaling_networks consists on training boolean logic models from prior_knowledge and dedicated experimental_data the problem of training these models is an optimization task that can be solved with stochastic search_methods which have the important limitation that they do not guarantee global optimality nor an exhaustive solution in this article we show how recasting this problem in a highly declarative language allows us tois highlighted as well as the two most common ones and the most common gtt is close to the optimal one whereas the second most common gtt has a different behavior distribution of suboptimal models the suboptimal models are ordered from left to right first according to their mses and then according to their gtts the number of different models leading to the same gtt is plotted in vertical bars gtts are ordered and colored by their mse the optimal models correspond to mse the two most common gtts describe the response of and models identify the complete family of feasible models and query them to obtain insight into model degeneracy in a real case study we have seen that there is a family of feasible models with a deep combinatorial structure several combinations of internal submodules with equal or similar scores can equivalently explain the observed behavior of the system this leads to a rapid_growth of the family of suboptimal models taking_into the inherent noise in data we showed that different models can be considered as plausible representations of the pkn and an experimental phosphoproteomics dataset thanks to our exhaustive characterization of these models we could determine unambiguously which hyperedges biological links are functional based on their distributions across the models and determine_whether groups of hyperedges are exclusive from each other to further characterize this family of models we introduced the concept of gtts and used it to explore their inputoutput behavior compared with the model topologies the variability is much lower the models can be grouped in gtts and for of the possible perturbations all models gave the same predictions interestingly the distribution of models among gtts is far from being equidistributed and two gtts comprise almost half of the models while the gtt corresponding to the optimal score is specific of the models while the most common gtt is similar to the gtt with optimal score the second most common gtt is different however a single experiment is able to discriminate these models these results underscore the importance of exploring exhaustively the family of models and take into account experimental_error to obtain an adequate picture of the feasible model solutions our formal approach based on asp allows a precise characterization of the information that can be inferred from the confrontation of prior_knowledge with experimental_observations over protein signaling_networks it also permits the study of the internal combinatorics leading to the variability of the system functioning and provides a tool toward experimental_design owing to the complexity of signaling_networks and the limitations of existing experimental_technologies in terms of which nodes can be measures and or perturbed models typically show an important lack of identifiability this is a general limitation of models in systems_biology in the context of boolean models we expect that further development of experimental_design in intimate coordination with advances in experimental_techniques will allow us to tackle this issue this work opens the way to several prospective tracks first it would be useful to evaluate our asp formulation and those based on ilp from and to understand their strengths and complementary features in contrast to ilp asp is a relatively new tool for problem_solving in biology asp having its roots in knowledge representation and reasoning has proven to be well suited to address highly combinatorial search and discrete optimization_problems with at least comparable_performance with well established ilp solvers on the other hand ilp as a mathematical programming framework may be more suitable to study problems based on calculus over large domains of integer or rational numbers therefore combining the expressiveness and power of several solving technologies instead of selecting one of them seems a promising option for the future second we plan to study the extension of our approach to time series data although switching from a steady_state to a dynamical viewpoint implies a growth of the search_space fitting models whose steady_states evolve between clearly separated time scales should be of similar complexity to the problem studied in this article fitting to the actual timecourses of a boolean model has a higher_level of complexity as it requires to adjust the time step of the boolean model to the real_time of the measurements more generally we need to develop a rigorous framework to study models of biological_networks as a family of plausible realizations not of single networks a first approximation could be to compare experimental_data ideally a distribution across individual cells with a distribution of simulated results across a family of single logical models the comparison of the distribution of feasible models with single_cell data emerges as longer_term follow_up of this work that should provide deep insight into the cell to cell heterogeneity of signal_transduction altogether we have implemented an open_source tool based on asp providing a powerful framework to analyze networks models in systems_biology further several prospective tracks will certainly lead to future_developments to extend and improve the functionalities of caspo
