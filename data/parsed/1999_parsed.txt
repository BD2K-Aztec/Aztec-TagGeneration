genevetter a web_tool for quantitative monogenic assessment of rare_diseases when performing dna_sequencing to diagnose affected_individuals with monogenic forms of rare_diseases accurate attribution of causality to detected variants is imperative but imperfect even if a gene has variants already known to cause a disease rare disruptive variants predicted to be causal are not always so mainly due to imperfect ability to predict the pathogenicity of variants existing population scale sequence resources such as genomes are useful to quantify the background prevalence of an unaffected individual being falsely predicted to carry causal_variants we developed genevetter to allow users to quantify the background prevalence of subjects with predicted causal_variants within specific genes under user specified filtering parameters genevetter helps quantify uncertainty in monogenic diagnosis and design genetic_studies with support for power and sample_size for specific genes with specific filtering criteria genevetter also allows users to analyze their own sequence_data without sending genotype_information over the internet overall genevetter is an interactive web_tool that facilitates quantifying and accounting for the background prevalence of predicted pathogenic_variants in a population availability_and genevetter is available at http genevetter org contact inaccurate attribution of causality to rare genetic_variants found in sequencing studies of subjects with rare_diseases can limit the benefits of screening and potentially result in harm for accurate classification of a variants pathogenicity investigators typically account for multiple characteristics such as its allele_frequency conservation score and predicted functional consequences however even after careful filtering and application of these parameters to a known set of causal_genes a proportion of non causal_variants are still at risk for being misclassified as causal due to imperfect filtering for example it is reported than of general_population can be falsely determined to carry causal_variants for maturity_onset mody a monogenic form of diabetes our work is motivated by a study of nephrotic_syndrome ns a rare_disease with more than genes implicated as monogenic causes diagnosis of a monogenic cause in an ns patient may be important for personalizing treatment_plans many studies have quantified the fraction of monogenic cases through targeted_sequencing followed by pathogenicity filtering in case only cohorts however applying imperfect variant filtering procedures will misdiagnose a fraction of truly non monogenic cases as harboring putative causal_variants in addition this will result in a non negligible rate of background prevalence of monogenic ns diagnosis in the unaffected population beyond ns when making genetic diagnosis of any rare_diseases in clinical or research settings new methods and tools that account for this background prevalence should improve accuracy of this classification to facilitate accounting for the background prevalence in sequencing studies of rare_diseases we developed an intuitive web_tool genevetter it provides comprehensive_analyses and visualizations of putative causal_variants when sequencing a set of genes across individuals in genomes g users can obtain background prevalence for a specific population and also calculate power and sample_size for genetic_studies assessing enrichment of case specific rare and disruptive variants when sequencing_data is already available for a specific cohort users can apply the same filtering criteria to genevetter to systematically compare cases with g without sending any individual_level information over the network
