gene_expression conserved and differential gene interactions in dynamical biological_systems motivation while biological_systems operated from a common genome can be conserved in various ways they can also manifest highly_diverse dynamics and functions this is because the same set of genes can interact differentially across specific molecular contexts for example differential gene interactions give rise to various stages of morphogenesis during cerebellar_development however after over a decade of efforts toward reverse_engineering biological_networks from high_throughput omic_data gene_networks of most organisms remain sketchy this hindrance has motivated us to develop comparative modeling to highlight conserved and differential gene interactions across experimental_conditions without reconstructing complete gene_networks first results we established a comparative dynamical system modeling cdsm approach to identify_conserved and differential interactions across molecular contexts in cdsm interactions are represented by ordinary_differential and compared across conditions through statistical heterogeneity and homogeneity tests cdsm demonstrated a consistent superiority over differential correlation and reconstruct then compare in simulation_studies we exploited cdsm to elucidate gene interactions important for cellular_processes poorly_understood during mouse cerebellar_development we generated hypotheses on differential genetic_interactions involved in expansion of the external granule layer these interactions are implicated in cell_cycle differentiation apoptosis and morphogenesis additional differential interactions among gene_clusters were also identified when we compared gene interactions during the presence of rhombic lip versus the presence of distinct internal granule layer moreover compared with differential correlation and reconstruct then compare cdsm makes fewer assumptions on data and thus is applicable to a wider_range of biological_assays availability source_code in c and r is available for non commercial organizations upon request from the corresponding author the cerebellum gene_expression dataset used in this article is available upon request from the goldowitz lab dang cmmt ubc ca biological_systems encoded by a common genome can manifest highly_diverse dynamics because the same set of genes can interact differentially across specific molecular contexts such differential gene interactions give rise to cell_differentiation in development divergent cellular types and differences between normal and pathological cells hence it is of pivotal importance to compare gene interactions across biological_systems so as to delineate context dependent molecular_mechanisms automated omic technologies for gene_expression protein activity and metabolic_profiling have enabled genomewide studies of molecular interaction_patterns although numerous biological system modeling_methods have been developed reverse_engineering of biological_networks is still challenging due to insufficient sampling or perturbation in practical biological_experiments this has motivated us to compare interactions across conditions in two biological_systems directly from data profiles overriding independent network_reconstruction for each system previous work mostly employing reconstruct then compare or differential correlation has met limited success in exploring differential interactions due to restricting assumptions reconstructthen compare methods ignore uncertainty in the estimated model_parameters and can wrongfully announce a conserved interaction as differential due to random noise and differential correlation approaches also known as differential_coexpression utilize difference in correlation_coefficients between a pair of variables across two conditions to detect differential interactions although uncertainty is accounted for several assumptions hamper the usefulness of this strategy the most limiting requirement is equality of data and noise variance under the two conditions see discussion on their limitations in supplementary_material such requirements are often not met in biological_experiments to overcome the limitations of differential correlation or reconstruct then compare we introduce and validate a novel statistical_framework for comparing interactions in dynamical system models dsms we call the framework comparative dsm cdsm we use homogeneity to refer to the similarity ofpage a null_model is first obtained y the green line by pooling all points a homogeneity model hm is obtain y x the black line then we obtain the heterogeneity model ht which contains y x the red line and y x the blue line estimated from each group of points respectively b the three models are evaluated by residual sum of squares rss and model complexities via parameter dimensions dim c finally we compute the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the interaction between x and y across conditions they are related to the shaded area in the left and right panel in a the significant homogeneity indicates a common interaction trend the significant_heterogeneity suggests a difference between the two lines in the heterogeneity model evidenced by a difference in slope d in contrast the difference in slope between the two models is undetectable by differential correlation as difference between the pearsons correlation_coefficients across the two conditions is zero an interaction across conditions and heterogeneity for the difference of an interaction across conditions zhao and colleagues developed an expected conditional f ecf statistic to evaluate heterogeneity across conditions but the asymptotic distribution of ecf is open we used two f statistics to evaluate heterogeneity and homogeneity of interactions as illustrated in providing a basis to detect conserved and differential interactions in biological_networks across conditions we demonstrated in supplementary_material that our framework reduces to differential correlation if one adds four restricting assumptions equality of sample_sizes zero data mean equality of data variance and equality of noise variance across conditions with a fifth assumption on equality of variance between data and noise our framework becomes equivalent to reconstruct then compare which we will refer to as numerical comparison by overcoming these unpractical assumptions on experiments the cdsm framework is more general for differential interactions than other known methods the cdsm framework was evaluated by simulation_studies and then applied to detect differential and conserved interactions during mouse cerebellar_development our method outperformed numerical comparison and differential correlation in two simulation_studies using a cdc cyclin cell_division model with known regulation kinetics and a realistic network of unknown architecture with nodes respectively we then applied our method to compare gene interactions during development of the mouse cerebellum an excellent biological model system for studying nervous_system development although morphological events are well documented during cerebellar_development the molecular_mechanisms are nebulous and it is hypothesized that diverse gene interactions_occur sequentially and in a tightly controlled_manner therefore we attempted two studies using our method to identify_conserved and differential interactions on genome_wide microarray time course data obtained during cerebellar_development for the first study of screening genetic_interactions from other organisms in biogrid we generated hypotheses on and significant genetic_interactions involved in external granule layer egl expansion for the dba and bl mouse_strains respectively these putative interactions are implicated in cell_cycle apoptosis and morphogenesis and to a lesser extent differentiation in a second study differential interactions among gene_clusters were identified when comparing cerebellar gene_expression in two developmental_events specifically gene_expression in a prenatal_period in cerebellar_development characterized by the presence of the glutamatergic cell germinal zone known as the rhombic lip was compared with gene_expression during a late embryonic to post_natal period characterized by the presence of distinct internal granule layer igl this second study also revealed novel gene interactions as new testable biological_hypotheses and we highlighted those that are involved with the wnt_pathway we have proposed and validated the cdsm framework to detect conserved and differential gene interactions across molecular contexts from time course observations instead of focusing on the reconstruction of interactions often limited by data insufficiency we use cdsm to compare interactions across conditions we achieved the comparison by decomposing the total interaction_strength f t across conditions into strengths of homogeneity f c and heterogeneity f d and therefore established a decomposition rule the cdsm framework was validated by two simulation_studies in which it outperformed two alternative_methods numerical comparison and differential correlation numerical comparison ignored uncertainty and did not perform well differential correlation did not do well either due to its limitations in dealing with non linearity combinatory effects and unequal variance of the variables and noise the cdsm overcomes these issues and can be particularly effective for comparing gene_regulatory to detect inherent systematic changes in terms of differential interactions beyond system state changes via differential_gene analysis applying cdsm to the time course microarray_data for cerebellar_development revealed conserved and differential interactions across various events the gene_regulatory underlying cerebellar_development is poorly_understood our rationale is to find gene interactions that were either consistently conserved or differential in two setups through cdsm on genome_wide time course observations in our first and more conservative setup we studied how genetic_interactions known in other organisms may participate in mouse cerebellar_development we found and significant interactions putatively involved in egl expansion for the dba and bl mouse_strains respectively these efforts identified promising candidates for further biological_validation for instance e f e f pax pitx and scx are now hypothesized to be involved in cerebellar_granule development in the second and more explorative setup we detected at the genome_scale many de_novo differential interactions between the presence of rhombic lip and presence of distinct igl among these interactions the most promising ones are those that are found to influence general developmental_pathways such as the wnt_pathway an example is the novel gene interactions involved in a tf named lef an essential output of the wnt pathwaywhose downstream_gene interactions are strongly differential when comparing the two developmental_events overall these identified gene interactions have generated testable_hypotheses that merit further biological investigation three conditions are important to make cdsm fruitful based on our simulation_studies first our framework works better on a cascaded network architecture often the case for biological_systems than on random networks that is an upstream differential interaction can be reliably detected without announcing downstream interactions differential even if the expression levels of downstream_genes may have changed second the dsm is based on the estimation of the derivative of each variable to time and is thus effective to deal with systems with smooth dynamics but not discrete non smooth observations third the dsm heavily relies on the correct mathematical form for interactions and the comparative results will be reliable only when a sufficiently good approximation of the interaction form is used in the modeling several future_directions are possible for comparative modeling of interactions the cdsm is readily_applicable to data obtained by experiments using combinatorial gene perturbation such as data from high_throughput quantitative genetic_interaction assays also a wider_range of mathematical forms for interactions can be included beyond our proposed models of additive non linear terms without changing the underlying statistical_framework this will be feasible with an increasing supercomputing power furthermore prior_biological obtained from alternative means can be incorporated to limit the search_space for potential interactions
