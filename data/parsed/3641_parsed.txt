predicting folding_free changes upon single_point motivation the folding_free is an important characteristic of proteins stability and is directly related to proteins wild_type function the changes of proteins stability due to naturally_occurring mutations missense_mutations are typically causing diseases single_point made in vitro are frequently used to assess the contribution of given amino_acid to the stability of the protein in both cases it is desirable to predict the change of the folding_free upon single_point in order to either provide insights of the molecular_mechanism of the change or to design new experimental_studies results we report an approach that predicts the free_energy change upon single_point by utilizing the d structure of the wild_type protein it is based on variation of the molecular_mechanics generalized born mmgb method scaled with optimized_parameters smmgb and utilizing specific model of unfolded_state the corresponding mutations are built in silico and the predictions are tested against large dataset of mutations with experimentally_measured changes of the folding_free benchmarking resulted in root_mean kcal_mol and slope of the linear_regression fit between the experimental_data and the calculations was the smmgb is compared with other leading methods of predicting folding_free changes upon single_mutations and results discussed with respect to various parameters availability all the pdb files we used in this article can be downloaded fromprotein folding_free is an important characteristic directly related to protein_stability some proteins are very stable while others unfold under very small perturbation of the native conditions in both cases not all amino_acids contribute equally to the protein_stability and interactions some of them being crucial and frequently termed hot_spots while others contributing very little to the folding free to whom correspondence should be addressed energy however the contribution of a given amino_acid to protein_stability cannot be easily predicted even if the d structure of the corresponding protein is available therefore developing methods to improve predictions of hot_spots and even more to assess the contribution of a given amino_acid to the folding or binding_free is of great_importance accurate_predictions see khan and vihinen for comparison of different methods will be beneficial for understanding the role of individual amino_acids on protein_stability and to rationalize the effects of non synonymous single nucleoside polymorphism and missense_mutations on the protein fold of particular interest is predicting the effects caused by diseasecausing missense_mutations since the function of protein can be affected in a variety of ways among them the most common effect is changing protein_stability i e destabilizing or stabilizing the wild_type protein fold in addition to altering the macromolecular interactions hydrogen_bond and many other effects however the predictions about the changes of the folding energy should not only indicate if they favor the stability or not but also the predicted absolute magnitude should be accurate as well to allow to distinguish between disease_causing and harmless mutations because of this significance efforts were devoted to develop methods and approaches to evaluate the stability changes upon amino_acid but despite of the efforts accurate calculations of folding_free are still a challenge currently there are several distinctive approaches that were developed to predict the protein_stability changes due to mutations they can be classified into four categories i first principle methods which calculate the folding_free changes based on detailed atomic_models and may be quite computationally_expensive and may not be applicable in cases of large set of mutations ii methods using statistical_potentials which were successfully used to
