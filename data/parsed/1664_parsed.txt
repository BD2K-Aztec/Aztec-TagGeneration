evolutionary non linear modelling for selecting vaccines against antigenically variable viruses motivation in vitro and in vivo selection of vaccines is time consuming expensive and the selected vaccines may not be able to provide protection against broad_spectrum viruses because of emerging antigenically novel disease strains a powerful computational_model that incorporates these protein dna or rna level fluctuations can effectively predict antigenically variant strains and can minimize the amount of resources spent on exclusive serological testing of vaccines and make wide_spectrum vaccines possible for many diseases however in silico vaccine prediction remains a grand_challenge to address the challenge we investigate the use of linear_and regression_models to predict the antigenic similarity in foot_and strains and in influenza strains where the structure and parameters of the non linear_model are optimized using an evolutionary algorithm ea in addition we examine two different scoring_methods for weight ing the type of amino_acid in the linear_and models we also test our models with some unseen data results we achieved the best prediction results on three datasets of sat foot_and two datasets of serotype a foot_and and two datasets of influenza when the scoring_method based on biochemical_properties of amino_acids is employed in combination with a non linear_regression models based on substitutions in the antigenic areas performed better than those that took the entire exposed viral capsid_proteins a majority of the non linear_regression optimized with the ea performed better than the linear_and models whose parameters are estimated using the least_squares method in addition for the best models optimized non linear_regression consist of more terms than their linear counterparts implying a non linear nature of influences of amino_acid our models were also tested on five recently generated fmdv datasets and the best model was able to achieve an agreement rate vaccines can be effective in preventing viral_diseases and improving the health of millions however there are many viral_diseases for which vaccine_production deployment is a challenge because of extensive antigenic variability antigenic variability is the mechanism by which infectious organisms bacteria virus or protozoa alters its surface protein to evade a host immune system infection and or vaccination by an antigenically variable virus do not necessarily confer protection to subsequent exposure of the disease e g human_immunodeficiency hiv influenza and foot_and fmdv hence upon an outbreak of an antigenically variable virus a rapid responseto reduce the spread of the virus is needed in other words the rapid selection of the most effective vaccine against the particular strain of virus is imperative however the in vitro serological_tests that measure the cross_reactivity of vaccines to outbreak strains are time consuming and expensive an in silico predictor that can accurately_predict vaccine_efficacy would be invaluable with the advent_of it is now possible to obtain the sequence of a virus within hours the computational exploitation of this sequence_information for vaccine_design selection is therefore attractive yet to date most computational research on viral vaccines has focussed on developing tools for identifying epitopes from our literature_search only three previous_studies attempting to predict antigenic variability and therefore vaccine_efficacy for foot_and and influenza were identified foot_and and influenza are both socioeconomically important highly infectious_diseases caused by antigenically variable viruses as dna_sequences and associated serological_test data are available for these viruses they are obvious candidates for the development of an in silico vaccine selection predictor thus far in silico approaches for predicting vaccine_efficacy have focussed on the use of linear_and techniquesused linear_mixed to relate estimated antigenic_differences to sequence_variation in fmdv andused stepwise and logistic_regression to predict antigenic variants in however as vaccine_efficacy relies on the interaction of amino_acid within or outside an antigenic site loop that may result in unusual non linear patterns in antigenic distance it is likely that non linear_models that can handle complex interdependencies between variables will be better suited furthermore as biological data can be noisy and or viral_strains partially labelled dataset contains only sequence_data but not serological_data a predictor that can be trained with imperfect data is needed here we present a genetic_algorithm ga optimized quadratic non linear_regression that is able to accurately accuracy predict the vaccine_efficacy for fmdv and influenza a strains taking amino_acid as input we show that our model is an improvement to the approaches previously taken furthermore to examine whether there are differences in the influence of amino_acid changes in different capsid_proteins on the virus_neutralization vn titre haemagglutination inhibition hi assay value we compare two approaches for calculating amino_acid changes one reporting the total number of changes across all capsid_proteins three capsid_proteins in fmdv and one in influenza while the other reporting specific capsid changes finally we study two methods for weighting the importance of amino_acid changes one based on the characteristics and structure of amino_acids and the other based on amino_acid scores pam blosum
