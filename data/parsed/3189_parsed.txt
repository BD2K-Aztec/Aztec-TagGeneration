systems_biology mytoe automatic_analysis of mitochondrial_dynamics we present mytoe a tool for analyzing mitochondrial_morphology and dynamics from fluorescence_microscope images the tool provides automated quantitative analysis of mitochondrial motion by optical_flow estimation and of morphology by segmentation of individual branches of the network like structure of the organelles mytoe quantifies several features of individual branches such as length tortuosity and speed and of the macroscopic structure such as mitochondrial area and degree of clustering we validate the methods and apply them to the analysis of sequences of images of u os human cells with fluorescently_labeled mitochondria availability source_code windows software and manual available atmitochondria play_a in several cellular_processes from energy_production to apoptosis and ageing malfunctioning in mitochondrial processes has been associated to several diseases due to mitochondrial fusion and fission the organelles form a highly_dynamic structure that can change from fragmented to filamentous a better understanding of the dynamics of this structure and its relationship with complex_cellular may provide much insight on mitochondrial functioning and their role on the well being of cells recent works addressed the problem of segmenting mitochondria from fluorescence_microscope images presented a segmentation_method along with descriptors for mitochondrial properties another method uses d imaging mitochondrial motility has been assessed by the degree of colocalization between successive images and from the differences of subsequent image_pairs these methods detect motion but do not yield data on directionality other methods to study motility include optical_flow of estimation and distance transform tracking_methods for motility analysis exist but rely heavily on human interaction to whom correspondence should be addressed we present an easy to use software mytoe for automated study of mitochondrial structural_dynamics from temporal confocal_images it has a simple graphical_user and requires only a few parameters from the user mytoe includes a novel segmentation_method which identifies individual branches of the organelles structure by thresholding and by morphological image_processing in contrast to previous methods this allows quantifying properties of both single branches and the macroscopic structure formed by the mitochondria of is used for motion analysis the output can be examined in mytoe with branch level data being visualized by color coding individual branches based on the data and motion vectors being visualized as quiver plots the results are saved as matlab mat files and comma separated values we first describe the methods in mytoe and results of the validation procedure finally we use mytoe to analyze time lapse sequences of u os human_osteosarcoma hoechst and wga fluorescent_dyes respectively the images were acquired with a nikon eclipse ti with apo a wallac perkin elmer ultraview spinning disk confocal system andor emccd camera and an autofocus system each cell was imaged every s for min in d an example image is shown in inand c we show a region of the same image and the structure segmented from that region respectively the quality of microscope imaging is degraded by noise and saturation thus we added noise and increasingly saturated the images supplementary_material we applied mytoe and observed how the features changed with increasing levels of degradation visual_inspection showed that the methods are robust to levels of degradation much higher than in real images in supplementary_material we present the results of the analysis of structure and motion and of the features infor a set of images as an example shows time series of mean branch speeds of mitochondria of four cells revealing that they differ widely likely due to differing cell_cycle mytoe provides an easy means to study mitochondrial structure and kinetics by automated_image of temporal images of fluorescently_labeled mitochondria the structure analysis was found robust to noise and insensitive to saturation thus the method can be used to obtain reliable measurements from saturated images provided that the mitochondrial branches are separable so_far we tested mytoe on one cell_type its efficiency may depend on the shapes of cell_type and mitochondria here we showed that it is accurate enough to for example distinguish the kinetics of the mitochondria structure from one cell to another in the future this framework can be extended by including additional descriptors and adding other shape analysis techniques that can be chosen as a function of the cell_type additionally we aim to further develop mytoe so as to automatically detect_abnormalities in the mitochondria structure due to chemicals such as in drug_screening or disease
