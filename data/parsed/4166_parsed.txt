systems_biology sed ed a workflow editor for computational_biology experiments written in sed ml the simulation experiment description markup_language sed ml is a new community data standard to encode computational_biology experiments in a computer readable xml format its widespread_adoption will require the development of software support to work with sed ml files here we describe a software_tool sed ed to view edit validate and annotate sed ml documents while shielding end_users from the underlying xml representation sed ed supports modellers who wish to create understand and further develop a simulation description provided in sed ml format availability_and sed ed is available as a standalone java_application as an eclipse plug in and as an sbsi www sbsi ed ac uk plug in all under an mit open_source source_code is at https sed ed sedmleditor googlecode com svn the simulation experiment description markup_language sed ml is an xml language that aims to describe computational_biology experiments so that they may be reproduced and exchanged between different software_tools in brief sed ml level encodes uniform time course simulation descriptions it describes from where to obtain a model the type of simulation to run and the content and presentation of the simulation output sedml is designed to be machine_readable rather than human_readable and to most modellers sed ml should be largely hidden however there is a need for curators and sed ml document editors to easily view annotate and validate sed ml files without being exposed to the underlying xml sed ed is an application designed to address the needs of these users
