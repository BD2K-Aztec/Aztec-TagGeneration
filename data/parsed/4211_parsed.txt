structural_bioinformatics sesaw balancing sequence and structural_information in protein functional_mapping motivation functional_similarity between proteins is evident at both the sequence and structure levels sesaw is a web_based program for identifying functionally or evolutionarily conserved_motifs in protein_structures by locating sequence and structural_similarities and quantifying these at the level of individual_residues results can be visualized in d as annotated alignments or in d as structural superpositions an example is given for both an experimentally_determined query structure and a homology_model availability_and the web_server is located atsequence alignment and structural_alignment are widely used techniques for inferring functional or evolutionary_relationships between proteins however most alignment_methods do not integrate sequence and structural_information into one measure of similarity or describe the similarity at the level of individual_residues we recently_introduced a sequence and structure based scoring_method that employs sequence profileprofile comparisons but is anchored by structural_alignments and showed that the functional information associated with the top scoring hits found by the method agreed well with expert annotations published in the literature subsequently we have shown that this approach can be used to identify functional sites in remote e g sequence_identity homology_models even when the structural template used to build the model is itself un annotated that is a structure without a known function e g a structural_genomics target can be used as an intermediate template to subsequently locate a functionally characterized structure and thus map putative_functional sites onto a distantly_related query_sequence here we describe a web_based implementation of the method called sesaw sequencederived structural_alignment weights that can automatically perform putative_functional residue mapping we emphasize that such mapping is intended to guide subsequent_experiments rather than to serve as a substitute for experimental annotations to whom correspondence should be addressed
