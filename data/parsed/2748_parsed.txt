sequence_analysis log odds sequence_logos motivation dna and protein patterns are usefully represented by sequence_logos however the methods for logo generation in common use lack a proper statistical basis and are non optimal for recognizing functionally_relevant alignment columns results we redefine the information at a logo position as a per observation multiple_alignment log odds score such scores are positive_or depending on whether a columns observations are better explained as arising from relatedness or chance within this framework we propose distinct normalized maximum_likelihood and bayesian measures of column information we illustrate these measures on high_mobility b hmgb box proteins and a dataset of enzyme alignments particularly in the context of protein_alignments our measures improve the discrimination of biologically_relevant positions availability_and our new measures are implemented in an open_source web_based logo generation program which is available at http www ncbi nlm nih gov cbbresearch yu logoddslogo index html a stand alone version of the program is also available from this site patterns or motifs that are shared among multiple dna or protein_sequences often correlate with important_biological a widely used method for representing and studying such patterns is provided by sequence_logos a sequence_logo represents concisely two important features of a multiple alignmentthe information content at each alignment position and the frequencies of the nucleotides_or observed at that position here we suggest modifications to the way in which the information content is usually measured these modifications yield a direct connection between the information for an alignment position and a multiple_alignment log odds score we have implemented a program that uses the modified information measures and illustrate its application to protein_alignments in the dna context it is appropriate to posit ignorance and use jeffreys priors essentially rendering measures a and b equivalent furthermore although these measures are formally distinct from the entropy difference measure for uniform background frequencies they differ only by an n dependent constant which approaches as n grows measures a and b do differ substantially from entropy difference in the important case of non uniform background frequencies but for large_datasets they are still similar to the known relative entropy measure thus it is primarily in the protein context that a user will encounter noticeable differences between the measures we propose and other measures in common use here to apply measure b to proteins we use the dirichet mixture dist ncbi described in for the sake of consistent comparison we use the background frequencies implied by this mixture throughout when used to analyze proteins logos are usually applied to multiple_alignments in which all the sequence_segments included are in fact related the primary purpose is to visualize those positions that are the most conserved and thus presumably the most relevant to protein_structure and function to illustrate the behavior of our various measures we first apply them to a particular hmgb box alignment in which the most important positions may be independently determined by structural_features and by conservation within a broader encompassing family second we consider a set of alignments of enzyme families in which the catalytic_sites stand as proxies for the most important positions
