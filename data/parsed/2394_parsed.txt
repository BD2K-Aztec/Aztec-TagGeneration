gene_expression improving performances of suboptimal greedy iterative biclustering heuristics via localization motivation biclustering gene_expression data is the problem of extracting submatrices of genes and conditions exhibiting significant correlation across both the rows and the columns of a data matrix of expression values even the simplest versions of the problem are computationally hard most of the proposed solutions therefore employ greedy iterative heuristics that locally optimize a suitably assigned scoring_function methods we provide a fast and simple pre_processing algorithm called localization that reorders the rows and columns of the input_data matrix in such a way as to group correlated entries in small local neighborhoods within the matrix the proposed localization algorithm takes its roots from effective use of graph_theoretical methods applied to problems exhibiting a similar structure to that of biclustering in order to evaluate the effectivenesss of the localization pre_processing algorithm we focus on three representative greedy iterative heuristic methods we show how the localization pre_processing can be incorporated into each representative algorithm to improve biclustering performance furthermore we propose a simple biclustering algorithm random extraction after localization real that randomly extracts submatrices from the localization pre processed data matrix eliminates those with low similarity_scores and provides the rest as correlated structures representing biclusters results we compare the proposed localization pre_processing with another pre_processing alternative non_negative we show that our fast and simple localization procedure provides similar or even better results than the computationally heavy matrix_factorization pre_processing with regards to h value tests we next demonstrate that the performances of the three representative greedy iterative heuristic methods improve with localization pre_processing when biological correlations in the form of functional enrichment and ppi verification constitute the main performance_criteria the fact that the random extraction method based on localization real performs better than the representative greedy heuristic methods under same criteria also confirms the effectiveness of the suggested pre_processing method availability supplementary_material including code implementations in leda c library experimental_data and the results are available atclustering refers to the process of organizing a set of input vectors into clusters based on similarity specified according to some predefined distance measure in many cases it is more desirable to simultaneously cluster the dimensions as well as the vectors themselves this special instance of clustering referred to as biclustering was introduced by hartigan although traditional one way clustering provides valuable information with regards to a global perspective extracting local substructures via biclustering may help build intuition on both dimensions of the data in addition to the areas such as data_mining and pattern_recognition biclustering has found many applications in bioinformatics specifically in microarray_analysis drug activity analysis and motif_detection in gene_expression analysis data are assumed to be arranged in a matrix where each gene corresponds to a row and each condition to a column after reordering rows and columns of the matrix a bicluster can then be defined as a submatrix with significant correlation among its data values such a submatrix is likely to group together genes that exhibit similar behavior over a subset of experimental_conditions one of the early approaches for biclustering expression data is that of cheng and church a meansquared residue score is defined and the algorithm greedily inserts removes rows and columns to arrive at a certain number of biclusters achieving some predefined residue score order preserving submatrix is another greedy iterative algorithm that finds a statistically_significant bicluster at each iteration maximum similarity biclusters msb starts by constructing a similarity matrix based on a reference gene a greedy strategy of removing rows columns iteratively is employed to provide the maximum similarity bicluster in polynomial time large average submatrices las is a recently_proposed algorithm which tries to extract large average submatrices according to a bonferroni based significance score several graph_theoretical approaches have also been suggested provided a divide_and algorithm bimax prelic that runs on discretized binary_data in samba the data matrix is viewed as a bipartite_graph where the genes conditions constitute the layers of the bipartite_graph and edges in the graph correspond to thepage
