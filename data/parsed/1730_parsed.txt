sequence_analysis factera a practical method for the discovery of genomic_rearrangements at breakpoint resolution for practical and robust de_novo identification of genomic fusions and breakpoints from targeted paired_end dna sequencing_data we developed fusion and chromosomal_translocation enumeration and recovery algorithm factera our method has minimal external dependencies works directly on a preexisting binary alignment map file and produces easily_interpretable output we demonstrate facteras ability to rapidly_identify breakpoint resolution fusion_events with high_sensitivity in patients with non_small including novel rearrangements we anticipate that factera will be broadly_applicable to the discovery and analysis of clinically_relevant fusions from both targeted and genome_wide sequencing_datasets availability_and http dna rearrangements resulting in gene_fusions represent a major class of somatically acquired structural_variation in human_malignancies notable examples_include the highly recurrent association of the philadelphia_chromosome in chronic_myelogenous and t q q translocations in follicular_lymphomas more recently recurrent fusions involving alk ros ret or ntrk were identified in non_small nsclc and tmprss_erg in prostate_cancer many structural_rearrangements are oncogenic driver_mutations and are increasingly therapeutically targetable owing to their unique junctional sequences fusions can also serve as exquisitely sensitive biomarkers of tumor_burden in cell_free which is continuously shed into diverse body_fluids advances in targeted high_throughput have enabled interrogation of virtually any genomic_region at low_cost facilitating large_scale analysis of genetic_variation recently we designed a kb targeted_sequencing panel for ultrasensitive assessment of circulating_tumor ctdna in nsclc to capture fusions we included intronic_regions from genes known to participate in nsclc rearrangements e g alk ros and developed a novel framework for fusion and breakpoint detection here we describe and benchmark factera a new software_tool for the discovery of genomic_rearrangements including translocations inversions and deletions because previous methods for fusion discovery perform well in simulated_data but tend to overestimate breakpoints in real tumor_genomes factera was designed to detect fusion_genes with high_specificity without compromising sensitivity using data from nsclc tumors and cell_lines we show that factera compares_favorably to previous_approaches achieves high_sensitivity and precisely and efficiently characterizes fusion_genes and breakpoints in targeted sequencing_data to evaluate facteras performance we applied our kb sequencing panel to eight nsclc tumor_genomes consisting of six patients and two cell_lines nci h hcc all harboring a known rearrangement in alk or ros as confirmed by fish factera identified inter gene_fusions with a median of two fusions per sample confirming all known alk and ros fusions while precisely characterizing unknown partner_genes breakpoints and reciprocal events supplementary for example factera detected a balanced slc a ros translocation in hcc whereas in patient p it identified a reciprocal eml_alk intrachromosomal fusion inversion along with two novel ros fusion partners mkx fyn both novel ros fusion_events along with three additional fusions in three samples were validated by qpcr supplementary moreover in every examined instance predicted breakpoints were experimentally_verified n supplementary notably while our capture panel was designed to target alk and ros without knowledge of their partners factera readily identified both known eml kif b slc a and cd and novel translocation partners for these genes next we assessed facteras sensitivity_and because all fusions involving alk or ros were either experimentally confirmed or represent a reciprocal partner of a validated fusion we considered all such events true_positives previous whole_genome studies reported a mean of structural_rearrangements per nsclc tumor indicating that less than one fusion should be expected within our kb capture panel by random chance the alk and ros fusions are therefore likely to comprise most if not all of the detectable structural_rearrangements within our eight sequencing samples suggesting a high_sensitivity because the remaining candidate fusions krtap krtap identified by factera map to repetitive genomic_regions they arguably represent false_positives arising from misalignment these candidates were readily eliminated using the ucsc repeatmasker track resulting in specificity without affecting true_positives supplementary methods if this step was omitted factera achieved a specificity of of fusions using the same datasets we then compared factera results with five previous fusion_detection methods supplementary only socrates and delly achieved a sensitivity of relative to factera however both reported many more candidate fusions as such we examined their outputs for concordant predictions reasoning that any such events might represent true fusions from candidates compared only fusions were found in common between them of which were also identified by factera supplementary because the remaining candidates were unique to each method we assessed whether they could be false_positives we evaluated hcc genomic_dna by pcr for putative fusions called by either delly or socrates but not both supplementary supplementary consistent with our concordance analysis none of these fusion candidates could be detected suggesting they arose from library_preparation or sequencing related artifacts in contrast primers targeting slc a ros a fusion identified by all three methods yielded the correct product supplementary finally a bp fusion within eif e patient p was predicted by both delly and socrates but missed by factera while factera was originally used to detect intergene fusions when reapplied to detect inter and intragenetic events section the same fusion was identified along with all
