sequence_analysis pavis a tool for peak annotation and visualization we introduce a web_based peak annotation and visualization pavis for annotating and visualizing chip_seq peak data pavis is designed with non bioinformaticians in mind and presents a straightforward user_interface to facilitate biological_interpretation of chip_seq peak or other genomic enrichment data pavis through association with annotation provides relevant genomic_context for each peak such as peak location relative to genomic_features including transcription_start intron exon or untranslated_region pavis reports the relative enrichment p values of peaks in these functionally_distinct categories and provides a summary plot of the relative proportion of peaks in each category pavis unlike many other resources provides a peak oriented annotation and visu_alization system allowing dynamic visualization of tens to hundreds of loci from one or more chip_seq simultaneously pavis enables rapid and easy examination and cross comparison of the genomic_context and potential functions of the underlying genomic_elements thus supporting downstream hypothesis_generation availability_and pavis is publicly accessed at http manticore niehs nih gov pavis the advance of sequencing_technology and its exponential declining cost have made it possible to conduct many genomewide studies to understand complex biological_processes such as gene_regulation epigenomic changes and chromatin_remodeling these studies have generated a large number of chip_seq that are subsequently parsed by peak_calling programs to report statistically_significant peaks for a genome_wide study the number of significant peaks can be tens to hundreds of thousands the biological_relevance of a chip_seq peak and the functions of its underlying dna_element are often dependent on its position relative to nearby genes or other functional_elements it can be a challenging and time consuming task to examine all peaks and to develop meaningful biological interpretations of their functional_relevance motivated by this challenge we developed the pavis tool to facilitate data comparison interpretation and hypothesis_generation from chip_seq peak data there are several existing software_tools that can be used for annotation and visualization of chip_seq e g cisgenome and peakanalyzer peakannotator all of these tools are useful for chip_seq peak data analysis and interpretation but they each have limitations peakanalyzer peakannotator is a highly_efficient tool with utilities not only for functional_annotation of peaks but also for sequence extraction supporting motif analysis however it does not provide peak visualization capability cisgenome provides capabilities similar to peakanalyzer cisgenome however does not support the annotation of many existing chip_seq peak files including many of those from the encode_project both the ucsc_genome and the integrative_genomics are powerful_tools and have more capabilities displaying multiple relevant data in different tracks their visualization capabilities however are designed to display maximal information for a single genomic_region one at a time as a complimentary tool pavis is designed to display multiple_loci simultaneously with each locus linked to the ucsc browser for additional information furthermore pavis can be used to annotate chip_seq in the context of nearby gene features
