systems_biology inference of gene_regulatory from genome_wide knockout fitness data motivation genome_wide fitness is an emerging type of high_throughput generated for individual_organisms by creating libraries of knockouts subjecting them to broad ranges of environmental_conditions and measuring the resulting clone specific fitnesses since fitness is an organism scale measure of gene_regulatory behaviour it may offer certain advantages when insights into such phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest over individual gene_expression previous_works have shown that genome_wide fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regulatory_interactions when compared with results of more conventional gene_expression analysis yet to date few algorithms have been proposed for systematically using genome_wide mutant fitness data for gene_regulatory results in this article we describe a model and propose an inference algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify underlying gene_regulatory unlike most prior methods the presented approach captures not only structural but also dynamical and non linear nature of biomolecular systems involved a state_space model with non linear basis is used for dynamically describing gene_regulatory network_structure is then elucidated by estimating unknown model_parameters unscented_kalman is used to cope with the non linearities introduced in the model which also enables the algorithm to run in on line mode for practical use here we demonstrate that the algorithm provides satisfying_results for both synthetic data as well as empirical measurements of gal network in yeast_saccharomyces and tyrrliur network in bacteria shewanella oneidensis availability matlab_code and datasets are available to download atin recent_years modelling and inference of biological regulatory_networks have become an active area of research in large part owing to the emergence of microarray_technology which allows for simultaneous measurement of gene_expression on the genome_wide scale the vast_amounts of data provided by gene_expression enable the possibility of accurate estimation of gene_regulatory organization which has greatly benefited a broad range of disciplinesfrom basic biological_sciences to bioengineering to medical_diagnosis and treatment the goal of inference algorithms is to discover the connectivity structure and potentially dynamic_characteristics of these networks based on such time or other state series data among other things the nature of inference algorithms varies depending on the types of biological_networks and the way they are modelled one category of models quantizes the empirical data into binary numbers and views network_structures as boolean constraints although this could be attempted in a deterministic framework both the uncertainties introduced by measurement errors as well as the inherent stochasticity of gene_expression make any experimental_data substantially probabilistic to impart this random nature to the boolean framework the probability boolean_network have been introduced however as biological_processes are neither digital nor homogeneous further gene regulatory modelling and inference refinements may be achieved by using alternative probabilistic network descriptions continuous time differential_equations stochastic_differential and control theory methods among others although any of these methods offers certain advantages_and in attempting to capture the structure and dynamics of gene_regulatory it should be noted that they have largely been designed toward describing gene_expression data recently however a new type of high_throughput data has emerged and seen

technological_advances to massively scale the traditional gene_deletion interruption studies in order to achieve nearly genome_wide coverage by generating knockout knockdown mutant_strain libraries for all non essential genes in an organism these libraries are then further subjected to a large number of environmental_conditions and stresseswith the observable in each of the settings being the fitness of individual clones collected in stationary_phase pairing the resulting data with an appropriate model of gene_expression then allows for the inference of the underlying gene_regulatory through estimation of significant interaction_terms along with those for production degradation expression_level etc although potentially applicable to any observable type this approach may be particularly well suited for the use with fitness data to help constrain any inferred gene_regulatory solutions to those dynamic modes that are most important for a given set of biological_functions and conditionse g growth on specific substrates or tolerance to certain stresses recent works have indeed suggested that the use of genome_wide fitness data can provide new perspectives on systems level organization of cells and uncover novel gene regulatory_interactions when compared with gene_expression based analysis yet although on a limited scale the idea of biological_network characterization based on knockout data has been considered before e g the emergence of high_throughput genome_wide gene_deletion interruption technology along with the use of population fitness rather than gene_expression as an observable offers novel challenges as well as benefits to the task of gene network_inference on the one hand microarray and other gene_expression experiments typically generate high_dimensional in the form of a real vector that comprises expression levels of multiple genes at each sampled time and or condition point whereas fitness measurements map the state of the system into a much lower dimensional spacee g that of a single real variable such as growth_rate this inevitably leads to significant loss of information on the other hand deletion experiments usually involve simply cultivating and observing cells which could be performed on a substantially larger scale much more efficiently and under significantly_greater range of conditions when compared with the relatively demanding gene_expression assays the ensuing ability to perform experiments simultaneously across the entire mutant collection substantially increases the overall genome_wide fitness data dimensionalityoften putting it on par with available gene_expression furthermore fitness observations allow for the preferential selection or overweighting of clones that display a desirable phenotype e g the stronger the selectionthe more significant the contribution of surviving strains this becomes an increasingly important factor in many biotechnological and biomedical_applications whereby the contribution of practically irrelevant genes is effectively being filtered outregardless of their statistical_significance or dynamic_state indeed it has been shown that this type of data is very useful for the determination of target gene_functions few systematic models and or inference algorithms have been proposed for the elucidation of regulatory_networks from fitness data conclusions are often being made on the basis of visual inspections or similar relatively naive strategies yet greater prominence and availability of such data along with indications that fitness profiling might contain information about gene_regulation suggest the need for a more comprehensive and rigorous inference approach the analysis of ample data provided by genome_wide fitness experiments may also be useful in complementing network_inference based on microarray_gene and such other data by helping to initialize them or further refine their results in this work we propose an algorithm for inferring_gene from genome_wide knockout fitness data our approach is based on describing biological_networks via a non linear dynamical_model and then elucidating model_parameters from fitness measurements the resulting parameter set can be used to identify the underlying regulatory network_structure as well as to make forward looking estimates of its function under temporal_dynamics or environmental changes in section we describe the system model and problem formulation in section we provide a heuristic sample ordering selection_algorithm based on correlation score to cope with the order selection problem that arises when using mutant fitness data in section we describe the parameter_estimation algorithm based on the unscented_kalman ukf technique in section we use the proposed algorithm to analyse both a synthetic example as well as experimental_data from yeast_saccharomyces and bacteria shewanella oneidensis which are further compared against known empirical results we conclude the article with a summary and remarks regarding the proposed model and inference algorithm we have proposed a dynamical_model and an algorithm for inference of gene_regulatory based on genome_wide knockout fitness dataan emerging data type whose utility in biological_systems identification has not been sufficiently explored to date the algorithm uses a statespace model to capture the dynamical and non linear nature of such networks an unscented_kalman is used to infer the unknown_parameters in order to cope with model non linearity although fitness data inherently suffers from loss of information caused by its reduced dimensionality when compared with the more widely explored gene_expression data type the potentially larger amounts of and more contextually phenotypically meaningful data provided may be able to compensate for the relative lack of resolution as our work appears to suggest the analysis of a synthetic example as well as empirical gal and tyrrliur network data presented here shows that the described algorithm is able to provide satisfying inference results even for relatively complex mechanisms ultimately the two data typesgene expression and knockout fitnessmay be expected to be most informative when used in a complementary fashion as noted previously inferences generated from genome_wide knockout fitness data could be used to facilitate network elucidation methods based on gene_expression by helping initialize or further refine their predictions conversely information provided by gene_expression data may be exploited by the proposed algorithm in conjunction with knockout fitness data to synergistically improve final inference results for instance gene_expression data may be collected under a more limited set of conditions for a subset of the mutant library or just for the wild_type and used for the initial inference of an augmented state vector yk g t k a t b t i t t t associated only with the gene_expression part of the model equations such preliminary_results could then be used as a prior for the subsequent network_inference round which uses genome_wide fitness data in order to take advantage of its potentially larger scale or more immediate availability across a range of conditions as well as to introduce corresponding phenotypically significant refinements as discussed earlier several other directions appear promising toward potentially further extending and improving the inference methodology proposed here for instance the non linear univariate interaction model equation may be augmented with explicitly multivariate terms this should serve to enhance resolution of non linear interactions for a given gene across multiple reaction partners and improve modelling accuracy though at a cost of substantial computational_overhead owing to complications related to multiplicative noise propagation and the need to account for intermediate molecular complexes perhaps a more straightforward approach involves using the model to accommodate multiple knockout experiments i e those involving multiple inactivated genes in each strain this is done analogously to the way single knockout networks have been analyzed here by simply setting all of the corresponding interaction_term coefficients to zero for the genes in question the reason we have focused less on such applications in this work however is the present scarcity of multiple versus single knockout observation data finally additional constraints could be incorporated to help account for other pre_existing sources of experimental or heuristic information for example we have noted earlier the possibility of applying feed optimization schemes to condition data ordering one may further look at various sparseness conditions as a way of improving computational_efficiency and incorporating pre_existing knowledge about the network during inference though care should be taken as significant variations in effective regulatory network_topology may naturally arise across experimental_conditions or in going from one related organism to another overall we believe that these questions help further support the suggestion that the analysis of genome_wide fitness data whether directly or in conjunction with gene_expression data towards understanding of biological_systems function and in particular inference of gene_regulatory organization offers a rich new area of future researchto which this article is seeking to make an initial contribution
