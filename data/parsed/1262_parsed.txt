data_and data_driven information_retrieval in heterogeneous collections of transcriptomics_data links sim s to malignant_pleural motivation genome_wide measurement of transcript_levels is an ubiquitous tool in biomedical_research as experimental_data continues to be deposited in public_databases it is becoming important to develop search_engines that enable the retrieval of relevant studies given a query study while retrieval systems based on meta_data already exist data_driven approaches that retrieve studies based on similarities in the expression data itself have a greater potential of uncovering novel biological_insights results we propose an information_retrieval method based on differential_expression our method deals with arbitrary experimental_designs and performs competitively with alternative_approaches while making the search results interpretable in terms of differential expression_patterns we show that our model yields meaningful connections between biological conditions from different studies finally we validate a previously_unknown connection between malignant_pleural and sim s suggested by our method via real_time in an independent set of mesothelioma samples availability supplementary data and source_code are available fromdna microarrays are a frequently used high_throughput tool for measuring gene_expression which is reflected in the continuously increasing amount of data available in public_repositories such as the gene_expression geo or arrayexpress the thousands of gene_expression studies in these repositories make it increasingly challenging to retrieve datasets that are relevant to the user at the same time the availability of these collections gives us the opportunity to develop retrieval methods that take into account the gene_expression data from these studies to deliver biologically_meaningful and provide insights into the molecular_mechanisms at work in the deposited studies there are two possible types of solutions for the task of retrieving relevant studies from databases knowledge driven approaches are based on the metadata used to describe the deposited gene_expression studies various forms of string matching algorithms have been applied to retrieve studies based on a textual query advanced solutions incorporate controlled_vocabularies or ontologies for semantic query expansion given high_quality annotations the likelihood of biological_relevance of the results is high but methods using this paradigm are limited to retrieving studies annotated with a known label moreover these approaches are fundamentally limited by the fact that the text_based description of a study and its results contains only a fraction of the information in the actual gene_expression data data_driven or content based_approaches to information_retrieval or meta_analysis have a high potential for discovering novel and biologically_meaningful relationships between the studied tissues organisms and biological conditions since similarities between studies are derived from shared expression_patterns page differential_expression is a natural encoding for a study as it describes the biological_variation between the studied conditions it is also a very useful basis for data_driven retrieval in heterogeneous collections of gene_expression studies and meta_analysis in general as it addresses issues such as inter platform incommensurability data_driven information_retrieval or meta_analysis methods typically consist of the following four components i a decomposition of the experimental_design of studies into differential_expression pairwise_comparison of genes or gene_sets ii a method to measure the significance of differential_expression e g foldchange t test or gene_set gsea which serves as a basis for encoding the studies iii a method to extract biological patterns of interest from the encoded studies and iv a relevance measure between studies conditions or microarrays supplementarydescribes the various existing_approaches for each of the components depending on their scope most existing_methods include only a subset of the components for instance the well known meta_analysis module map method does not include an approach for computing the relevance between studies conversely several information_retrieval methods do not make use of any method to extract shared expression_patterns three challenges that are particularly significant in the context of large and highly_heterogeneous gene_expression repositories but that so_far have not been addressed are the decomposition of studies with an arbitrary experimental_design facilitation of the biological_interpretation of the retrieval results and the systematic evaluation of the retrieval_performance for instance most methods are designed to deal only with studies comparing case versus control other methods are able to handle studies with arbitrary designs but decompose studies into comparisons in ways that induce study specific bias and hinder the interpretation of the retrieval results as an example comparing two phenotypes e g normal versus disease in a multifactorial study while ignoring additional experimental_variables may introduce confounding_factors in this article we propose rex data_driven retrieval of experiments which extends our earlier data_driven information_retrieval method an overview of the key_steps of the method is provided in first for the decomposition of studies into pairwise_comparisons we introduce an approach that takes_into the fact that a comparison depends not only on the phenotypes being compared but also on the phenotypes which are held_constant in the comparison i e the context in each comparison the other experimental factors need to have the same values in order to avoid confounding_factors unlike in our previous work this approach is applicable to any type of experimental factor the underlying data_driven modeling has also been extended our proposed unsupervised_learning model enables the detection of associations between studies and the interpretation of these associations in terms of recurrent patterns of differential_expression the new model additionally takes_into correlations in the activity of gene_expression moreover while the earlier method worked purely on the level of gene_sets we now additionally model the activity of the specific genes in the sets to increase accuracy and enable more specific interpretations finally we propose a novel ontology based_approach for evaluating the retrieval results to deal with the wide_range of biological and medical subject areas spanned by the studies in the repository we apply rex to a collection of studies taken from the arrayexpress repository involving three species human mouse and rat and corresponding to a total of phenotype comparisons in our previous feasibility study we applied our method to comparisons derived from human studies we show that the inferred differential expression_patterns correspond to functionally coherent core intersections of gene_sets we also demonstrate that the numerical retrieval_performance of our method is competitive with existing_approaches in a series of case studies we point out that connections between conditions found by our method have been confirmed in independent studies these case studies illustrate how conditions can be connected on a molecular level and provide evidence for the validity of our approach in an experimental_validation study we explored a connection found by our method that hints at a potential role of the basic helix loophelix transcription_factor single minded homolog short isoform sim s in malignant_pleural mpm which has not been previously described in the literature using realtime polymerase_chain rt_pcr we were able to detect significant sim s underexpression in an independent set of mpm tumors indicating that sim s may effectively have a role in mpm this shows that our data_driven information_retrieval approach can indeed be used to obtain novel biological_insights from large and heterogeneous collections of
