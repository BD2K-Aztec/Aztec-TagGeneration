sequence_analysis distilled single_cell genome_sequencing and de_novo for sparse microbial_communities motivation identification of every single_genome present in a microbial sample is an important and challenging_task with crucial applications it is challenging because there are typically millions of cells in a microbial sample the vast_majority of which elude cultivation the most accurate method to date is exhaustive single_cell using multiple_displacement which is simply intractable for a large number of cells however there is hope for breaking this barrier as the number of different cell_types with distinct genome_sequences is usually much smaller than the number of cells results here we present a novel divide_and method to sequence and de_novo assemble all distinct genomes present in a microbial sample with a sequencing cost and computational_complexity proportional to the number of genome types rather than the number of cells the method is implemented in a tool called squeezambler we evaluated squeezambler on simulated_data the proposed divide_and method successfully reduces the cost of sequencing in comparison with the navenave exhaustive approach availability squeezambler and datasets are available atcritical applications including the human_microbiome biothreat detection and combating antibiotic_resistant pathogens necessitate identification of all distinct genome_sequences in a bacterial sample when prior_knowledge is available about which organisms may be present in the sample flow_cytometry and s_rrna may be used however metagenomics is usually used for analyzing the genomics of relatively abundant microbes when no prior_knowledge is given metagenomics consists the study of the variation of species in a complex microbial sample because the vast_majority of environmental bacteria elude cultivation metagenomics investigates microbial_communities by sequencing sampled genome fragments without the need for culturing such a heterogeneous pool of sequencing_reads can also be assembled to yield a superposition of highly abundant genomes in the sample there are two problems with metagenomics i the resulting assembly contains multiple_genomes superimposed and ii only highly abundant genomes survive the sampling process advances in dna_amplification technology have enabled whole_genome directly from individual cells without requiring growth in culture single_cell methods have enabled investigation of novel uncultured microbes these culture independent single_cell studies are a powerful alternative to metagenomics studies genomic_sequencing from single bacterial_genomes was first demonstrated with cells isolated by flow_cytometry using multiple_displacement mda mda is now the preferred method for whole_genome amplification from single cells the first attempt to assemble a complete bacterial_genome from one cell further explored the challenges of assembly from amplified dna including amplification_bias and chimeric dna rearrangements amplification_bias results in orders_of difference in coverage and absence of coverage in some regions chimera formation occurs during the dna branching process by which the dna_polymerase generates dna_amplification in mda subsequent studies continued to improve single_cell assemblies a nearly full potential of single_cell genome_assembly has recently been realized by the work offollowed by those of owing to recent_progress in single_cell dna_amplification techniques and de_novo algorithms the genomes of all bacterial_species in a sample can be captured one cell at a time however there are often millions of cells per sample in which case the navenave deep_sequencing of every cell becomes prohibitively costly moreover it is expected that deep_sequencing of every cell is often not necessary as the majority of biologically_important samples are sparse in the sense that many cells are biological_replicates compressed cand s and and distilled adaptive sampling and refinement sensing methods have been proposed in the past_decade to exploit sparsity for reducing the cost of sensing and reconstructing signals in various spaces ranging from banach spaces to boolean algebras inspired by those advances we give an to whom correspondence should be addressed algorithm in this article that exploits sample sparsity to reduce the cost of sequencing without compromising the accuracy of identification of all distinct genomes even the ones that are minimally represented in the sample because we did not have access to real_data we tested our algorithm using simulated_data we used our tool mdasim to simulate mda processes one process per cell from distinct genomes the output of mdasim was fed into an illumina read generator art to generate illumina_reads with realistic errors from the simulated amplicons the set of generated_reads for each cell was treated like a microfluidic droplet from which samples without replacement are extracted in each iteration of squeezambler we assume that mda products are contamination free which require a contaminant free automated microfluidic cell_sorting amplification and sampling device we presented an adaptive divide_and algorithm for distilled sequencing and de_novo of distinct genomes in a bacterial_community e g human_gut samples derived from such communities are often sparse in the sense that the number of distinct genomes is much less than the number of cells our algorithm exploits sparsity to decrease the amount of sequencing and the number of multiplexing barcodes needed for single_cell and de_novo we implemented our algorithm in a tool which we call squeezambler and performed simulation_experiments to demonstrate its power our results show that i the number of required barcodes with our divide_and algorithm is less than that required by the navenave approach and that ii the amount of sequencing needed remains the same or decreases owing to the computational intensity of the problem only small examples with low sparsity were studied in this work real_world samples are much sparser species in cells than the examples here species in cells also the parameters used to run our tool were chosen conservatively and without optimization therefore we expect the improvement of our algorithm to be higher than what we reported in this article in real_world situations squeezambler identifies all distinct genomes in the sample which are candidates for different strains species those cells that are identified as having distinct genomes need to be subsequently deeply sequenced and assembled to obtain a more detailed assembly funding nih ro dk sttr r gm and nsf dbi to s d conflict of interest none declared
