systems_biology mirin identifying microrna regulatory_modules in protein_protein exploring microrna mirna regulations and protein_protein could reveal the molecular_mechanisms responsible for complex biological_processes mirin is a web_based application suitable for identifying functional_modules from protein_protein regulated by aberrant mirnas under user_defined biological conditions such as cancers the analysis involves combining mirna regulations proteinprotein_interactions between target_genes as well as mrna and mirna_expression provided by users mirin has successfully uncovered oncomirs and their regulatory_networks in various cancers such as gastric and breast_cancer availability_and mirin is freely_available micrornas mirna are short non coding rna_molecules that repress target gene_expression at the post_transcriptional level mirnas regulate critical biological_processes such as cell_growth tissue_differentiation and embryonic_development therefore corrupted mirna and dysfunctional mirna_biogenesis may lead to various disorders such as cancer most mirnas regulate a large_number and so it is difficult to determine the primary function of a given mirna previous_studies report that complexity of mirna regulation and topological characteristics of proteinprotein_interaction pins are correlated therefore the interacting_proteins targeted by a given mirna can reveal its function additionally because pins are dynamic in cellular_systems they have frequently been integrated with mrna expression_profiles to expose conditional network modules under a biological state consequently integrating mirna regulations with pins and expression_profiles of mirnas and mrnas could provide opportunities to identify mirna regulated pins and their function under specific biological conditions such as cancer versus normal samples here we designed a web_application mirin to identify disturbed mirna regulatory subnetworks and their functions under user specified biological conditions mirin takes_advantage of mirna_targets and proteinprotein_interactions ppis as well as incorporating gene_expression data to create conditionspecific mirna mediated pins although there already exists a similar tool mirconnx it does not incorporate ppis the core analytic procedure of mirin has been used to successfully_identify cancer associated mirna regulated pin modules in gastric and breast_cancer besides exploring individual mirna regulated subnetworks mirin also takes the co regulations of multiple_mirnas into consideration to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of mirna_regulatory to demonstrate the capabilities of mirin we applied it to invasive_carcinoma of the breast expression_profiles of mirnas and mrnas were obtained from the cancer_genome supplementary tables s and s after executing the analysis_pipeline of mirin we identified the top de mirnas downregulated and upregulated in breast_cancer tissue supplementary according to mir disease and of the mirnas are associated with breast and other cancers respectively we focused on mir regulatory_modules and found some interesting go terms such as response to estrogen stimulus and positive regulation of canonical wingless receptor signaling_pathway which are associated with the carcinogenesis supplementary from a network view we can see that mir might inhibit caveolin and modulate estrogen_receptor which are estrogen_responsive described as tumor_suppressors in breast_cancer supplementary furthermore by using gene_expression based outcome for breast_cancer online we found that the expression levels of genes involved in the mirna_regulatory identified by mirin can significantly affect breast_cancer patient survival_rates supplementary this case study exhibits how mirin could be used to help identify mirna_regulatory associated with user specified conditions overview of mirin functions through integrating user uploaded expression_profiles with built in mirna regulation and pin information mirin can identify mirna_regulatory and provide a summary tables describing statistical_information about de mirnas and their regulatory_networks b results from functional_enrichment that visualize functional_modules and summarize enriched functions c the activities of mirna regulatory_modules under specific biological conditions and d co regulations between de mirnas and their coregulatory networks modules
