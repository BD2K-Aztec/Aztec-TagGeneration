reliance a machine_learning and literature based prioritization of receptor_ligand pairings motivation the prediction of receptorligand pairings is an important area of research as intercellular communications are mediated by the successful interaction of these key_proteins as the exhaustive assaying of receptorligand pairs is impractical a computational_approach to predict pairings is necessary we propose a workflow to carry out this interaction prediction task using a text_mining approach in conjunction with a state of the art prediction method as well as a widely accessible and comprehensive dataset among several modern classifiers random_forests have been found to be the best at this prediction task the training of this classifier was carried_out using an experimentally_validated dataset of database of ligand receptor partners dlrp receptorligand pairs new examples co cited with the training receptors and ligands are then classified using the trained classifier after applying our method we find that we are able to successfully predict receptorligand pairs within the gpcr family with a balanced accuracy of upon further inspection we find several supported interactions that were not present in the database of interacting_proteins dipdatabase we have measured the balanced accuracy of our method resulting in high_quality predictions stored in the available database reliance the omics era has presented tremendous opportunities for highthroughput investigations into important questions facing the research_community many investigative strategies of implementing data_mining in combination with high_throughput experiments have accomplished much several of these highthroughput experimental methods yeast_two systemsy h pull_down assays tandem_affinity mass_spectrometry gavin to whom correspondence should be addressed microarrays and phage_display have all generated enormous datasets yet they are incomplete and are composed of many false_positives several databases exist to store information about validated or predicted proteinprotein_interactions ppi they include the munich information center for protein sequencesmips database the molecular interactionsmint database the intact database the database of interacting proteinsdip the biomolecular interaction_network databasebind and the biogrid database some like the yeast proteome database contain interactions which are derived from wet_lab results as well as those curated from literary sources currently there exists thousands of candidate receptors and ligands and potentially hundreds of thousands of interactions as the exhaustive assaying of every possible receptorligand pairs is impractical a computational_approach to the prediction task is necessary for example created a receptor_ligand matching algorithm for the chemokine and tgf families later we more aptly matched the tgf family with kernels with an increase in recall of over the obtained from the results offollowing this we have benchmarked several machine_learning and assayed several parameters on the receptorligand interaction prediction task submitted for publication the results of this work show that we can obtain a balanced accuracy of in this prediction task having used a golden_standard to determine which is the best machine_learning to apply to this problem we now seek to make in silico predictions the starting_point of this novel course of research is the widely_applied and powerful field of text_mining in this article we present a strategy that takes_into text_mining information in conjunction with a popular machine_learning algorithm the random_forest which integrates several data_sources such as domain expression and phylogeneticbased evidence we build our new candidate list by searching for genes that are co cited with the receptors and ligands from the dlrp database we then make predictions using our trained classifier and evaluate the results in terms of known pairs as well as in terms of distribution of the co citations in our ranked_list of predictions the new examples where mapped to gene_ontology and a search was performed for classifications containing the term receptor with more than five members the three classifications resulting from this search_criteria were peptide receptor activity g_protein transmembrane_receptor tyrosine_kinase and cytokine_receptor activity we then used the dip database as a baseline for calculations of sensitivity specificity and balanced accuracy for each classification
