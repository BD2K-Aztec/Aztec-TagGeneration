databases_and intside a web_server for the chemical and biological examination of drug side_effects drug side_effects are one of the main health_threats worldwide and an important obstacle in drug_development understanding how adverse_reactions occur requires knowledge on drug mechanisms at the molecular level despite recent_advances the need for tools and methods that facilitate side effect anticipation still remains here we present intside a web_server that integrates chemical and biological_information to elucidate_the drug side_effects intside currently catalogs side_effects caused by drugs associated with drug features divided_into eight categories belonging to either biology or chemistry on the biological side intside reports drug_targets and off targets pathways molecular_functions and biological_processes from a chemical viewpoint it includes molecular fingerprints scaffolds and chemical_entities finally we also integrate additional biological data such as protein interactions and disease related genes to facilitate mechanis tic interpretations availability_and our data and web_resource are available online http intside irbbarcelona org side_effects ses are defined as non therapeutic generally undesired phenotypic_responses to drug treatment they affect around million patients per year in the usa ranking the fourth cause of death anticipating ses before launching a drug to the market is crucial for reducing health_risks as well as costs and time during drug_development to address_this many databases and tools have flourished for instance the food_and developed the adverse_event faers that contains adverse_reactions and medication error reports another major ses repository is side effect resource sider which collects information on marketed medicines and their ses recorded in package labels the wealth of information in these repositories has enabled systematic studies on ses permitting for instance the computational inference of unknown drug_targets however most studies are not able to capture complex or unspecific events which are often directly related to the drug structure and reactivity the association between drug structure and its activity has indeed been used in predictive toxicology yet available resources offer very broad phenotypic categories and are not able to discriminate among the great variety of ses the emerging picture is that drug ses are the result of the interaction of small_molecules with complex_biological requiring an integration of chemical and biological details that unfortunately is not conducted in most studies very recently we presented a top_down approach to identify chemical and biological drug features that might be involved in the development of adverse_drug duran we delimited the chemical and biological space for each compound by gathering molecular_properties from major biomedical resources and carried_out an enrichment_analysis associating more than ses with molecular_features here we present a web_server named intside which automates this analysis and enables a quick and easy access to our findings moreover we further integrate additional biological_information such as protein interactions and disease related genes to facilitate mechanistic interpretations as a result intside provides a complete catalog of proteins cellular_processes and chemical_structures that may lead to undesired responses to drug_treatments
