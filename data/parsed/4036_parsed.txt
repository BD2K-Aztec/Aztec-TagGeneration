structural_bioinformatics rna_secondary diagrams for very large_molecules rnafdl there are many programs that can read the secondary_structure of an rna_molecule and draw a diagram but hardly any that can cope with bases rnafdl is slow but capable of producing intersection free diagrams for ribosome sized structures has a graph ical user_interface for adjustments and produces output in common formats availability_and source_code is available under the gnu_general v at http sourceforge net_projects rnafdl for linux and similar systems or windows using mingw rnafdl is implemented in c uses the cairo d graphics library and offers both command_line and graphical_user it might be a great simplification but the most popular method to show rna_structure remains the classic radial base_pair graph we describe rna force directed layout rnafdl whose strength is the ability to handle large_molecules and to produce diagrams without intersections without user intervention this type of diagram is extremely regular with fixed distances between consecutive bases and between members of base_pairs unpaired bases are placed on circle segments the rules mean that diagrams are easy to interpret but the rules cannot be enforced on larger_molecules they invariably lead to intersecting lines this means that programs either produce bad diagrams or bend the rules naview relaxes the rules for loop_regions with the consequence that loops may be distorted in size_and and larger structures are still not free of line intersections data not shown treated the intersection problem with a backtracking method but the code still cannot draw a large_ribosomal a more recent program can draw large structures without intersections but varies the distances between bases in loops there are no intersections but the size of the loops may not reflect the number of bases if automatic approaches fail one may allow or even encourage manual intervention varna and rnaviz both use sophisticated methods for an initial layout but rely on manual editing to get intersection free plots
