genome_analysis in silico identification of oncogenic_potential of fyn related_kinase in hepatocellular_carcinoma motivation cancer development is a complex and heterogeneous process it is estimated that of human genes probably contribute to oncogenesis whereas current experimentally_validated cancer_genes only cover of the human_genome thus hundreds of cancer_genes may still remain to be identified to search for new genes that play roles in carcinogenesis and facilitate cancer research we developed a systematic workflow to use information saved in a previously_established tumor associated gene tag database results by exploiting the information of conserved protein_domains from the tag we identified potential new tags as a proof_of one predicted oncogene fyn related_kinase frk which shows an aberrant digital expression pattern in liver cancer_cells was selected for further investigation using paired hepato cellular carcinoma_samples we found that frk was up regulated in of cases p tumorigenic assays performed in hep b and hepg cell_lines revealed a significant correlation between the level of frk expression and invasiveness suggesting that frk is a positive regulator of invasiveness in liver cancer_cells conclusion these findings implied that frk is a multitalented signal_transduction molecule that produces diverse biological_responses in different cell_types in various microenvironments in addition our data demonstrated the accuracy of computational_prediction and suggested that other predicted tags can be potential targets for future cancer research availability the tag database is available online at the bioinformatics centerhepatocellular carcinoma hcc is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and shows high prevalence in asia and africa according to the annual_report from the bureau of health_promotion department of health taiwan http www bhp doh gov tw bhpnet portal default aspx hcc is the second most common cancer in the taiwanese_population but is the leading_cause in taiwanese males although recent_studies have revealed many genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to the aberrant activation of several signaling_cascades including epidermal_growth and ras extracellular signalregulated kinase the pathogenesis of hcc is heterogeneous among patients so the molecular_mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis remain_largely cancer development is a complex and heterogeneous process and it may be brought about by multiple causes including chemical and physical mutation viral or bacterial_infection and hereditary mutations furthermore cancer is considered to be a genetic disease and develops at least in part because of dna_damage generally_speaking genes involved in tumorigenesis are divided_into two basic categories based on their actions oncogenes_and tsgs while oncogenes encode_proteins that control cell_proliferation and or apoptosis a tsg is a protein that protects a cell from entering the course of carcinogenesis it has been suggested that of human genes probably contribute to oncogenesis whereas current experimentally_validated cancer_genes only cover of the human_genome suggesting that hundreds of cancer_genes still remain to be identified a structural_element is the signature of a protein that specifies the unique function of that protein typically structural_elements like domains or motifs provide_clues to the functions of otherwise uncharacterized_proteins and are often used to search for novel members of a protein_family many new proteins belonging to various families have been identified through in silico approaches in humans and other species for example based on the well known five major cysteine_rich domains found a novel gel forming mucin muc muc in glandular tissues using a hidden_markov modelbased genome_wide search approach another example is the identification of new claudin family_members with a psi_blast based_approach these studies to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as demonstrate that computer_assisted approaches are efficient and flexible for identifying novel members of domain sharing protein_families we hypothesized that genes involved in tumorigenesis especially functionally_distinct groups of genes like oncogenes and tsgs code for global protein_families thus the members within a group may share_common domains that are signatures of their unique pathophysiological function if so the well characterized tumor associated protein_domains can be used to search for novel proteins that may be involved in tumorigenesis to test this hypothesis we first established a tumor associated gene tag database http www binfo ncku edu tw tag to provide information about commonly shared functional_domains in well characterized oncogenes and tsgs using tag genes as a training_set followed by computer_assisted searching in the human_genome we identified candidates with the potential to be involved in tumorigenesis for a proof_of study one candidate fyn related_kinase frk was chosen and its oncogenic_potential for invasiveness in hcc was validated protein_kinase is an enzyme that modifies other proteins by phosphorylation of tyrosine or serine_threonine amino_acid this usually results in a functional change of the target protein ptks which can be classified into receptor and non receptor_types are a large and diverse multigene_family involved in the regulation of a range of cellular_processes including proliferation migration differentiation death and cell_to in multicellular_organisms in humans perturbation of ptk signaling by mutations and other genetic_alterations results in deregulated kinase_activity and leads to the development of many diseases and malignant_transformation blume although the products of oncogenes can be classified into six broad groups transcription_factors chromatin remodelers growth_factors growth_factor signal_transducers and apoptosis regulators of the known oncogenes and proto_oncogenes involved in cancers code for ptks thus it was not surprising that the computational search using known oncogenes as the training_set showed that of the predicted tag oncogenes belonged to this specific family and the consequences of dysfunction of these ptks no doubt would be tumor_formation on the other hand a tumor_suppressor is a protein that either has a dampening or repressive_effect on the regulation of the cell_cycle or promotes apoptosis and sometimes both so it protects a cell from entering the path to carcinogenesis the functions of tumor_suppressor fall into many categories including proteins that are responsible for dna_damage and involved in cell_adhesion in agreement with these principles we found that the properties of the predicted tsgs were mainly binding ability and involvement in the processes of responses to stimuli as the most significant process involving these predicted tsgs was vascular_development angiogenesis and angiogenesis is considered to be an important step toward metastasis these data suggested that the newly predicted tsgs may participate in the control of tumor_metastasis frk also known as rak is a kda ptk that belongs to the src non receptor_tyrosine family and shares about amino_acid with fyn src and lyn because frk has different structural_features that comprise a putative bipartite nuclear_localization in the sh_domain and is uniquely localized in the nucleus frk is known to have a different set of substrates from other src family_members frk is expressed
