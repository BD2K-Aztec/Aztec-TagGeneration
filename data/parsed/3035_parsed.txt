systems_biology model_building and intelligent acquisition with application to protein subcellular_location classification motivation we present a framework and algorithms to intelligently acquire movies of protein subcellular_location patterns by learning their models as they are being acquired and simultaneously determining how many cells to acquire as well as how many frames to acquire per cell this is motivated by the desire to minimize acquisition time and photobleaching given the need to build such models for all proteins in all cell_types under all conditions our key innovation is to build models during acquisition rather than as a post_processing step thus allowing us to intelligently and automatically adapt the acquisition process given the model acquired results we validate our framework on protein subcellular_location classification and show that the combination of model_building and intelligent acquisition results in time and storage savings without loss of classification_accuracy or alternatively higher classification_accuracy for the same total acquisition time availability_and the data and software used for this study will be made available upon publication atthe creation of accurate and predictive_models for cells and tissues will require detailed information on the subcellular_location of all proteins the field of location proteomics is concerned with learning this information for entire proteomes and with capturing it in the form of generative_models that can be used in cell simulations given the scale of the problem efforts to optimize acquisition of location information are highly_desirable when studying the spatiotemporal behavior of proteins in a single_cell using fluorescence_microscopy we typically have to choose a priori the number of frames to acquire this can be problematic as we do not generally know in advance how many frames will be necessary to obtain the information we seek we thus risk acquiring either too few or too many frames than needed for our application to whom correspondence should be addressed thereby wasting time and storage space we use the term frame to represent a time point in the time lapse imaging of live cells similarly when learning about a homogeneous_population of cells here called class of cells we may take several cells from this class and acquire a movie of each however we do not know in advance how many cell movies we should acquire to gain an understanding of the class nor how many frames to acquire for each cell movie once again we risk acquiring too few cells and frames and not learning what we wish to know or wasting time by acquiring too many cells and frames reducing the area and duration of exposure to the exciting light also protects the sample from photobleaching and phototoxicity in fluorescence_microscopy in this work we propose intelligent model_building and acquisition algorithms to deal with the above problems these algorithms automatically_determine during acquisition when to stop acquiring frames from a particular cell and when to stop acquiring cells from a particular class as shown in they work by building models during acquisition this is in contrast to the sequential approach to processing microscopy_images which would view model_building as a post_processing step we apply the algorithms to d movies of t cell_lines tagged_with gfp with a different protein labeled in each cell_line we consider each cell_line to be a different class and determine the parameters of acquisition how many cell movies we need to learn about each class and how many frames we need in each cell movie we test these algorithms by trying to recognize classify the pattern of the labeled_proteins and show that we can build models both of an individual cell and of a class of cells which can then be used to correctly_classify the subcellular_location pattern of a given cell when we build models from data that is intelligently acquired the models achieve a higher classification_accuracy on an independent test_set than when we build models from the same amount of data acquired with standard acquisition methods a fixed number of frames per cell and a fixed number of cells per class we have demonstrated that intelligently choosing when to stop acquiring frames and cells leads to an increased accuracy for a given amount of acquired data or equivalently a reduced acquisition time and resources for a given accuracy the intelligent acquisition algorithms described here are not closely_tied to the model_building procedure used and thus have broad_applicability in other modeling scenarios in addition we have presented a model_building technique based solely on the locations and types of objects present within a cell and shown that the resulting models can classify with a higher accuracy than previous results using all of the image data automated microscopy is increasingly used both for basic_research in cell and systems_biology and for drug_screening and development approaches such as those we have described here can be directly incorporated into automated microscopes such as high_content systems which are typically designed to include decision_making during acquisition alternatively they can also be relatively easily added to conventional microscopes in this case the main_challenge is to create a control_loop between the model_building software mbs and the microscope control software mcs in particular to give the mbs the ability to control rudimentary aspects of microscope acquisition the two critical requirements are for the mbs to be able to retrieve each cell image after it is acquired and for the mbs to be able to either initiate acquisition of the next frame or stop acquisition of the next frame assuming that continued acquisition of a large number of frames is the default these are surprisingly difficult to achieve with the mcs of commercial microscopes as typically configured because some microscopes wait until all or a certain number of frames have been acquired before writing them to disk and because the mcs often cannot itself be controlled other than via a graphical_user at least three solutions present themselves the first is to configure the microscope with optional macro languages provided by the manufacturer that can incorporate external software into the control_loop the second is to use third_party mcs such as the open_source micromanager which give nearly complete microscope control this is an excellent solution with the main disadvantages being that manufacturer support may be lacking in the case of hardware problems and that the performance latency acquisition speed may not be as good as the software that has been optimized for the manufacturers hardware the last is to use software that simulates interaction with the graphical_user to perform basic control this solution is the lowest cost and has the minimal impact but the external control software may need to be extensively modified to work with new versions of the manufacturer software once the control_loop is established implementation of the approaches described here is straightforward as discussed above the time required for computing models is small relative to acquisition time the one potential exception is the time required for defining the object types which is not included in the modelbuilding time the object types are assumed to be constant during the model_building to learn object types we currently use k_means for many different values of k and the time required can be many minutes in the extrinsic scenario this is not a problem since classes do not change in the intrinsic scenario the object types may need to be relearned when a new class is observed possible solutions include reducing the range of k over which the search is done using more highly optimized clustering code and or using online or incremental clustering_approaches for the future we plan to extend the methods described here to allow models to be built from image series collected with spatial_and that may vary under computer control
