comparing genome_wide chromatin profiles using chip_chip or chip_seq motivation chip_chip technologies_provide genome_wide measurements of various types of chromatin_marks at an unprecedented_resolution with chip samples collected from different tissue_types and or individuals we can now begin to characterize stochastic or systematic changes in epigenetic patterns during development intra individual or at the population level inter individual this requires statistical_methods that permit a simultaneous comparison of multiple chip samples on a global as well as locus specific scale current analytical_approaches are mainly geared toward single sample investigations and therefore have limited applicability in this comparative setting this shortcoming presents a bottleneck in biological interpretations of multiple sample data results to address this limitation we introduce a parametric classification approach for the simultaneous analysis of two or more chip samples we consider several competing_models that reflect alternative biological assumptions about the global_distribution of the data inferences about locus specific and genome_wide chromatin differences are reached through the estimation of multivariate mixtures parameter_estimates are obtained using an incremental version of the expectationmaximization algorithm iem we demonstrate efficient scalability and application to three very diverse chip_chip and chip_seq the proposed approach is evaluated against several published chip_chip software_packages we recommend its use as a first pass algorithm to identify candidate_regions in the epigenome possibly followed by some type of second pass algorithm to fine_tune detected peaks in accordance with biological or technological criteria availability r source_code is available at http gbic biol rug nl supplementary epigenetic_modifications such as methylation of dna or histones are associated with the transcriptional output of genes hence they occupy a central role in genome function the use of chromatin_immunoprecipitation techniques coupled with tiling arrays chip_chip or deep_sequencing chip_seq now permit a detailed characterization of various types of chromatin_marks on a genome_wide scale global surveys of this type have been mainly conducted in the context of a single_genome analyses however to begin to understand the epigenetic basis of biological_variation detailed comparisons of chromatin profiles between different tissues and or individuals are becoming increasingly important such comparative_studies can be broadly divided_into those that are concerned with intra_individual and those concerned with inter_individual the goal of intra individual analysis is the detection of key chromatin_modifications that are associated with or possibly drive normative processes such as tissue development for instance recently compared mammalian_cells across several stages of differentiation in order to map the genome_wide changes in dna_methylation and several histone_marks that reflect this progression the focus of inter individual comparisons in contrast rests on the analysis of chromatin differences between individuals for a given tissue this is accomplished by either treating each individual as a separate unit of analysis or by comparing pooled tissue from individuals that belong to a priori well defined groups a clear example for this latter type of application comes from oncology studies where cancerous_tissues from patients are directly evaluated against normal_tissue from healthy_individuals apart from clinically_relevant inter_individual attention has recently shifted to naturally_occurring chromatin variation a recent survey of several arabidopsis ecotypes for instances has revealed substantial variation in genomewide dna_methylation part of which has been shown to be stably transmitted across generations this latter observation suggests that many of the experimental_populations that are derived from these ecotypes and used for genetic_mapping experiments such as f intercrosses or recombinant_inbred rils could segregate a source of epigenetic variation that impacts many commonly_studied complex_traits independent of dna sequence_polymorphisms in light of this possibility we have argued for a genome_wide characterization of available parental lines to identify those that are most divergent on the level of chromatin such lines can be used to obtain epigenetically informative line crosses which could become the basis for the dissection of the epigenetic architecture underlying continuous trait variation the above intra_and individual applications share a common problem they require a methodological_approach that permits a meaningful partition of the epigenome into regions with differentially enrichment rde regions with shared enrichment rse and regions with shared non enrichment rsne for a chromatin mark of interest and supplementary in many practical situations researchers are interested in comparing a small number of chip samples possibly as low as two each sample being presented by one tiling_array or sequencing_experiment small numbers of samples are common because of financial_constraints or because they represent pilot_studies most available software_packages for the analysis of chip_chip or chip_seq have been designed for single_genome i e single_chip sample investigations and therefore have limited application in this setting supplementary tables s and s in an attempt to overcome_these we introduce a parametric classification_method based on multivariate mixture_models the approach permits a direct comparison of two or more chip samples its unique feature lies in the characterization of the global_distribution of the data in accordance with several plausible biological_models at the same time it provides probabilistic estimates of locus specific chromatin_states to ease computational_demands we implement an incremental version of the expectationmaximization iem algorithm we illustrate our approach in the context of two published chip_chip experiments and one unpublished chip_seq experiment we highlight the utility of our approach in terms of the biology of each example dataset we also evaluate our approach against several published chip_chip software_packages we presented a parametric classification_method for genome_wide comparisons of chromatin profiles between multiple chip samples for simplicity we focused our discussion on the special_case of a two sample comparison extensions to additional dimensions are possible the number of components that have to be considered to capture the rde structure between additional conditions increases at a rate d where d denotes the number of conditions involved in the comparison while the interpretation of the classification results becomes increasingly_complex the actual modeling benefits greatly from the imposed parameter constraints so that the number of parameters to be estimated increases at a much slower rate
