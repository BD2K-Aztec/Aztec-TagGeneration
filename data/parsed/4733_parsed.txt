treedom a graphical web_tool for analysing domain_architecture evolution we present treedom a web_tool for graphically analysing the evolutionary_history of domains in multi_domain individual_domains on the same protein chain may have distinct evolutionary_histories which is important to grasp in order to understand protein_function for instance it may be important to know whether a domain was duplicated recently or long_ago to know the origin of inserted domains or to know the pattern of domain loss within a protein_family treedom uses the pfam_database as the source of domain annotations and displays these on a sequence tree an advantage of treedom is that the user can limit the analysis to n sequences that are most similar to a query or provide a list of sequence ids to include using the pfam alignment of the selected sequences a tree is built and displayed together with the domain_architecture of each sequence multi_domain have evolved by insertions_or of distinct protein_domains tracing the history of a certain domain combination can be important for functional_annotation of multidomain_proteins and for understanding the function of individual_domains in order to analyze the evolutionary_history of the domains in multi_domain it is desirable to inspect the sequence tree for each domain together with the domain_architecture of the sequences a few graphical tools exist that can combine trees with domain_architectures nifas is a java_applet based on outdated java libraries that does not work in many current browsers although it is a general_purpose tool it has mainly been used as a plugin to the pfam_database but this is no longer supported another discontinued tool is the treedomviewer domosaics is a java_applet package that includes a panel with a tree and unproportional domain_architectures however it requires substantial manual work to produce such a view for a given case which limits its usability the phylomedb database for complete catalogs of gene phylogenies has a similar graphic display that also contains features other than domains it is however limited to the phylogenies in phylomedb and not for general_purpose the same is true for the inparanoid database sonnhammer and that shows domain_architectures and tree for proteins in an orthologue group finally the treefam database of animal phylogenetic_trees has a tree and domain_architecture graphic which is built on a reusable biojs tree javascript component
