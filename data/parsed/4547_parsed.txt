tempi probabilistic modeling time evolving differential ppi_networks with multiple information motivation time evolving differential proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks are essential to understand serial activation of differentially_regulated up or downregulated cellular_processes drps and their interplays over time despite developments in the network_inference current methods are still limited in identifying temporal transition of structures of ppi_networks drps associated with the structural_transition and the interplays among the drps over time results here we present a probabilistic_model for estimating time evolving differential ppi_networks with multiple information tempi this model describes probabilistic relationships among network_structures time course gene_expression data and gene_ontology biological_processes gobps by maximizing the likelihood of the prob abilistic model tempi estimates jointly the time evolving differential ppi_networks tdns describing temporal transition of ppi network_structures together with serial activation of drps associated with tran siting networks this joint estimation enables us to interpret the tdns in terms of temporal transition of the drps to demonstrate the utility of tempi we applied it to two time course datasets tempi identified the tdns that correctly delineated temporal transition of drps and time dependent associations between the drps these tdns provide hypotheses for mechanisms_underlying serial activation of key drps and their temporal associations availability_and source_code and sample data_files are available atmany cellular_events involve serial activation of cellular_processes during which genes proteins associated with the processes are up or downregulated differential proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks dns have been used to delineate ppis edges among differentially_regulated nodes drns such as up or downregulated genes or proteins the dns have been considered more effective for understanding the differences between two conditions compared with non dns however the dns delineate no temporal transition of the drns and or their edges to represent serial activation of cellular_processes over time thus time evolving differential ppi_networks tdns have been introduced to delineate i temporal changes in abundances or activities of drns node transition and or ii formation of new edges for the drns and disappearance of existing edges over time edge transition the tdns are essential to understand serial activation of differentially_regulated cellular_processes drps during a cellular_event and their underlying_mechanisms time course gene_expression analysis can provide temporal changes in abundances of the drns several interaction assays such as yeast_two and mass spectrometrybased tandem_affinity can be used to measure ppis among the drns however it is still challenging to experimentally identify temporal transition of the edges among the drns because of the limited coverage of the interactomes detected by these assays von the limitation of the experimental methods prompted us to develop a computational_method to estimate tdns many methods for estimation of dynamic gene_regulatory have been developed however estimation of temporal transitions of differential ppi_networks i e tdns has been rarely studied a couple of methods have been developed to identify differential ppi_networks which can be then used to estimate tdns first a simple method to infer dns using timecourse gene_expression data identifies drns over time and constructs a template ppi_network with the known ppis among all the drns tdns can be then constructed by selecting the interacting drns with significant expression changes at each t from the template ppi_network second principal network_analysis pna identifies differential expression_patterns over time and then selects drns and their edges known ppis between the drns showing the differential expression_patterns a principal subnetwork ps is then constructed using both drns and edges selected for each differential_expression pattern finally tdns can be constructed by selecting the edges in pss for which the linked drns show significant expression changes at each t functional_interpretation of the inferred tdns is important to understand temporal transition of the drps in most of the network_inference it is commonly performed independently from network_inference using post_hoc of gene_ontology biological_processes gobps of the nodes in the inferred networks for example the method proposed byclusters the nodes in timeevolving networks based on the similarity of temporal transitions of their edges and then links these clusters to cellular_functions to whom

information such as gobps during the network_inference such that the inferred tdns can represent directly temporal transition of differentially_regulated gobps and time dependent interplays between the gobps thereby facilitating functional_interpretation of the tdns here we introduce a probabilistic_model for estimating timeevolving differential ppi_networks with multiple information tempi although many methods have used probabilistic modeling for estimating network_structures a unique aspect of our model is that it models additionally probabilistic dependencies of gobps with network_structures and time course global data by maximizing the likelihood_function of the probabilistic_model tempi jointly estimates the tdns showing temporal transitions of network_structures with temporal activation of the gobps and their temporal interplays during the network_inference tempi infers edges not included in the known ppis whereas most of the previous methods e g pna select a subset of ppis for estimation of tdns from the known ppis
