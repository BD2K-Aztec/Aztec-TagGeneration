parallelization of the mafft multiple_sequence program multiple_sequence msa is an important step in comparative sequence analyses parallelization is a key technique for reducing the time required for large_scale sequence analyses the three calculation stages all to all comparison progressive alignment and iterative refinement of the mafft msa program were parallelized using the posix threads library two natural parallelization strategies best first and simple hill climbing were implemented for the iterative refinement stage based on comparisons of the objective scores and benchmark scores between the two approaches we selected a simple hill climbing approach as the default availability the parallelized version of mafft is available at
