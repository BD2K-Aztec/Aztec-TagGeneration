maestroweb a web_server for structure based protein_stability prediction the prediction of change in stability upon point_mutations in proteins has many applications in protein analysis and engineering we recently adjoined a new structure based method called maestro which is distributed as command_line program we now provide access to the most important features of maestro by an easy to use web_service maestroweb allows the prediction of change in stability for user_defined mutations provides a scan functionality for the most de stabilizing n point_mutations for a maximum of n creates mutation sensitivity_profiles and evaluates potential disulfide_bonds maestroweb operates on monomers multimers and biological assemblies as defined by pdb availability_and maestroweb is freely_available use at https point_mutation can have a strong impact on protein_stability while in biomedical_research functional consequences are of particular interest in protein_engineering often targeted stability changes are intended different computational_approaches to predict the change in stability upon point_mutations have been developed methods using the d structure of the wild_type protein e g i mutant popmusic or duet turned out to perform better than purely sequence based_approaches in general however the new sequencebased method inps closes this performance gap for some datasets and is also able to complement and improve structure based_approaches we recently_introduced a novel structure based method called maestro which has a similar or better accuracy than the competitor methods maestro offers additional benefits which are i report of a prediction confidence value ii operation on multimeric proteins iii a scan mode for the most de stabilizing n point_mutations and iv evaluation of potential disulfide_bonds here we present maestroweb which provides an easy to use web_interface to maestro for the most frequent application scenarios we have introduced maestroweb an easy to use web_service for the prediction of changes in stability upon point_mutations in proteins it provides several common types of in silico mutation experiments the applicability on multimeric structures and the improved accuracy on multi point_mutations make maestroweb outstanding in comparison to other web_tools
