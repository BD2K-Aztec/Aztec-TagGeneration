systems_biology mseasy unsupervised and untargeted gc_ms data_processing mseasy performs unsupervised data_mining on gas chro matographymass spectrometry data it detects putative compounds within complex metabolic mixtures through the clustering of mass_spectra retention_times or retention indices are used after clustering together with other validation criteria for quality_control of putative compounds the package generates a fingerprinting or profiling matrix compatible with nist mass_spectral search program and aristo webtool automatic reduction of ion spectra to ontology for molecule identification most commonly used file_formats netcdf mzxml and ascii are acceptable a graphical and user_friendly interface mseasytkgui is available for r novices availability mseasy and mseasytkgui are implemented as r packages available at http cran r project org_web mseasy index html and http cran r project org_web mseasytkgui index htmlunveiling metabolic_profiles of biological_systems and their interface with their environment are being studied increasingly in an untargeted holistic manner indeed global metabolic_profiling or fingerprinting provides a very powerful means of classifying comparing and discriminating groups of samples gas chromatographymass spectrometry gc_ms is one of the leading analytical platforms for this approach this hyphenated mass_spectrometric technique produces large multidimensional data with retention_times and peak quantification from gas_chromatography and mass to charge ratio m z and fragment intensity from mass_spectrometer handling such complex datasets requires efficient bioinformatics processing_tools in a recent review of bioinformatics_tools in metabolomics have shown that the alignment i e the elimination of retention time shifts between datasets is still a challenging step associated with numerous technical_difficulties here we present an alternative approach for gc_ms data_processing insensitive to shift in retention time mseasy works directly on the raw mass_spectra ms rather than on extensively corrected chromatograms unsupervised clustering_algorithms group ms into putative compounds the optimal number of putative compounds in the dataset is identified when the total number of molecules is unknown mseasy accelerates the data_processing and helps to interpret complex gc_ms datasets by extracting human understandable structure and supplying quality_control criteria the method was developed as an r package offering substantial flexibility and opportunities for further developments the novel r package mseasy is a free easy to use and powerful raw data_processing pipeline that extracts essential information from raw gc_ms data with minimal effort it is insensitive to shift in retention time and does not require chromatogram alignment mseasy speeds up greatly gc_ms data_processing allows handling large amount of data and limits labor_intensive and error_prone tasks
