construction of co complex score matrix for protein complex prediction from ap ms data motivation protein_complexes are of great_importance for unraveling the secrets of cellular_organization and function the ap ms technique has provided an effective high_throughput to directly measure the co complex relationship among multiple proteins but its performance suffers from both false_positives to computationally predict complexes from ap ms data most existing_approaches either required the additional knowledge from known complexes supervised_learning or had numerous parameters to tune method in this article we propose a novel unsupervised_approach without relying on the knowledge of existing complexes our method probabilistically calculates the affinity between two proteins where the affinity score is evaluated by a co complexed score or c s in brief in particular our method measures the log likelihood_ratio of two proteins being co complexed to being drawn randomly and we then predict protein_complexes by applying hierarchical clustering_algorithm on the c s score matrix results compared with existing_approaches our approach is computationally_efficient and easy to implement it has just one parameter to set and its value has little effect on the results it can be applied to different species as long as the ap ms data are available despite its simplicity it is competitive or superior in performance over many aspects when compared with the state of the art predictions performed by supervised or unsupervised approaches a protein complex is a group of two or more associated polypeptide_chains most proteins participate in cellular_processes by interacting with other molecules often with other proteins in the assembly of operational complexes to better understand and detect the cocomplexed relationship among proteins the screening technique of affinity_purification followed by mass_spectrometry ap ms has been designed and applied by two research groups to detect the full yeast interactome in an ap ms experiment a tagged protein is expressed in yeast and then pulled down from a cell_extract along with any proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed associated with it by co immunoprecipitation or by tandem_affinity the set of pulled down proteins is then identified by ms in a laborious and expensive process this procedure has been systematically applied to large sets of yeast proteins the tagged protein in ap ms is also typically called the bait and the proteins it pulls down are called the preys ap ms experiments measure complex co membership and the fact that a prey is found by certain bait means that there is either a direct_physical or an indirect physical_interaction functional interaction mediated by a protein complex since ap ms data provide us direct information about the co complex relationships among proteins it is thus more useful resources for complex detection compared with pairwise protein interaction data however ap ms screening may not be good enough to detect protein_complexes directly because a single bait protein may be involved in more than one complex in a cell it may therefore capture a set of prey proteins which actually never occur in the same complex in addition it is well known that real purification data are noisy and it contains many false_positives to deal with these problems several notable computational_approaches have recently been proposed to identify protein_complexes from ap ms data which typically consist of following three steps the first step is to assess the protein interaction affinities assigned a probability to each pair of proteins by using a stacking algorithm an advanced supervised_learning algorithm from machine_learning on experimental reproducibility and mass_spectrometry scores with the hand curated mips complexes as the training_set described the socio affinity sa scores of comparing the number of cooccurrences of two proteins against the random expectation by using a combination of spoke and matrix model developed the purification enrichment pe scores as a modified_version of sa scores in the probabilistic_framework of a nave_bayes classifier designed a matrixmodel scoring algorithm based on the hypergeometric_distribution proposed the dice coefficient dc to measure interaction affinity between two proteins based on similarity of their co purification patterns after the affinity scores are calculated the second step is to construct a proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network by applying a threshold or cutoff value tried all thresholds to determine the one that yielded the set of predicted complexes with the best performance of balanced accuracy and coverage against the set of manually_curated mips complexes tested a series of thresholds and chose the one that produced the best f measure the harmonic mean of recall and precision on the mips complexes finally the third step isin this section we first elaborate the ap ms datasets we used and list the complex sets predicted by current state of the arts for comparison then we compare our predicted complex sets on the integrated gavin and krogans data with those existing ones in terms of widely used evaluation metrics such as accuracy recall co localization and functional co annotation finally the result of applying our method on gavins data alone is also presented used only one mass_spectrometry method maldi_tof to identify proteins co purified with a bait while
