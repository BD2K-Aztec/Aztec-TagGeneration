genome_wide synteny through highly_sensitive sequence_alignment satsuma motivation comparative_genomics heavily relies on alignments of large and often complex dna_sequences from an engineering perspective the problem here is to provide maximum sensitivity to find all there is to find specificity to only find real homology and speed to accommodate the billions of base_pairs of vertebrate_genomes results satsuma addresses all three issues through novel strategies i cross_correlation implemented via fast_fourier ii a match scoring_scheme that eliminates almost all false hits and iii an asynchronous battleship like search that allows for aligning two entire fish genomes and mb in cpu hours using processors on a single machine availability satsuma is part of the spines software_package implemented in c on linux the latest_version of spines can be freely downloaded under the lgpl_license fromthe problem of identifying dna_sequences that share a common_origin dates back to the beginning of modern genomics and a number of sequence_alignment programs have been developed over the past_years an incomplete list includes fasta the blast family including blastz and megablast http blast wustl edu ssearch mummer blat patternhunter comparative genome biology aims to find genomic differences as well as similarities from a computational perspective this requires providing pairwise sequence_alignments at maximum sensitivity specificity and acceptable speed while full dynamic_programming approaches such as in in theory yield maximal sensitivity it is not practical to apply them to large_datasets e g entire vertebrate_genomes because of the high_computational to whom correspondence should be addressed two other approaches have been used to address_this i suffix_tree based_methods e g which are very fast but limited to highly_similar sequences and ii k tuple or seeded matches where specific regions are considered for more thorough alignments if a minimum number of seeds either consecutive runs of bases ktuples k_mers or windows that allow for mismatches in certain positions but not others can be matched perfectly between both sequences so that the size of the seed i e the minimum number of bases that need to match determines the runtime of the program versus its sensitivity seeded aligners generally require genomic_sequences to be masked for repeats and or these programs dynamically filter out seeds that occur too many times to avoid runtimes that increase exponentially with seed frequency satsuma is a new sequence_alignment program which in contrast finds sequence matches through cross_correlation a widely used technique in audio signal_processing when we treat genomic_sequences as if they were audio signals applying cross_correlation is like finding decayed echoes of originally identical acoustic patternsin this case homologous dna that has diverged over time for similar yet conceptually different approaches applying crosscorrelation to dna_sequence see cross_correlation computes a measure of similarity between two analog signals in the time domain as a function of time lag or relative shift between them resulting in a sliding dot product of both signals this operation can be done in the frequency_domain as a number of multiplications at computational_cost that is linear with the signal length given that the transformation back_and between time and frequency domains is computed rapidly using the fast_fourier fft algorithm cross_correlation can be computed very efficiently however it is not computationally possible to fourier_transform large sequences such as entire chromosomes at once runtime o n log n so satsuma divides genomic_sequences the query and the target into windows bp by default that overlap in the query_sequence overlap one fourth of the size when a query window is compared to a target window nucleotides from both sequence windows are translated into four numeric signals one for each base or letter a c g and t and cross_correlation is applied to each signal pair after summing up the results for all letters we are left with a function that indicates the letter similarity between query
