systems_biology gosemsim an r package for measuring semantic_similarity among go terms and gene_products the semantic comparisons of gene_ontology go annotations provide quantitative ways to compute similarities between genes and gene groups and have became important basis for many bioinformatics_analysis approaches gosemsim is an r package for semantic_similarity computation among go terms sets of go terms gene_products and gene_clusters four information content ic and a graph based_methods are implemented in the gosemsim package multiple species including human rat mouse fly and yeast are also supported the functions provided by the gosemsim offer flexibility for applications and can be easily integrated into high_throughput analysis_pipelines availability gosemsim is released under the gnu_general within bioconductor_project and freely_available atthe gene_ontology go is becoming the de facto standard for the annotation of gene_products the go consortium annotates gene_products with terms from three orthogonal ontologies organized as directed_acyclic laying the foundation for quantitative semantic comparisons several metrics have been proposed to measure the semantic_similarity between go annotations and have been verified in terms of the correlations with sequence_similarity proteinprotein_interactions and gene_expression the go semantic_similarity provides the basis for functional comparison of gene_products and therefore has been widely used in bioinformatics applications such as protein sub nuclear_localization prediction gene_function and cluster_analysis of genes two typical approaches to measure semantic_similarity of go terms are information content ic and graph_based measures to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the ic based measures depend on the frequencies of two go terms involved and that of their closest common_ancestor term in a specific corpus of go annotations such as the uniprot knowledgebase three ic based measures resniks lins and jiang and conraths have been introduced from natural_language taxonomies byto compare gene_products in early time on the basis of resniks and lins definition an ic based measure has also been presented by considering that the specificity of a go term is usually determined by its location in the go graph proposed a graph_based strategy to compute semantic_similarity using the topology of the go graph_structure in the wangs method the semantics of go terms are encoded into a numeric format and the different semantic contributions of the distinct relations are considered several online tools for semantic_similarity measurement of gene_products are available at present such as g sesame and fussimeg http xldb fc ul pt rebil ssm to facilitate large_scale analysis two freely_available software_packages gograph and gosim implementing classic ic based_methods for semantic comparison of go terms have also been developed here we present an r package named gosemsim to compute semantic_similarity among go terms sets of go terms gene_products and gene_clusters providing both ic and graph based_methods
