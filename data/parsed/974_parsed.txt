chromplot visualization of genomic_data in chromosomal context visualizing genomic_data in chromosomal context can help detecting errors in data_processing and may suggest new hypotheses to be tested here we report a new tool for displaying large and diverse genomic_data along chromosomes the software is implemented in r so that visualization can be easily integrated with its numerous packages for processing genomic_data it supports simultaneous visualization of multiple tracks of data large_genomic such as qtls or synteny tracts may be shown along histograms of number of genes genetic_variants or any other type of genomic element tracks can also contain values for continuous or categorical_variables and the user can choose among points connected lines colored segments or histo grams for representing data chromplot takes data from tables in data frame in granges formats the information necessary to draw chromosomes for mouse and human is included with the package for other organisms chromplot can read gap and cytobandideo tables from the ucsc_genome we present common use cases here and a full tutorial is included as the pack ages vignette availability_and chromplot is distributed under a glp licence at http www bio conductor org when analyzing large_amounts of genomic_data visualization in chromosomal context can reveal chromosome specific or genomewide patterns suggesting new hypotheses and their appropriate tests in addition it may show errors in data generation or in an analysis step we distinguish between two types of genomic visualization local and global local visualization displays data in a region within one chromosome global visualization displays data in whole chromosomes tools available for local visualization are very flexible allowing highly customized plots with diverse data e g genomegraphs and genoplotr r packages and the integrative_genomics igv global visualization has been incorporated in websites of cross_species repositories e g ucsc ensembl and ncbi and in species specific websites such as or the chromosome visualization_tool and gviewer gmod org wiki flash gviewer standalone tools are task sepecific e g phenogram represents genotype by phenotype associations quantsmooth displays discrete and continuous data in the local view and large segments in the global view the ideoviz r package can plot continuous values as lines or bars for binned data but has no support for categorical_data thus there is a need for a generic tool for global visualization to mach flexibility of local visualizers of genomic_data chromplot creates karyotype like graphs and the data can be plotted on three areas to the left to the right and on the chromosome multiple tracks may be overlaid or shown on different chromosomal sides the user can generate a virtually infinite number of possible graphs this is a list of common uses for the package synteny plots the genomic_regions of homology are represented by colored segments within chromosomes data can be read in axt format or as a table differentially_expressed as histograms in chromosomal context may reveal clusters of differential_expression this may suggest effects from regional context such as chromatin_state epigenetics regulation or cis eqtl as in qtl_mapping qtls can be represented as lod curves or chromosomal segments it is possible to integrate such information with results from omics experiments such as differential_expression gwas genomewide_association in outbred populations can be summarized as for instance average log p values by chromosomal bins similar plots may be created to summarize genomewide genetic_divergence e g fst or measures of positive_selection like ihs genome_sequencing chromplot can be used for quality controlling or summarizing results from whole_genome sequencing_experiments for instance it is possible to plot genome_coverage as connected lines or number of detected variants as histograms local_ancestry chromosomes of admixed individuals can be painted by genetic ancestry on the body bands or on either side segment and segment physical_maps of genes or makers use the stat argument omitting the statcol argument and providing an id column
