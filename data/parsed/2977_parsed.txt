data_and mining and evaluation of molecular relationships in literature motivation specific information on newly_discovered proteins is often difficult to find in literature particularly if only sequences and no common names of proteins or genes are available preceding sequence_similarity can be crucial for the process of information collection in drug research it is important to know whether a small_molecule targets only one specific protein or whether similar or homologous_proteins are also influenced that may account for possible side_effects results prolific protein literature investigation for interacting compounds provides a one step solution to investigate available information on given protein_names sequences similar proteins or sequences on the gene level co occurrences of uniprotkb_swiss proteins and pubchem compounds in all pubmed_abstracts are retrievable concise heat maps and tables display frequencies of co occurrences they provide links to processed literature with highlighted found protein and compound synonyms evaluation with manually_curated drugprotein relationships showed that up to could be discovered by automatic text processing examples are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of prolific availability the web_application is available at http prolific pharmaceutical bioinformatics de and a web_service at http www pharmaceutical bioinformatics de prolific soap collecting information on proteins in the large and fast_growing body of available biomedical information can be an elaborate task particularly if proteins are only rarely_investigated newly predicted or sequenced or if no common names are available for proteins and genes researchers may want to search for potential lead structures for given targets determine the function of the protein or analyse side_effects of drugs with regard to protein similarity to gather needed information for proteins as possible targets for chemical_compounds there are a variety of databases available providing manually_curated information however a need for information beyond the scope of the existing databases often requires researchers to find information in biomedical texts by searching pubmed http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed with mesh_terms although the texts are rather unstructured pubmed is widely_accepted as the most comprehensive and up to date source for biomedical information while subsequent analysis of information found in texts seems inevitable text or datamining tools greatly enhance the process of information collection a variety of tools can be found via the critical assessment of information_extraction systems in biology initiative several tools focus on the recognition of proteins and genes in texts or extraction of information of relationships between biological_entities others focus on a convenient provision of mined data of several types like proteins drugs and diseases via web_service or the co occurrence of biological_entities like excerpt copub and cil finding co occurences of biological_entities is a well accepted method for finding associations of any type that may be hidden in context or implicit and supports on going research in natural_language cil was recently_published enabling users to search for compound structures similar structures and names in all pubmed_abstracts proteins referred to in those texts are related to the compounds the relationships and their frequency are displayed as results prolific protein literature investigation for interacting compounds closes the gap between protein information in literature and sequence_information on proteins with a one step solution thus it complements cil it enables researchers to collect a variety of information on proteins without identifiers or synonyms similar sequences are searched and all compounds mentioned in the same context are identified it provides all information including abstracts with highlighted found entities in a pre_calculated swiftly accessible database visualizing data in a heat map with colours representing displayed values thus prolific has a protein centric point_of in contrast to cil with its compound centric view allowing to obtain new information on proteins compounds and their relationships however this requires specialized data_structures allowing for high_speed data_retrieval for the large amount of data the interconnection of both applications results in an additional benefit enabling users to switch between protein and compound literature research using result compoundspage
