genetics_and assessing single_nucleotide detection and genotype_calling on whole_genome sequenced individuals motivation whole_genome wgs is now routinely used for the detection and identification of genetic_variants particularly single_nucleotide snps in humans and this has provided valuable new insights into human diversity population histories and genetic_association of traits and diseases however this relies on accurate detection and genotyping calling of the polymorph isms present in the samples sequenced to minimize cost the majority of current wgs studies including the genomes_project kgp have adopted low_coverage of large number of samples where such designs have inadvertently influenced the development of variant_calling methods on wgs_data assessment of variant accuracy are usually performed on the same set of low coverage individuals or a smaller number of deeply sequenced individuals it is thus unclear how these variant_calling methods would fare for a data_set of samples from a population not part of the kgp that have been sequenced at various coverage depths results using down sampling of the sequencing_reads obtained from the singapore sequencing malay project ssmp and a set of snp calls from the same individuals genotyped on the illumina omni quad array we assessed the sensitivity of snp_detection accuracy of genotype_calls made and variant accuracy for six commonly used variant_calling methods of gatk samtools consensus assessment of sequence and variation casava varscan glftools and soapsnp the results indicate that at coverage depth the multi sample callers of gatk and samtools yield the best accuracy particularly if the study samples are called together with a large number of individuals such as those from genomes_project if study samples are sequenced at a high coverage depth such as casava has the highest variant accuracy as compared with the other variant callers assessed fueled by rapidly decreasing costs and advancements in highthroughput sequencing_technologies it is now possible to sequence one complete human_genome at a fraction of the time and cost of the initial human_genome these developments have thus transformed the field of human genomics studies and have contributed significantly to our knowledge and understanding of human diversity and population histories as well as aided the identification of causal_variants for human_diseases and traits the successful application of whole_genome wgs in these diverse fields of studies however relies on the accurate detection and genotype_calling of the polymorphisms present in the individuals studied compared with the traditional_sanger technology wgs by next_generation have much shorter reads and higher per base sequencing_error which confounds true polymorphisms from sequencing_errors intuitively having high sequencing_coverage data where each base in the genome is sequenced multiple times will allow the true polymorphisms to be better distinguished from the sequencing_errors as such single sample variant_calling methods will usually perform well with high coverage depth but fare poorly when applied to individuals sequenced at low coverage depths however deep wgs on a large number of individuals is currently not feasible economically based on the results from a simulation_study conducted it was found that for a given fixed amount of sequencing performed sequencing a large number of individuals at low coverage depths of provide higher power in detecting rare single_nucleotide snps than compared with sequencing a smaller number of individuals at high coverage depth the former design is what has been adopted by the kgp this thus resulted in the development of different variant_calling methods that seek to generate accurate genotype_calls at variant sites identified across multiple_individuals that have been sequenced at low coverage depths however the assessment of these variant_calling methods are performed mainly on simulated_data and on a small number of individuals who have been sequenced to high coverage depths of at least to whom correspondence should be addressed in this work we thus seek to investigate the following issues given a population_based sample of individuals such as the southeast_asian malays that are not present in kgp and are deep whole_genome sequenced which of the variant_calling methods i gatk ii samtools iii consensus assessment of sequence and variation casava iv varscan v glftools http www sph umich edu csg abeca sis glftools or vi soapsnp will have the best performance in i variant discovery or detection ii genotype_calling and iii overall variant accuracy defined as a product of the two above metrics across sequencing_coverage depths from to
