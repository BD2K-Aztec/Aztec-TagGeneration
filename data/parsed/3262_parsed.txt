genome_analysis ngsutils a software_suite for analyzing and manipulating next_generation datasets ngsutils is a suite of software_tools for manipulating data common to next_generation experiments such as fastq bed and bam format files these tools provide a stable and modular platform for data management and analysis availability_and ngsutils is available under a bsd_license and works on mac os x and linux systems python and virtualenv are required more information and source_code may be obtained from the website http ngsutils org with the broad implementation of next_generation ngs_technology in biomedical_research genomics sequencing_data are generated at an unprecedented rate such advances bring enormous challenges in data analysis of which efficient standardized and consistent analysis are critical with the deluge of data brought about by these technological_advances the time required to analyze ngs_datasets has become the limiting_factor in high_throughput experiments in most cases ngs data_processing involves manipulating converting and processing large standardized files such as fastq bed and bam_files frequently initial pre_processing is required before using these files as input to mapping for assembly purposes once reads have been mapped post_processing of these files is typically applied to filter out noisy mappings or calculate summary information the analysis of ngs experiments frequently consists of writing custom one off scripts to manipulate data or calculate final results this approach is inefficient and can lead to reproducibility errors there are some existing_tools that aid in the analysis of ngs_data such as bedtools vcftools samtools and the fastx toolkit http hannonlab cshl edu fastx toolkit to help augment the functionality of exiting tools and allow for pipeline assembly the ngsutils suite was developed covering different aspects of ngs_data analysis including preprocessing post_processing filtering format conversion and final_result calculations
