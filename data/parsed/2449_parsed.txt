data_and inferring disease association using clinical factors in a combinatorial manner and their use in drug_repositioning motivation complex physiological relationships exist among human_diseases thus the identification of disease associations could provide new methods of disease care and diagnosis to this end numerous studies have investigated disease associations however combinatorial effect of physiological_factors which is the main_characteristic of biological_systems has not been considered in most previous_studies results in this study we inferred disease associations with a novel approach that considered disease related clinical factors in combina torial ways by using the national_health data and the results have been shown as disease networks here the fp growth algorithm an association_rule algorithm was used to generate a clinical attribute combination profile of each disease in addition we characterized the clinical risk attribute combinations frequently discovered from the diseases in this study furthermore we validated that the results of this study have great_potential for drug_repositioning and outperform other existing disease networks in this regard finally we suggest a few disease pairs as new candidates for drug_repositioning and provide the evidence of their associations from the literature complex physiological relationships exist among human_diseases thus the identification of disease similarity has been used to study etiology and pathogenesis of similar diseases as well as have provided novel ways for disease diagnosis drug_repositioning therefore many studies to elucidate disease associations have emerged and the results of which have been presented as disease networks dns previous_studies of dns can be classified into two categories based on the used data molecular data and electronic_health ehr data from a molecular perspective goh et_al constructed dns that were linked if they shared one or more disease genes following gohs study functional modulebased studies by using molecular data have also appeared to clarify disease associations lee et_al created dns that were linked if the enzymes related to diseases shared metabolic_reactions in addition also built dns by an integrated analysis of disease related mrna_expression data and the human protein_interaction here two diseases were linked if they had similar profiles of functional_modules that were described by differently expressed genes of the disease more recently published the article of disease associations by considering both disease_related and their localization in a cell the other approach for constructing dns based on ehr data have also emerged ehr data have usually been used for obtaining comorbidity which implies the presence of one or more diseases in addition to a primary disease that the patient has for example introduced dns obtained from the disease history of more than million patients also presented networks from phenotype information including both structured and unstructured electronic_patient such as free_text diagnosis reports furthermore introduced adams for discovering disease associations using multiple sources such as pubmed articles discharge_summaries and so on however previous_studies overlooked the combinatorial effect which is one of main biological_characteristics combinatorial_effects exist in biological system and biological_factors influence a disease in combinatorial rather than individual ways as evidence studies for combinatorial_effects in biology and physiology have recently appeared in molecular_biology field presented that most saccharomyces_cerevisiae genes were shown to be influenced by combinatorial_effects of cultivation parameters these combinatorial_effects led to higher explained_variance of the gene_expression showed that the combination of rapamycin and lapatinib significantly_decreased growth of triple_negative we also explored some clinical studies devoted to identifying the combinatorial_effects of diseases furthermore the combinatorial_approach has been applied in adverse_drug field extracted multi item adverse_drug from the food and drug administrations adverse_effect reporting system by using association_rule all of these studies have shown that combinatorial_effects exist in physiological system and are worthy to be regarded to elucidate diseases and disease associations to whom correspondence should be addressed the fundamental assumption of previous_studies on the other hand is that higher association exists between diseases as more disease_related are shared individually not combinatorially especially in gohs study individual sharing genes is a measure of similarity however even though two diseases share disease genes the etiological_factors of each disease could be totally different due to the combinatorial_effects on biological_factors for example there are two diseases sharing disease genes gene a and b one disease occurs when both gene a and gene b are not working properly however the other disease presents when gene a or gene b is not functioning then it is hard to conclude that these two diseases have a perfect association more explanation in thus when we try to get more precise and accurate association between diseases from a biology perspective combinatorial effect profiles of them should be analyzed this explanation can be applied to other molecule based studies and ehr based studies in the same manner from this background we present a novel approach that considers disease related physiological_factors in combinatorial ways for inferring disease associations here we decided to use clinical data rather than molecular data or comorbidity data molecular information is incomplete and should be further explored even though much knowledge has been discovered by development of recent technology and analysis on the other hand clinical data provide_practical explanations of disease associations and is becoming available to researchers in massive_amounts the national_health nhanes http www cdc gov nchs nhanes htm a major clinical survey of the national_center was used as primary data for this study molecule and comorbidity data were incorporated to evaluate the results of this study in evaluation part as well in this article we constructed the dns from the information of disease related clinical attribute combinations in addition we generated the clinical attribute combinations frequently discovered from the diseases concerned in this study named as clinical risk attribute combinations cracoms in the evaluation section we showed that the results of this study have great_potential to be used for drug_repositioning and outperform other existing dns in this regard furthermore we investigated a few disease pairs as candidate disease for drug_repositioning and present some valuable evidence of the associations we further explored disease pairs that are able to be new candidates for drug_repositioning as a result we found that the gout and heart_diseases pairs were positioned at high ranks in this study but drugs hardly shared for the disease pairs yet to verify the potential for new candidates of drug_repositioning we investigated relationships between gout and heart_diseases from literature and we could obtain some evidence that they are closely associated choi and curhan and declaimed that men_and with gout have an increased risk for heart_diseases such as myocardial_infarction and coronary_heart moreover also revealed that gout is a risk_factor of myocardial_infarction using multivariable_regression in krishnans article they referred that further research will be needed for the exact links between two diseases and the combinatorial_approach of this study could give some clues for it we also disclosed disease pairs of cataract and heart_diseases that has great_potential for new drug_repositioning candidates to understand the results further we surveyed articles that support the observed disease association reported that coronary_heart is one of the statistically_significant risk_factor of cataract in addition provided some evidence_supporting a relationship between cardiovascular_diseases and incident cataract the combinatorial_approach is highly necessary to explain disease associations because the real diseases occur in combinatorial ways in this study we inferred disease associations with a novel approach that considered disease related physiological_factors in combinatorial ways by using nhanes data this study will give good explanations for understanding disease associations and it will also provide inspiration to combinatorial_approach studies not only in the disease related field but also in other fields having combinatorial characteristic furthermore we generated disease specific clacops as well as cracoms which will give a few clues for disease prevention and etiology those profiles will be investigated in the future this results show that the networks of this study clacop sharing dn performed better than other networks at almost every top k when compared with both reference networks approved drug sharing dn and reference networks trial drug sharing dn we also validated the potential of this study to be used in the drug_repositioning field and showed that this study outperformed other approaches in this regard as a result a few disease pairs such as the gout and congestive_heart and the cataract and coronary_heart were suggested as the candidate diseases for drug_repositioning we will investigate these drug_repositioning candidate diseases on hereafter studies in addition when molecular data and their combinatorial analysis are incorporated further improvements could be achieved in elucidating disease associations because molecular data provide the information that physiological data cannot cover this further work also will be investigated in the future note four disease pairs in this table have been revealed as candidates for drug_repositioning those pairs had relatively high similarities in this study but relatively low similarities in the reference dn indicating that they have not been used for drug_repositioning yet in spite of the potential chf congestive_heart chd coronary_heart
