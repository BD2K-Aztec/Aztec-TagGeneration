varid a variation detection framework for color_space and letter space platforms motivation high_throughput hts technologies are transforming the study of genomic_variation the various hts technologies have different sequencing biases and error_rates and while most hts technologies sequence the residues of the genome directly generating base calls for each position the applied_biosystems solid platform generates dibase coded color_space sequences while combining data from the various platforms should increase the accuracy of variation detection to date there are only a few tools that can identify variants from color_space data and none that can analyze color_space and regular letter space data together results we present varida probabilistic_method for variation detection from both letter and color_space reads simultaneously varid is based on a hidden_markov and uses the forward_backward algorithm to accurately identify heterozygous homozygous and tri allelic snps as well as micro indels our analysis shows that varid performs better than the ab solid toolset at detecting variants from color_space data alone and improves the calls dramatically when letter and color_space reads are combined availability the toolset is freely_available athigh throughput sequencing hts technologies are revolutionizing the way biologists acquire and analyze genomic_data hts machines such as roche illumina solexa and ab solid are able to sequence up to a full human_genome per week at a cost hundreds fold less than previous methods the resulting data consists of reads ranging in length between and nt from unknown locations in the genome analysis of these datasets poses an unprecedented informatics challenge due to the sheer number of reads that a single run of an hts machine can produce the shortness of the reads and the various technologies different sequencing biases and error_rates the two basic steps in the discovery of variants in the human population from reads coming from any of these technologies are first the mapping of reads to a finished reference_genome and second the identification of variation by analysis of these mappings in the last few years there have been many approaches proposed for mapping reads from hts technologies among many others see to whom correspondence should be addressed b show the correspondence between di nucleotides and their color_space representation with a translation matrix and the corresponding finite_state automaton in part c we show the effect of snps on the color_space representation of the read as well as effect of sequencing_errors on the trivial translation of the read from color to letter space the first letter shown in the reads is actually the last letter of the linker which helps us lock in on one of the four possible translations of a color_space read for reviews that utilize a wide_variety of approaches compared to this multitude of mapping tools there have only been a handful of toolsets for single_nucleotide snp and small bp indel discovery the main_challenge in detecting these variants is using the error_rates of the sequencing_platform the potentially incorrect mappings and the varying coverage to determine the likelihood that a position represents a heterozygous or homozygous variant with respect to some reference_genome we use the term heterozygous to refer to the case when a single donor allele differs from the reference and homozygous to refer to the case when both donor alleles differ from the reference and are the same as each other tri allelic snps when the two donor alleles differ from each other and from the reference page i i i to test varid we utilized the dataset of who sequenced several regions of the human_genome spanning a total of kb from four individuals na na na and na both with the ab solid platform and the roche pyrosequencer to validate the snp calls the authors also resequenced kb from the same regions with sanger_sequencing from the original high coverage datasets we generated reduced coverage randomly_selected subsets from the individuals with different degrees of coverage to analyze the ab solid data we ran the solid system analysis_pipeline tool corona lite with the schema on the color_space data as well as varid with both the ab pipeline mappings as well as shrimp mappings for all of the read subsets for the data we ran varid and gigabayes on the letterspace reads using mosaik and shrimp as the mapping tools finally we tested our prediction pipeline on various color and letterspace subsets combined we compared the variants called by each method with the sanger validation_set to compute the following statistics bullet number of true_positive tp snps that the predictor detects that are also in the validation_set bullet number of false_positive fp snps the predictor calls variant that are not in the validation_set bullet precision the number of true_positives as a fraction of all predictions tp tp fp bullet recall the fraction of true_positives as a fraction of the validated snps tp tp fn bullet f measure the harmonic mean of precision p and recall r the results of our analysis are illustrated in where we present results of color_space only results of letter space only and results for combinations of the two sequence_types respectively in we present results from variation identification with varid and the corona lite snp caller http www solidsoftwaretools com gf project mapreads using the color_space data we ran varid both with the alignments produced i sections we ran varid on various datasets aligned with the shrimp tool in the second we ran it with ab mapper output and finally in the third we ran the corona lite pipeline on the ab mappings in general the results show that variation detection is difficult even with high coverage of color_space and the results are dependent on the coverage and the mapping package usedfor example varid with shrimp mappings tends to have slightly_lower precision but higher recall leading to higher f measure scores especially at lower coverages while varid with ab mappings has higher_precision but also lower recall for example we can look at combining of ab solid color_space data with of roche data comparing to the equivalent cost of roche we achieve more precision and higher recall in the combined run similarly comparing to the equivalent cost of ab solid color_space data we obtain better precision and better recall another example can be found by looking at the cs and ls combination and comparing with of cs or of ls in figures and the various hts technologies that have emerged in the past_few have different data representations advantages biases and features in this work we introduced a novel probabilistic_framework for variation identification which can use both letter and colorspace data simultaneously we have shown in our results that when using only color_space dataa data type for which very few genomic analysis tools existthe model outperforms the ab solid toolkit corona lite and performs on par with gigabayes predictions for letter space data alone more importantly when the color and letter space data are combined the varid framework allows for a significant performance increase demonstrating that a method that can take into consideration multiple technologies combining their different advantages and compensating for their different weaknesses can achieve_higher variant predictions than are possible from any single data type
