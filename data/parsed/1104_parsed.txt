computational discovery of specificity conferring sites in non_ribosomal motivation by using a class of large modular enzymes known as non_ribosomal nrps bacteria and fungi are capable of synthesizing a large variety of secondary_metabolites many of which are bioactive and have potential pharmaceutical applications as e g antibiotics there is thus an interest in predicting the compound synthesized by an nrps from its primary structure amino_acid alone as this would enable an in silico search of whole genomes for nrps enzymes capable of synthesizing potentially useful compounds results nrps synthesis happens in a conveyor belt like fashion where each individual nrps module is responsible for incorporating a specific substrate typically an amino_acid into the final_product here we present a new method for predicting substrate_specificities of individual nrps modules based on occurrences of motifs in their primary structures we compare our classifier with existing_methods and discuss possible biological explanations of how the motifs might relate to substrate_specificity availability_and seql nrps is available as a web_service implemented in python with flask at http services birc au dk seql nrps and source_code available at https bitbucket org dansondergaard seql nrps non_ribosomal nrps are large proteins found mainly in bacteria and fungi where they are responsible for synthesis of a variety of peptides many of which are bioactive and have significant pharmaceutical value while the most famous example is the penicillin precursor tripeptide synthesized by fungi in the penicillium genus many other compounds that are active as antibiotics or e g immunosuppressants are known in a time where antibiotic_resistance is becoming increasingly problematic investigating the possibilities for synthesis of novel therapeutical compounds from nrpss is therefore of great interest nrpss are modular enzymes with each module comprising at least three domains an adenylation a domain a thiolation t domain and a condensation c domain of these the a domain recruits a specific substrate and activates it by transfer of an adenylate moiety the activated substrate is then picked up by a prosthetic phosphopantetheine arm coupled to thet domain and physically moved to the c domain where the peptide_bond is formed to an activated substrate from the next module in line this process continues up until the last c domain which in bacteria this usually is a thioesterase domain where a hydrolysis reaction causes the chain of substrates to detach from the nrps often by circularization of the final_product one module is thus responsible for incorporating one substrate into the final peptide product more than individual substrates have been observed in peptides synthesized by nrpss including both the proteinogenic lamino acids as well as their d isomers non proteinogenic amino_acids such as ornithine and fatty_acids determining the substrate_specificity of a given a domain biochemically by isolating it and trying all possible candidates is a cumbersome process and often fruitless effort hence there is a desire to predict the specificity from the amino_acid of a domains alone and state of the art prediction_methods such as nrpssp and nrpspredictor r ttig et_al are able to achieve that with relatively high_accuracy using profile_hidden phmm and support_vector respectively the first successful attempt to predict a domain substrate_specificity was devised by examining the crystal_structure of the a domain phea from grsa in bacillus brevis in complex with its cognate substrate phenylalanine phe the analysis revealed residues critically involved in substrate_binding and recognition due to high_sequence between a domains in general it was speculated that sequence_alignment of phea with other a domains would reveal the residues important for substrate recognition using this approach the authors successfully predicted the specificity of most a domains in their dataset using only these residues which were then aptly named the specificity conferring code here we present a new approach for predicting the specificity of nrps a domains using automatic identification of sequence_motifs discriminating sequences of a domains with different specificities evaluated on a manually_curated non redundant dataset our method achieves an overall prediction_accuracy of higher than the obtained by the current state of the art method the motifs discovered include the well known specificity conferring code but also other sites not previously associated with substrate_specificity we then discuss the significance of these sites from a biological and structural perspective
