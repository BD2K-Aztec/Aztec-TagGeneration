sequence_analysis a cautionary note on using binary calls for analysis of dna_methylation downloaded from contact a prochenka phd ipipan waw pl or rploski wp pl in this article a classification approach for dna_methylation with bisulfite next_generation data cheng and zhu proposed a classification procedure based on a mixture of bino mial model to make binary calls for methylation status whereas we find this approach interesting and competitive to method described in lister et_al under the used assumptions we advise to use the proposed methodology with caution because we disagree with some of the generalization made namely the authors state that cytosine c positions can be either methylated or not and that ideally after polymerase_chain there are only c or t reads for each covered c position of interest depending on the methylation status in particular it is stated that obtaining c reads at unmethylated sites can be observed only due to incomplete conversion sequencing or other systematic errors whereas true in many situations these assumptions have important exceptions methylation can indeed be described by a binary variable when a single c in one dna_molecule is considered however even in a single diploid cell all the autosomal chromosomes exist in two copies and at some loci methylation may occur at one but not the other chromosome with imprinted loci being a well recognized example adalsteinsson and ferguson smith the heterogeneity of methylation at a given c can be even more prominent when mixture of dna_molecules extracted from a population of cells is studied the most popular experimental_design in such setting when many reads are obtained at a site sequencing_depth higher than one cs in some dna_molecules can be methylated and in some not generating a proportion which reflects a true biological_phenomenon rather than technical_artifacts using such proportions for prediction of phenotypic_features for example age has been widely described in the literature in hannum et_al and garagnani et_al a microarray_based meth ylation analysis shows that treating methylation as a continuous variable is effective for identifying the correlation between subject age and methylation in garagnani et_al proportions of methy lated cs were used to predict age of subjects and the elovl gene showed a progressive increase in methylation with age with the spearmans correlation_coefficient equal to the dependence between age and methylation proportions for the purpose of the age prediction is also the subject of our own studies using yet another technology pyromark platform to analyse full blood we recently confirmed usefulness of elovl methyla tion as an age markerthe final linear_regression included two cs in elovl and enabled prediction with r zbiec zbiec piekarska et_al finally we observed similar dependences using reduced_representation rrbs a method directly discussed by cheng and zhu a plot of methylation frequency against age for the elovl gene as obtained from rrbs versus the methylation status calling msc procedure described in cheng and zhu is presented in figure observe that in our data according to the msc procedure the position is methylated if and only if the methylation frequency directly counted from rrbs is greater than incomplete conversion for our data estimated as sequencing and systematic errors cannot be responsible for these findings reported in several studies using different methods thus we would like to argue that making binary calls as proposed in
