genetics_and omegaplus a scalable tool for rapid detection of selective_sweeps in whole_genome datasets recent_advances have led to the rapid accumulation of molecular sequence_data analyzing whole_genome data as obtained from next generation sequencers from intra species samples allows to detect signatures of positive_selection along the genome and therefore identify potentially advantageous genes in the course of the evolution of a population we introduce omegaplus an open_source tool for rapid detection of selective_sweeps in whole_genome data based on linkage_disequilibrium the tool is up to two orders_of than existing programs for this purpose and also exhibits up to two orders_of smaller memory_requirements availability omegaplus is available under gnu gpl at http www exelixis lab org software html statistical_tests that rely on selective_sweep theory maynard can localize targets of recent and strong positive_selection by analyzing single_nucleotide snp patterns in intra species multiple_sequence nextgeneration_sequencing allow for the rapid and cheap extraction of data to assess whole genome_variation in single species populations however applying such statistical_tests to wholegenome data is challenging because of increased execution times and memory_requirements several studies in the last decade have focused on detecting positive_selection in genomes from natural_populations of individuals kim anddeveloped a composite maximum_likelihood ml framework to detect selective_sweeps using the empirical mutation frequencies of polymorphic_sites site_frequency this approach was later adapted byfor populations that have experienced past demographic changes kim andproposed the statistic to accurately localize selective_sweeps and developed a ml framework that uses linkage_disequilibrium ld_information in this work we introduce omegaplus a high performance implementation of the statistic to the best of our knowledge to whom correspondence should be addressed omegaplus represents the first scalable statistic implementation that can be applied to whole_genome data previous implementations were not suitable for whole_genome analyses the implementation byis only suitable for analyses of sub genomic_regions whereas the implementation byhas excessive memory_requirements even for moderate datasets we presented omegaplus to accurately identify selective_sweeps in whole_genome data using the statistic we intend to further improve the memory_requirements as well as to support additional file_formats and methods to calculate ld we also plan to set up a web_server user support is provided via the omegaplus google group http groups google com group omegaplus
