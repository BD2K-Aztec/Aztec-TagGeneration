structural_bioinformatics computational reconstruction of primordial prototypes of elementary functional loops in modern proteins motivation enzymes are complex catalytic machines which perform sequences of elementary chemical_transformations resulting in biochemical function the building_blocks of enzymes elementary functional loops efls possess distinct_functional signatures and provide catalytic and binding amino_acids to the enzymes active_sites the goal of this work is to obtain primordial prototypes of efls that existed before the formation of enzymatic domains and served as their building_blocks results we developed a computational strategy for reconstructing ancient prototypes of efls based on the comparison of sequence_segments on the proteomic scale which goes beyond detection of conserved functional_motifs in homologous_proteins we illustrate the procedure by a cxxc containing prototype with a very basic and ancient elementary function of metal metal containing cofactor binding and redox_activity acquiring the prototypes of efls is necessary for revealing how the original set of protein_folds with enzymatic functions emerged in predomain evolution current evolution of proteins takes_place via mutation and recombination of protein_domains leading to both divergence and convergence it is rather obvious however that evolution of protein_structure and function did not start from full protein_folds and the latter has to have been formed in a predomain stage of evolution therefore one of the most important tasks in studies of the evolution of protein_function is to find how the first set of folds with the most basic biochemical_functions was formed and to determine the set of ancient functional peptides that gave rise to the above repertoire of folds previous_studies that closed loops of amino_acid are universal building_blocks of protein_folds according to the same studies the closed loops to whom correspondence should be addressed emerged from ring like peptides primitive proteins or proteinlike molecules in prebiotic evolution and served as building_blocks of the first protein_folds similarly to folds that are built from closed loops as structural_units the enzymatic functions can also be decomposed into combinations of elementary units of protein_function the latter are closed loops that possess one or a few functional_residues and bring them to the active_site which we call elementary functional loops efls the functional signatures of some efls are shared between super families of proteins with different biochemical_functions and even between different folds their prototypes presumably underwent recombination at the predomain stage of protein evolution recently we have developed a computational procedure for finding sequence_profiles of widely spread efls with characteristic functional signatures in this procedure we obtained sequence_profiles from complete proteomes many of the profiles correspond to their originating protein_families such as those described in pfam or cdd and represent family specific functional signatures as in prosite while others reveal connections between different folds and functions here we would like to proceed further and find a way to obtain ancient prototypes of efls therefore we developed a procedure for reconstructing prototypes which served as basic units of the first folds domains with enzymatic functions the procedure for obtaining prototypes is very different to that of ancestor reconstruction the latter typically requires a phylogenetic_tree built from the alignment of related super family_members and an evolutionary model with particular mutation and amino_acid substitution_rates here on the contrary we work with short sequence_fragments belonging to phylogenetically unrelated proteins from remote super families which presumably were involved in the design of the first enzymes in predomain evolution we illustrate the computational strategy that we have developed by reconstructing an ancient prototype with redox_active metalbinding elementary function the most generic signature of this prototype reads cys xaa xaa cys cxxc for brevity we start with a minimal set of non redundant profiles from which we reconstruct the prototype and its derivatives using these profiles in a profile sequence_search over complete proteomes and the protein databank we detect a diversity of efls with metal metal containing cofactor binding and redox_activity in different folds and show that they take part in different biochemical_functions page the goal of this work is to obtain prototypes of elementary functions and their derivatives we define a prototype as the most generic and ancient functional signature and its derivatives as descendants efls with a diversity of contemporary functions we develop a special benchmark for sequence_search with profiles of efls introduce and evaluate a new pssm based measure for profileprofile comparison and reconstruct prototypes by clustering the profiles as a case study we explore a prototype with cxxccontaining signature and its derivatives
