genome_analysis tip a probabilistic_method for identifying transcription_factor target_genes from chip_seq binding_profiles motivation chip_seq and chip_chip experiments have been widely used to identify transcription_factor tf_binding and target_genes conventionally a fairly simple approach is employed for target_gene identification e g finding genes with binding_sites within kb of a transcription_start tss however this does not take into account the number of sites upstream of the tss their exact positioning or the fact that different tfs appear to act at different characteristic distances from the tss results here we propose a probabilistic_model called target_identification from profiles tip that quantitatively measures the regulatory_relationships between tfs and target_genes for each tf our model builds a characteristic averaged profile of binding around the tss and then uses this to weight the sites associated with a given gene providing a continuous valued regulatory score relating each tf and potential target moreover the score can readily be turned into a ranked_list of target_genes and an estimate of significance which is useful for case dependent downstream_analysis conclusion we show the advantages of tip by comparing it to the simple approach on several representative datasets using motif occurrence and relationship to knockout experiments as metrics of validation moreover we show that the probabilistic_model is not as sensitive to various experimental parameters including sequencing_depth and peak_calling method as the simple approach in fact the lesser dependence on sequencing_depth potentially utilizes the result of a chip_seq experiment in a more cost effective_manner chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by microarray_hybridization chip_chip and more recently by sequencing chip_seq have been widely used for genome_wide identification of transcription_factor tf binding_events to facilitate the processing and analysis of the resulting datasets many methods and software_packages have been developed most efforts have focused on to whom correspondence should be addressed identifying tf_binding peaks that are regions of increased sequence_read density or hybridization intensity relative to the background in addition methods have been proposed to combine genomic binding data with other biological_information e g histone_modification conservation etc for predicting functional_binding of tfs the genome_wide tf_binding data provide useful biological_insights for understanding transcriptional_regulation one of the important_applications is to identify the target_genes controlled by tfs and dissect the transcriptional_regulatory underlying the relevant biological_process as demonstrated in many studies in these studies a simple peak based method has been used to associate tf_binding peaks with genes for determining the tftarget regulatory_relationships specifically the genes with promoters overlapping with one or more peaks were identified as the targets this simple peak based method is easy to implement but it has several limitations first it treats all binding peaks equally without taking_into their relative positions to genes second it does not provide confidence_scores of the identified target_genes even though the significance of binding peaks is available third the number of target_genes identified is very sensitive to the number of binding peaks and the parameter setting such as the size of the dna regions considered as promoters therefore a more sophisticated method would be helpful for the utilization of genomic occupation data being produced increasingly in this work we propose a probabilistic_model tip for identifying tf target_genes based on chip_seq or chip_chip data the model calculates the regulatory potential of a tf to genes based on the tfs binding profile i e its binding signals across the genome the binding_profiles for different tfs can be quite differentmost are promoter associated whereas a few are more distantly enhancer associated even for the promoterassociated tfs their binding peaks can often be differentially distributed in the promoter_regions the probabilistic_model we propose here integrates the binding signals within a broad dna region_surrounding a genes transcription_start tss and takes_into the binding characteristic profile of the tf we apply the model to several datasets to demonstrate its efficiency and benchmark it against the simple peak based method in particular we show that it gives rise to a more biologically_meaningful target gene_set than the peak based method the model provides us with ain this article we propose a probabilistic_model to identify tf target_genes based on chip_seq or chip_chip data we have shown that target_genes identified by this model are more responsive to the stimulation or perturbation of the regulatory tf and are more likely to contain its binding_motif in their promoters when compared with those identified by the simple method our model provides a gene_list ranked by the regulatory potential by the tf and gives a confidence_score which allows the user to select a subset of genes for creation of testable hypothesis and further experimental_investigation with ever increasing genomic occupation data the model provides a powerful_tool for understanding gene_regulation as shown in the genes identified by the model represent a very conservative set of regulatory_targets by a tf due to the following reason our normalization of the regulatory scores is based on the mean of regulatory scores for all genes including both targets and non targets section in the real_data the distribution of regulatory scores for all genes shows a normal like distribution from non target_genes on the left side and a very thick tail on the right side from target_genes supplementary we would expect to obtain more significant target_genes if only the regulatory scores for non targets which can be regarded as the background binding are used for normalization obviously the non target_genes are unknown in advance but this issue can be circumvented by iteratively estimating significance and selecting non targets for normalization alternatively one can also normalize the regulatory scores based on the background binding estimated from a number of randomly_selected dna regions it is also possible to further improve the method by taking_into the existence of tf binding_motif namely assign higher weight to genes with motifs in dna regions around their tss by combining with additional data such as expression data from tf perturbation experiments the framework might also be adapted to predict functional_binding although the chip_seq and chip_chip experiments have detected a large number of binding_sites many of them cannot be clearly connected with target gene_regulation as such a quantitative method introduced here or previously would be useful for understanding functional binding it is interesting to see that the target_genes identified by the probabilistic_model are not sensitive to the sequencing_depth as we have shown using the tcf data when more reads are sequenced in a chip_seq experiment more binding peaks mostly weak ones would be identified these weak peaks are not quite discriminative from the background_noise and their contribution to gene_regulation might be limited in this sense the target_genes identified by the
