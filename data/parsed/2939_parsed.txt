systems_biology metingear a development environment for annotating genome_scale genome_scale often lack annotations that would allow them to be used for further analysis previous_efforts have focused on associating metabolites in the model with a cross reference but this can be problematic if the reference is not freely_available multiple resources are used or the metabolite is added from a literature_review associating each metabolite with chemical_structure provides unambiguous_identification of the components and a more detailed view of the metabolism we have developed an open_source desktop_application that simplifies the process of adding database cross_references and chemical_structures to genome_scale annotated models can be exported to the systems_biology open interchange format availability source_code binaries documentation and tutorials are freely_available johnmay github com metingear the application is implemented_in with bundles available for ms windows and macintosh os x genome_scale have proved useful in areas such as growth optimization and metabolic_engineering the time required to generate a reconstruction has decreased with improvements in automatic pipelines such as the popular model seed despite rapid improvements in automation extensive manual_curation is still required for an accurate model common practice is to download the draft reconstruction and curate the model in a textbased spreadsheet adding missing reactions from multiple_databases and literature_reviews although recent models are also published in systems_biology sbml the spreadsheets contain additional annotations that are not transferred to the sbml annotation model the main advantage of the annotations is that they allow identification of the components in a model identifying which components are present allows it to be integrated and analyzed with other resources such as metabolomics experiments without additional effort to map the components between datasets the large number of components in genome_scale models means comprehensive annotation is time consuming for metabolites these annotations constitute a cross reference to a chemical or a metabolic_pathway database although this can help to identify what the metabolite is there are limitations i if the metabolite was added from a literature_review the reference dataset may not contain that entity ii the reference dataset contains the entity but at a different protonation_state the protonation_state of the entry is important as conservation of mass and charge is a requirement for constraint based analysis and iii the reference_databases are closed access or no longer fully accessible the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg is frequently used as a starting_point for models but a paid subscription is now required for bulk access chemical_structure is already used in smaller models of metabolic_pathways where atomatom mappings between reactions are required for metabolic_flux the inclusion of full chemical_structure in a genome_scale model is advantageous over only including a cross reference the structure is database independent and allows direct metabolite_identification a reference to any database can be inferred by searching for an isomorphic structure identification is required when incorporating several reference datasets if no mapping exists then additional processing is required to identify similarities and overlap integrating the chemical_structure directly into the model facilitates this integration on demand reconciled databases see reconciled databases supplementary_material primarily use a structure representation to merge entities between datasets these requirements are most beneficial as models grow larger the recent human reconstruction includes iupac international chemical identifier inchi structure representations the structure also allows identification of metabolites that cannot be referenced to an existing database a metabolite may be added from a literature_review or identified experimentally from a mass_spectrum models may include small peptide chains or fatty_acids associated with the acyl_carrier these metabolites are not normally found in chemical databases but can still be assigned a chemical_structure subtleties of metabolites and reactions can be expressed and interpreted from the structure metabolites are often referred by their trivial name from which it is difficult to determine such subtleties in to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work particular the full structure can unambiguously describe the protonation_state and the stereochemistry thermodynamic_constraints and gibbs_free of formation can be estimated and used to constrain a model to estimate these constraints the chemical_structure is required we have created metingear a desktop_application to assist in the annotation of metabolic_models using both manual and automated techniques the main goal is to facilitate the integration of chemical_structure into genome_scale models
