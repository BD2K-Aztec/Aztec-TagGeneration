structural_bioinformatics pseudoknots in rna_folding landscapes motivation the function of an rna_molecule is not only linked to its native_structure which is usually taken to be the ground_state of its folding landscape but also in many cases crucially depends on the details of the folding pathways such as stable folding_intermediates or the timing of the folding_process itself to model and understand these processes it is necessary to go beyond ground_state structures the study of rugged rna_folding landscapes holds the key to answer_these efficient coarse_graining methods are required to reduce the intractably vast energy_landscapes into condensed representations such as barrier trees or basin hopping graphs bhg that convey an approximate but comprehensive picture of the folding kinetics so_far exact and heuris tic coarse_graining methods have been mostly restricted to the pseudoknot free secondary_structures pseudoknots which are common motifs and have been repeatedly hypothesized to play_an in guiding folding trajectories were usually excluded results we generalize the bhg framework to include pseudoknotted rna_structures and systematically study the differences in predicted folding behavior depending on whether pseudoknotted structures are allowed to occur as folding_intermediates or not we observe that rnas with pseu doknotted ground_state structures tend to have more pseudoknotted folding_intermediates than rnas with pseudoknot free ground_state structures the occurrence and influence of pseudoknot ted intermediates on the folding_pathway however appear to depend very strongly on the individual rnas so that no general rule can be inferred availability_and the algorithms described here are implemented in c as standalone programs its source_code and supplemental material can be freely downloaded frombeyond the role as carriers of genetic_information rna_molecules often play much more active roles in regulating gene_expression intracellular transport and even as catalysts more often than not these functions are associated with the rnas ability to undergo specific conformational changes as is the case for riboswitches the function of an rna_molecule thus is often poorly described by its ground_state structure and instead has to be studied as a dynamic ensemble of structures quantities of biological interest include folding v c the author published_by
