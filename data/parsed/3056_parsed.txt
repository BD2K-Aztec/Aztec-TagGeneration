model_selection in bayesian segmentation of multiple dna alignments motivation the analysis of multiple_sequence is allowing researchers to glean valuable insights into evolution as well as identify genomic_regions that may be functional or discover novel classes of functional_elements understanding the distribution of conservation levels that constitutes the evolutionary landscape is crucial to distinguishing functional_regions from non functional recent_evidence a binary_classification of evolutionary_rates is inappropriate for this purpose and finds only highly_conserved functional_elements given that the distribution of evolutionary_rates is multi_modal determining the number of modes is of paramount concern through simulation we evaluate the performance of a number of information criterion approaches derived from mcmc simulations in determining the dimension of a model results we utilize a deviance information criterion dic approximation that is more robust than the approximations from other information criteria and show our information criteria approximations do not produce superfluous modes when estimating conservation distributions under a variety of circumstances we analyse the distribution of conservation for a multiple_alignment comprising four primate_species and mouse and repeat this on two additional multiple_alignments of similar species we find evidence of six distinct classes of evolutionary_rates that appear to be robust to the species used availability source_code and data are available atmuch attention has been given to delineating protein_coding believed to account for of the human_genome however it is the extensive non protein_coding that remain a largely untapped resource for the identification of novel classes of functional_elements recent_studies have indicated that there exists a vast amount of functionality in the non coding_regions pheasant and to whom correspondence should be addressed the task of delineating and identifying the functional_elements is hindered by the lack of understanding of the constraints shaping such elements studying rates of evolution in genomes is also key to understanding genomic function humanmouse and humandog sequence_comparisons suggest that of the mammalian_genome is subject to purifying evolutionary selection this figure is supported by the recent_finding that of bases are confidently predicted as being under evolutionary constraint in mammals by two out of three algorithms employed in the encode_project analysis and in analyses of large_alignments of mammals what remains_unclear is the relationship between the rate at which a functional element evolves and its functional type it is understood that conserved_sequences are likely to harbour functional_elements the length of evolutionary time the segments have remained_unchanged is evidence of biological or functional significance it should be stressed however that the amount of conserved_sequence is a lower_bound on the amount of functional sequence since lack of evolutionary constraint on a sequence does not imply lack of function indeed the encode pilot_study found many functional_elements that are seemingly unconstrained across mammalian evolution there is a strong demand for the development of more sophisticated bioinformatic approaches to studying distributions of evolutionary_rates current approaches such as the simple per_cent identity within a sliding_window and the two state phylo hidden_markov hide a multitude of sins most importantly the implicit assumption of a dichotomy of evolutionary_rates conserved and non conserved conservation estimates are based on a continuous model of a known distribution of evolutionary_rates for ancient repeat ar sequences assumed to be neutrally evolving and an unknown distribution for functional sequences this unknown distribution is estimated through the computationally_efficient sliding_window technique however results are affected by window_size it is assumed that the conserved fraction is the difference estimated by mixture decomposition between the level of similarity across all windows in the alignable fraction of the genome versus that in ar sequences or other supposedly neutrally evolving sequences this fundamental assumption of a dichotomy of conservation levels does not adequately capture the complexity of the evolutionary_rate distribution and may lead to invalid estimates ofwe have presented an overview of information criterion approaches to model_selection in genomic segmentation and presented three methods of approximating information criterion using posterior samples we conclude that the approximate information criteria are reasonable for model_selection in the simulation_study we successfully chose the true number of components for all three scenarios differing in number of components and also the underlying dirichlet parameters although these criteria are very blunt instruments used on their own they may result in incorrect model choice however a better choice can be made when these criteria are used in conjunction with an examination of the other model_parameters such as the mixture proportions model deviance and number of changepoints hence it is advised that they be used with care and intelligence another important result is that the information criterion approach to model_selection does not inflate the number of modes if anything it is a conservative estimate of the number of modes we applied the information criterion to determine the number of classes for an alignment of four primates and mouse and found six wellresolved classes a previous analysis using a parsimony score mapping of columns from an alignment of three primates human chimp rhesus_monkey and mouse found evidence of seven classes and moreover a comparison ofto figure c insuggests that many of the classes identified in the two analyses correspond the fact that such similar_results is particularly intriguing because the estimated divergence times for the four primates human chimp gorilla orangutan are much less than those of the three primates yet there is still substantial evidence that there are multiple wellresolved classes of evolutionary_rates hence our methods are applicable to quite closely_related provided that a suitable outgroup is included moreover the results from the simulation_study increase our confidence in the results reported in we have shown that the use of fixed changepoints does not result in an over inflated estimate of the number of non fixed changepoints hence modelling natural boundaries such as alignment block boundaries as fixed changepoints apparently has no detectable influence there is still much work needed in the area of model_selection and its application to these models while information criterion approaches to estimating the number of classes in the bscm appear to be justified they are computationally_expensive even with high powered clusters of computers further investigation would be warranted in applying a ggs scheme to sample over the model space and this is a direction of future_research the ultimate_goal of genomic segmentation is to attribute a specific functional class to each of the discovered segment classes however at this stage results suggest that the classes contain mixtures of functional_classes multiple sources of data indicative of function can be incorporated into the model by defining a suitable input_sequence in preliminary work by the authors we have used these methods to identify a large number of classes when other information is accounted for in the input_sequence such as gc_content frequency of indels and also mutation types this has led to the discovery of many novel functional_elements in regions once thought of as largely not functional the work presented here shows that we can be confident that any classes identified through changepoint analysis are most likely real classes and not artefacts of the data and the information criteria should be used with a degree of caution our results also show the model is not influenced by the number of fixed changepoints or the number of segment classes underlying the input_sequence funding australian research council grants dp and dp
