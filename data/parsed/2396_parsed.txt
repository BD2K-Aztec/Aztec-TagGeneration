improving protein fold_recognition with hybrid profiles combining sequence and structure evolution motivation template_based the most successful approach for predicting protein d structure often requires detecting distant evolutionary_relationships between the target_sequence and proteins of known structure developed for this purpose fold_recognition methods use elaborate strategies to exploit evolutionary_information mainly by encoding amino_acid into profiles since protein_structure is more conserved than sequence the inclusion of structural_information can improve the detection of remote homology results here we present orion a new fold_recognition method based on the pairwise_comparison of hybrid profiles that contain evolutionary_information from both protein_sequence and structure our method uses the state structural alphabet protein blocks which provides an accurate d description of protein_structure local conformations orion systematically outperforms psi_blast and hhsearch on several benchmarks including target_sequences from the modeling competitions casp and and detects more templates at fold and superfamily scop levels availability software freely_available for download atunderstanding how proteins adopt their d structure remains one of the most challenging questions in science the resolution of this problem would have a great impact on various fields of biology and medicine allowing for example the rational_design of new protein functions and drug molecules despite the progress made over the last decades our biochemical knowledge and computational power are still insufficient to accurately_predict protein_structure solely from the amino_acid nevertheless on the basis of the evolutionary_relationship that many proteins share it is possible to model the structure of a target protein using as a template a related protein of known structure this approach called comparative modeling is currently the most successful in constructing theoretical_models of protein_structures since the quality of the resulting structure_prediction largely depends on the template protein selected the initial step of homology detection is crucial in comparative modeling when proteins share_sequence evolutionary_relationships can be found using simple pairwise sequence comparison methods heuristic such as blast or optimal such as ssearch however in the case of non obvious relationships below the twilight zone of sequence_identity between the target and the template fold_recognition methods have been proposed to find related proteins for template_based early methods of remote_homology were based on profile to sequence comparison a profile canbe represented as a position_specific pssm encoded from multiple_sequence msa of related proteins and therefore contains evolutionary_information specific to a protein_family and defined by the levels of residue conservation at each sequence position the first profile to sequence algorithm proposed by and the widely used psi_blast were followed by methods derived from the probabilistic interpretation of profiles using hidden_markov profile_hmms like sam t or hmmer which improved both the alignment_quality and the sensitivity_specificity of detection compared with sequence to sequence_alignment profiles and profile_hmms greatly_improved identification of distantly_related proteins and consequently comparative modeling fold_recognition was later taken to a new level with the ffas method which was based on profileprofile alignment by using profiles for both target and template such methods fully_exploit the transitivity of sequence_homology making them more sensitive and specific than profile tosequence comparisons finally the pairwise profile hmm comparison introduced with the hhsearch algorithm s ding has further pushed the boundaries of remote_homology and provided one of the current best approach for protein fold_recognition besides these methods solely based on sequence some authors have proposed structure based fold_recognition methods called threading the principle of threading is to assess the compatibility between the target_sequence d and different solved_protein d by using knowledge based scoring_functions thus comparative modeling may still be achieved by using templates sharing no detectable homology with the target_sequence since proteins may be structurally_similar even without detectable evolutionary_relationship between their sequences despite interesting success these d d methods are limited by the quality of the sequence to structure alignment and do not reach the accuracy of the most advanced purely sequence_based following the success of both sequence and structure based fold_recognition methods combined approaches have emerged indeed structural_information from solvent_accessibility secondary_structure or backbone torsion_angle can be used to improve sequencebased fold_recognition such structural_features have the advantage of being predictable which addresses the absence of experimental model for the target protein thus several methods combining discrete structural_descriptors with amino_acid sequence_information have been proposed given that structural cores change less rapidly between and times slower than sequences one can imagine the advantage of using structural profiles that would be generated from d descriptions of protein_structures in the same way that sequence_profiles are generated from amino_acid indeed protein_structure being more conserved than sequence through evolution these structural profiles would be more conserved and richer in evolutionary_information than sequence_profiles and therefore better at detecting distant homologies in this article we present orion a new method for fold_recognition using evolutionary_information from both amino_acid and protein_structure and encoded as combined sequence structure profiles our method uses the accurate sequential description of protein local conformations provided by the state structural alphabet protein blocks pb instead of the conventional three state secondary_structure which has important drawbacks especially for describing the loops which constitutes of the local structure of the proteins the relevance of pb structural_information has previously been demonstrated through numerous applications such as structural_alignment and local structure_prediction the novelty of our method also lies in the use of a combination of sequence and structural profiles for both target and template the structural profiles used for the template were derived from structural_alignments of the homstrad database for distantly_related proteins structural_alignments have been shown to be more relevant than sequence_alignments thus using as a benchmark the structural families from homstrad and targets from the eighth ninth and tenth editions of the critical assessment of structure_prediction casp experiments we show that orion outperforms the hhsearch algorithm in recognizing proteins with same or similar folds our detailed analysis further indicates that this accurate homology detection can be attributed to the inclusion of the pb structural_descriptors into profileprofile alignments we have developed orion a profileprofile alignment_method for fold_recognition based on a structural alphabet that improves remote_homology orion is able to detect between and more homologs than the state of the art method hhsearch on a balanced test_set derived from the homstrad database on another test_set of target_sequences from casp and orion systematically outperforms hhsearch and psi_blast detecting respectively and more templates at fold level mean difference in success_rate for top and our method works particularly well for distantly_related proteins due to the addition of accurate_predictions of local structural_information in the form of pbs a possible improvement of orion would be to incorporate other accurately_predicted structural_features such as solvent_accessibility the combination of such structural_descriptors with the pbs should provide a good approximation of the environmentorion orion with pbs profiles hhsearch hhsearch with predicted_secondary information examples of protein_structure predictions based on templates detected by orion the structural_models were obtained with modeller using orion sequence_alignments casp_targets on the right are colored in grey and models are on the left target and model structures were aligned with the tm_align program the three casp_targets are t d a t d b and t d c improving protein fold recognitionpreferences for each amino_acid of the target protein_sequence this information is helpful to predict structural core positions and therefore identify more remote_homologs for example a series of central buried alpha_helices could be identified from the target_sequence with a combination of the predicted pbs and solvent_accessibility descriptors these latter restricting the number of possible template hits another possible improvement would touch on the weights of the different terms in the scoring_function optimal weights were obtained from an evaluation of the successful detection rate on a balanced homstrad test_set this assessment indicates that the sequence and structural scoring terms should be equally weighted for the highest success_rate supplementary however the weights could be dynamically adjusted according to the target_sequence thus while close homologs detection is based on the sequence very remote_homologs detection requires using more structural_information since the structure is more conserved than the sequence throughout the evolution to address the issue of the weighting of the scoring terms orion may evaluate the difficulty of the detection in the initial_search and then adjust the different parameters and perform another search in the template library finally orion and hhsearch show significant differences in template detection suggesting that they are complementary thus orion would also contribute to the improvement of the quality of metaservers and other consensus based prediction_algorithms
