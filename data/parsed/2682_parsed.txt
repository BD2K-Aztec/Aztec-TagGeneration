data_and lc_ims feature finder detecting multidimensional liquid_chromatography ion_mobility and mass_spectrometry features in complex datasets motivation the addition of ion_mobility to liquid_chromatography experiments requires new or updated software_tools to facilitate data_processing results we introduce a command_line software application lc_ims feature finder that searches for molecular_ion signatures in multi_dimensional liquid_chromatography ion_mobility mass_spectrometry lc_ims data by clustering deisotoped peaks with similar monoisotopic mass charge_state lc elution time and ion_mobility drift time values the software application includes an algorithm for detecting and quantifying co eluting chemical_species including species that exist in multiple_conformations that may have been separated in the ims dimension availability lc_ims feature finder is available as a command_line for download at http omics pnl gov software lc_ims feature finder php the microsoft net framework is required to run the software all other dependencies are included with the software_package in conventional proteomics liquid_chromatography lc separations are generally coupled_with ms to increase analytical_sensitivity and proteome coverage more recently ion_mobility ims has been added as an extra dimension of separation to further enhance sensitivity although several software programs are available for deisotoping and or grouping related peaks to aid in the identification of species typically peptides or metabolites none are currently able to process lc_ims data in this regard we introduce lc_ims feature finder a software application that enables researchers to discover possible molecular_ion signatures in lc_ims data by reporting characteristic_features such as monoisotopic mass charge_state lc elution time and ims drift time for use by downstream identification software an important component of lc_ims feature finder is the ability to detect multiple_conformations of a chemical_species the algorithm is particularly useful when i a single molecular gas_phase ion species exists in multiple structural conformations that have distinct ims drift times and ii two different molecular_ion species co elute in the ims dimension in these cases the intensity profiles are frequently not base_line resolved but instead form a set of overlapping peaks which hinders the ability to accurately quantify each individual intensity profile to ensure the most accurate representation of these profiles lc_ims feature finder returns to the raw_data file to collect raw intensity values returning to the raw_data is essential to get the most accurate representation of these profiles the mixture of profiles is split into distinct intensity profiles that will be quantified and reported_separately in the output_file the individual intensity profiles reported are resolved using both the lc and ims dimensions therefore creating distinct lc_ims features future versions of lc_ims feature finder will explore the possibility of resolving which of the two cases give rise to the multiple_conformations the software application outputs a tab separated value text_file that contains associated information about each molecular_ion signature detected monoisotopic mass m z charge_state lc elution time ims drift time and abundance the final monoisotopic mass and m z values are weighted averages based on intensity of the monoisotopic mass and m z values of each deisotoped feature associated with a given signature the lc elution time and ims drift time values are the time points at which the signature exhibits the highest_intensity the output_file can be used by downstream software to cross reference the detected molecular_ion species with a database of known ions to aid in identification of the ions contained in the dataset more details about the software input output and configurable parameters are available in the supplementary_information
