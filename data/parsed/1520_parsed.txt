data_and ebimage an r package for image_processing with applications to cellular_phenotypes ebimage provides general_purpose functionality for reading writing processing and analysis of images furthermore in the context of microscopy based cellular assays ebimage offers tools to segment cells and extract quantitative cellular descriptors this allows the automation of such tasks using the r programming_language and use of existing_tools in the r environment for signal_processing statistical_modeling machine_learning and data visualization availability ebimage is free_and released under the lgpl_license and available from the bioconductor projectimaging cells labeled with specific markers is a powerful method to localize cellular_structures and proteins and to characterize cell morphological changes during population progression or induced by perturbing agents automated phenotyping from such images generates quantitative descriptors of cellular_phenotypes which are computationally analysed to infer biological_roles or functional_relationships recent examples_include characterization of genes involved in cell_division by analysing time lapse image_sequences of human cells estimation of drug effects based on phenotypic changes measured in human hela_cells and identification of genes involved in cell_morphology in drosophila using rna_interference rnai cell segmentation and feature_extraction are well established steps realized by dedicated software such as cellprofiler or generic image_processing platforms like matlab labview or imagej however the analysis and interpretation of multi_parametric cellular descriptors is a more challenging_task it requires powerful statistical and machine_learning and can be facilitated by the possibility of producing visualizations of intermediate results by the automation of complex workflows such as cross_validation or parameter searches and by easy access to biological metadata and genomic_databases these points motivate the use of bioconductor a software project to whom correspondence should be addressed based on the feature rich r programming_language providing tools for the analysis and comprehension of genomic_data several r packages provide some level of functionality for processing and analysing images rimage offers diverse filtering functions but supports only the jpeg format and cannot save images the package ripa is dedicated to the analysis of hyperspectral images but does not provide for image_segmentation biops offers a wide_range of image filters but only supports the jpeg and tiff formats and lacks a fast interactive display interface the recent packageautomated phenotyping of cells promises to be useful in many fields of biology it relies on imaging cell segmentation feature_extraction and statistical_analysis ebimage offers the essential functionality for performing these tasks future improvements are expected to include handling large multi_dimensional objects using netcdf format d objects segmentation and reconstruction and time lapse image_sequences cell_tracking and extraction of spatio temporal_features
