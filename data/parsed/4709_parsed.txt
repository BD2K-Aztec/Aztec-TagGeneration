structural_bioinformatics towards optimal alignment of protein_structure distance_matrices motivation structural_alignments of proteins are important for identification of structural_similarities homology detection and functional_annotation the structural_alignment problem is well studied and computationally difficult many different scoring_schemes for structural_similarity as well as many algorithms for finding high_scoring alignments have been proposed algorithms using contact_map overlap cmo as scoring_function are currently the only practical algorithms able to compute provably optimal alignments results we propose a new mathematical_model for the alignment of inter residue distance_matrices building upon previous work on maximum cmo our model includes all elements needed to emulate various scoring_schemes for the alignment of protein distance_matrices the algorithm that we use to compute alignments is practical only for sparse distance_matrices therefore we propose a more effective scoring_function which uses a distance threshold and only positive structural scores we show that even under these restrictions our approach is in terms of alignment_accuracy competitive with state of the art structural alignment_algorithms whereas it additionally either proves the optimality of an alignment or returns bounds on the optimal score our novel method is freely_available and constitutes an important promising step towards truly provably optimal structural_alignments of proteins
