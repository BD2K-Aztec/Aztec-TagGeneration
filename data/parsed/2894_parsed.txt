genetics_and metabomxtr an r package for mixture_model analysis of non targeted metabolomics_data non targeted metabolomics technologies often yield data in which abundance for any given metabolite is observed and quantified for some samples and reported as missing for other samples apparent missingness can be due to true absence of the metabolite in the sample or presence at a level below detectability mixture_model analysis can formally account for metabolite missingness due to absence or undetectability but software for this type of analysis in the high_throughput setting is limited the r package metabomxtr has been developed to facilitate mixture_model analysis of non targeted metabolomics_data in which only a portion of samples have quantifi able abundance for certain metabolites high_throughput metabolomics profiling has surged in popularity with non targeted technologies in particular offering opportunity for discovery of new metabolite associations with phenotypes or outcomes a challenge to analyzing non targeted output is the frequent occurrence of missing_data these data are not missing in the sense that they were not collected rather metabolites may be detected and their abundance quantified in some samples and not others typically conducted using nuclear_magnetic liquid_chromatography or gas chromatographymass spectrometry non targeted assays typically have unknown lower detection_thresholds thus when a given metabolite is not detected it is unknown whether that metabolite was indeed absent or merely undetectable several approaches for handling missingness have been described in metabolomics literature including complete_case imputation and adaptations of classic dimension_reduction tools to allow for missing_data for metabolite by metabolite analyses imputation is common with methods including minimum median and nearest_neighbor imputation partial_least and principal_components with missing_data adaptations have been used although these methods identify regression_based linear_combinations of multiple correlated metabolites associated with a phenotype or outcome and in general results are less translatable for understanding individual metabolite contributions an underused approach for metabolite by metabolite analysis is the bernoulli lognormal mixture_model proposed by this method simultaneously estimates parameters modeling the probability of non missing response and the mean of observed values imputation is not required and instead missingness is explicitly modeled as either true absence or presence below detectability consistent with non targeted metabolomics technology we used mixture_models to analyze gc_ms metabolomics_data but to our knowledge there is no available software to easily perform these analyses that folds into existing high_throughput data analysis_pipelines noting the elegance of the mixture_model approach and the continued issue of missing_data in metabolomics research we present metabomxtr an r package that automates mixturemodel analysis the core_functions accept r objects typically handled in bioconductor type analyses or basic data frames thus providing a flexible tool to complement existing user pipelines and preferences for data preprocessing this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com generally following log transformation the contribution of the ith observation to the likelihood is the r package metabomxtr facilitates mixture_model analysis of non targeted metabolomics_data re analysis of the hapo pilot metabolomics_data indicates that mixture_model analysis detects metabolites identified by other common imputation approaches and additionally identifies associations that would otherwise be missed rigorous testing of mixture_models on a wider scale is warranted in summary metabomxtr provides metabolomics researchers a previously unavailable tool for handling non targeted metabolomics missingness
