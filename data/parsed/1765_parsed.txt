faster computation of exact rna shape probabilities motivation abstract shape analysis allows efficient computation of a representative_sample of low_energy foldings of an rna_molecule more comprehensive_information is obtained by computing shape probabilities accumulating the boltzmann probabilities of all structures within each abstract shape such information is superior to free_energies because it is independent of sequence_length and base_composition however up to this point computation of shape probabilities evaluates all shapes simultaneously and comes with a computation cost which is exponential in the length of the sequence results we device an approach_called rapidshapes that computes the shapes above a specified probability threshold t by generating a list of promising shapes and constructing specialized folding programs for each shape to compute its share of boltzmann probability this aims at a heuristic improvement of runtime while still computing exact probability_values conclusion evaluating this approach and several substrategies we find that only a small proportion of shapes have to be actually computed for an rna_sequence of length this leads depending on the threshold to a fold speed up compared with the previous complete method thus probabilistic shape analysis has become feasible in medium scale applications such as the screening of rna_transcripts in a bacterial_genome availability rapidshapes is available via http
