genome_analysis geval a web_based browser for evaluating genome_assemblies motivation for most research approaches genome analyses are dependent on the existence of a high_quality genome reference assembly however the local accuracy of an assembly remains difficult to assess and improve the geval browser allows the user to interrogate an assembly in any region of the genome by comparing it to different datasets and evaluating the concordance these analyses include a wide_variety of sequence_alignments comparative_analyses of multiple gen ome assemblies and consistency with optical and other physical_maps geval highlights allelic variations regions of low complexity abnormal coverage and potential sequence and assembly errors and offers strategies for improvement although geval focuses_primarily sequence integrity it can also display arbitrary annotation including from ensembl or trackhub sources we provide geval web_sites for many human mouse zebrafish and chicken assemblies to support the genome reference consortium and geval is also downloadable to enable its use for any organism and assembly availability_and web_browser http geval sanger ac uk plugin http wchow reference_genomes are the foundation for genomic biology as more and more de_novo sequencing_projects are being conducted and more draft_genomes released the continued challenge is to create sufficiently complete and correct assemblies that can be confidently used as references by the research_community although it has been over a decade since it was announced that the human_genome was completed this statement referred to the then achievable quality of sequence resolution there remained errors and lack of sequence_coverage for important regions for example many areas encoding multi gene_families ihgsc since then genome_assemblies of varying quality have been produced for many more species and individuals often resulting in annotation errors with negative influence on their research use groups such as the genome reference consortium grc genomereference org lead efforts to curate and resolve genome_assembly issues and maintain the best quality genome references possible for key research species depending on the project groups that tackle creating a genome reference may have at their disposal multiple alternative assemblies together with resources such as clone_libraries collections of short_reads cdna_sequences rnaseq_data physical_maps optical maps or genetic_markers these datasets help in repairing and reorganizing genomic_regions or to create a strategy to infuse new sequence into a draft assembly in parallel research biologists who observe discrepancies between their data and the genome reference would v c the author published_by
