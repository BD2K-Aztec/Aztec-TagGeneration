context specific transcriptional_regulatory network_inference from global gene_expression maps using double two way t tests motivation transcriptional_regulatory network_inference have been studied for years most of them rely on complex mathematical and algorithmic concepts making them hard to adapt re implement or integrate with other methods to address this problem we introduce a novel method based on a minimal statistical_model for observing transcriptional regulatory_interactions in noisy expression data which is conceptually_simple easy to implement and integrate in any statistical_software environment and equally well performing as existing_methods results we developed a method to infer regulatory_interactions based on a model where transcription_factors tfs and their targets are both differentially_expressed in a gene specific critical sample contrast as measured by repeated two way t tests benchmarking on standard escherichia_coli and yeast reference datasets showed that this method performs equally well as the best existing_methods analysis of the predicted interactions suggested that it works best to infer context specific tf target interactions which only co express locally we confirmed this hypothesis on a dataset of normal_human samples where we found that our method predicts highly tissue_specific and functionally_relevant interactions whereas a global co expression method only associates general tfs to non specific biological_processes availability a software_tool called twixtrix is available from http twixtrix googlecode com transcriptional_regulatory which emerge from the combinatorial regulation of the expression of all genes in an organism by a limited number of transcription_factors tfs control the cellular response to internal and external_perturbations at present direct experimental mapping of complete transcriptional_regulatory remains infeasible particularly in higher organisms especially since the structure of these networks is itself condition_dependent a lot of attention has therefore been devoted to computationally reconstruct transcriptional_regulatory from compendia of genome_wide gene_expression in diverse conditions time points cell_types or genotypic backgrounds however despite many years of research it still remains a question which computational_methods are most suited to tackle this problem moreover regulatory_network remains a task firmly in the hands of specialists and network_inference are still not routinely_included in standard statistical software_packages unlike for instance differential_expression testing or co expression analysis at least in part this is due to the fact that most network_reconstruction methods depend on non trivial mathematical concepts such as mutual_information differential_equations biophysical models bayesian_networks ensemble methods or machine_learning huynh while these complex mathematical_models are well justified in theory current gene_expression have high levels of noise and are lacking in resolution making these models prone to over fitting furthermore the resulting algorithms are difficult if not impossible to re implement as they often depend on poorly documented parameter choices and heuristic techniques for instance to improve convergence rates or avoid local_optima in order to address these problems we propose a novel method which is based on a minimal statistical_model the model assumes that tfs and their targets are both differentially_expressed in a gene specific sample contrast but it makes no assumption on any functional relationship be it linear or non linear between the gene_expression of tfs and their targets it should thus be ideally_suited to infer regulatory_interactions from noisy low_resolution gene_expression maps first the method identifies for each gene its critical contrast the separation of samples into two sets across which that gene is most significantly_differentially as determined by two way t tests second the method_takes a list of tfs or other regulatory_proteins and calculates their differential_expression in the critical contrast of each possible target_gene again determined by two way t tests the predicted network is the list of tf gene_associations ranked by these t test p values either considered as a weighted network or cutoff at a desired significance threshold to whom correspondence should be addressed the idea to use t tests to predict regulatory_interactions was first proposed by here we systematically evaluate the performance of this double two way t test procedure using benchmark expression data and networks of known transcriptional regulatory_interactions in escherichia_coli and yeast following standard evaluation protocols established by the dream community we found that double two way t testing performs as well as the best current methods especially in yeast next we compared the top_ranked predictions of each method and found that the t test procedure identifies a considerably different set of interactions than the other methods in particular whereas the top_ranked predictions of the other methods tend to exhibit high levels of global co expression between the tfs and their predicted targets interactions found by the t test procedure tend to only co express locally and involve tfs that are only expressed under certain experimental_conditions we therefore hypothesized that the double two way t test method is particularly useful to predict context specific networks in multi_cellular organisms to test this hypothesis we applied it to a global gene_expression compendium containing samples from normal_human although due to a lack of knowledge in human a systematic evaluation of the predicted network is impossible manual_analysis of the top_ranked tfs showed that the functional enrichment of their predicted targets is indeed highly_consistent with known cell_type modes of action for these tfs reconstructing transcriptional_regulatory from genome_wide gene_expression data remains an important bioinformatics challenge although diverse mathematical and computational_methods have been proposed to address this problem they have not been as successful as might originally have been expected a possible reason is that current gene_expression are too noisy and lack the resolution for adequately fitting complex mathematical_models here we analysed a method which rather than adding to the complexity of network_inference uses a minimal statistical_model for associating tfs to putative target_genes without assuming any linear or non linear functional relationship between their expression_profiles the method is based on a double two way t test which assesses the differential_expression of a tf in the critical sample contrast of all genes essentially this results in a local co expression measure which appears well suited to capture context specific transcriptional_activity at the expense of giving less weight to globally co expressed tf target pairs in bacteria much of the cellular response to perturbations is controlled at transcriptional level only such that many tf target pairs are co expressed under all experimental_conditions here the double two way t test therefore does not improve upon existing_methods in yeast however there is evidence of known transcriptional interactions which only co express under specific conditions the t test procedure prioritizes such interactions and indeed performs better in yeast than e coli relative to the existing_methods taking this one step further we hypothesize that the double two way t test method for inferring regulatory_interactions will be particularly useful to analyse global gene_expression maps in multi_cellular organisms which combine data from hundreds of different samples indeed we confirmed that our method predicts highly tissue_specific and functionally_relevant interactions from a dataset of normal_human samples whereas global co expression methods only associate general tfs to non specific biological_processes in view of the time it takes to experimentally generate large expression compendia judging a network inference_method by its running time is perhaps not very relevant nevertheless we note that depending on hardware details the t test procedure took not more than a few seconds to analyse the human dataset while the other methods needed from a few hours upto several days having a fast method is clearly beneficial e g to easily compare results from different normalizations of the data or from different subsets of a large data compendium e g from normal versus disease_states cell_lines versus tissue_samples etc in summary we believe that the double two way t test method provides a useful addition to existing network_inference whose primary strength lies in prioritizing context specific regulatory_interactions from global gene_expression maps which integrate data from hundreds to thousands of samples from diverse experimental_treatments cell_types tissues developmental_stages or individuals confilict of interest none declared
