a comparison of several algorithms for the single individual snp haplotyping reconstruction problem motivation single_nucleotide are the most common form of variation in human dna and are involved in many research_fields from molecular_biology to medical_therapy the technological opportunity to deal with long dna_sequences using shotgun_sequencing has raised the problem of fragment recombination in this regard single individual haplotyping sih problem has_received over the past_few results in this article we survey seven recent_approaches to the sih problem and evaluate them extensively using real human haplotype_data from the hapmap project we also implemented a data generator tailored to the current shotgun sequencing_technology that uses haplotypes from the hapmap project availability the data we used to compare the algorithms are available on demand since we think they represent an important benchmark that can be used to easily compare novel algorithmic ideas with the state of the art moreover we had to re implement six of the algorithms surveyed because the original code was not available to us five of these algorithms and the data generator used in this article endowed with a web_interface are available atrecently many researchers focus has shifted from what individuals of a certain species have in common to their differences and thus to dna mutations the single_nucleotide snp pronounced snip is the most widespread form of variation in human dna and consists in the variation of the base present in a single fixed position of the dna_strand the sequence of all snps in a given chromosome is called a haplotype humans are diploid organisms this means that except for the sexual chromosomes of males the chromosomes come in two copies one inherited from the mother and one from the father as a consequence the haplotypes of a chromosome can be fully described by two sequences of snps the mothers haplotype and the fathers since haplotypes contain all the information about dna variations they play_a in many studies about variations in gene_expression and prediction of diseases for this reason several sequencing_projects have been launched with the ultimate_goal of building a complete map of the snps present in the human dna at the moment the hapmap consortium has produced the most complete map of snps in human dna consisting of over million snps and has estimated that the overall number of snps in the human dna is about million single individual haplotype sih reconstruction problem is one of the core problems in the reconstruction of whole genomes it consists in rebuilding the two haplotypes from a set of fragments obtained by the shotgun_sequencing of the chromosomes current shotgun technology produces a very large set of fragments with lengths in the range of bases with a certain degree of overlap between them this technology does not allow keeping track of the association of a fragment with its haplotype an important characteristic of this problem is that unlike the fragment assembly problem the position and orientation of the fragments is known a priori this means that fragments can be arranged in a matrix called snp matrix in the absence of errors it is easy to find a bipartition of the snp matrix such that the fragments belonging to each partition do not conflict two fragments are said to be conflicting if for a certain position not gap they have different values in the real_world application this is not the case and errors affect the snp matrix errors can originate from various sources reading errors are typically due to chemical optical errors in reading the snps and as a result lead to the insertion of a wrong base in a certain position ambiguous readings occur when the signal_strength of a snp in not enough to establish its correct value with a high degree of confidence the effect of ambiguous readings is typically the insertion of a gap in the sequence the sih problem has_attracted in the past_few and a large number of models and algorithms have been introduced in the literature many models have np_hard solutions thus heuristics are often used however a common framework to compare all those algorithms with each other is still lacking we tested several algorithms for the sih problem and from them we selected the seven most effective heuristic_algorithms moreover we defined a common framework in which all the algorithms were evaluated an exhaustive comparison of all the algorithms for the sih problem is not feasible for many reasons for example many algorithms are designed for simplified models of the snp matrix and are inadequate for the matrices generated according to the current shotgun sequencing_technology in this class of algorithms there are those that do not allow the insertion of gaps inside the fragments or the insertion of mate_pair sequences another class of algorithms as in uses genotype_information to solve the sih problem this information can improve the accuracy of the reconstructed haplotypes but is not often available in practice
