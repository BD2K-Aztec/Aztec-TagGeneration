anarci antigen_receptor numbering and receptor classification motivation antibody amino_acid can be numbered to identify equivalent positions such annotations are valuable for antibody sequence comparison protein_structure modelling and engineering multiple different numbering schemes exist they vary in the nomenclature they use to annotate residue positions their definitions of position equivalence and their popularity within different scientific_disciplines however currently no publicly_available software exists that can apply all the most widely used schemes or for which an executable can be obtained under an open license results anarci is a tool to classify and number antibody and t cell receptor amino_acid variable domain_sequences it can annotate sequences with the five most popular numbering schemes kabat chothia enhanced chothia imgt and aho the variable domains of antibodies and t cell receptors tcr contain these proteins major binding regions alignment of these variable sequences to a numbering scheme allows equivalent residue positions to be annotated and for different molecules to be compared performing numbering is fundamental for immunoinformatics analysis and rational engineering of therapeutic_molecules several numbering schemes have been proposed each is favoured by scientists in different immunological disciplines the kabat scheme was developed based on the location of regions of high sequence_variation between sequences of the same domain type it numbers antibody heavy vh and light vk and vj variable domains differently chothias scheme is the same as kabats but corrects where an insertion is annotated around the first vh complementarity_determining cdr so that it corresponds to a structural loop similarly the enhanced chothia scheme makes further structural corrections of indel positions in contrast to these kabat like schemes imgt and aho both define unique schemes for antibody and t cell receptor tcr va and vb variable domains thus equivalent residue positions can easily be compared between domain types imgt and aho differ in the number of positions they annotate and respectively and where they consider indels to occur separate online interfaces exist that can apply each numbering scheme kabat chothia and enhanced chothia through abnum imgt through domaingapalign and aho through pyigclassify no program currently exists that can apply all schemes or for which an executable is available under open license we have developed anarci a program that can annotate sequences with all five of the numbering schemes described above we provide both a web_interface and the software under open license so that these fundamental annotations can be easily available for further immunoinformatics analyses we have developed anarci a program for annotating antigen_receptor variable_domain amino_acid with five commonly used numbering schemes the program can be run as command_line or imported as a python module for incorporation in custom scripts we also provide a public web_browser interface that can annotate small numbers of sequences anarci is freely distributed under the gplv_license and available at opig stats ox ac uk webapps anarci conflict of interest none declared the web_based interface to anarci the species domain type and numbering is reported for each sequence the annotations can either be downloaded or visualized on the webpage
