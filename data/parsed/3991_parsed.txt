genome_analysis retroseq transposable_element discovery from next_generation data a significant proportion of eukaryote genomes consist of transposable_element te derived sequence these elements are known to have the capacity to modulate gene function and genome_evolution we have developed retroseq for detecting non reference te insertions from illumina paired_end whole_genome sequencing_data we evaluate retroseq on a human trio from the genomes_project showing that it produces highly_accurate te calls availabilty retroseq is open_source and available from https github com tk retroseq transposable_elements were first discovered in maize by barbara mcclintock in the early th century and have since been found in almost every organism they are often referred to as genomic parasites and most are relics of ancient viral_infections in large eukaryote genomes such as human and mouse tes make up almost half of the genome there are two distinct classes of tes class i retroelements that move by a copy and paste fashion and the less prevalent class_ii dna transposons that operate by a cut and paste mechanism within the retroelements there are two distinct classes the long_terminal ltr bound elements and the non ltr elements in the human_genome there are two main types of non ltr elements namely the short interspersed nuclear elements sine and long_interspersed nuclear elements line within these classes the alu and l subfamilies are known to remain functionally_active and polymorphic in laboratory_mice the ltr bound elements also known as endogenous retroviral elementservs can be divided_into several subfamilies and are known to be responsible for up to of spontaneous mutations with the advent_of technologies it has become feasible to catalogue all types of molecular variation including insertions of large sequences such as tes previously hormozdiari et_al furthermore a number of authors have developed te insertion_site junction sequencing assays and computational_methods to detect non reference tes in this article we present our software retroseq which can be used to discover non reference te insertions from whole_genome sequencing_data with high_accuracy previously we used retroseq to create a comprehensive catalogue of just over one hundred thousand polymorphic sine line and erv elements across mouse_strains using data from a trio of northern and western european_ancestry ceu from the genomes_project we show how retroseq can be used to create an accurate set of te calls find alu and l insertions in each individual this trio was previously part of a survey of alu and l elements in a genomes pilot_project follow_up study however the sequencing_data available at the time provided lower illumina sequencing_coverage for each genome which hindered the sensitivity of alu and l detection chip stewart personal communication for alu_elements the sensitivity of retroseq and tangram is for all three individuals with tea slightly_lower see for l elements the sensitivity of all the methods is uniformly lower with retroseq and tangram performing best however when we look at the retroseq false_negative by te type in the trio we do not see a significant_difference in the rates for l over alu calls we can estimate an upper false_discovery in the child by examining the calls relative to the expected inheritance patterns if we consider the calls private to the child as false_positives the false_discovery of the callers varies_significantly supplementary with retroseq having the lowest overall rate followed by tangram and tea if we take the calls shared by the parents and not found in the offspring we can estimate the upper false_negative for retroseq in the offspring at we can use the pcr validated calls with precise break_points to examine the accuracy of the break_points estimated by retroseq supplementary figs s s show the distribution of the break_points found by retroseq around the pcr validated break_points in na the vast_majority of the break_points are within ae bp of the pcr break_points with being within bp supplementary the coverage for these samples is extremely_high so it is useful to ask what is the effect on the sensitivity of te calling when the sequencing_depth is lower therefore we sub sampled the data from sample na at various depths and plotted the sensitivity relative to i the pcr validated calls and ii the intersection of the computational calls fromand retroseq supplementaryshows that there is a significant drop off in sensitivity at depths lower than with the sensitivity of the computational calls at coverage thus in the context of te calling in low coverage populations data from multiple_individuals could be pooled to increase the sensitivity of te discovery
