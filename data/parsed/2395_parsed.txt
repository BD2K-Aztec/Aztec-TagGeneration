structural_bioinformatics improving protein fold_recognition and template_based by employing probabilistic based matching between predicted one dimensional structural_properties of query and corresponding native properties of templates motivation in recent_years development of a single method fold_recognition server lags behind consensus and multiple template techniques however a good consensus prediction relies on the accuracy of individual methods this article reports our efforts to further improve a single method fold_recognition technique called sparks by changing the alignment scoring_function and incorporating the spine x techniques that make improved_prediction of secondary_structure backbone torsion_angle and solvent_accessible results the new method called sparks x was tested with the salign benchmark for alignment_accuracy lindahl and scop benchmarks for fold_recognition and casp blind_test for structure_prediction the method is compared to several state of the art techniques such as hhpred and boostthreader results show that sparks x is one of the best single method fold_recognition techniques we further note that incorporating multiple_templates and refinement in model_building will likely further improve sparks x availability the method is available as a sparks x server atgiven a query protein_sequence with unknown structure the most reliable structure_prediction technique is to recognize its matching structural folds from existing known structures with or without significant_sequence called homology_modeling and fold_recognition respectively this approach is also known as templatebased modeling template_based becomes increasingly powerful because most popular structure folds adopted by multiple_sequences are known however recognizing structurally_similar folds in the absence of sequence_similarity fold_recognition is challenging as revealed from the critical assessment of structure_prediction casp to whom correspondence should be addressed techniques casp experiments highlighted the importance of posttreatment of models predicted by individual fold_recognition methods through the use of consensus predictions for example robetta pmodeller fams ace phyre and or constrained templatefragment recombination and refinement for example chunk tasser i tasser the experiments also indicated a convergence of techniques that can be broadly characterized as mixing and matching of multiple fragments and templates examples of recently_developed new methods include the combined use of fragment and template comparison non linear scoring_function from conditional_random model and profile entropy employment of predicted torsion_angles and a combined use of profileprofile alignment and pairwise and solvation potentials we have developed a series of single fold_recognition methods sparks sp sp sp and sp that are based on weighted matching of multiple profiles that include sequence_profiles generated from multiple_sequence predicted versus actual secondary_structures knowledge based profile singlebody score function depth_dependent sequence_profiles derived from template structures predicted versus actual solvent_accessible and predicted versus actual dihedral_angles statistically significant_improvement is observed for the accuracy and sensitivity of fold_recognition as the number of matching profiles increases from to in particular sparks sp and sp were ranked among the top performers for automatic servers in casp and casp experiments one issue in the methods developed above is that matching predicted d profiles of query_sequence with actual profiles of templates is based on simple difference matrices it does not account for the probability of errors in predicted d structural_properties such as secondary_structure backbone torsion_angles and solvent_accessible in this article we introduce energy termswe have reported a new fold_recognition server called sparksx that is significantly different from our previous versions in how the profileprofile matching score is obtained moreover we also employed significantly_improved secondary_structure real value torsion_angle prediction and solvent_accessibility prediction all these techniques made an improvement over our previous sp series possible we found that predicted asa contributes the most to the overall accuracy of sparks x one interesting observation is that spakrs x performs significantly better in recognizing structurally_similar proteins and in building better models based on the large dataset of scop and the latest_version of hhpred available on the web on the other hand limited casp blind prediction suggests the opposite the official average gdt score for domains given by hhpredb is compared with given by sparks x http predictioncenter org casp this improvement of hhpred over sparks x is likely due to significantly more sophisticated model_building techniques_employed in the unreleased version of hhpred by using distance_restraints derived from multiple_templates together with alignment confidence furthermore sparks x is only behind the best automatic server in official average gdt score of zhang server this is likely due to combined effect of consensus prediction from multiple fold_recognition servers the use of multiple_templates and model refinement this is an area of focus in our future work for further improving sparks
