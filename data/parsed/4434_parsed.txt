strategies to improve the performance of rare_variant studies by optimizing the selection of controls motivation when analyzing a case group of patients with ultra rare_disorders the ethnicities are often diverse and the data_quality might vary the population_substructure in the case group as well as the heterogeneous data_quality can cause substantial inflation of test_statistics and result in spurious_associations in case_control if not properly adjusted for existing techniques to correct for confounding_effects were especially developed for common_variants and are not applicable to rare_variants results we analyzed strategies to select suitable controls for cases that are based on similarity_metrics that vary in their weighting_schemes we simulated different disease_entities on real exome data and show that a similarity based selection scheme can help to reduce false_positive associations and to optimize the performance of the statistical_tests especially when data_quality as well as ethnicities vary a lot in the case group a matching approach that puts more weight on rare_variants shows the best performance we reanalyzed collections of unrelated patients with kabuki make up syndrome hyperphosphatasia with mental_retardation syndrome and catelmanzke syndrome for which the disease genes were recently described we show that rare_variant tests are more sensitive and specific in identifying the disease gene than intersection filters and should thus be considered as a favorable approach in analyzing even small patient_cohorts in genome_wide gwas spurious_associations from population_substructure are known pitfalls as statistical_tests in case_control assume that differences in the compositions of genotypes are solely due to their difference in disease status and not to any difference in genetic_background especially in large association studies comprising thousands of individuals the assumption of population homogeneity is often violated this can increase the familywise error_rate fwer which is the probability to report at least one false association an inappropriate genetic matching of cases and controls in the presence of population_substructure can lead to inflation unless properly accounted for in the analysis over the recent_years several effective methods have been developed to control the inflation of test_statistics in association studies these can be subdivided into approaches that select suitable controls for cases prior to the statistical_test such as genotype based matching or a stratification score based matching and strategies that correct the p values afterwards due to differences in the group substructure such as genomic control principal_component or other variance_component models most of these methods have been extensively_studied in association studies that work with common_variants in complex_diseases however as the genetic_risk modifiers that were identified in many gwas do explain the disease_susceptibility only to a limited degree it was suggested to extend the search to rare_variants to find the missing_heritability the statistical_tests that have to be applied for rare_variants differ substantially from those which are suitable for common_variants like in other studies we will use in hereinafter the abbreviations cvas and rvas to make a clear_distinction common and rare_variant studies over the last few years many new statistical_approaches have been developed or adapted to analyze associations for collections of rare_variants these methods can be divided_into two main types namely multiple marker tests and univariate tests that are applied to genotype data that are combined within a region of interest e g a gene the issue of appropriate methods for multiple testing corrections has been extensively discussed in cvas and it took several years to agree on as an acceptable significance threshold for indefinitely dense maps of common single_nucleotide snps for rvas a careful analysis of significance testing has just begun and is an ongoing field of research in the meantime computationally_intensive permutation_tests can be used to correct the p values empirically and to compare different test_statistics gwas for common_variants in complex_diseases usually require hundreds of samples for sufficient power for rare_variants that are functionally_relevant and thus exhibit_higher effect_sizes significant associations might already be detectable for smaller case groups however the limited number of cases that are available for the analysis of ultra rare_diseases will remain a challenge and in such studies ranking genes by p values may serve as a stopgap solution to identify promising disease_loci in the genome in this article we analyze how test_statistics perform on exome datasets of individuals from diverse ethnic_backgrounds and varying data_quality we focused especially on strategies for selecting controls and studied how this may influence the disease_gene we show that an appropriate choice of controls is of utmost interest when studying individuals with rare_disorders as these collections show usually a substantial population_substructure due to diverse ethnicities the increasing availability of high_throughput has revealed the cause of multiple rare monogenic_disorders over the recent_years many of these discoveries could be made because classical linkage_analysis in large affected pedigrees could limit the genomic search_space however it seems that many of the low hanging fruits have been picked by now and that collections of unsolved cases are building up that require different analysis strategies in some of the rare_disorders a single pathogenic allele does not need to be fully penetrant and might require additional modifiers to develop the phenotype in autism_spectrum it seems to be the mutational load of functionally compromising variants in several genes that seems to matter especially in these instances case group association studies that focus on rare_variants might help to find further disease related loci although gwas have been a big success in identifying target_genes for complex_disorders there are some key differences when it comes to rare mathieson andshowed that population_substructure from rare_variants is systematically different from stratification that is due to common_variants they demonstrated that existing_methods to correct for confounding_effects in cvas cannot account for the substructure introduced by rare_variants as correction of substructure is not feasible in rvas strategies to identify suitable controls seem to be a promising alternative in our work we therefore focused on methods that match controls based on their similarity for associations studies that build on snp data there has already been pioneering work byon genotype based matching approaches and the metrics that we analyze for selecting controls also build on these efforts we studied_systematically how ngs data_quality as well as different population backgrounds influence the chances of identifying the disease gene in small case groups of individuals with ultra rare we also found that in rvas a similarity_metric that puts a stronger weight on sharing rare alleles shows the best performance in the statistical_analysis especially if the data_quality is heterogeneous we also showed that the profiles of rare_variants between different european_populations and different sequencing studies do vary_considerably which has important consequences for the setup of rvas whenever ancestral components are potential_confounders stratification based matching approaches such as described byshould also be considered from a statistical point_of it is often not optimal to include as many controls as possible if they are not matching due to data_quality or ethnicity the best performance may be achieved if samples that are prone to cause spurious_associations are not included whenever there is high variability in the quality of the datasets in the case group a matching approach that is also sensitive to the rate of genotyping_errors seems to be the method of choice however there is no simple rule of thumb for a selection_strategy that applies to any case cohort in some datasets simulations with known pathogenic_mutations such as described in this work might help to decide whether sequencing of additional controls would improve the statistical_power observed log p hpmrs n a f rvas for three recently resolved monogenic_disorders kabuki makeup syndrome mabry syndrome and catelmanzke syndrome are mendelian_disorders for which pathogenic_mutations have been identified in new disease genes by intersections of candidate variant sets in case groups of unrelated affected_individuals comprising or cases for fewer cases the approach of an intersection filter would have been inconclusive by a rvas approach with controls however the probability of identifying the disease gene in such cohorts is still considerable even when the number of cases with pathogenic_mutations in these cohorts is reduced_markedly a c and e additionally a selection of similarity matched_controls may also help to reduce spurious_associations effectively the qq plots b d and f show the observed versus the expected p values for instances of the rvas simulations where and individuals had pathogenic_mutations in the disease genes kmt d tgds and pgap and showed the lowest p value only when similarity matched_controls were used when random controls are used the p values of highly_variable genes such as nfx krt or cshl are inflated
