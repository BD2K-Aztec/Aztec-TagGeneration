systems_biology da parameter_estimation of biological_pathways using data assimilation approach data assimilation da is a computational_approach that estimates unknown_parameters in a pathway model using time course information particle_filtering the underlying method used is a well established statistical_method that approximates the joint posterior distributions of parameters by using sequentially generated monte_carlo samples in this article we report the release of java_based software da with an intuitive and user_friendly interface to allow users to carry out parameters estimation using da availability_and da was developed using java and thus would be executable on any platform installed with jdk not jre or later da is freely_available for academic users and can be launched or downloaded from http simulating and modeling of biological_pathways have been gaining_popularity in an attempt to better understand complex biological_relationships however before a pathway model can be simulated all parameters in the model must be known unfortunately some parameters are usually either unknown or do not agree in literature to address this problem we previously_introduced a computational_method called data assimilation da to estimate unknown_parameters in a pathway model using the time course information based on a well established statistical_method particle_filtering this method has been successfully used to do parameter_estimation for the circadian_clock model and phosphotyrosine dependent signaling_networks in the epidermal_growth egfr pathway furthermore in a recent paper it has also been shown that particle_filtering can be deployed to utilize parallel_computing infrastructure that makes it scalable for large complex models to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as
