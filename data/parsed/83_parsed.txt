genome_analysis a comparative_analysis of algorithms for somatic snv detection in cancer motivation with the advent of relatively affordable high_throughput dna_sequencing of cancers is now common practice in cancer research_projects and will be increasingly used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and treatment somatic cancer only single_nucleotide snvs are the simplest class of mutation yet their identification in dna sequencing_data is confounded by germline poly morphisms tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors four recently_published algorithms for the detection of somatic snv sites in matched cancernormal sequencing_datasets are varscan somaticsniper jointsnvmix and strelka in this analysis we apply these four snv calling algorithms to cancernormal illumina exome_sequencing of a chronic_myeloid cml patient the candidate snv sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false_positives then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths_and of each snv calling algorithm results comparing the candidate snv sets returned by varscan somaticsniper jointsnvmix and strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites their susceptibility to various sources of noise and their sensitivities to low allelic fraction candidates availability data accession_number sra code atcancer genome_projects are currently working to catalogue the diversity of dna mutations present in different cancers via highthroughput dna_sequencing of matched cancernormal samples these projects seek to find correlations between mutation profiles and clinical_outcomes identify mutations driving cancer_progression and identify targets for novel therapeutic developments somatic single_nucleotide snvs are the simplest class of mutation but their detection from matched cancer normal sequencing_data is complicated by both biological and technical noise cancers arise from a single ancestral cell that has acquired enough somatic_mutations to deregulate its own proliferation and expand into a large cell_population with clonal mutations matching the ancestral profile loss of function in genes for genome_stability and repair establishes a mutator phenotype in which a greater rate of somatic_mutation provides the cell_population with a vast repository of mutations in low_copy those mutations conferring a selective_advantage preferentially expand in number forming subpopulations with the same subclonal mutations clonal and subclonal mutations include drivers of the cancer phenotype and passenger_mutations that arose in the same clonally expanding cell_line as a driver analysis of cancer sequencing_data has unique challenges including methods for analysing matched cancernormal samples to distinguish germline polymorphism from somatic variation genome_rearrangements that do not align well to the reference and cancer sample_heterogeneity from subclonal variation and sample impurity in addition to this biological_complexity are several sources of mapping and sequencing_error both random and systematic error profile assessments of the illumina sequencing_platform have identified increased error_rates at read ends a tendency towards transversion base call errors a low indel error_rate and systematic sequence specific errors following inverted_repeat sequences and gg motifs the majority of systematic errors assessed byonly had base call errors on one of the two dna_strands they suggested the presence of different motifs immediately_preceding a certain site during sequencing on different strands leaves one strand significantly more prone to phasing error than the other greater_depth of sequencing is often advanced as the solution to separating sequencing_errors from real variation but the susceptibility of particular sites to recurrent base call errors is consistently observed at any depth furthermore increased depth has the unintended side effect of allowing sites with lower susceptibility to systematic_error to accumulate multiple such mistakes this

distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work a particularly significant problem in cancer sequencing as subclonal variation and sample impurity give rise to mutations at the same low allelic fractions as aggregations of systematic_error varscan somaticsniper jsm and strelka were used to return candidate snv sites from matched cancernormal exomes from a chronic_myeloid cml patient sequenced with the illumina_hiseq platform in paired bp reads sra the algorithms were also applied to similar exome_sequencing from non cancerous patient samples randomly split into two equal sized subsamples to mimic production of two normal sequencing samples from each individual to assess the output returned in the absence of any real somatic variation between samples details of the data and methods used are available in the supplementary_information
