genome_analysis making novel proteins from pseudogenes motivation recently we made synthetic proteins from non coding_dna of escherichia_coli encouraged by this we asked can we artificially express pseudogenes into novel and functional proteins what kind of structures would be generated would these proteins be stable how would the organism respond to the artificial reactivation of pseudogenes results to answer_these we studied full_length protein equivalents of pseudogenes the sequence based_predictions indicated interesting molecular and cellular functional_roles for pseudo gene derived proteins most of the proteins were predicted to be involved in the amino_acid energy_metabolism purines and pyrimidine biosynthesis central intermediary_metabolism transport and binding interestingly many of the pseudogene derived proteins were predicted to be enzymes furthermore proteins showed_strong of stable tertiary_structures the prediction scores for structure function and stability were found to be favorable in most of the cases impact to our best knowledge this is the first such report that predicts the possibility of making functional and stable proteins from pseudogenes in future it would be interesting to experimentally synthesize and validate these predictions the term pseudogene has been derived from the term pseudo meaning false these genes are also known as genomic fossils the first pseudogene was reported in s dna of xenopus_laevis pseudogenes are obsolete stretches of dna_sequences that lack protein_coding potential owing to the presence of the frame_shift and premature_stop even though they resemble functional_genes they are considered dysfunctional relatives of ancestral functional_genes that might have lost function during evolution pseudogenes have been reported in plants bacteria yeast insects ramos onsins and aguad e nematodes and mammals based on their origins pseudogenes have been categorized into i processed pseudogenesformed by retrotransposition of mrna and have paralogs in the same genome ii duplicated pseudogenessometimes called unprocessed pseudogenes arise because of the duplication of functional_genes that later on acquire mutation and finally become nonfunctional and iii unitary or disabled pseudogenesthought to originate through disruptive mutation in the functional protein_coding as new duplicated_genes they could serve as a source of genomic innovations resulting in novel functions unprocessed and duplicated pseudogenes have intronexon structures whereas processed pseudogenes have exonic region only the long protein_coding tend to produce non processed pseudogenes whereas short proteincoding_genes tend to produce processed pseudogenes currently the origin evolution and function of pseudogenes are incompletely_understood the biological role of pseudogenes were first reported nearly years_ago in the form of regulating neuronal_nitric gene_expression recent_studies have indicated more functional_roles for pseudogenes the relationship between pseudogenes and long_noncoding lncrnas is beginning to be understood antisense_rna derived from pten pseudogene has been found to regulate the transcription and mrna_stability of pten tumor_suppressor pseudogene derived non_coding amplified the expression_level of their parent gene and functioning as endogenous rnas with the pten pseudogene further pseudogene derived small_rnas have been found to play a role in regional chromatin repression recent_evidences indicate involvement of pseudogenes in regulating the growth of organism by acting as mirna decoy encoding short_peptides or proteins african trypanosoma_brucei suppress the gene_expression through rna_interference given their mechanisms of origins development of these sequences over evolutionary scale of complexity and their potential functional_roles pseudogenes make a strong case for understanding fundamental biology and generating novel applications in this bioinformatics study on pseudogenes our aim was to predict profile of proteins that can be made on demand this thought has origins in our previous study where the feasibility of experimentally making novel and functional proteins from non coding_dna was demonstrated saccharomyces_cerevisiae is among the most well studied organism where pseudogenes have been identified and analyzed it is also one of the most precisely sequenced and annotated eukaryotic_genome due to this reason s cerevisiae was considered in the present study the present study is an extension of previous work where escherichia_coli non coding dna_sequences were artificially expressed into functional proteins this gave rise to a new questionwhat would happen if we artificially expressed pseudogene sequences would they make stable and functional proteins how would their structure look like what kind of molecules would they interact with given their increasingly_complex role at both genetic and epigenetic levels guo et_al this study attempts to present a novel way of understanding pseudogene biology by artificially expressing candidate_sequences that show most promising leads of the pseudogenes that were computationally translated to protein_sequences sequences gave full_length open_reading orf without any stop_codons and were considered in this study to understand potential property of pseudogene proteins sequence_based and structure based prediction studies were performed using the best computational_tools available before this step pseudogene sequences were sent for rna_structure based on the reasoning that if pseudogene mrna assumes a rigid secondary_structure it would be difficult to artificially synthesize proteins reports suggest that highly_expressed may not show stable mrna secondary_structure whereas low expressed genes may show highly_stable mrna secondary_structure thus higher the value of g lower the possibility of forming a stable mrna secondary_structure all pseudogene proteins exhibited g ranging from kcal_mol to kcal_mol indicating that pseudogenes may have been possibly low expressing genes in the past when they were in an active_state it would be interesting to see how they behave when artificially expressed using both a weak and a strong promoter to strengthen pseudogene predictions for experimental_validation it is important to address the reliability of function predictions functions of selected pseudogenes and its relatives were predicted using sequence_information as tools have been developed that reliably_predict the function from sequence_data it was found that many pseudogeneencoded proteins eka eka eka eka eka eka eka and eka had function similar to that of their relatives furthermore several pseudogene proteins were predicted to play a role in amino_acid and energy_metabolism we found that three pseudogenes eka eka and eka from the set of pseudogenes showed similar functions based on both proteinprotein_interaction and gene_ontology predictions majority of pseudogene proteins were found to localize to cytosol interestingly pseudogene encoded_proteins eka eka and eka that show up in the energy_metabolism category also localize to cytosol cytoplasm thus strengthening the belief in predictions proteins with regulatory_functions eka were also localized to cytosol cytoplasm interestingly eka and eka showing up under purines and pyrimidines biosynthesis functional category were found to be localized to the nucleus subcellular compartment it was encouraging to observe that predicted pseudogene proteins showed high aliphatic index values and lower instability index indicating greater stability if expressed the low hydrophobicity score of predicted proteins indicate their polar nature tertiary_structure of potential pseudogene proteins was determined by using i tasser because of the wide acceptance of this tool in the community the quality of model is estimated based on the c score the convergence parameters of the structure assembly simulations and threading template alignments are used for calculating the c score typically c score value is between and where higher value of c score indicates a model with a high_confidence and vice_versa the c score value for all pseudogene proteins was found to be in the range of to indicating a strong foldability of the predicted proteins structural_stability of proteins is an important indicator of their potential function to further understand the strength of structural predictions we studied proteins using stability parameters like stabilization centers total_energy cation interaction_energies non covalent noncanonical interaction and instability index and encouraging evidence of protein_structure stability was found tables further the total_energy of the proteins was calculated using gromacs force fieldwherein the lower the energy the higher the possibility of stable configuration the total_energy of all the proteins individually was found to be negative indicating that all the proteins are likely to exhibit a stable structure if expressed further of the proteins exhibited several stabilization centers among all the proteins eka and eka were found to have the lowest energy and highest numbers of stabilization centers we also studied non covalent interactions like hydrogen_bonds hydrophobic_interactions disulphide bridges salt_bridges and cation interactions in these proteins the data obtained under all these categories give a strong indication of stable foldability of proteins among all the proteins eka and eka show presence of higher non covalent interaction indicating better stability these two proteins also showed the highest number of non canonical interactions suggesting higher structural_stability of proteins thus lending_support to the d cation interaction_energy and g structure stability profiles finally to validate the strength of stability predictions we performed tests that examine instability of these proteins the instability index indicates whether a protein would be unstable in vivo the instability index of is considered as a good evidence of stability interestingly eka sequence exhibited the lowest instability followed by eka eka and eka overall this study suggests that eka and eka are the two most promising pseudogenes for artificial expression into proteins experiments have been started to validate these predictions it would be interesting to see how cell responds to deliberate expression of sequences that nature decided to switch off given the context dependency and emergent properties arising from protein interactions it would be interesting to see the experimental outcome of artificial pseudogene expression
