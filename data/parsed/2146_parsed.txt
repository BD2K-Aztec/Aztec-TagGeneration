systems_biology guildify a web_server for phenotypic characterization of genes through biological data_integration and network based prioritization algorithms determining genetic_factors underlying various phenotypes is hindered by the involvement of multiple genes acting cooperatively over the past_years diseasegene prioritization has been central to identify genes implicated in human_disorders special_attention has been paid on using physical_interactions between the proteins encoded by the genes to link them with diseases such methods exploit the guilt by association principle in the protein_interaction to uncover novel diseasegene associations these methods rely on the proximity of a gene in the network to the genes associated with a phenotype and require a set of initial associations here we present guildify an easy to use web_server for the phenotypic characterization of genes guildify offers a prioritization approach based on the proteinprotein_interaction where the initial phenotypegene associations are retrieved via free_text search on biological_databases guildify web_server does not restrict the prioritization to any predefined phenotype supports multiple species and accepts user specified genes it also prioritizes drugs based on the ranking of their targets unleashing opportunities for repurposing drugs for novel therapies availability_and available online atduring the past_decade diseasegene prioritization has been central to research_efforts in the field of human_genetics the promise of suggesting novel associations for genetic_disorders with implications to therapeutical improvements has yielded a broad_spectrum of computational_tools special_attention has been paid on using physical_interactions between the products of these genes to associate them with diseases methods using proteinprotein_interactions ppis exploit the guilt by association principle over the network_topology to uncover new diseasegene associations the guilt by association principle suggests that the genes_whose proteins interact with the products of known disease genes are more likely to be disease genes recently we proposed three novel algorithms for genome_wide prioritization of disease genes using ppi_networks and showed that a consensus method_combining these algorithms improved the prioritization when using the diseasegene associations in online mendalian inheritance in man omim database combined with genomics and proteomics_data the method has been successfully used to identify a gene driving metastasis to bone in breast_cancer available network based prioritization_tools use either disease gene_annotations from omim database or a set of genes provided by the user as initial associations seed genes these tools typically output the prioritization for a set of candidate_genes genes lying under a given genomic interval a set of user provided genes or top ranking genes several hundred at most furthermore some of these tools are accessible only through cytoscape as a plugin publicly_available biological data_repositories can also be used for mining initial phenotypegene associations required by network based prioritization methods without restricting to any predefined phenotype or candidates considering the limited availability of convenient interfaces that bridge network based prioritization algorithms we present guildify an interactomebased prioritization server for phenotype based characterization guildify retrieves initial phenotypegene associations seeds via free_text search on biological_databases and ranks the proteins in the interaction_network for their relevance to the phenotype when the queried species is homo_sapiens guildify provides a ranking of the drugs related to the phenotype based on the ranking of their targets phenotypic characterization of genes plays_a in explaining the mechanisms behind biological_processes we have developed guildify a free and easy to use web_server for prioritization of genes using ppi_networks for a given phenotype guildify uses descriptive fields in several proteomics and genomics databases in combination with network based prioritization methods and provides an interactome wide ranking the ranking represents the relevance to the phenotype of interest and can be used to short list the set of candidate_genes that need to be further validated or to repurpose drugs e g through common high_ranking targets
