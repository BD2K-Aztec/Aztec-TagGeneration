genetics_and icall a genotype_calling algorithm for rare low_frequency and common_variants on the illumina exome array motivation next generation genotyping microarrays have been designed with insights from genomes_project and whole exome_sequencing these arrays additionally include variants that are typically present at lower_frequencies determining the genotypes of these variants from hybridization intensities is challenging because there is less support to locate the presence of the minor alleles when the allele counts are low existing algorithms are mainly designed for calling common_variants and are notorious for failing to generate accurate calls for low_frequency and rare_variants here we introduce a new calling algorithm icall to call genotypes for variants across the whole spectrum of allele_frequencies results we benchmarked icall against four of the most commonly used algorithms gencall opticall illuminus and genosnp as well as a post_processing caller zcall that adopted a two stage calling design normalized hybridization intensities for individuals genotyped on the illumina humanexome beadchip were considered of which individuals were also whole_genome sequenced the sequence calls were used to benchmark the accuracy of the genotype_calling and our comparisons indicated that icall outperforms all four single stage calling algorithms in terms of call rates and concordance particularly in the calling accuracy of minor alleles which is the principal concern for rare and low_frequency variants the application of zcall to post process the output from icall also produced marginally improved_performance to the combination of zcall and gencall availability_and icall is implemented in c for use on linux operating_systems and is available for download atstatistical algorithms have automated the process of calling the genotypes in large_scale microarray genotyping where up to million variants can be assayed simultaneously this process has been predominantly applied to probes that query two possible allelic outcomes at a genomic variant generically defined as allele a and allele b and the degree of hybridization to each of the two alleles is reflected by the fluorescence_intensity translating both sets of allelic hybridization intensities thus allow discrete decisions to be made with respect to whether the genotype of a sample at a particular single_nucleotide snp should be aa ab or bb occasionally when the hybridization intensities do not offer sufficient support for one of the discrete calls a null call can be made which is subsequently treated as missing numerous algorithms have been developed to call genotypes for earlier generations of microarrays on both the affymetrix and illumina platforms they can be broadly classified into five categories i single sample single snp_calling such as the dynamic_model where only the intensity_measurements at each snp are considered disregarding whether there were other samples genotyped at the same time ii multi sample single snp_calling such as the gencall in the proprietary software beadstudio and genomestudio and illuminus where the intensity_measurements at each snp across multiple samples are jointly considered in a cluster_analysis framework to learn about genotype cluster characteristics before making the calls iii single sample multi snp_calling such as genosnp which does not rely on parameters derived from multiple samples iv hybrid calling such as opticall where a prior_distribution is generated using multi sample and multi snp data even though the actual calling is performed within each snp and v linkage_disequilibrium aware calling such as mams and the approach by browning and colleagues where the signal_intensities from multiple_snps are jointly evaluated using the correlation_structure between snps to improve the accuracy of the calls early generations of genotyping microarrays prioritized tagging_snps identified from the international_hapmap that are selected on their ability to provide adequate coverage of the human_genome in the hapmap populations and are typically common_snps with minor_allele maf that exceeded the design of nextgeneration genotyping microarrays has been guided by the data from the genomes_project and other whole exome_sequencing to increase genome_coverage and to include low_frequency and rare_variants defined as snps with maf to whom correspondence should be addressed between and and snps with maf respectively that are often ancestry specific although genotype_calling for these next generation arrays similarly relied on translating the hybridization intensities and b the lower allele frequency_spectrum of the majority of these snps presents a significantly different challenge where only a small fraction of the samples is heterozygous and there is usually no homozygous cluster for the alternate allele and d this can thwart algorithms that perform multi sample calling as these algorithms regardless of whether they are maximum likelihood_based or rely on bayesian_models often set out to locate three genotype clusters shifts in the positions of the genotype clusters due to intrinsic hybridization chemistry for a fraction of the snps can compound the problem of multi sample genotype_calling and f in recognition of the challenges associated with calling the genotypes for rare snps a novel stage calling strategy zcall was introduced to post process the genotype_calls from a default calling algorithm such as gencall this relied on calibrating the positions of the other two genotype clusters on the basis of the dominant homozygous cluster to improve the accuracy and call rate in practice the genotypes for bulk of the snps can be accurately_determined with straightforward rules in partitioning the distinctively different hybridization intensities however snps with lower maf or with shifted intensities will not conform to these simple rules and instead require more sophisticated_statistical strategies to accurately call genotypes here we introduce a new genotype_calling strategy for illumina arrays icall which performs multi sample calling at a single snp to improve accuracy across the full allele frequency_spectrum this algorithm adopts the classical three component students t mixture_model framework that illuminus adopts but focuses on deriving appropriate penalties to find the best seeding parameters to initialize the expectationmaximization em procedure to recognize the variety of situations where calling becomes difficult such as when i the maf is low ii the total number of samples for joint calling is small or iii the hybridization intensities deviate substantially from usual our method icall is benchmarked against four of the most commonly used single stage algorithms opticall illuminus genosnp and gencall as well as different iterations of two stage calling with zcall with a large dataset of samples that have been genotyped on the illumina exome chip where samples have been additionally whole_genome sequenced on illumina_hiseq at a deep coverage of fold the sequencing calls for these samples were used to derive a set of gold_standard calls for calculating calling accuracy our algorithm has been implemented in a c program that is available for public access the performance of icall was compared against four single stage genotype_calling gencall opticall illuminus and genosnp intensity data were available for samples that have been genotyped on the illumina exome chip of which samples came from the singapore integrative omics project iomics and samples came from multiple complex disease studies that are being carried_out at the genome institute of singapore to compare the performance of different genotype_calling we need to derive a set of gold_standard calls that we subsequently assumed to be perfect for benchmarking the genotype_calls made by different algorithms of the iomics samples samples have been additionally whole_genome sequenced to a target_coverage of fold as part of the singapore sequencing studies http www statgen nus edu sg and the sequence calls after quality checks for these samples were regarded as the gold_standard calls that were subsequently used to benchmark the performance of the different methods a total of snps were present on the exome chip that overlapped with the polymorphic_variants identified from the high_coverage these snps were classified as common maf snps low_frequency maf snps and rare maf snps according to the gencall genotypes for all samples to evaluate how the number of samples available for joint calling impacts the algorithms we thinned the dataset into four smaller sets with and samples which always included the samples with gold_standard calls note that gencall genotypes were available for the iomics samples and samples independently and genosnp is a singlesample caller where the performance is not affected by the size of the available samples the performance of icall gencall opticall illuminus and genosnp is evaluated using five metrics i call rate defined as the percentage of valid genotype_calls that are not assigned as null ii concordance defined as the percentage of valid genotype_calls that are identical to the gold_standard calls iii overall concordance defined as the percentage of genotype_calls out of all possible calls that are identical to the gold_standard calls and is calculated as the product of the call rate and the concordance iv minor_allele concordance for rare and low_frequency snps defined as the percentage of the heterozygous and minor allelehomozygous calls that are identical to the gold_standard calls out of the total number of such calls made for these snps and v missed minor_allele call rate defined as the percentage of the heterozygous and minor_allele homozygous calls that are not identified out of the total number of available minor_allele calls in the gold_standard the last two metrics effectively evaluate the true_positive and false_negative for making a genotype call involving at least one minor_allele at a rare or low_frequency snp the calculations of all five metrics are made using only the samples for which there are gold_standard calls available on the basis of call rates and concordance with the gold_standard calls icall yielded the highest overall concordance_rate and call rate regardless of the sample_size we observed that gencall yielded the highest concordance_rate but tend to be more conservative at making calls but still managed to deliver an overall concordance_rate that was consistently higher than the performance by opticall the performance of illuminus and genosnp were comparatively less satisfactory with genosnp yielding an overall concordance_rate that was below when evaluating the ability to correctly call genotypes carrying at least one copy of the minor_allele that is present in the dataset at a frequency icall consistently yields the highest_accuracy and the lowest missed allele calls compared with gencall opticall illuminus and genosnp at low_frequency snps for example icall achieved a minor_allele concordance_rate of and at the sample_sizes of and respectively compared with opticall at and respectively and the next best performing algorithm gencall at on the basis of samples at rare snps icall similarly delivered the highest minor_allele concordance_rates across all sample_sizes considered at least with all other methods delivering concordance this suggests that whenever icall made a call involving a minor_allele it was more likely to be correct than existing algorithms however a high minor_allele concordance can be achieved by a conservative algorithm that only calls the easy to call minor_allele genotypes but misses out on most of the genuine minor_allele calls we additionally evaluated the extent that each caller is missing genuine minor_allele calls for low_frequency snps icall consistently exhibited the lowest missed minor_allele call rate with a maximum of compared with for gencall and for opticall with samples however for rare snps icall was more conservative and made less minor_allele genotype_calls than opticall especially when the sample_size is large missed minor_allele call rate of and for icall and opticall respectively although the genotype_calls by icall are much more likely to be correct concordance of by icall versus by opticall as the number of samples available for joint calling increases opticall appears to be more liberal at making minor_allele calls whereas icall appears to be stable gencall illuminus and genosnp consistently performed_poorly when measured with these two minor_allele metrics zcall is a post_processing caller that uses intensities and genotypes generated from a stand alone caller as input_data we also compared the performance of gencallzcall opticallzcall and icallzcall the results indicated that zcall always improved the genotype_calls generated from all the three callers with the greatest degree of improvement observed for gencall genotypes across all snps gencallzcall yielded marginally_higher overall concordance_rates and at sample_sizes of and respectively compared with those by icallzcall and respectively however at low_frequency and rare snps icallzcall outperformed gencallzcall delivering higher concordance_rates and lower missed call rates for minor_allele genotypes opticallzcall exhibited the same characteristics as opticall where it is more aggressive in calling minor_allele genotypes but at the expense of making more erroneous calls we have introduced icall a method for calling genotypes that yields comparatively better performance than existing genotype_calling particularly in accurately calling the genotypes involving minor alleles at low_frequency or rare snps one important aspect of genotype_calling is that determining the genotypes accurately is straightforward for the majority of the snps but there are snps where the maf are considerably_lower or when the hybridization profiles differ from the usual that require more robust considerations to accurately determine the genotypes our method improves on the framework of illuminus by using a series of penalty functions to identify the optimum parameters to seed the em model the availability of a large dataset that has been genotyped on the exome chip meant that we can evaluate the performance of existing algorithms across different sample_sizes we have benchmarked the genotype_calls obtained from different methods against a set of gold_standard calls that was derived from deep_sequencing as a stand alone caller icall performs the best in terms of delivering the most accurate genotype_calls while minimizing the number of missed calls particularly for genotypes involving minor alleles at low_frequency and rare snps the better performance at low_frequency and rare snpswas similarly observed when icall was incorporated as part of a two stage calling process with zcall we have compared icall against existing_methods using two additional metrics that specifically focused on the ability to call the genotypes that involved at least one minor_allele at rare and low_frequency snps this is in line with the intended purpose of the exome microarray for finding low_frequency or rare snps that are associated with phenotypes measuring how accurately and sensitively a calling algorithm can call a heterozygous or minor_allele homozygous genotype is thus more important after all an algorithm that erroneously calls a rare snp as major allele monomorphic will have attained a concordance of at least in quantifying the association evidence at rare or low_frequency snps it is common to pool allele counts across similar snps in a genomic_region to assess allelic burden erroneously calling the presence of a minor_allele genotype or the failure to call a minor_allele genotype when it exists can thus directly impact the power and false_positive of the association_analyses automated algorithms for calling genotypes have contributed to the success of large_scale genomic studies and this is likely to continue with the continuous introduction of next generation genotyping microarrays designed with knowledge gained from large_scale sequencing studies querying up to million snps across the genome or variants found specifically in the exons although these technologies_provide the opportunity to investigate new hypotheses on the evolution of the human_genome and the genetic_etiology of diseases and traits this can only happen if the content in the human_genome can be accurately_determined we have introduced a calling algorithm that provides a better ability at accurately calling genotypes for rare and low_frequency snps and consistently performs well at common_snps
