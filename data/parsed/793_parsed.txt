databases_and blad a comprehensive database of widely circulated beta_lactamases motivation beta_lactamases confer resistance to a broad range of antibiotics and inhibitors by accumulating mutations the number of beta_lactamases and their variants is steadily_increasing the horizontal_gene likely plays_a in dissemination of these markers to new environments and hosts moreover information about the beta_lactamase classes and their variants was scattered categorizing all these classes and their associated variants along with their epidemiology and resistance pattern information on one platform could be helpful to the researcher working on multidrug_resistant thus the beta_lactamase database blad has been developed to provide comprehensive_information epidemiology and resistance pattern on beta_lactamases beta_lactamase gene sequences in blad are linked with structural data phenotypic_data i e antibiotic_resistance and literature references to experimental_studies in summary blad integrates_information that may provide insight into the epidemiology of multidrug_resistance and enable the designing of novel drug_candidates availability the database can be accessed from the website www blad co in beta_lactamases are one of the major causes of resistance against beta_lactam carbapenem_resistant enterobacteriaceae has been increased in bacterial_strains isolated from nosocomial_infections in past_years based on the sequence the beta_lactamases are divided_into four classes ad class a c and d are serine beta_lactamases whereas class b enzymes are metallo beta_lactamases class a provides the most commonly_encountered mechanism of bacterial resistance_to it appears to be the most widely_distributed class of beta_lactamases and capable of hydrolyzing penicillins and classical cephalosporins the genes of class b beta_lactamases are implicated in the hydrolysis of cephalosporins and carbapenems and are located on both chromosomes and plasmids some of the most prevalent class b enzymes include imp vim ndm and spn the ndm was a recent addition to this class which was isolated from a patient hospitalized in india another class of enzyme is a serine hydrolyzing class c belonging to the cephalosporinases family which confers resistance to broad_spectrum cephalosporin including cefoxime and ceftazidime some of the most prevalent enzymes of this class are ampc cmy acc produced by gram_negative the enzyme oxa beta_lactamases belongs to class d and oxa type beta_lactamases have been characterized so_far several recent efforts thai and pleiss have been made to partially unify the information about the beta_lactamases with limited functionalities the main limitation of such resources is lack of information for all types of beta_lactamases class thus to address these limitations and to facilitate the characterization of these beta_lactamases we have integrated sequence structural and experimental information on a common platform although the information available in the previously_published resources are useful such resources do not provide the information for all types of beta_lactamases moreover other resources lack the information about the d structures and inhibitors resistance profile of the beta_lactamases beta_lactamase database blad represents the most extensive catalog for maximum type of beta_lactamases class ad along with other unique features such as search by source country type variant along with local_alignment restriction_enzyme analysis tools which are lacking in previously_published databases of this kind hence our annotated and updated database will provide broad information to the researchers
