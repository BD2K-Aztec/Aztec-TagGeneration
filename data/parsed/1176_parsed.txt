systems_biology correcting for link loss in causal network_inference caused by regulator interference motivation there are a number of algorithms to infer causal regulatory_networks from time_series here we analyse the phenomena of regulator interference where regulators with similar dynamics mutually suppress both the probability of regulating a target and the associated link strength for instance interference between two identical strong regulators reduces link probabilities by results we construct a robust method to define an interference corrected causal network based on an analysis of the conditional link probabilities that recovers links lost through interference on a large real network streptomyces_coelicolor phosphate depletion we demonstrate that significant interference can occur between regulators with a correlation as low as losing an estimated of links by interference however levels of interference cannot be predicted from the correlation between regulators alone and are data specific validating against known networks we show that high numbers of functional links are lost by regulator interference performance against other methods on dream data is excellent availability_and the method is implemented in r and is publicly_available as the niacs package at http www warwick ac uk fac sci systemsbiology research software the falling costs of global gene_expression transcriptome measurement by microarrays and more recently next_generation has spurred the development of network_inference techniques of particular interest given their direct bearing on mechanisms of regulation and information_flow through the cell is the identification of causal regulatory_signals the associated directed causal networks and regulatory_pathways time series experiments potentially capture these signals but because of low temporal_resolution of transcriptome_data only simple models can be used for analysis the most basic is a linear auto regression_model where x t i is the log expression_level of gene i i g at time t t t b ij is the connectivity strength i the additive constant and t i gaussian_noise n i precision i despite the simplicity of these models inference is computationally_intensive given the high number of regressors expression data on s of genes is typical depending on the experimental_conditions and organism and potentially greater if gene models rna_splicing transcripts are distinguished a factor that considerably aids identification of regulatory links in these systems is the fact that biological_networks are sparse i e the connectivity matrix b b ij is sparse with the average number of regulators per gene being much smaller than the number of genes part of this sparsity results from the fact that only a subset of genes more specifically their associated proteins can be regulators the set of potential_regulators can thus be restricted a priori to those identified from bioinformatic literature considerations as potential_regulators thereby reducing computation considerably sparse network models use gibbs variable_selection methods to determine which elements of the matrix b are present in the regression specifically the prior on b ij allows it to be zero with finite probability the indicator ij f g of a link j i determines if b ij is non zero when ij while b ij if ij the indicator is modelled as a bernoulli distribution with a prior probability of being non zero ij j ber ij j while has a beta prior b ej let d denote the time_series fx t i g and the model_parameters f i i ij b ij g the likelihood is then given bythe associated posterior can then be sampled using the bioconductor_package grenits http www bioconductor org_packages bioc html grenits html in network models interference has a direct bearing on the posterior_probability of links being present specifically in these to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work sparse network models ij j d is reduced if there is another regulator k with similar dynamics to j in the case of an exact identity between the dynamics of j and k there are three identical regression_models ij ik ij ik and ij ik and thus the probability of any one and therefore of ij j d is reduced the relative weighting of these three states is determined by the prior link probability which is low in sparse networks thereby downweighting the double link case therefore only the two states ij ik and ij ik need to be considered effectively halving ij jd relative to the case when k is excluded from the network proof in section a key problem is gauging when regulators might interfere specifically how interference decreases with a diminishing correlation between these regulators and thus deciding how to select which regulators to use in the regression failing to deal with this appropriately means that key_regulators might be missed because they are part of a correlated set of regulators and their link probabilities fall below threshold through mutual interference we developed a framework for solving this problem based on the analysis of conditional posterior link probabilities that identifies the interfering sets of regulators this allowed us to define an interference corrected causal network and further the relative_weights of the interfering regulators reflecting their likely contribution to the control of a given gene the article is organized as follows in section we analyse the impact of identical regulators on network links demonstrating that the link probabilities of identical strong regulators are essentially additive we give a numerical demonstration of the theory on an augmented experimental dataset doubling up a key_regulator in section we develop a framework to correct for interference in network construction a post_processing step that clusters regulators and calculates regulator interference within clusters for each target in section we illustrate our method on three experimental_datasets that give rise to networks with distinct architectures and demonstrate that interference is data specific there being no simple relationship between interference and regulator correlation further we provide evidence that the recovered links are functional in section we discuss the impact of these issues and the generality to other inference fitting methods in this article we have proposed a method for dealing with the problem of regulators with similar dynamics suppressing causal link signals in the auto regression_model equation by analysis of the level of interference between highly_correlated regulators computed from the posterior conditional link probabilities we are able to correct for link suppression by near identical regulators and thus recover regulator links that would otherwise be lost because their posterior link probabilities are reduced below threshold we defined an icn n that includes as a subnetwork the original network n i e our method only adds links lost by interference the icn is defined at the value of the correlation threshold where interfering regulators are judged to be optimally clustered as measured by a score that sums over weighted links our score punished clustering of inconsistent regulators through a lack of mutual interference or no interference our approach avoids a subjective subselection of the set of predefined regulators i e all regulators should be included in the inference in absence of prior information and by a postprocessing step interference is corrected in effect we are assuming that there are potentially multiple regulators for a target but network_inference is hampered by insufficient dynamic data to separate signals from individual regulators with similar dynamics determining whether there are two true regulators as opposed to one is not possible without additional experimental_data e g experiments under conditions where the regulators have distinct dynamics or conducting experiments with strains where either regulator is expressed under an inducible promotor our method crucially prevents loss of both regulators from the inferred network we demonstrated that the recovered links for phop and the arabidopsis circadian_clock are functional with precision at least as good as that for the predicted links in a comparison against other network_inference on simulated_data dream grenits is already highly_competitive while performance is further improved when coupled with niacs to correct for regulator interference the area under precision_recall curve increasing on average by supplementary most of the improvement is in the crucial high_confidence predictions supplementary niacs outperformed the other methods in of cases for the icn n we assign the link probability as the maximum of the posterior link probability and the conditional_probability if applicable however we do not expect the conditional_probability ij jd ik k cr s nfjg to truly reflect the probability of regulator j regulating i as this is dependent on the clustering set cr s in essence if there are multiple regulators they all affect the dynamics if on and a true measure of their regulatory_effects is in the presence of the other regulators therefore we recommend that links arising from interference remain distinguished because their probabilities are corrected and thus a direct comparison with links may be misleading however the relative weighting within a cluster of regulators according to their conditional posterior_probabilities is a reflection of the evidence in the data as to the identity of the true regulator the identity of this true regulator may also be discerned by using additional experiments or gene_annotations these data can also be used as prior information in grenits restricting allowable links thereby removing some of the regulator ambiguity our analysis on three real_datasets demonstrated that interference is not simply a function of regulator correlation in the phosphate depletion causal network example for two highly_correlated regulators we found a spread of interference among their targets comprising a set of targets on which interference is mutual whereas other targets have only a sole regulator despiteregulator interference their high correlation interference is thus heterogeneous on the set of targets these observations mean that interference must be analysed on a per experiment per target basis and the optimal correlation threshold determined in each case in addition to regulator interference we also observed another phenomenon in our networks whereby two or more regulators enhance the causal signals of each other specifically the regulators have elevated posterior link probabilities in the presence of each other we define pairwise synergistic regulators j k on target i as regulators with ij jd ik jd ij jd ik ik jd ij this definition can be easily generalized to the case of multiple regulators causal signal synergy between regulators was rare with and synergistic regulators in examples and respectively supplementary we emphasize that neither interference nor synergy between the causal signals implies that a mechanistic interference synergy exists link suppression enhancement from interference synergy in our context arises because of similarity correlation in the regulator dynamics interference between dynamically similar regulators in causal network_inference is a general_problem it will occur in any statistical_hypothesis methodology for the model in equation for instance as the weights b ij in equation are suppressed under interference and their variance increases under a lack of a posteriori identifiability any test for a non zero coefficient will be subject to loss of highly_correlated regulator links see section of supplementary_material in this article we have provided a methodology to recover missing suppressed links within a bayesian context through a post_processing of the network posterior samples
