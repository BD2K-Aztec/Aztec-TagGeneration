gene_expression inference of combinatorial boolean rules of synergistic gene_sets from cancer microarray_datasets motivation gene_set has become an important tool for the functional_interpretation of high_throughput gene_expression moreover pattern analyses based on inferred gene_set activities of individual samples have shown the ability to identify more robust disease signatures than individual gene based pattern analyses although a number of approaches have been proposed for gene_set based pattern analysis the combinatorial influence of deregulated gene_sets on disease phenotype classification has not been studied sufficiently results we propose a new approach for inferring combinatorial boolean rules of gene_sets for a better understanding of cancer transcriptome and cancer classification to reduce_the of the possible boolean rules we identify small groups of gene_sets that synergistically contribute to the classification of samples into their corresponding phenotypic groups such as normal and cancer we then measure the significance of the candidate boolean rules derived from each group of gene_sets the level of significance is based on the class entropy of the samples selected in accordance with the rules by applying the present approach to publicly_available prostate_cancer datasets we identified significant boolean rules finally we discuss several identified boolean rules such as the rule of glutathione metabolism down and prostaglandin_synthesis regulation down which are consistent with known prostate cancer_biology availability scripts written in python and r are available at http biosoft kaist ac kr ihpark the refined gene_sets and the full list of the identified boolean rules are provided in the supplementarywith the advent of microarray_technologies genome_wide gene_expression has become a crucial tool in biomedical_research during the past_few in cancer research genome_wide gene_expression has been used to discover new cancer_subtypes to develop gene_expression for cancer diagnosis prognosis or prediction of drug responsiveness potti to whom correspondence should be addressed and to identify cancer associated signaling_pathways or cellular_processes in a typical analysis of cancer gene_expression individual genes are ranked by the statistical_significance of the differential_expression between two different experimental_conditions several tens of top_ranked genes are then selected for further analysis such as cancer classification and functional_enrichment to investigate the combinatorial influences of deregulated genes on disease phenotype classification researchers have proposed a number of multivariate approaches however all of these individual gene based_approaches tend to produce unstable gene_lists or combinations of genes due to the small_sample used in individual studies a recently_developed type of gene_set aims to directly evaluate the statistical_significance of coordinated expression changes of genes belonging to specific pathways or functional_categories without selecting an arbitrary number of highly ranked genes in advance and the gene_sets are usually derived from the gene_ontology kyoto_encyclopedia kegg reactome and other knowledge bases these approaches have the ability to detect gene_sets whose constituent genes show subtle but coordinated expression changes which might not be detected by conventional functional enrichment_methods moreover several cancer classification approaches based on the gene_set activities inferred from individual samples perform better than other cancer classification approaches based on the expression levels of individual genes besides the gene_set based cancer classification approaches various other approaches to the study of interdependencies among gene_modules have been proposed proposed a module network for learning about transcriptionally coexpressed modules and their dependency_structure so that gene_expression in different types of cancer could be characterized that model differs from other gene_set dependency models in that it learns about the gene_modules and their dependency_structure simultaneously from data rather than frompage we have presented a method of inferring boolean rules of gene_sets from cancer microarray_datasets we first identified small_subsets of gene_sets that are synergistic we then enumerated all the possible conjunctive boolean functions of the gene_sets within each group of gene_sets and finally we evaluated the predictive powers of the boolean functions although several approaches have been proposed to reveal the boolean logic of individual_molecules our method is different with those methods in that we try to identify relevant_variables by using a synergy network before we search for the boolean rules we have identified and discussed several significant boolean rules of gene_sets that are frequently observed in prostate_cancer our results show the possibility of using boolean rules of gene_sets for cancer classification and the identified boolean rules provide insights into the combinatorial influences of deregulated gene_sets on cancer developments the coverage of gene_set increases as the information on pathway interactions is accumulated thus further research directions should include the pathway interaction information for the dissection of coherent submodules in a gene_set
