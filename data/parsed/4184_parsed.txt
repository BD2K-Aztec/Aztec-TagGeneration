gene_expression semi_supervised improves gene_expression based prediction of cancer_recurrence motivation gene_expression has_shown in outcome_prediction for different types of cancers nevertheless small_sample remains a bottleneck in obtaining robust and accurate classifiers traditional supervised_learning techniques can only work with labeled data consequently a large number of microarray_data that do not have sufficient follow_up information are disregarded to fully leverage all of the precious data in public_databases we turned to a semi_supervised technique low_density separation lds results using a clinically_important question of predicting recurrence_risk in colorectal_cancer patients we demonstrated that i semi supervised_classification improved prediction_accuracy as compared with the state of the art supervised method svm ii performance_gain increased with the number of unlabeled samples iii unlabeled data from different institutes could be employed after appropriate processing and iv the lds method is robust with regard to the number of input_features to test the general applicability of this semi_supervised method we further applied lds on human breast_cancer datasets and also observed superior_performance our results demonstrated great_potential of semi_supervised in gene_expression based outcome_prediction for cancer patients a major_challenge in clinical_cancer is the prediction of prognosis at the time of tumor discovery accurate outcome_prediction can help guide the selection of appropriate therapy for each individual patient for example if patients can be accurately assigned to a low_risk or a high_risk subgroup based on whether the disease would relapse within a certain amount of time after tumor_resection adjuvant_chemotherapy ctx can be administered to high_risk patients while low_risk patients might forgo this toxic treatment microarray_based gene_expression has showed great_potential in outcome_prediction for different types of cancers to whom correspondence should be addressed nevertheless small_sample remains a bottleneck in obtaining robust and accurate prediction_models the number of samples in microarray_based cancer studies is usually small because microarray_experiments are time consuming expensive and limited by sample availability for outcome_prediction sample_size is further reduced significantly by the availability of follow_up data for the analyzed samples in fact in publicly_available gene_expression databases such as the gene_expression geo only a small fraction of human tumor gene_expression provide clinical follow_up data gene_expression data based outcome_prediction usually relies on traditional supervised_learning techniques in which only labeled data i e data from samples with clinical follow_up can be used for learning while unlabeled data i e data from samples without clinical follow_up are disregarded recent_studies in machine_learning suggest that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with limited amount of labeled data can produce considerable improvement in learning accuracy a technique called semi_supervised indeed semisupervised learning has proved to be effective in solving different biological_problems including protein classification peptide_identification in shotgun_proteomics prediction of transcription factorgene interaction and gene_expression based cancer subtype discovery because semi_supervised is able to use a large number of unlabeled microarray_data in conjunction with some labeled data we hypothesize that this technique can be used to improve gene_expression based classification of human cancer different algorithms for semi supervised_classification have been proposed and many successful algorithms directly_or rely on the assumption that the decision boundary should not cross high_density regions but lie in low_density regions usually called cluster assumption this can be illustrated by comparing the well known support_vector svm to its semi_supervised extension transductive svm tsvm the goal of a standard svm is to maximize the margin around the decision boundary of the labeled data to enable robust classification in a tsvm in addition to the original goal of svm unlabeled data are used to guide the boundary away from dense regions by finding a hyperplane that is far away from the unlabeled data_points finding the exact tsvm solution is np_hard therefore several approximation algorithms have beenproposed in this article we aimed to develop and evaluate semi_supervised classifiers for human_cancers based on one of the most successful semi_supervised classification_method low_density separation lds we started with the prediction of relapse_free for stage i through iii colorectal_cancer crc patients based on gene_expression of primary_tumors colorectal_carcinoma is the third most commonly occurring noncutaneous carcinoma and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in the usa although clinical_trials have showed clear benefit of adjuvant ctx for stage_iii patients of stage_iii patients enrolled in surgery only groups did not recur in years even without adjuvant_treatment on the other hand while clinical_trials have failed to show the benefit of adjuvant ctx when applied to unselected stage_ii patients some studies suggest that a subset of high_risk stage_ii patients may benefit from adjuvant_therapy moreover although the standard treatment for stage i patients requires no adjuvant_treatment after surgery about of stage i cancer will recur therefore an accurate and reliable method that identifies high_risk stages i and ii patients and low_risk stage_iii patients could improve the selection of individualized_therapy using five crc gene_expression from the geo database we demonstrated that i semi supervised_classification improved prediction_accuracy as compared with the state of the art supervised method svm ii performance_gain increased with the number of unlabeled samples iii unlabeled data from different institutes could be employed after appropriate processing and iv the lds method is robust with regard to the number of input_features to test the general applicability of the semi_supervised method we further applied it on human breast_cancer datasets and demonstrated_superior accuracy as compared with svm the present study was designed to address the small_sample problem in gene_expression based outcome_prediction for human_cancers as compared with svm the semi_supervised lds
