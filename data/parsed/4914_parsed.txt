what handedness and angles between helices has the studied three helical protein domain we have created a new server foldhandedness using this server it is possible i to define the regions of helices from two issues from the pdb_file and using the last version of the dssp program ii to determine the handedness for any chosen three helices and iii to calculate the angle and sign between the chosen pairs of the helices for large proteins and complexes of proteins with dna or rna recently the role of a mirror_image conformation as a subtle effect in protein_folding has been considered the understanding of chirality both in protein_structures and amyloid suprastructures is an important issue in molecular_biology now chiral amino_acids form chiral helices that selfassemble into structural_domains the left_handed beta helix was a dogma during years it should be noted that the left_handed beta helix has a more regular structure than the right_handed helix and the first may be implicated in the formation of amyloid aggregates for example the prion_protein we are the first who have demonstrated that folding optimization depends not only on the secondary_structure but also on the handedness of a helices left_handed three helical domains have the fastest folding_rates in comparison with right_handed threehelical domains among eight proteins with known experimental folding_rates when studying the mechanical_properties of these eight domains under stretching at a constant speed and at a constant force on the atomic_level it has been demonstrated using molecular_dynamics simulations that the right_handed three helix domains are more resistant mechanically than the lefthanded domains we explained this fact by that the right_handed domains have a larger number of contacts per residue than the left_handed domains moreover from our analysis we have revealed that bacterial three helix proteins have some advantages in packing over eukaryotic right_handed three helix proteins which should result in faster folding identification of protein handedness raises the question how to determine this value for some domains this value is not evident here we present a server able to calculate this value the packing angle and the sign between all helices for any large protein consisting of alpha_helices for prediction of handedness the user should choose a d structure using a standard symbol pdb code or use a home pdb_file from md_simulations and choose three helices from the same chain
