gene_expression biological impact of missing_value on downstream_analyses of gene_expression motivation microarray_experiments frequently produce multiple missing_values mvs due to flaws such as dust scratches insufficient resolution or hybridization errors on the chips unfortunately many downstream algorithms require a complete data matrix the motivation of this work is to determine the impact of mv imputation on downstream_analysis and whether ranking of imputation_methods by imputation_accuracy correlates well with the biological impact of the imputation methods using eight datasets for differential_expression de and classification analysis and eight datasets for gene clustering we demonstrate the biological impact of missing_value on statistical downstream_analyses including three commonly_employed de methods four classifiers and three gene clustering_methods correlation between the rankings of imputation_methods based on three root_mean rmse measures and the rankings based on the downstream_analysis methods was used to investigate which rmse measure was most consistent with the biological impact measures and which downstream_analysis methods were the most sensitive to the choice of imputation procedure results de was the most sensitive to the choice of imputation procedure while classification was the least sensitive and clustering was intermediate between the two the logged rmse lrmse measure had the highest correlation with the imputation rankings based on the de results indicating that the lrmse is the best representative surrogate among the three rmse based measures bayesian principal_component and least_squares adaptive appeared to be the best performing methods in the empirical downstream evaluation gene_expression data obtained from microarray_experiments are usually peppered with missing_values mvs that occur from a variety of reasons even though the technology has been improved over the past_decade mv imputation remains a necessary key_step in data preprocessing randomly scattered mvs may be due to spotting problems poor hybridization inadequate resolution fabrication errors or contaminants on the chip including scratches dust and fingerprints these mvs are usually flagged by absent present calls in the affymetrix platform detection p values in the illumina system or other outlier detection_algorithms in cdna arrays since many downstream_analyses require a complete dataset for implementation mv imputation is a common practice many mv imputation_methods have been developed in the literature all these methods are based on the fact that genes do not function individually but are usually highly_correlated with co regulated_genes mv imputation_methods generally belong to two categories in the first category expression information of a missing entry is borrowed from neighboring genes whose closeness is determined by a distance measure e g correlation euclidean_distance famous local methods in this category include k nearest_neighbors knn ordinary_least ols least_squares adaptive lsa and local least_squares lls for the second category dimension_reduction techniques are applied to decompose the data matrix and iteratively reconstruct the missing entries singular_value svd partial_least pls and bayesian principal_component bpca belong to this global method category in most methodological papers evaluations comparing relatively few mv imputation_methods in a small number of datasets are commonly seen this can result in over optimism of the newly_developed algorithm an issue that has been recently discussed in the issue of whether an overall best mv imputation method exists or which mv imputation method is best suited to a given dataset was not clear until a recent comprehensive comparative_study by they investigated the mv imputation performance of eight popular_methods in various types of datasets time series multiple exposure and time series multiple exposure and concluded that no universally best mv imputation method exists although three top methods lsa lls and bpca consistently performed among the best they further proposed an entropy based selection scheme that predicts performance of local based knn ols lsa and lls versus global based pls svd and bpca mv imputation_methods in different kinds of data_structures classified by an entropypage
