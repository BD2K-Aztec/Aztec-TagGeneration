gene_expression single_feature polymorphism detection using recombinant_inbred microarray_expression motivation the affymetrix_genechip microarray is currently providing a high_density and economical platform for discovery of genetic_polymorphisms microarray_data for single_feature polymorphism sfp detection in recombinant_inbred rils can capitalize on the high_level of replication available for each locus in the ril population it was suggested that the binding_affinities from all of the rils would form a multimodal distribution for a sfp this motivated us to estimate the binding_affinities from the robust multi array analysis rma method and formulate the sfp detection problem as a hypothesis_testing problem i e testing whether the underlying distribution of the estimated binding_affinity eba values of a probe is unimodal or multimodal results we developed a bootstrap based hypothesis_testing procedure using the dip statistic our simulation_studies show that the proposed procedure can reach satisfactory detection_power with false_discovery controlled at a desired_level and is robust to the unimodal distribution assumption which facilitates wide_application of the proposed procedure our analysis of the real_data identified more than four times the sfps compared to the previous_studies covering of their findings the constructed genetic_map using the sfp markers predicted from our procedure shows over concordance of the genetic orders of these markers with their known physical locations on the genome_sequence availability the r package dipsfp can be downloaded fromin the past_decade affymetrix_genechip microarrays have provided an important and versatile_tool for many genome studies this technology uses hybridization_probes which are comprised of hundreds of thousands of mer oligonucelotides chemically_synthesized on a solid substrate typically these probes or features are grouped into different probe_sets for different target_genes to whom correspondence should be addressed see affymetrix for more details since its introduction by affymetrix_genechip microarrays have been used extensively for genome_wide gene_expression analysis recently affymetrix_genechip microarrays have also been used for identifying genetic_polymorphisms on a variety of genomes in a highly_parallel manner such genetic_polymorphisms including single_nucleotide snps and small insertion deletions are detected by single probes on the array and therefore are called single_feature polymorphisms sfps the idea is that the sequence mismatch between a mer perfect match pm probe on the array and its target_sequence will significantly alter hybridization and attenuate that probes signal therefore the presence of sequence_polymorphisms in some pm probes will lead to detectable differences in those probes hybridization signals between the two different accessions one of which has similar sequences as the probe_sequences on the array since hundreds of thousands of probes can be analyzed at the same time the affymetrix_genechip microarrays are currently providing one of the most highly parallelized and economical platforms for genetic_polymorphism discovery facilitating the increasing need of highresolution genetic and physical_maps for genetic_studies for relatively small_genomes such as yeast arabidopsis and rice microarray_hybridization of genomic_dna has been a successful route to detect sfps for more complex genomes such as barley and cowpea crna samples have been successfully used as surrogates for dna samples to detect sfps in most of the microarray_based sfp detection studies usually only two or three biologically replicated dna or rna samples are extracted from each accession under comparison with so few replicates sfp detection suffers from either low detection_power or high false_positive however increasing biological_replicates simply for the purpose of sfp detection is generally cost prohibitive since ril expression microarrays are often available for expression quantitative_trait analysis proposed to use such data without extra cost for simultaneous sfp detection and ril genotyping they developed a metric for the binding_affinity called sfpdev and assumed that the sfpdev values of a sfp frompageall of the rils would form a bimodal_distribution where each peak represents a parental genotype then for each probe they sorted the sfpdev values in an increasing order and performed an empirical brute_force search for a gap value greater than two in the ratios of every two consecutive sfpdev values if such a gap was found for a probe and all sfpdev values of one parent fall on one side of the gap and all sfpdev values of the other parent fall on the other side of the gap then this probe is called a sfp obviously a simple ratio of two consecutive sfpdev values cannot fully characterize the distribution of sfpdev values from all of the rils and the searching method also lacks the statistical justification of false_positive control moreover it has been reported in the literature that most of sfps predicted from the sfpdev based analysis are gene expression_level polymorphisms rather than the genuine sequence_polymorphisms suggesting that the sfpdev is not independent of the gene expression_level in this article we formulate the sfp detection problem as a hypothesis_testing of unimodality versus multimodality and propose a bootstrap testing procedure to predict sfps based on the estimated binding_affinity eba values from the robust multi array analysis rma method our simulation_studies show that our procedure can reach a satisfactory detection_power with fdr controlled at the desired_level when there are sufficiently strong signal_intensities from the microarray_hybridization they also show that our procedure is robust to the unimodal distribution assumption which allows the broader application of our procedure our analysis of the ril datadetected more than four times as many sfps covering of that of the constructed genetic_map using the predicted sfps showed over concordance of the genetic positions with their known physical locations on genome_sequence to account for the binding_affinity from the pm intensity value we proposed the eba which is estimated by the tukeys median polish method from the rma model however in the real_data analysis we obtained the eba by dividing the pm value by the estimated expression_level since there were only two replicates for each ril and the estimate for the binding_affinity might not be reliable the performance of the eba was investigated in the real_data analysis compared to the low detection_power of sfpdev and high fdrs of indexes proposed in the eba showed the advantage of high detection_power and competitive fdr control because of the conservativeness of the fdr control procedure of the actual fdr from our procedure is usually smaller than the nominal fdr however in the real_data analysis a seemingly larger fdr was obtained this phenomenon has also been reported in the literature in additional to the binding_affinity and the gene expression_level many factors could affect the signals on the arrays and result in the sfp like probes that cannot be validated by the sequence_polymorphisms in our simulations where f i x is multimodal if and only if the probe i is a sfp our algorithm works well and the fdr is controlled at the nominal level note that the detection_power highly depends on the separation of two modes in the bimodal_distribution the low detection_power in our real_data analysis are mainly due to the poor bindings of the target_sequences that perfectly match to the probe_sequences on the array resulting in the modes not separatable the on going efforts on sfp technology including complexity reduction and gene enrichment of the target dna can potentially improve the detection_power of sfp detection this article is motivated by the sfp detection predominantly for homozygous ril populations where there are only two genotypes at most loci rejecting the null_hypothesis directly implies the sequence difference between those two genotypes in other settings there might be more than two possible genotypes resulting in bimodal trimodal or multimodal distribution of the eba values for a sfp the number of modes is of great interest for genotype identification which can then be formulated as the following hypothesis_testing
