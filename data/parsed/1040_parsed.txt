collaborative analysis of multi gigapixel imaging data using cytomine motivation collaborative analysis of massive imaging datasets is essential to enable scientific_discoveries results we developed cytomine to foster active and distributed collaboration of multidisciplinary_teams for large_scale image_based studies it uses web development methodologies and machine_learning in order to readily organize explore share and analyze semantically and quantitatively multi gigapixel imaging data over the internet we illustrate how it has been used in several bio medical_applications availability_and cytominein various scientific domains incl biology biomedicine astronomy botany geology paleobiology marine research aerobiology climatology projects leading to terabytes of multi gigapixel images become increasingly common the data deluge e g biomedical_research studies often rely on whole slide virtual microscopy or automated volume electron_microscopy in these fields significant advances could be made by multidisciplinary collaboration involving distributed groups of life_scientists and computer scientists exploiting large_scale image networks or eventually by enlisting the help of members of the general public in large imaging surveys through interactive games e g eyewire http eyewire org and brainflight http brainflight org projects for example researchers in experimental histology are willing to precisely annotate images and need to consult distant experts in pathology or molecular_biology developers of image_processing are willing to collaborate with machine_learning specialists to build complementary image_analysis workflows furthermore all these individuals need to actively collaborate to gain new insights e g computer scientists require realistic ground_truth and proofreadings ground_truth data cannot do it alone provided by life_scientists to design and refine their analysis methods vice_versa life_scientists increasingly rely on algorithms or crowdsourced outputs in combination with proofreading tools to enable efficient analysis of very large image sets bioimage_informatics aims at developing software to ease the analysis of large_scale biomaging data in recent_years several software have been developed including cellprofiler catmaid bisque ilastik icy fiji omero and bigdataviewer the proposed software and its algorithms have already been applied to a wide_variety of image types to accelerate discovery and to enable collaborative analysis these results encourage its exploitation in many domains however in practical_applications obtaining satisfactory recognition_performance using automatic algorithms depends on many factors including image variations e g due to image_acquisition and sample_preparation protocols and the quality and quantity of annotations provided for training see e g empirical evaluations in supplementary note although the combination of our algorithms and proof editing tools enabled to derive relevant quantification results in various applications it is important to note that further adaptation of algorithms or developing novel recognition algorithms might be needed for specific types of images or varying acquisition conditions a key_advantage of our platform is therefore its extensibility indeed our architecture enables computer scientists to add their novel software register them to the cytominecore and launch them from cytomine webui or from the command_line also annotation objects created by each instance of a software are stored in the database and are available through web_services these can then be subsequently proofread or retrieved through the api by other software for further analysis and creation of novel more precise annotation objects this allows to create complex image analysis_pipelines based on distributed software it has to be noted that although the software allows visualization of d image planes x y z c t current applications cited in section have involved independent analysis of d image planes only e g fluorescent image planes in and tissue_slices in using our api based on web_services one is able to extend the software by designing analysis algorithms that integrate d information if needed or to interoperate with existing software cytomine is a versatile software for collaborative analysis of multigigapixel images as already demonstrated by its various applications with our design choices we also believe our platform will facilitate accessibility curation and dissemination of imagingrelated data in the future it might be extended and tailored to support i the setup of large_scale multi centric image repositories or the emergence of an imaging data bazaar to enable new research_questions or validate results on larger cohorts ii the organization of image_analysis challenges on unprecedented benchmarks to foster image machine_learning research iii the crowdsourcing of image annotation tasks to tackle intractable datasets iv the dissemination of multi gigapixel imaging data and associated quantification results to support scientific claims of research_papers and v increase the reproducibility of scientific results by providing a platform where published results are available along the algorithms and the image data we have also started to derive the software for teaching purposes see supplementary note
