gene_expression generalized random set framework for functional_enrichment using primary genomics datasets motivation functional_enrichment using primary genomics datasets is an emerging approach to complement established methods for functional enrichment based on predefined lists of functionally_related currently used methods depend on creating lists of significant and non significant genes based on ad_hoc significance cutoffs this can lead to loss of statistical_power and can introduce biases affecting the interpretation of experimental_results results we developed and validated a new statistical_framework generalized random set grs analysis for comparing the genomic_signatures in two datasets without the need for gene categorization in our tests grs produced correct measures of statistical_significance and it showed dramatic_improvement in the statistical_power over other methods currently used in this setting we also developed a procedure for identifying genes driving the concordance of the genomics profiles and demonstrated a dramatic_improvement in functional coherence of genes identified in such analysis availability grs can be downloaded as part of the r package clean from http clusteranalysis org an online implementation is available at http genomicsportals org contact elucidating the functional significance of differences in gene_expression or of patterns of different gene_expression regulatory_events in the context of existing knowledge about gene function has not only become the most challenging but also the most rewarding aspect of the genomics data analysis the most commonly used strategy relies on sets of reference_lists containing functionally_related such as gene ontologies and kegg_pathways to identify functional_categories enriched by the differentially_regulated statistical_methods and computational procedures for identifying functionally_related sets of genes that are associated with new to whom correspondence should be addressed experimental_data have been studied in detail two basic approaches are used to establish statistical_significance of such enrichment the first approach relies on counting the number of genes in a given functional category that are also differentially_expressed and using the fishers exact or chi_squared to establish the statistical_significance of such overlaps the inherent limitation of this type of analysis is the requirement to choose statistical_significance cutoff levels for differential_expression this can reduce the statistical_power of the analysis and different threshold choices may in some situations lead to different enriched categories the second approach uses the complete distribution of differential expressions of all genes to identify enriched gene_lists without categorizing them into differentially and non differentially_expressed statistically these methods use either rank_based kolmogorovsmirnov like tests or the traditional location shift tests to identify lists of functionally_related that are more differentially_expressed than a randomly drawn list of genes of the same length systematic performance assessments established that in general location shift methods using all data outperform chisquared and kolmogorovsmirnov like methods in a further refinement of this approach the probcd methodology accommodates the use of the complete distribution of differential_expression as well as the probabilistic rather than binary assignment of genes to functional_categories such as go by using a probabilistic categorical_data analysis approach comparing a new experimentally_derived gene_list to other predefined lists of functionally_related while widely used has its limitations despite the large number of such gene_lists they are often not adequate for precisely characterizing functional consequences of experimentally_derived genomics profiles first functional relationship does not necessarily imply co expression or co regulation for example only a fraction of genes associated with the same go term also exhibit coordinated gene_expression consequently a potentially large portion of genes belonging to a functional category or pathway will never be informative about the association between a genomics profile and the pathway second gene_lists associated with a biological concept or process are often incomplete page we implemented our new approach and the other methods listed inand performed a comparison study using expression data from primary human_breast and the connectivity_map we then evaluated each method based on their ability to correctly identify a target signature concordant with a query signature among a number of unrelated decoy signatures this approach allows us to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of each method while mimicking the functional analysis by primary genomics data where the researcher compares a new dataset query to a diverse collection of existing genomics datasets references in order to identify gene_signatures that are similar to the query we have developed a new method to assess the concordance of gene_signatures the new method was compared with other existing_methods evaluating their ability to identify genomics datasets similar to a query dataset based on their respective gene_signatures the ultimate_goal of such analysis is to use the phenotypic_characteristics of the identified reference sets to elucidate underlying molecular_functions of the genomic profile in the new dataset comparisons were made with methods specifically used in this context as well as alternative statistical_methods that are applicable in this setting all of the currently used methods epsa exalt cs and lrpath use a significance cutoff to designate which genes are differentially_expressed in the query dataset however the a priori choice of the optimal cutoff is a difficult problem a too restrictive cutoff leads to a low number of genes in the signature particularly in experiments with small_sample choosing less restrictive to compute the epsa score for two sets of query and corresponding reference signatures as described n and compute the respective roc_curves query set is a set of compound vehicle comparisons with a relatively large_number with low p values set is a more difficult set of comparisons where the number of differentially_expressed for each signature and cutoff is lower for set the fdr cutoff results in a better roc_curve than for p value cutoff upper two curves while for set the less conservative p value cutoff produces a better roc_curve than the fdr cutoff lower two curves cutoffs on the other hand often leads to high numbers of genes in the signature which then results in reduced specificity when computing the concordance measures to illustrate the impact of the cutoff choice on subsequent concordance analyses we used the connectivity_map data to first calculate the epsa score for two sets of query and corresponding reference signatures as described n each time using i a stringent significance cutoff fdr and ii a less conservative one p we then computed the respective roc_curves query set is a set of compound vehicle comparisons with a relatively large_number with low p values set is a more difficult set of comparisons where the overall number of significant p values is lower for each signature and cutoff choice supplementary in the former case the fdr cutoff was the better choice i e the roc_curve for the fdr cutoff is above the curve for the p value cutoff as it resulted in query signatures that were more informative for the concordance assessment compared with a larger signature based on a less conservative cutoff containing many uninformative genes in the latter case however fdr proved to be too restrictive not producing a sufficiently_large gene_signature and the p valuebased cutoff was the better alternative still producing signatures with informative genes that is roc_curves for set overall are worse than for the less difficult set but the curve for the p value cutoff is above the non informative roc_curve for the fdr cutoff in this case in an elegant theoretical_analysis within their unifying rs framework showed that in certain situations small number of very significant genes methods based on categorizing genes can outperform methods that rely on the complete expression_profiles in the traditional enrichment_analysis by gene_lists while it is possible that this result holds in the context of enrichment by primary data our procedure indicates that it is probably impossible to a priori define optimal significance cutoffs for assessing the concordance of gene_signatures consequently one may always be better off using methods that do not rely on defining such cutoffs alternative simple statistical_methods that do not require specifying statistical_significance cutoffs correlation_coefficients wilcoxon_test showed surprisingly strong performance in the breast_cancer datasets analysis but performed_worse than other methods based on selecting differentially_expressed epsa exalt cs and lrpath in the more difficult connectivity_map data our analysis in which we progressively remove the signal by random re labeling of genes indicates that simple methods perform well when most genes are differentially_expressed but their performance deteriorates when only a fraction of genes are concordant this could be explained by the fact that if most genes are differentially_expressed and concordant using all genes is better than losing many informative ones due to imperfect statistical_power of the differential_expression the fact that our grs method performs as well as or better than any other method in all settings implies that it is capable of correctly weighing the contribution of different genes based on the statistical_significance of their differential_expression our results indicate that simple methods utilizing complete gene_expression correlation wilcoxon and methods that rely on preselecting differentially_expressed epsa exalt cs and lrpath both have domains of superiority however our procedure performs optimally in all settings and in difficult situations such as the connectivity_map data clearly outperforms all tested alternatives our method provides additional means to functionally annotate newly_generated genomics data exploiting the vast number of datasets publicly_available through repositories such as geo it is readily available as part of the add on r package clean and through our web_interface genomics portals the online version http genomicsportals org facilitates the use of datasets uploaded by the user as well as using any one of the primary genomics datasets currently deposited in the genomics portals as query and reference datasets
