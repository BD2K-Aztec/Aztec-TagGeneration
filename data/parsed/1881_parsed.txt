sequence_analysis fred an immunoinformatics framework for python immunoinformatics approaches are widely used in a variety of applications from basic immunological to applied biomedical_research complex data_integration is inevitable in immuno logical research and usually requires comprehensive pipelines including multiple tools and data_sources non standard input and output_formats of immunoinformatics tools make the development of such applications difficult here we present fred an open_source immunoinformatics framework offering easy and unified access to methods for epitope_prediction and other immu noinformatics applications fred is implemented in python and designed to be extendable and flexible to allow rapid_prototyping of complex applications availability_and fred is available at http fred the field of immunoinformatics has matured over the last decades epitope prediction_methods are now widely used and have been successfully_applied in many areas from basic immunological to translational_research however these applications often require complex pipelines combining multiple tools multiple data_sources and extensive preand post_processing furthermore many of the hla epitope prediction_tools do not offer a unified interface and output format which makes_it to use prediction_methods interchangeably one way to overcome these problems are web_based workbenches like the ones offered by iedb or epitoolkit but often data volume speed or legal restrictions e g concerning data privacy prevent the use of such applications also web_based workbenches usually provide only limited or delayed integration of novel resources and methods we therefore developed framework for epitope detection fred an opensource python based framework for computational immunology fred is the completely re implemented successor of fred and provides a unified interface to many prediction_tools we implemented routines covering data pre_processing hla_typing epitope_prediction epitope selection as well as epitope assembly fred is flexibly designed to allow easy extension by building on top of popular modules such as biopython http biopython org and pandas http pandas pydata org fred allows rapid_prototyping of complex and innovative immunoinformatics applications we present fred a versatile immunoinformatics software framework enabling a unified interface to many tools from epitope_prediction hla_typing to epitope selection and assembly its openness and easy extensibility makes fred a perfect instrument for the development of advanced immunoinformatics pipelines that are needed for example in cancer_immunotherapy development and other areas of personalized_medicine
