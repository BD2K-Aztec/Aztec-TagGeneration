data_and weakly supervised_learning of information structure of scientific abstracts is it accurate enough to benefit real_world tasks in biomedicine motivation many practical tasks in biomedicine require accessing specific types of information in scientific_literature e g information about the methods results or conclusions of the study in question several approaches have been developed to identify such information in scientific journal_articles the best of these have yielded promising results and proved useful for biomedical_text tasks however relying on fully supervised machine_learning ml and a large body of annotated data existing_approaches are expensive to develop and port to different tasks a potential solution to this problem is to employ weakly supervised_learning instead in this article we investigate a weakly supervised approach to identifying information structure according to a scheme called argumentative zoning az we apply four weakly supervised classifiers to biomedical abstracts and evaluate their performance both directly and in a real_life scenario in the context of cancer risk_assessment results our best weakly supervised classifier based on the combination of active_learning and self training performs well on the task outperforming our best supervised classifier it yields a high_accuracy of when just of the labeled data is used for training when cancer risk assessors are presented with the resulting annotated abstracts they find relevant_information in them significantly_faster than when presented with unannotated abstracts these results suggest that weakly supervised_learning could be used to improve the practical usefulness of information structure for real_life tasks in biomedicine availability the annotated dataset classifiers and the user test for cancer risk_assessment are available online atmany practical tasks in biomedicine require accessing specific types of information in scientific_literature for example a biomedical scientist may be looking for information about the objective of the study in question the methods used the results obtained or the to whom correspondence should be addressed conclusions drawn by the authors similarly many biomedical_text tasks e g information_extraction summarization focus on the extraction of specific types of information in documents only to date a number of approaches have been proposed for the classification of sentences in scientific_literature according to categories of information structure or discourse rhetorical argumentative or conceptual structure depending on the framework in question some of the approaches classify sentences according to typical section names seen in scientific documents while others are based e g on argumentative zones qualitative dimensions or conceptual structure of documents the best current approaches have yielded promising results and proved useful for information_retrieval information_extraction and summarization tasks however relying on fully supervised machine_learning ml and a large body of annotated data existing_approaches are expensive to develop and port to different domains and tasks and thus intractable for use in real_life applications a potential solution to this bottleneck is to develop techniques based on weakly supervised ml instead making use of a small amount of labeled data and a large_pool of unlabeled data weakly supervised_learning e g semi supervision active_learning co tri training self training aims to keep the advantages of fully supervised approaches it has been applied to a wide_range of natural_language nlp and text_mining tasks including namedentity recognition question answering information_extraction text classification and many others yielding performance levels similar or equivalent to those of fully supervised techniques in this article we investigate the potential of weakly supervised_learning for argumentative zoning az of biomedical abstracts az provides an analysis of the argumentative structure i e the rhetorical progression of the argument of a scientific document it has been used to analyze scientific texts in various disciplinesincluding computational linguistics law biology and chemistry and has proved useful for nlp tasks such as summarization however the application of az to different domains has resulted in laborious annotation exercises that suggests that a weakly supervised approach would be more practical for the real_world application of az taking two supervised classifiers as a comparison pointsupport vector machines svm and conditional_random crf we investigate the performance of four weakly supervised classifiers for az two based on semi_supervised transductive svm and semi_supervised crf and two on active_learning active svm alone and in combination with self training we apply these classifiers to az annotated biomedical abstracts in the recent dataset of the results are promising our best weakly supervised classifier active svm with self training outperforms the best supervised classifier svm yielding high_accuracy of when using just of the labeled data for training when using just onethird of the labeled data it performs as well as a fully supervised svm which uses of the labeled data the abstracts in the dataset ofwere selected on the basis of their suitability for cancer risk_assessment cra this enables us to conduct user based evaluation of the practical usefulness of our approach for the real_world task of cra we investigate whether cancer risk assessors find relevant_information in abstracts faster when the abstracts are annotated for az using our best weakly supervised approach the results are promising although manual annotations yield the biggest time savings compared with the time it takes to examine unannotated abstracts considerable savings are also obtained with weakly supervised ml annotations using active svm with self training in sum our investigation shows that weakly supervised az can be employed to improve the practical applicability and portability of az to different information access tasks and that its accuracy is high enough to benefit a real_life task in biomedicine
