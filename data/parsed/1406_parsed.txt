data_and discovering hospital_admission patterns using models learnt from electronic hospital_records motivation electronic_medical nowadays routinely_collected in many developed_countries open a new avenue for medical_knowledge acquisition in this article this vast amount of information is used to develop a novel model for hospital_admission type prediction results i introduce a novel model for hospital_admission type prediction based on the representation of a patients medical_history in the form of a binary history vector this representation is motivated using empirical_evidence from previous work and validated using a large data corpus of medical_records from a local_hospital the proposed model allows exploration visualization and patient specific prognosis making in an intuitive and readily understood manner its power is demonstrated using a large real_world data corpus collected by a local_hospital on which it is shown to outperform previous state of the art in the literature achieving over accuracy in the prediction of the first future diagnosis the model was vastly superior for long_term prognosis as well outper forming previous work in of the cases while producing comparable_performance in the remaining of the cases availability_and full matlab_source is freely_available for download at http ognjen arandjelovic t org data dprog zip public healthcare is an issue of major global significance and concern on the one end of the spectrum the developing world is still plagued by diseases of poverty which are nearly non existent in the most technologically developed_countries on the other end the health risk_profile of industrially leading nations has dramatically changed in recent history with an increased skew toward so_called diseases of affluence healthcare management poses_challenges both in the sphere of policy_making and scientific_research considering the complexity of problems at hand it is unsurprising that there is an ever increasing effort invested in a diverse range of promising avenues yet the available resources are inherently limited to ensure their best usage it is crucial both to develop an understanding of the related epidemiology as well as to be able to communicate this knowledge effectively to those who can benefit from it governments the medical research_community healthcare_practitioners and patients the associations between diseases and a wide_variety of risk_factors are underlain by a complex web of interactions this is particularly the case for the modern diseases of the developed_world the key premise of this work is that to facilitate the understanding of this complexity and the discovery of meaningful patterns within it it is crucial to make use of the vast_amounts of data routinely_collected by healthcare_services in industrially and technologically developed_countries herein the specific aim is to develop a framework which allows a health practitioner e g a doctor or a clinician to understand the available patient_information in an intuitive yet powerful fashion such a framework would on the one end of the utility spectrum facilitate a deepening of disease understanding and on the other provide the practitioner with a tool which can be used to incentivize the patient at risk to make the required lifestyle changes
