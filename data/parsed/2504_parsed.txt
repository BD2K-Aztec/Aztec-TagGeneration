integrating full spectrum of sequence_features into predicting functional microrna mrna interactions motivation micrornas mirnas play_important in general biological_processes and diseases pathogenesis identifying mirna target_genes is an essential step to fully understand the regulatory_effects of mirnas many computational_methods based on the sequence complementary rules and the mirna and mrna expression_profiles have been developed for this purpose it is noted that there have been many sequence_features of mirna_targets available including the context features of the target_sites the thermodynamic_stability and the accessibility energy for mirna mrna interaction however most of current computational_methods that combine sequence and expression information do not effectively integrate full spectrum of these features instead they perceive putative mirnamrna interactions from sequence_based prediction as equally meaningful therefore these sequence_features have not been fully utilized for improving mirna_target results we propose a novel regularized regression_approach that is based on the adaptive lasso procedure for detecting functional mirnamrna interactions our method fully takes_into the gene sequence_features and the mirna and mrna expression_profiles given a set of sequence_features for each putative mirnamrna interaction and their expression values our model quantifies the down_regulation effect of each mirna on its targets while simultaneously estimating the contribution of each sequence feature to predicting functional mirnamrna interactions by applying our model to the expression datasets from two cancer studies we have demonstrated our prediction results have achieved better sensitivity_and and are more biologically_meaningful compared with those based on other methods availability_and the source_code is available at http nba uth tmc edu homepage liu mirnalasso micrornas mirnas are small_non containing about nucleotides that play important gene regulatory_roles in plants and animals these small rna_molecules exert their function through interacting with their mrna_targets the base paring of the mirna with the untranslated_region utr of their targets triggers the mrna_degradation and or protein translational inhibition since their initial discovery mirnas have emerged as key gene_regulators in a variety of fundamentally_important biological_processes including cell_proliferation dysregulation of mirna function has played a role in the pathophysiology of many human_diseases particularly in cancer mirnas represent one of the most abundant classes of generegulatory molecules in mammals there are more than distinct mirnas identified in human it is also demonstrated that of human mrnas are subject to mirna mediated post_transcriptional among the mirnamrna regulatory_relationships multiple_mirnas are often required to act cooperatively to target the same gene on the other hand a given mirna is able to pair with up to hundreds of genes this multiplicity effect poses a great challenge to comprehensively depict a functional mirnamrna regulatory_network over the past_decade many mirna algorithms and tools have been independently developed to study the mirnamrna interactions including targetscan pictar microt cds miranda rnahybrid and targets the majority of these algorithms are based on several well known rules derived from important sequence_features of target_recognition including sequence complementarity seed matching thermodynamic_stability target_site context target_site accessibility and the degree of site conservation despite these efforts the number of false predictions obtained from these computational_methods is still high and more importantly these predictions only represent static mirnamrna interactions therefore expression_profiling has been proposed as a complementary information resource to study dynamic mirnamrna regulatory relationship as a result many approaches tend to integrate this expression information into sequence_based target predictions to obtain more reliable mirna_targets these methods assume that the expression levels of a given mirna and its targets are inversely_correlated due to the down_regulation effect of mirnas on its targets for example genmir computes the probabilities of having an interaction between a mirna and its putative targets in a bayesian_framework a lasso based method enforces a sparseness solution and combines the risc availability with sequenced based prediction and expression data another related method_named talasso includes non positive constraints in their regularized least_squares however when integrating the sequence based_predictions on mirnamrna interactions with the expression data these approaches perceive these putative interactions as equally meaningful as long as they meet certain criteria defined by the sequencebased prediction rules therefore these approaches neglect the full spectrum of available sequence_features of mirna_targets a recent study addresses this problem to some degree by combining sequence_context scores and conservation information with expression_profiles this model is specifically_designed for mirna overexpression experiments to identify targets of a particular mirna in different cell conditions in this article we propose a novel regularized regression_approach for detecting mirnamrna interactions our approach takes_into the mirna and mrna expression_profiles from matched_samples while incorporating sequence_features of putative targets beside the seed match rule between a mirna and its targets we use three additional features i thermodynamic_stability measured by the hybridization energy between a mirna and its candidate target_sites for a successful hybridization the binding_energy dg hybrid must be thermodynamically favorable i e negatively valued ii target_site accessibility which is energetically measured by ddg the free_energy required to unpair the nucleotides on the target_site to make the target accessible it includes two components dg hybrid and dg disruption the latter is the cost of altering the local structure of the mrnas which also prefers to be negatively valued iii target_site context several context features are related to mirna targeting and have been found to boost the target_site efficacy among these features the local au content near the target_site the target_position within utr the residue pairing at end of mirna the target_site abundance and the seed pairing stability are used as the determinants to generate the target_site context score by the targetscan algorithm for different types of target_sites the contribution of these context features are calculated using different sets of regression parameters deduced by the algorithm the combined context value named the context score is then calculated as the sum of the contribution of these context features plus the mean repression level of the targets with the corresponding seed match type to ease the implementation of our method we use the context score directly as an additional sequence feature our algorithm only quantifies the mirnamrna interactions from an initial set of putative mirnamrna pairs that were obtained from targetscanhuman therefore it works as a filter to the targetscanhuman prediction results and is expected to achieve a better accuracy by combining these sequence_features and the expression data of mirnas and mrnas together through real_data application we have demonstrated that our method has achieved better sensitivity_and in predicting mirna_target interactions and the predicted targets are more biologically_meaningful than other methods we compared
