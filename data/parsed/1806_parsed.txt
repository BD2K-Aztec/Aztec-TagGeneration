genome_analysis featurestack perl module for comparative visualization of gene features comparative_analysis of gene structures is important for understanding gene function and evolution to facilitate gene structure comparison multiple related gene models need to be shown side_by in a single compact image in addition sequence_features such as protein_domains should be highlighted for functional_annotation and to provide reference_points for comparison few specialized tools have been developed for the comparative visualization of gene structures including fancygene geca and gsds fancygene provides rich annotation options but is limited to the display of a single genomic locus and image generation cannot be automated conversely geca and gsds allow rapid image generation for many genes but options to highlight sequence_features on top of gene models are limited here we present two perl modules bio draw featurestack and bio graphics glyph decorated gene which build upon existing bioperl and biographics functionality for the highly generic and versatile visualization of multiple gene structures when used in combination these two modules allow for fully_automated and yet highly configurable image generation which greatly_facilitates comparisons of many gene structures
