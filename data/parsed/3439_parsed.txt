genome_analysis pass bis a bisulfite aligner suitable for whole methylome analysis of illumina and solid reads the sequencing of bisulfite treated dna bi seq is becoming a gold_standard for methylation studies the mapping of bi seq reads is complex and requires special alignment_algorithms this problem is particularly relevant for solid color_space where the bisulfite_conversion c t changes two adjacent colors into possible combinations here we present an algorithm that efficiently aligns bi seq reads obtained either from solid or illumina an accompanying methylation caller program creates a genomic view of methylated and unmethylated cs on both dna_strands availability_and the algorithm has been implemented as an option of the program pass freely_available pass bisulfite_sequencing bi seq is an established method to provide information on methylation status of dna unmethylated cs are deaminated by bisulfite_treatment and after pcr they turn into ts whereas methylated cs remain_unchanged the bi seq reads are mapped onto the reference_genome by taking_into that cs may have become ts the resulting t c discrepancies are then used to infer the methylation status although the general rationale of bi seq is easily understood the analysis of the data is difficult the two dna_strands change asymmetrically as the cs occur in different positions as a result each strand produces a different reference_genome for bi seq mapping with the consequent increase of complexity and a possible loss of mapping specificity a further specificity loss may be due to the diminished linguistic complexity as we essentially switch from a four base to the three base alphabet agt some early methods for bi seq mapping required long execution times being based on probability vectors or on iterations of all possible c t conversions more recently some efficient algorithms have been developed such as bs seeker and bismark these latter algorithms are based on the full c t conversion on both plus and minus strands of the reference_genome as well as a full c t conversion of the reads so that the mapping is performed using only the three letters agt a post mapping_procedure will then re consider the original four base sequences and compare the occurrences of cs in the genome and in the reads the agt conversion approach is effective but it cannot be directly applied to solid reads because they are encoded in color_space where each color corresponds to four possible words of two bases as a consequence the available software to align bi seq solid reads is still slow and inefficient in this respect some of the best programs are socs b based on an iterative algorithm and b solana the difficulty of mapping bi seq solid reads is unfortunate as color_space has some interesting potential owing to the double encoding of each base and to the fact that after bisulfite_treatment the full set of four colors would still be present here we introduce a new implementation of pass that allows the mapping of bi seq reads on an agt simplified genome managing both base space as well as native color_space the program is able to perform alignments with gaps a feature that is not available in most programs for bisulfite mapping furthermore when possible it discriminates the genomic strand from which the read originated
