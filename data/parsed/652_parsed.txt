bambus scaffolding metagenomes motivation sequencing_projects increasingly target samples from non clonal sources in particular metagenomics has enabled scientists to begin to characterize the structure of microbial_communities the software_tools developed for assembling and analyzing sequencing_data for clonal organisms are however unable to adequately process data derived from non clonal sources results we present a new scaffolder bambus to address some of the challenges encountered when analyzing metagenomes our approach relies on a combination of a novel method for detecting genomic repeats and algorithms that analyze assembly graphs to identify biologically_meaningful genomic_variants we compare our software to current assemblers using simulated_and we demonstrate that the repeat detection_algorithms have higher sensitivity than current approaches without sacrificing specificity in metagenomic_datasets the scaffolder avoids false joins between distantly_related organisms while obtaining long_range contiguity bambus represents a first step toward automated metagenomic assembly availability bambus is open_source and available from http amos sf net metagenomics the direct_sequencing of dna from all organisms in an environment without culturing has recently_emerged as a new scientific field that enables the discovery of novel organisms and genes as well as the study of population_structure and dynamics metagenomic_studies have greatly expanded the understanding of microbial_diversity for example viral quasi species have been shown to affect pathogenicity in the poliovirus due to cooperation between differently adapted individuals in a population as well as between coinfecting viruses other recent_studies have relied on metagenomics to identify novel genes and uncultured microbes the assembly of metagenomic_data is complicated by several factors such as i widely different levels of representation for different organisms in a community ii genomic_variation between to whom correspondence should be addressed closely_related organisms iii conserved genomic_regions shared by distantly_related organisms and iv repetitive_sequences within individual_genomes similar challenges occur in the assembly of polymorphic eukaryotes a challenging domain for existing assembly algorithms for example the assembly of the sea squirt genome ciona savignyi required extensive manual intervention and customized scripts despite the fact that this genome is fairly simplethere were only two haplotypes of roughly_equal coverage metagenomic_data are considerably more complex due to the lack of assembly tools specifically targeted at metagenomic_projects studies rely on existing assemblers and attempt to mitigate some of the challenges posed by the data through iterative adjustment of assembly parameters and post_processing tuning is critical as existing assemblers make frequent errors even in simulated_datasets with significantly_lower complexity than true environments at the same time current assemblers produce fragmented assemblies hampering downstream_analysis for example in the analysis of the global ocean survey data the celera_assembler was heavily modified to allow high_error in order to account for strain variation and to overcome the effects of varied coverage levels on the statistical repeat detection procedure only two assemblers were developed specifically for metagenomic_datasets however neither utilizes mate_pairs our focus in this work we present novel scaffolding algorithms optimized for non clonal assembly though our algorithms are also applicable to polymorphic genomes the primary_focus of this article is on metagenomic_analysis these algorithms are implemented in a software_tool called bambus bambus supersedes our previous scaffolder bambus which was targeted at clonal sanger data we will show that when applied to metagenomic_datasets bambus generates large scaffolds while avoiding false joins between distantly_related organisms furthermore our software can automatically identify genomic_regions of variation that correspond to previously_characterized polymorphic_loci in the following section we demonstrate the performance of bambus by comparing it with two assemblers used in recent page bambus is not a stand alone assembler instead it is a drop in scaffolding module optimized for non clonal data and is compatible with the output of many modern assemblers thus bambus can be applied to virtually all existing sequencing technologiesit is sufficient to start with an assembler that is best suited for that type of data we have shown that it can easily be applied to the output of celera_assembler newbler soapdenovo and minimus and have demonstrated its performance in sanger and illumina data bambus includes an executive script named gobambus that will automatically process input_data in a variety of formats and run the pipeline making it easy to use
