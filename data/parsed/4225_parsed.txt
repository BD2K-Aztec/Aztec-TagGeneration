sequence_analysis shimmer detection of genetic_alterations in tumors using next generation sequence_data motivation extensive dna_sequencing of tumor and matched normal samples using exome and whole_genome sequencing_technologies has enabled the discovery of recurrent genetic_alterations in cancer_cells but variability in stromal contamination and subclonal heterogen eity still present a severe challenge to available detection_algorithms results here we describe publicly_available software shimmer which accurately detects somatic single_nucleotide using statistical_hypothesis with multiple_testing this program produces somatic single_nucleotide predictions with significantly_higher sensitivity and accuracy than other available software when run on highly_contaminated or heterogeneous_samples and it gives comparable sensitivity and accuracy when run on samples of high_purity the development of next_generation methods has led to a rapid increase in the availability of high_quality sequence_data from large_numbers of tumor_samples some with matched_samples from the same individuals blood or unaffected tissue these data have uncovered genes and pathways that are mutated in various forms of cancer and the characterization of these alterations has led to a greater understanding of oncogenesis as well as the potential for earlier_diagnosis of cancers and more directed treatments however sensitive and accurate detection of somatic singlenucleotide variants ssnvs from next_generation data is still a challenging informatic problem because of differing levels of purity and numbers of subclonal populations represented in tumor_samples the depth of read_coverage necessary to detect a mutation accurately is dependent on the prevalence of the mutation in that sample which is in turn dependent on levels of copy_number levels of stromal contamination and prevalence of mutation among subclones within the sample available software for detecting differences between samples often provides little guidance with regard to how deep coverage needs to be to attain the users required sensitivity and accuracy a large number of algorithms have been developed to identify small mutations in aligned sequencing_reads from pairs of samples for ssnvs several studies have used a navenave subtraction method in which variants are first called separately from both the tumor and normal samples reads and then sites that have a confident call of a variant in the tumor as well as a confident call of no variant in the normal are assumed to be ssnvs however analyzing samples separately can lead to false_positives when a germline variant is present in a low percentage of reads from the normal sample as well as false_negatives when mutation levels in the tumor are too low to allow an algorithm to confidently distinguish variant reads from sequencing_error analyzing reads from the two samples simultaneously enables better discrimination of germline alleles from sequencing_error other algorithms do this simultaneous analysis with hypothesis_testing varscan is a comprehensive sequence_analysis tool that includes ssnv detection and analyzes pairs of samples simultaneously it predicts ssnvs using a combination of heuristic filtering and a fishers_exact but the tool reports p values without any correction_for and fails to report the number of tests performed or the expected underlying distribution of p values making it impossible to perform these corrections after running the program similarly deepsnv performs a likelihood_ratio on each site in a sequenced region along with rigorous multiple_testing to report sites for which the frequency of a variant allele is significantly_higher than that of modeled sequencing_errors but it gives the user only rough control over which sites are tested jointsnvmix uses bayesian probability models to infer the genotypes of both tumor and normal samples simultaneously allowing users to train the model on the data and then classify mutations as somatic or germline with a given posterior_probability the software also now includes the ability to filter predictions using parameters learned from the data however as it is based on a diploid model this method is prone to errors in regions where the model does not to whom correspondence should be addressed reflect reality for example copy_number altered regions and misaligned repetitive_sequences similarly somaticsniper uses a bayesian_model to calculate posterior_probabilities of somatic_mutations using a prior that incorporates the dependence of tumor and normal genotypes from a single individual and provides software for filtering using other indicators for potential false_positives others have used bayesian approaches as well in this study we describe a new simpler approach based on hypothesis_testing with correction_for implemented in a publicly_available software_tool shimmer the algorithm yields highly_accurate and sensitive calls on matched tumor and normal sequence even in the presence of large_amounts of stromal contamination heterogeneity and copy_number and even without any post filtering of ssnv calls we compared the variants predicted by shimmer with those predicted by varscan somaticsniper deepsnv and jointsnvmix on the simulated_datasets described in the previous section in addition we ran shimmer varscan and somaticsniper on the whole_genome colo data for each dataset we defined sensitivity as the percentage of known true variants that are predicted correctly by each program and assessed accuracy by tallying the number of false_positive variants a program predicted here we present results from both real_and supporting the use of simple statistical_methods without heuristics or filtering for the determination of genetic_differences between tumors and matched normal samples it should be no surprise that the use of hypothesis_testing with correction_for provides highly_accurate determination of true_positive variants while effectively controlling the fdr as these statistical_methods have already been successfully_applied in so many fields of scientific_research we also show that these statistical_methods as implemented in the program shimmer perform comparably with other currently available software such as somaticsniper at typical depths of sequencing for whole exome and whole_genome sequencing_experiments although there does not seem to be a significant_advantage to using shimmer when analyzing samples with high_purity it can be expected to give far superior results on samples that are highly_contaminated or contain subclonal heterogeneity furthermore although shimmers algorithm can be less sensitive at lower depths of sequencing well established statistical results allow the user to estimate the depth of coverage necessary to confidently detect somatic_mutations present in any level in a tumor these estimates can then guide decision_making regarding how much sequencing is cost_effective in large tumor normal sequencing studies barring difficulties in obtaining independent sampling of molecules because of sparse samples or low library complexity obtaining more reads is a viable strategy for increasing power to detect mutations present in small quantities in a sample regardless of the depth of sequencing performed the shimmer algorithm allows the user to decide what their maximum acceptable level of false_discoveries will be
