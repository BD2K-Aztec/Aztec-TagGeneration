crisprstrand predicting repeat orientations to determine the crrna encoding strand at crispr_loci motivation the discovery of crispr_cas almost years_ago rapidly changed our perception of the bacterial and archaeal immune_systems crispr_loci consist of several repetitive_dna called repeats inter spaced by stretches of variable_length sequences called spacers this crispr array is transcribed and processed into multiple mature rna species crrnas a single crrna is integrated into an interference complex together with crispr associated cas proteins to bind and degrade invading nucleic_acids although existing bioinformatics_tools can recognize crispr_loci by their characteristic repeat spacer architecture they generally output crispr arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine the strand from which crrnas are processed knowledge of the correct orientation is crucial for many tasks including the classification of crispr conservation the detection of leader regions the identification of target_sites protospacers on invading genetic_elements and the characterization of protospacer adjacent motifs results we present a fast and accurate tool to determine the crrna encoding strand at crispr_loci by predicting the correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine_learning approach both the repeat_sequence and mutation information were encoded and processed by an efficient graph_kernel to learn higher_order correlations the model was trained and tested on curated_data comprising crisprs and yielded a remarkable performance of auc roc area under the curve of the receiver_operator in addition we show that accurate orientation information greatly_improved detection of conserved repeat_sequence families and structure motifs we integrated crisprstrand predictions into our crisprmap web_server of crispr conservation and updated the latter to version availability crisprmap and crisprstrand are available at http crispr_cas immune_systems of bacteria and archaea provide adaptive defence against a variety of invading genetic_elements they have been classified into three major classes types i ii and iii where type_ii systems are confined to bacteria the adaptive_immune of all types is divided_into three major phases i adaptation the uptake of dna_fragments from genetic_elements and their insertion between consecutive repeats of a crispr array generally adjacent to a leader_sequence ii processing of the crispr array transcripts within the repeats to generate small crrnas that derive from part or all of each spacer region and iii interference involving targeting and cleavage of an invading genetic element or its transcripts by cas proteincrrna complexes barrangou and van_der oost and whereas the adaptation phase is relatively conserved in the different crispr_cas significant differences occur in the processing and interference mechanisms thus where type i and iii systems employ a cas processing endonuclease to cleave within the repeats the bacterial type_ii system uses the hostencoded rnase_iii together with a crispr associated transencoded tracrrna furthermore the various interference complexes exhibit considerable diversity we developed an efficient tool for determining the strand from which mature crrnas are derived by focussing on the repeats at crispr_loci the repeats are unique within the crispr_cas system because they are the only element to play_a in all phases of immunity thus despite their relatively short lengths each repeat carries essential structural_parameters or sequence_motifs that are recognized by enzymes or structural proteins involved in adaptation crrna biogenesis and interference paradoxically however the repeats are very heterogeneous occurring in a range of lengths nt and display considerable sequence_diversity an early comparative_study of crispr diversity yielded main clusters with specific sequence characteristics only a subset folded into characteristic hairpin_structure motifs more recently a major reevaluation of crispr conservation was executed by on a much larger data_set of crisprs where conserved repeat_sequence families were identified together with a total of potential structural_motifs the repeat clusters were further classified into six superclasses some of which showed strong biases to specific crispr subtypes and to certain bacterial or archaeal phyla crispr_loci are generally identified by their characteristic repeat spacer architecture for example crt and crisprfinder provide sensitive predictions of crispr arrays but do not provide unambiguous orientation information in the literature orientation is derived to whom correspondence should be addressed mainly by characteristic sequence_motifs in the repeat the detection of a conserved leader_region in closely_related crispr_loci or by transcriptome experiments where the dominantly transcribed_strand is determined however to date very few systems have been studied_experimentally and many large_scale studies require accurate orientation information for all available crispr arrays recently has presented the first tool to predict the orientation of crispr arrays their model is essentially a linear predictor based on a number of features which comprise the presence of the attgaaan motif in repeats a higher a or t content in the flanking_regions of crispr arrays nucleotide_composition within the crispr array the presence of mutations in specific parts of the array and the tendency to fold into a secondary_structure each feature is considered as an independent_predictor and is given a weight proportional to its estimated precision the final prediction is computed as the weighted combination of each predictor knowledge of the correct repeat orientation is crucial for accurate characterization of crispr conservation and for subsequently studying mechanisms of adaptation crispr rna_processing and interference in particular it can help to i detect leader regions currently poorly described in the literature ii identify signals of transcription_initiation and termination iii determine the orientation of protospacers on invading genetic_elements and finally iv characterize cognate protospacer adjacent motifs pams thus we consider that the repeat orientation tool presented here will be of critical importance for future crispr based experimental_studies we presented a highly flexible_approach to accurately_predict the transcribed_strand of crispr_loci the method is motivated by recent_findings and encodes the most relevant_information in the form of a graph_structure that can be efficiently processed with graph_kernel methods our tool compares favourably against a recent approach proposed inin terms of accuracy compared to auc roc runtimes s rather than min on a k sequences dataset and coverage we achieve auc roc on the sequences that the biswas tool fails to classify our approach was integrated in crisprmap to improve the accuracy of the previously_published classification of crisprs and resulted in i a comprehensive dataset with consensus repeats ii the most recent classification of cas subtypes based on cas protein occurrences for archaea and iii an improved annotation of makarova cas subtypes for bacteria respecting the rules published in the orientation prediction approach that we have presented is fast accurate and can be easily integrated in existing pipelines in future work we will employ it to ease the identification of novel targets protospacers pam motifs and the investigation of regulatory_motifs in the leader sequences of crispr arrays
