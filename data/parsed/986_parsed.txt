cit hypothesis_testing software for mediation_analysis in genomic applications motivation the challenges of successfully applying causal_inference methods include i satisfying underlying assumptions ii limitations in data models accommodated by the software and iii low power of common multiple testing approaches results the causal_inference test cit is based on hypothesis_testing rather than estimation allowing the testable assumptions to be evaluated in the determination of statistical_significance a user_friendly software_package provides p values and optionally permutation_based fdr estimates q values for potential_mediators it can handle single and multiple binary and continuous instrumental_variables binary or continuous outcome_variables and adjustment covariates also the permutation_based fdr option provides a non parametric implementation conclusion simulation_studies demonstrate the validity of the cit package and show a substantial advantage of permutation_based fdr over other common multiple testing_strategies availability_and the cit open_source r package is freely_available from the cran website https cran r project org_web cit index html with embedded c code that utilizes the gnu scientific library also freely_available http www gnu org software gsl the causal_inference test cit can play_an in post gwas analyses that seek to identify molecular mediators of the effects of genetic_variation on disease_phenotypes a growing number of groups have used the cit to identify mediators such as methylation and gene_expression the previously_published cit function was limited in scope accommodating a single discrete snp like variable a continuous mediator and a continuous_outcome we have developed the cit r package to extend software capabilities in a number of important_ways i binary as well as continuous outcomes ii continuous as well as binary instrumental_variables iii multiple instrumental_variables simultaneously and iv an approach for generating permutation_based q values the false_discovery fdr analog to p values with confidence_intervals in simulated_data we compared the permutation_based fdr approach implemented in the new software as described above to its parametric equivalent as described by millstein and volfson supplemental eq s computed on the omnibus cit p values replicate datasets were simulated for each scenario binary versus continuous_outcome and multiple testing corrections were based on the corresponding p values because parametric assumptions were satisfied in the simulated_data and the theory behind both fdr estimators is the same we would expect close agreement between the two approaches very close agreement was observed which demonstrates the validity of the permutation_based iut approach also apparent in the results is the substantial gain in power of the millstein and volfson fdr approach over the bonferroni and bh methods which is consistent with theoretical_properties of the respective tests the unadjusted p value curve for simulations conducted under reverse causality shows that fewer tests are called significant than would be expected under the null thus the results demonstrate the robustness of the method to reverse causality confusion and that the test is actually conservative under these conditions other simulation_results also demonstrated similar properties when multiple instrumental_variables with and without statistical interactions were involved supplemental figs s and s the cit package provides a general and powerful_tool for identifying the most likely molecular mediators of genetic effects the permutation_based q value method makes the cit fully non parametric the ability to apply a permutation_based fdr approach with confidence_intervals has the potential to substantially_increase the utility of the method by uncoupling statistical_significance with the conventional level results that do not achieve this threshold may nevertheless be biologically_important and the q value estimate along with confidence_intervals provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty in the results with the exception that the react curve in the upper plot demonstrates low type_i in the presence of reverse causation the y axis represents the proportion of tests called significant at a significance threshold specified on the xaxis fdr jm perm and param denote the permutation_based and parametric omnibus cit fdr respectively the proposed fdr approach is consistently more powerful than the benjamini and hochberg bh and much more powerful than the bonferroni_correction bonf
