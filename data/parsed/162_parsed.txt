a gibbs_sampling strategy applied to the mapping of ambiguous short sequence_tags motivation chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq is widely used in biological_research chip_seq yield many ambiguous tags that can be mapped with equal probability to multiple genomic_sites such ambiguous tags are typically eliminated from consideration resulting in a potential loss of important biological_information results we have developed a gibbs_sampling based algorithm for the genomic mapping of ambiguous sequence_tags our algorithm relies on the local genomic tag context to guide the mapping of ambiguous tags the gibbs_sampling procedure we use simultaneously maps ambiguous tags and updates the probabilities used to infer correct tag map positions we show that our algorithm is able to correctly map more ambiguous tags than existing mapping methods our approach is also able to uncover mapped genomic_sites from highly repetitive_sequences that can not be detected based on unique tags alone including transposable_elements segmental_duplications and peri centromeric regions this mapping_approach should prove to be useful for increasing biological_knowledge on the too often neglected repetitive genomic_regions genome_wide chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by highthroughput_sequencing chip_seq are increasingly used in biological and medical_research chip_seq produce a large amount of short sequence_tags which need to be reliably mapped back to the genome and processed to reveal biologically_relevant signal a number of algorithms have been recently_developed to process chip_seq these include algorithms for genomic mapping of sequence_tags smoothing of chip_seq tag distribution signals and detection of statistically_significant tag peaks one remaining challenge for the processing of chipseq data is the mapping of ambiguous tags ambiguous tags are to whom correspondence should be addressed those that can be mapped to multiple genomic_sites each of which has significant_sequence with the tag and thus it is difficult to distinguish the real site from all the possible sites usually researchers simply disregard ambiguous tags and only make use of uniquely mapped tags this often results in a substantial_loss of information and may bias conclusions based on the analysis of unique tags alone this is particularly true for mammalian_genomes such as the human_genome which have numerous interspersed repeat sequences repeat sequences that are highly_similar may produce a large amount of ambiguous tags which if not mapped will be disregarded in subsequent analyses research has shown that interspersed repeat sequences provide a wide_variety of functional_elements to eukaryotic_genomes therefore disregarding ambiguous tags may lead to an underestimate of the biological_significance and functional_roles of interspersed repeated dna two different approaches have been developed for the mapping of ambiguous sequence_tags the mapping software maq randomly selects a possible site and assigns it to the ambiguous tag each possible site has the same probability of being selected in other words there is no way to know if this approach yields a correct mapping of ambiguous tags the second approach takes_advantage of the local_context of mapped tags to more accurately assign genomic_locations for ambiguous tags this approach rests on the assumption that real ambiguous tag sites are expected to have more sequence_tags in the local vicinity whereas the incorrect sites for the same ambiguous tags are expected to have fewer numbers of co located tags to apply this method for any ambiguous tag the number of overlapping mapped tags at each of the possible ambiguous tagmapped positions are counted and used to assign fractional weights to each possible position the ambiguous tag is then fractionally mapped to each possible position with the fractions weighted by the local mapped tag context in other words possible sites with more tags already mapped are deemed to deserve higher confidence and are accordingly assigned greater fractions of ambiguous tags the fractional mapping method makes important contribution to the ambiguous tag mapping problem but as the use of chip_seq in scientific_research is increasing it will be important to further refine the accuracy of mapping ambiguous tags first the fraction method is heuristic as the fractions assigned to the possible map sites are directly proportional to the number of tags mapped to each site while this approach is consistent with biological intuition it lacks statistical support a more sensitive probabilistic_method could be used to better represent and measure the confidence_level of scheme of our glibbs sampling algorithm possible tag map sites along with their likelihood_ratios are shown prior to stochastic mapping gray boxes represent incorrect sites and the black_box represents the correct site an arrow between a tag and a site means the tag could possibly be mapped to that site one iterative cycle of joint stochastic mapping and parameter updating is shown the black arrows point to selected_sites for each tag after stochastic mapping each possible site second the fraction method deterministically fractionates the ambiguous tags without guarantee that the result is optimal in other words it does not search the possible space of assignments of ambiguous tags and lacks information on the accuracy of the final results third the fraction method is not realistic enough since it splits tags by assigning fractions of ambiguous tags to each possible site in reality each sequence tag is only derived from a single genomic site thus fractioning sequence_tags inevitably results in wasting signal on incorrect sites and weakening the signal level on real sites to address the outstanding issues with ambiguous tag mapping we have developed a probabilistic gibbs_sampling based algorithm to map more ambiguous tags with greater_accuracy our approach assigns ambiguous tags to single genomic_sites without fractionating tags and iteratively samples within the space of the possible mappings of ambiguous tags the gibbs_sampling strategy guides the algorithm to achieve accurate unique mappings of ambiguous tags the algorithm also provides statistical support for ambiguous tag mapping via the use of likelihood_ratios that measure the confidence_levels of possible genomic map sites we evaluated the performance of our algorithm compared to existing_approaches using sequence tag data from the highly repetitive human_genome we demonstrate that our probabilistic_approach to mapping ambiguous tags yields superior results as measured by i the fraction of correctly mapped ambiguous tags ii the precision and recall of correctly recovered repetitive genomic_sites and iii the level of signal found at repetitive sites
