databases_and nurbs a database of experimental and predicted nuclear_receptor binding_sites of mouse nuclear_receptors nrs are a class of transcription_factors playing_important in various biological_processes an nr often impacts numerous_genes and different nrs share overlapped target networks to fulfil the need for a database incorporating binding_sites of different nrs at various conditions for easy comparison and visu_alization to improve our understanding of nr binding mechanisms we have developed nurbs a database for experimental and predicted nuclear_receptor binding_sites of mouse nurbs nurbs currently contains binding_sites across the whole mouse_genome of nrs identified in chromatin_immunoprecipitation with massively_parallel dna sequencing_experiments all datasets are processed using a widely used procedure and same statistical criteria to ensure the binding_sites derived from different datasets are comparable nurbs also provides predicted binding_sites using nr hmm a hidden_markov hmm_model availability the gbrowse based user_interface of nurbs is freely_accessible at http shark abl ku edu nurbs nr hmm and all results can be downloaded for free at the website nuclear_receptors nrs are a class of ligand regulated transcription_factors involved in many important biological_processes such as development and metabolism and implicated in various human_diseases including diabetes cardiovascular_disease and cancers a single nr often impacts numerous_genes and different nrs may compete for target_sites resulting in overlapped target gene_networks therefore it is important to analyse and compare the binding_sites and target_genes of various nrs and determine the cross_talk between nrs the recent development of chromatin_immunoprecipitation with massively_parallel dna_sequencing chip_seq has greatly advanced the nr binding_site detection consequently data of experimental nr binding_sites have been accumulated rapidly although there is limited effort to collect and archive nr related chip_seq to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive database of nr binding_sites across whole_genome has been developed for easy comparing binding_sites for different nrs it is well known that the binding_sites of various nrs share a similar sequence pattern that contains two half_sites with a consensus_sequence of rgktca or its reverse complementary with variable intervals from to base_pairs there are three forms of such a pattern direct repeat inverted_repeat everted repeat and their reverse complement several methods have been used to predict nr binding_sites one widely used method is nhr scan sandelin and a hidden_markov hmm using experimentally_determined nrs to predict two half_sites simultaneously however nhr scan is no longer actively maintained and its web_based interface does not allow predicting binding_sites at a large_scale to take advantage of recently_discovered binding_sites and also to provide a standalone application for genome_scale response_element prediction to the community we have developed nr hmm a virtual basic application implementing an hmm_model based on the nhrscan algorithm the new model was trained on experimentally_verified binding_sites we present nurbs a database of binding_sites across the whole mouse_genome of nrs identified in chip_seq along with predicted binding_sites of mouse_genome using nr hmm a well established procedure in brief all sequenced_reads are aligned to mm mouse reference_genome http genome ucsc edu using bowtie version all peaks are detected using the model based analysis for chip_seq macs v the poisson p value cut_off for peak_detection is set to overlapped peaks are split using mali salmons peak splitter program http www ebi ac uk bertone software html the peak annotation is done using r package chippeakanno nr hmm was built using nr binding_sites collected in previous work and jaspar core http jaspar cgb ki se cgi bin jaspar db pl the sequences of the collected binding_sites were manually inspected and only those with two half_sites were kept the final dataset contained nr binding_sites the nr hmm_model is built using the framework of nhr scan the parameters of hmm were estimated using baumwelch algorithm the transmission probability matrix was estimated based on the frequency of each state in the training data laplaces rule pseudo count was applied to estimate the emission probability matrix the nr hmm is then used to predict nr binding_sites in mouse_genome mm available as a gbrowse track in nurbs the nurbs is implemented as a mysql relational_database and uses the generic genome_browser gbrowse as its web browser_based interface gbrowse is userfriendly and highly customizable links to the mouse_genome informatics database mgi http www informatics jax org are available in nurbs wherever possible because mgi also uses gbrowse as its user_interface all mgi annotation trackers can be easily downloaded and enabled in nurbs the main search page of nurbs is highly configurable by users detailed examples are provided in an online help file in brief users can click track buttons to select datasets for visualization and comparison the coverage option allows users to choose whether to display the binding region intensities nurbs supports searches by name and region a search result page displays selected tracks of experimental_data predicted peaks by nr hmm and annotations a hypertext link is available for a peak leading to additional information such as sequence and genome location similarly when an annotated feature such as a gene is visible in the result page a hyperlink to the mgi database is provided so the users can access more information such as genetic_map position mammalian homology_information gene_ontology and expression as well as links to other public_databases such as ensembl genome_browser university of california at santa_cruz ucsc_genome and ncbi we have developed nurbs a web_based database for experimental and predicted nr binding_sites in mouse_genome it has a customizable and user_friendly interface easy for navigating searching and comparing experimental and predicted nr binding_sites for multiple nrs all the data and the hmm_model are freely_available for download currently we are incorporating transcriptome_data in nurbs for more advanced studies and expanding the database to human nrs for cross_species comparison we intend to make nurbs a database open to the community and encourage users to provide feedback and submit new data and references we have been actively populating the database and plan to maintain regular updates for the years to come nurbs is distinct from other existing nr related databases it is developed to provide researchers a convenient way to compare experimental and predicted binding_sites for various nrs along with genomic_annotations other existing nr databases are devoted to the sequences structures and functions mutations and phylogenies of nrs not their binding_sites recently ochsner et_al set up a database transcriptomine which is focused on the expression and function of nrs related genes the well developed cistrome provides information about a number of nrs and their co factors and epigenomic information and it is better suited for investigating individual nr as it does not provide features for comparison between nrs in addition cistrome dedicates genomic visualization to remote ucsc_genome whereas nurbs uses an integrated gbrowse also used by mgi
