razers faster fully sensitive read_mapping motivation during the past_years next_generation has become a key_technology for many applications in the biomedical_sciences throughput continues to increase and new protocols provide longer_reads than currently available in almost all applications read_mapping is a first step hence it is crucial to have algorithms and implementations that perform fast with high_sensitivity and are able to deal with long_reads and a large absolute number of insertions_and results razers is a read_mapping program with adjustable sensitivity based on counting q grams in this work we propose the successor razers which now supports shared memory parallelism an additional seed_based filter with adjustable sensitivity a much faster banded version of the myers bit vector algorithm for verification memory saving measures and support for the sam output format this leads to a much improved_performance for mapping reads in particular long_reads with many errors we extensively compare razers with other popular read_mappers and show that its results are often superior to them in terms of sensitivity while exhibiting practical and often competitive run times in addition razers works without a pre_computed index availability_and source_code are freely_available for download at http www seqan de projects razers razers is implemented in c and openmp under a gpl license using the seqan library and supports linux mac os x and windows next_generation allows researches to produce billions of base_pairs bp within days in the form of reads of length_bp and more it has become an invaluable technology for a multitude of applications e g the detection of single_nucleotide snps and large structural genome variations targeted or de_novo genome or transcriptome_assembly isoform prediction and quantification identification of transcription_factor or methylation patterns in many of these applications mapping sequenced_reads to their potential genomic origin is the first fundamental step for subsequent analyses a variety of tools have been designed specifically for the purpose of mapping short_reads in a recent_publication give a survey and categorize the existing_tools into approaches using a q gram index for a seed and extend strategy e g or recursively descending a suffix_tree or prefix tree of the reference_genome recursive approaches are usually designed for the fast search of one or a few locations where reads map with low_error these search algorithms are mostly based on heuristics and optimized for speed instead of enumerating all possible locations conversely approaches based on the seed and extend strategy allow such an often approximate enumeration the first class of approaches aims at directly finding the best location for mapping a read best mappers whereas the second class aims at enumerating a comprehensive set of locations all mappers razers is an all mapper that uses q gram counting for read_mapping with controllable sensitivity this means it can guarantee to find all locations a read maps to in a reference_sequence at the same time it works with practicable performance since the original publication in sequencing_technology has advanced to produce longer_reads the increasing length leads to a larger absolute number of errors to be considered a problem that is aggravated by new technologies that have a higher_error e g pacbio older read_mappers have difficulties mapping long_reads with high number of errors with a high_sensitivity in this article we address this problem and propose a new read_mapper razers which is able to map reads of arbitrary length with a large number of insertions and deletion indel_errors our novel contributions are as follows the use of openmp to provide a shared memory parallelization with dynamic load balancing in addition to the q gram counting filter used in razers we implemented a pigeonhole based filter with controllable sensitivity since it proved to be superior for low_error an implementation of a banded version of myers bit vector algorithm which we use for the verification similar to hyyro hyyro which is up to four times_faster than the previous unbanded version these algorithmic improvements lead to a running time that is an order of magnitude faster than razers while keeping the guarantee for full sensitivity various extensive benchmarks show higher sensitivity when compared with other approaches especially best mappers furthermore the running time is superior to the considered all mappers and competitive or superior to best mappers on medium_sized genomes on large_genomes the running time is still practical and only about three times slower than that of bwa while being more sensitive razers does not rely on a pre_computed index like the tree based tools and is in this respect more flexible we presented a read_mapping program that is faster than or at least competitive to existing popular tools while guaranteeing full sensitivity following a sensible and formal definition for both hamming and edit_distance furthermore it allows the user to lower the sensitivity in a controlled fashion to further lower the running time third razers can deal with reads of arbitrary length and large error_rates we showed that razers has a superior_performance in the presence of sequence_variations together with some other recent_publications our work shows that the use of the bwt together with more or less exhaustive backtracking strategies has its limitations if the number of absolute indel_errors is large in addition the above strategies do not need a pre_computed index the banded edit_distance verification algorithm presented here should also be considered as a fast algorithmic ingredient for future read_mappers finally our tool is able to fully leverage the in core parallelism of modern processors razers was implemented using seqan doring and is publicly_available at http
