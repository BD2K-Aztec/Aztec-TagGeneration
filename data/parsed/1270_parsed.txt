dbdsm a manually_curated database for deleterious synonymous mutations motivation synonymous mutations sms which changed the sequence of a gene without directly altering the amino_acid of the encoded_protein were thought to have no functional consequences for a long time they are often assumed to be neutral in models of mutation and selection and were completely ignored in many studies however accumulating experimental_evidence has demonstrated that these mutations exert their impact on gene_functions via splicing accuracy mrna_stability translation fidelity protein_folding and expression and some of these mutations are implicated in human_diseases to the best of our knowledge there is still no database specially focusing on disease related sms results we have developed a new database called dbdsm database of deleterious synonymous mutation a continually updated database that collects curates and manages available human disease related sm data obtained from published_literature in the current release dbdsm collects sm disease association entries including sms and human_diseases from clinvar grasp gwas catalog gwasdb polymirts database pubmed_database and web of knowledge additionally we provided users a link to download all the data in the dbdsm and a link to submit novel data into the database we hope dbdsm will be a useful resource for investigating the roles of sms in human disease availability_and dbdsm is freely_available online atpoint mutations can be classified as either non synonymous or synonymous based on whether they change the amino_acid of a protein historically synonymous mutations sms have been consistently overlooked because they do not alter the protein_sequence and are thus considered functionally irrelevant many studies completely ignore sms whereas others use them to build background models for the estimation of deleterious_mutations but synonymous is different from same and accumulating_evidence suggested that sms could have functional consequences over diseases have been associated with sms in human genes so_far studies_analyzing the consequences of sms have revealed that they play_an in multiple_biological such as mrna_splicing mrna folding protein_translation and folding and micrornamrna interaction in summary currently there are many databases that focus on point_mutation such as dbnsfp and mirnasnp however to the best of our knowledge there is no database that can provide comprehensive resources for the diseaserelated sms to fill this gap we developed a literature based disease related sms database called dbdsm database of deleterious synonymous mutation which is proposed to assist with investigating the mechanism of sm disease association and facilitate translational_research on disease genetics we hope it will be a useful resource for the sm research_community in the current version dbdsm collected sm disease association entries including sms and human_diseases from clinvar grasp gwas catalog gwasdb polymirts database pubmed_database and web of knowledge the data in dbdsm can be easily accessed in a variety of ways users can query the database in search page by gene name dbsnp id disease name or chromosome_number which results in display of sm centered information users can also explore all entries of the database through the browse page all the results are available to download for further analysis aside from data_retrieval from dbdsm users are encouraged to submit novel data into the database users may first search dbdsm to check whether their data have already been deposited into the database if not they may upload the related data information which will be stored in dbdsm the novel data will be forwarded to the dbdsm developer via email and will become available after a manual check and confirmation all the descriptions above are available in the document page in conclusion dbdsm is the first attempt to establish a literature based resource of deleterious sms it is a resource for better understanding sm disease associations and developing useful information for investigating the roles of sms in human disease this database could also be used for the annotation of rna_seq the collection and curation of deleterious sms will keep on going and more valuable resources will be integrated into the dbdsm in the future we believe that dbdsm will be a useful tool for the biomedical research_community
