alignment_free protein_interaction comparison motivation biological_network comparison software largely relies on the concept of alignment where close matches between the nodes of two or more networks are sought these node matches are based on sequence_similarity and or interaction_patterns however because of the incomplete and error_prone datasets currently available such methods have had limited success moreover the results of network_alignment are in general not amenable for distance based evolutionary_analysis of sets of networks in this article we describe netdis a topology based distance measure between networks which offers the possibility of network phylogeny reconstruction results we first demonstrate that netdis is able to correctly separate different random graph_model types independent of network size and density the biological applicability of the method is then shown by its ability to build the correct phylogenetic_tree of species based solely on the topology of current protein_interaction our results provide new evidence that the topology of protein_interaction contains information about evolutionary_processes despite the lack of conservation of individual interactions as netdis is applicable to all networks because of its speed and simplicity we apply it to a large collection of biological and non biological_networks where it clusters diverse networks by type availability_and the source_code of the program is freely_available www stats ox ac uk research proteins resources the ability to recreate evolutionary_relationships between biological objects has driven much of our increased biological understanding in particular the reconstruction of phylogenetic_trees using sequence_data is now commonplace and has provided evidence for evolutionary_mechanisms such as mutation insertion and deletion similar to sequence_data over the past_decade the amount of available interaction data between proteins has been steadily_increasing these data are routinely represented as protein_protein ppi_networks with proteins as nodes and interactions as edges despite the abundance of ppi data now available there is no tree reconstruction method based purely on these networks yet it is conjectured that such trees based on networks may give rise to a step change in biology much as tree building methods from sequences did there already are more elegant methods available for constructing species_trees e g based on genomic_sequences trees built from ppi_networks would span a limited species set and are by themselves perhaps not of interest in contrast the methodology that is able to correctly build a phylogenetic_tree from interaction data would be much of interest as it should reveal information about the evolutionary_mechanisms at play in biological_networks such a method would also be useful in other domains where alternative means of generating taxonomies are not available there is currently a lack of consensus regarding likelihoodbased statistical_models for ppi_network evolution moreover often phylogenetic_tree methods based on distances perform better and are more robust to mis specification than maximum_likelihood methods hence we concentrate here on the development of a one dimensional network comparison statistic which can be used to compile a distance_matrix to build trees the most tractable methods for network comparison are those which compare at the level of the entire network using statistics that describe global properties e g but these statistics are not sensitive enough to be able to reconstruct phylogeny or shed light on evolutionary_processes in contrast there are several network_alignment based_methods that compare networks using the properties of the individual proteins nodes e g local network similarity and or protein functional or sequence_similarity the aim of these methods is to identify matching proteins nodes between networks and use these matching nodes to identify exact or close subnetwork matches a few of these methods have been expanded to the multiple network problems these methods are usually computationally_intensive and tend to yield an alignment that contains only a relatively small proportion of the network although this has been alleviated to some extent in more recent methods the analysis is further confounded by a large_number and false_negatives thought to be present in current ppi data studied the effect of errors and incompleteness in alignments of simulated networks and estimated that only nearly complete networks can produce reliable alignments finally ppi_network alignment_methods are all based on the loose premise that the respective orthologs of two interacting_proteins also interact forming pairs of so_called interologs and or that orthologs will share neighbourhood topology while there is some evidence for the existence of such conserved interactions across species particularly in proteins with

permissions_oup comfound taking the noise and incompleteness of the data into account that the fraction of correctly transferred interactions is at most between reasonably diverese species even if orthologs are defined as those proteins matched with a blast e val moreover current evidence points to a far larger rate of change in ppis than expected specific interaction matches seem not to be the rule but rather the exception thus we do not follow the network_alignment paradigm but instead we take our lead from alignment_free methods that have been used to identify evolutionary_relationships alignment_free based on k tuple counts also called k grams or k words have been applied to construct trees from sequence_data a key feature is the standardization of the counts to separate the signal from the background_noise inspired by alignment_free we use subgraph counts instead of sequence_homology or functional one to one matches to compare networks yet even when comparing synthetic networks of the same size generated from the same model their small subgraph content can be volatile our proposed method netdis compares the subgraph content not of the networks themselves but instead of the ensemble of all protein neighbourhoods ego networks in each network through an averaging many to many approach the comparison between these ensembles is summarized in a netdis value which in turn is used as input for phylogenetic_tree the biological intuition for our new approach is based on a collection of results the idea of using the subgraph content to build a distance between networks arises because motifs and modules have long been identified as important components of biological_networks and have been conjectured to play_an in evolution see alsoand pr zulj for previous explorations of biological_network comparison based on subgraph counts a key idea of our article is not to compare just the subgraph content of two networks but instead the ensembles of subgraphs of the two networks as hinted at in this use of subgraph content ensembles means that netdis requires only the interaction data and is very different in concept from ppi_network alignment_methods netdis differs from standard subgraph count approaches in two key aspects it introduces the ensemble view and applies a standardization that controls for background_noise we first use our method on simulated networks using several random graph models and show that it correctly classifies networks by model type even when confounded by varying network density and size we then use it to successfully reconstruct the correct phylogenetic_tree for the set of organisms for which significant ppi data are currently available our ability to reconstruct correct phylogenies adds evidence that ppi data retain evolutionary_information despite the lack of conservation of individual interactions we have also investigated our methods ability to separate by type a large set of networks from several biological and non biological domains the resulting tree is found to be highly clustered by domain type outperforming a recent and far more computationally_intensive community detection approach in all of the results that follow unless stated otherwise netdis was calculated using k and the dip core yeast interaction dataset as the gold_standard to test the robustness of the method we also used a simulated gold_standard network using the er model with nodes and edges see supplementaryfor results while using netdis with k is expected to increase the sensitivity of the method preliminary_analysis of the datasets used for this study indicated little benefit of the latter at the cost of substantially more computing time spent in induced subgraph counting in this article we add evidence to the idea that the topology of protein_interaction alone contains evolutionary_information without any additional biological data our results reveal that current ppi data are sufficiently abundant to derive correct phylogenetic_relationships at least between the model species from ppi data with genome_coverage of at least our method netdis is able to deduce correct phylogenies between species without resorting to sequence_homology we emphasize that netdis is not proposed as a competitive method for the generation of phylogenetic_trees for biological species existing techniques based on molecular sequences already address this particular problem comprehensively our main_result is that from the topology of protein_interaction alone it is possible to generate a correct phylogenetic_tree it is therefore worth considering the underlying assumptions of netdis explore what they may reveal about protein_interaction evolution the core principle of this work is that species that are more related will on average share more ppi_network neighbourhoods that are topologically similar than unrelated species do it is tempting to assign a biological_interpretation to the netdis algorithm a given biological_function is normally credited to a community of interacting_proteins that act together to perform that function in the cell closely_related will have on average more of these communities in common our method detects this phenomenon by comparing ensembles of ego networks derived from the ppi_networks netdis could also be used to consider the similarities between biological_networks during a cellular or adaptive_response where it is thought that understanding the differences between these networks is key obtaining phylogenies of cell states based on network data would provide a biological_perspective on these phylogenies which would be both newand completely_free from sequence_data this perspective would further complement phylogenies derived from phenotypic_traits with another type of molecular data the method could be refined by adding information on the proteins such as protein_function structure subcellular_location or age we would expect that including such information would increase the sensitivity of the method one particular focus of our ongoing and future research_efforts will be the derivation of theoretically well founded background expectations of subgraph counts used in netdis at present the method relies on specifying a gold_standard dataset to estimate these expectations while our results so_far indicate that the method is robust to the choice of gold_standard it seems feasible that derivation of exact expectation formulas may increase method sensitivity and or remove potential_bias we conclude with noting that as no other data besides network data are used as input to the method many types of network data can be analysed together this makes the method inherently different from the network_alignment paradigm as a proof_of we presented some results indicating its ability to correctly_classify simulated networks from random graph models as well creating a reasonable taxonomy for a diverse mixture of empirical networks the ability to highlight relationships between networks from different sources in a systematic way may help researchers across different fields to identify empirical analyses or theoretical_models which are applicable to their specific problem
