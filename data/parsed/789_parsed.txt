bismark a flexible aligner and methylation caller for bisulfite seq applications a combination of bisulfite_treatment of dna and high_throughput bs_seq can capture a snapshot of a cells epigenomic state by revealing its genome_wide cytosine_methylation at single_base bismark is a flexible tool for the time efficient analysis of bs_seq data which performs both read_mapping and methylation calling in a single convenient step its output discriminates between cytosines in cpg chg and chh context and enables bench scientists to visualize and interpret their methylation data soon after the sequencing run is completed availability_and bismark is released under the gnu gplv licence the source_code is freely_available from www bioinformatics bbsrc ac uk projects bismark cytosine_methylation of dna serves as an important epigenetic_mechanism to control gene_expression silencing or genomic_imprinting both during development and in the adult aberrant_methylation has been associated with a variety of diseases including cancer current massively_parallel methods to study dna_methylation include enrichment based_methods such as methylated_dna immunoprecipitation medip_seq or methylated_dna binding_domain sequencing mbd seq as well as direct_sequencing of sodium_bisulfite treated dna bs_seq methods compared in bisulfite_treatment of dna leaves methylated_cytosines unaffected while non methylated_cytosines are converted into uracils subsequent pcr_amplification converts these uracils into thymines for any given genomic locus bisulfite_treatment and subsequent pcr_amplification give rise to four individual strands of dna which can potentially all end up in a sequencing_experiment supplementary_material mapping of bisulfite treated sequences to a reference_genome constitutes a significant computational challenge due to the combination of i the reduced complexity of the dna code ii up to four dna_strands to be analysed and iii the fact that each read can theoretically exist in all possible methylation states even though there are a number of excellent short_read to whom correspondence should be addressed tools available e g bowtie these do not perform bisulfite mapping themselves the methylation_state of positions involving cytosines is determined by comparing the read sequence with the corresponding genomic_sequence depending on the strand a read mapped against this can involve looking for c to t as shown here or g to a substitutions a requires library to be constructed with an initial sequence tag na not available data required a lot of post_processing and computational knowledge bismark aims to generate a bisulfite mapping output that can be readily explored by bench scientists thus in addition to the alignment process bismark determines the methylation_state of each cytosine position in the read dna_methylation in mammals is thought to occur predominantly at cpg_dinucleotides however a certain amount of non cpg_methylation has been shown in embryonic_stem in plants methylation is quite common in both the symmetric cpg or chg and asymmetric chh context whereby h can be either a t or c
