genome_analysis using bioinformatics to predict the functional impact of snvs motivation the past_decade has seen the introduction of fast and relatively inexpensive methods to detect genetic_variation across the genome and exponential_growth in the number of known single_nucleotide snvs there is increasing interest in bioinformatics approaches to identify variants that are functionally_important from millions of candidate variants here we describe the essential components of bionformatics tools that predict functional snvs results bioinformatics_tools have great_potential to identify functional snvs but the black_box nature of many tools can be a pitfall for researchers understanding the underlying methods assumptions and biases of these tools is essential to their intelligent application the most common form of intra species variation is the single_nucleotide snv recent sequencing of whole human_genomes has identified the number of snvs in each individual to be in the range of million common snvs have recently been a focus of population_genetics and medical_research with the advent of high_density snv microarrays researchers can do fast genome_wide genotyping of study populations this technology has been used to trace the ancestry of modern humans and migration_patterns of ancient humans snvs are now the most commonly used markers in casecontrol association studies genome_wide gwas have identified over common snvs with statistically_significant correlations to disease_phenotypes http www genome gov gwastudies october however these correlations do not necessarily imply causality and researchers have found that most significant snvs identified by gwas do not contribute biologically to the disease phenotype of interest while most snvs are likely to be functionally neutral some snvs have a functional impact and thus directly contribute to disease susceptibilities and drug sensitivities discovering these to whom correspondence should be addressed in an age of personal_genomics snv prioritization has become essential this task can now be facilitated by snv meta servers which are essentially black boxes to automate execution of multiple assessments one for each of the many factors that can lead to a functional snv however anyone who uses black_box snv assessment_tools should understand how the assessments are made and what their limitations are one limitation shared by all of the prediction_methods described in this review is that prediction relies on knowledge and our knowledge is incomplete for example current ess predictors are based on only one family of splicing_factors hnrnp family proteins but there is no reason to believe that these proteins represent the complete universe of esss happily our knowledge is likely to expand thanks to new technologies chip_seq technology represents a significant advance in evaluating the impact of snvs on dna_binding because there is no requirement of knowing the precise binding sequences in advance this technology will facilitate research on the impact of snvs on dna_methylation chromatin and transcription_factor binding and rna_processing through clipseq additionally the task of snv assessment is likely to benefit from research currently underway on assessing the consequence of gains or losses of tfbss predicting isres and further characterizing microrna binding chromosomal segmentation may soon offer new insights on the medical relevance of intergenic snvs by distinguishing active intergenic chromatin from largescale repressed chromatin a communitywide effort cagi critical assessment of genomic interpretation has been created to compare analytical_methods to assess genomic_variation through blind prediction modeled after the casp contests and should provide_excellent information on what types of methods are effective in practice http genomecommons org cagi
