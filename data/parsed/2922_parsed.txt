metasv an accurate and integrative structural variant caller for next_generation structural_variations svs are large genomic_rearrangements that vary significantly in size making them challenging to detect with the relatively short_reads from next_generation ngs different sv_detection methods have been developed however each is limited to specific kinds of svs with varying accuracy and resolution previous_works have attempted to combine different methods but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions we propose metasv an integrated sv caller which leverages multiple orthogonal sv signals for high_accuracy and resolution metasv proceeds by merging svs from multiple tools for all types of svs it also analyzes soft clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing_tools underestimate insertion svs local_assembly in combination with dynamic_programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution paired_end and coverage_information is used to predict sv genotypes using simulation and experimental_data we demonstrate the effectiveness of metasv across various sv types and sizes availability_and code in python is atsvs have been implicated in contributing to genomic_diversity as well as genomic disorders therefore a significant amount of work has been done on detecting svs generally a tool for detecting svs uses one or more of the following signals from read_alignments split_read reads with split alignments e g pindel read_pair abnormal paired_end alignments e g breakdancer depthof coverage abnormal coverages e g cnvnator junction mapping alignments to known sv breakpoints e g breakseq or assembly around potential breakpoints e g mindthegap however there is no signal that comprehensively detects all types of svs since each has a niche of sv types and sizes where it v c the author published_by we demonstrate the effectiveness of metasv using the varsim simulation and validation framework simulated bp ngs_reads were generated at coverages for the na genome using published variant sets the reads were aligned using bwa mem for comparing reported svs against the ground_truth we use a reciprocal overlap of and a wiggle of bp which captures accuracy at a high breakpoint resolution the sv size cutoff was set to bp since smaller variants are a target of indel callers such as gatks haplotypecaller our results show that each method has varying performance in different sv size ranges by integrating_multiple methods metasv achieved a steady performance across all sizes we report accuracy as f score which is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision for this dataset metasv achieved an f score of sensitivity and precision were and respectively for deletions indicating high_accuracy and resolution for insertions it achieved an f score of sensitivity and precision were and respectively comparing to less than for all the individual tools analyzed insertion length was omitted from the accuracy analysis since long insertions cannot be assembled completely with ngs_reads nevertheless the significantly_enhanced detection of insertion events can definitely improve interpretation largely as they may cause impactful disruption in the genome finally genotyping accuracies of and were achieved for deletions and insertions respectively shows detailed accuracy comparisons for both deletion and insertion detection across different sv sizes and tools for deletions metasv performance was the highest across all sv sizes in most cases it improves upon the best performing individual tool for a given size for insertions the improvement due to metasv was more significant since all tools with the exceptiontherefore almost all improvement in accuracy is due to our insertion detection enhancementour soft clip based_approach is very sensitive while the assembly step for insertion detection yields high_precision in contrast to pindel which had low precision as with deletions small insertions are more difficult to detect in general detailed accuracy comparisons for other sv types are discussed in the supplementary text in order to study the impact on accuracy and runtime of varying coverages we generated additional simulation datasets with bp reads at and coverages we also generated bp reads at coverage to investigate the impact of increasing read_length for the same coverage although accuracy dropped for lower coverages metasv was still the most stable and most accurate with deletion f scores of and for and coverages respectively for bp read_length f scores of and were achieved for deletions and insertions respectivelyinsertion accuracy dropped slightly over bp reads due to reduced read_count for the same coverage furthermore it took around h to run all the four aforementioned tools for metasv as well as metasv on a single_node with dual hexcore x intel_xeon processors for coverage because metasv is parallelized in all its steps its speed should scale linearly with the number of available cores in addition to simulation we used the publicly_available illumina platinum genomes sequencing_data for na as a real testbed due to the lack of high_confidence comprehensive sv calls particularly for insertions false_positive cannot be accurately_determined using real_data therefore only sensitivity for deletions was reported here for deletions a sensitivity of was achieved against the complete genomics high_confidence callset for na generated using their analysis_pipeline version which is similar to our simulation_results complete genomics was used since it is an orthogonal sequencing_platform providing a less biased validation
