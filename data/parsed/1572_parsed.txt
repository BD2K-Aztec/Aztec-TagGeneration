systems_biology empirical_bayes conditional_independence graphs for regulatory_network recovery motivation computational inference methods that make use of graphical_models to extract regulatory_networks from gene_expression data can have difficulty reconstructing dense regions of a network a consequence of both computational_complexity and unreliable parameter_estimation when sample_size is small as a result identification of hub_genes is of special difficulty for these methods methods we present a new algorithm empirical light mutual min elmm for large network_reconstruction that has properties well suited for recovery of graphs with high degree nodes elmm reconstructs the undirected graph of a regulatory_network using empirical_bayes conditional_independence testing with a heuristic relaxation of independence constraints in dense areas of the graph this relaxation allows only one gene of a pair with a putative relation to be aware of the network connection an approach that is aimed at easing multiple testing problems associated with recovering densely_connected structures results using in silico data we show that elmm has better performance than commonly used network_inference including genenet aracne foci genie and glasso we also apply elmm to reconstruct a network among genes expressed in human lung airway_epithelium of healthy non smokers healthy smokers and individuals with chronic_obstructive assayed using microarrays the analysis_identifies dense sub networks that are consistent with known regulatory_relationships in the lung airway and also suggests novel hub regulatory_relationships among a number of genes that play roles in oxidative_stress and secretion availability_and software for running elmm is made available ata combination of microarray and next_generation are producing data on the gene_expression that characterize the to whom correspondence should be addressed genomic and regulatory states of cell_populations these data contain information that can be mined to identify regulatory_relationships responsible for genomic_profiles and that are important for understanding processes underlying_disease development a variety of algorithms making use of probabilistic_graphical both directed and undirected have been used to recover putative network_structure from such data these approaches have been successful in recovering networks with broad_scale topology which are consistent with gene and pathway annotations where some of the predicted relationships have been verified by experiments to deal with the high_dimensionality and small_sample of training data that is typical of gene_expression experiments researchers have used various strategies including regularized estimation of parameters learning sparse networks empirical estimation of testing statistics and mutual_information methods these approaches were shown to improve the accuracy of the network_inference especially when the recovered network is sparse in spite of these advances the goal of highly_accurate recovery of regulation networks which are not necessarily sparse remains a difficult problem in this article we present a new algorithm empirical light mutual min elmm for reconstructing undirected networks from gene_expression data which has properties well suited for recovering dense network regions when the size of the observed samples is small elmm is a variant of bayesian_network bn inference approaches that include reconstruction of an undirected graph the skeleton of the bn using conditional_independence ci testing elmm uses an empirical_bayes approach to learn the independence dependence parameters from gene_expression data an approach that has been found to have good properties for dealing with small samples and noisy_data in addition elmm uses a heuristic relaxation of independence testing that aims at easing the effects of the multiple_testing when recovering densely_connected sub graphs we assessed the performance of elmm using in silico networks simulated based on known regulatory_mechanisms and network_topologies in yeast and escherichia_coli the analysis shows that elmm has a higher accuracy compared with popular network recovery algorithms including genenet copyedited by sk manuscript category original paper
