structural_bioinformatics hidden conformations in protein_structures motivation prediction of interactions between protein residues contact_map can facilitate various aspects of d structure modeling however the accuracy of ab_initio contact_prediction is still limited as structural_genomics initiatives move ahead solved structures of homologous_proteins can be used as multiple_templates to improve contact_prediction of the major conformation of an unsolved target protein furthermore multiple_templates may provide a wider view of the proteins conformational_space however successful usage of multiple structural templates is not straightforward due to their variable relevance to the target protein and because of data redundancy issues results we present here an algorithm that addresses these two limitations in the use of multiple structure templates first the algorithm unites contact_maps extracted from templates sharing high_sequence with each other in a fashion that acknowledges the possibility of multiple_conformations next it weights the resulting united maps in inverse proportion to their evolutionary distance from the target protein testing this algorithm against casp_targets resulted in high_precision contact_maps remarkably based solely on structural data of remote homologues our algorithm identified residueresidue interactions that account for all the known conformations of calmodulin a multifaceted protein therefore employing multiple_templates which improves prediction of contact_maps can also be used to reveal novel conformations as multiple_templates will soon be available for most proteins our scheme suggests an effective procedure for their optimal consideration protein_structure representations vary in their level of detail from precise atomic_resolution models to the coarser contact_maps that provide information at the level of the interactions between amino_acid despite its low_resolution contact_map representation to whom correspondence should be addressed holds advantages for specific applications for example in multiple conformation analysis whereas structural_alignment of conformations requires structural superimpositions contact_map representation which is translation and rotation invariant allows straightforward comparison of multiple_conformations these advantages motivate the development of algorithms aimed at predicting intramolecular residueresidue interactions these algorithms often do not use any explicit structural_information but instead rely on statistical_methods that quantify the correlation between columns in a multiple_sequence msa also known as correlated mutation analysis improved_performance has been achieved by various machine_learning that incorporate correlated mutation measures and other features currently the best performing ab_initio contact predictor is nncon as determined by the analysis performed during the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp however despite the considerable progress the performance of ab_initio contact_map prediction_methods is still insufficient for most potential applications fortunately structural_information extracted from templates can facilitate contact_prediction some template based predictors use various approaches to construct d models of the target then extract a contact_map from each model and finally produce the consensus contact_map the rationale behind this approach is that a consensus of many inaccurate models will have a much higher reliability than predictions that are based on any single model other template based predictors implement machine_learning to incorporate contact_map information extracted from several templates c whereas template based structure_prediction may allow more accurate_models it has an intrinsic drawback the template captures the protein in a single conformation however the existence of an ensemble of conformations is often important for the function interactability and evolvability of proteins in this study we suggest that taking_into multiple_templates offers two opportunities i the ability to improve contact mapmultiple structural templates are already available in the pdb for about half of the casp_targets supplementary figs s and s below we demonstrate that incorporating information extracted from multiple_templates substantially boosts correct prediction of protein contact_maps compared with all alternative_approaches figs and and supplementary figs s and s furthermore we demonstrate that our algorithm often results in a contact_map that captures an ensemble of conformations that the protein can adopt as illustrated for calmodulin in structural_biology the ability to represent a protein as a contact_map is instrumental for example contact_map representation is useful for the identification of structural_motifs and for quantification of structural_alignment recently prediction of intramolecular helixhelix interactions which was based on predicted contact_maps enabled the design of biologically_active that hold therapeutic promise in cancer and inflammation in addition several groups suggested approaches for reconstructing d models from contact_maps b other studies use predicted contact_maps as constraints in d modeling to enhance convergence to the best model to refine the created models or to eliminate incorrect models after the modeling process is completed in the current study we suggest an approach for combining structural data from several templates to enhance contact_map of novel proteins the basic idea is that tools that capture a wider view of the protein conformational_space can provide useful insights on the contact_map level and serve as a better starting_point for downstream_analysis involving contact_maps e g d modeling indeed as structural_genomics initiatives move ahead it has become more likely to find at least one structural template for most proteins furthermore as revealed in supplementary many proteins already have at least two potential templates the contact_map predicted by the wmc algorithm succeeded in two different tests wmc exhibits better performance than any other contact_prediction method when evaluated against a single conformation as done in casp and supplementary figs s and s and it also enables the prediction of a united contact_map that considers the multiple_conformations that a protein can adopt as demonstrated for human calmodulin this study suggests that the performance of template based contact prediction_methods can be improved_significantly by using information extracted from multiple_templates a similar conclusion was suggested for the case of d modeling several methods such as modeller and swissmodel utilize structural constraints derived from a template or multiple_templates to assist d modeling the dynamic nature of proteins as exemplified by the variation of intramolecular contacts observed in different conformations pose the challenge of predicting contacts in each of the different conformations our study suggests a scheme for template based contact_prediction that
