structural_bioinformatics anchorms a bioinformatics tool to derive structural_information from the mass_spectra of cross_linked protein_complexes mass_spectrometry is being increasingly used in the structural_elucidation of mega dalton protein_complexes in an approach termed ms d referring to the application of ms to the study of macromolecular structures this involves the identification of cross_linked residues in the constituent proteins of chemically cross_linked multi subunit complexes anchorms was developed to simplify ms d studies by identifying cross_linked peptides in complex_peptide and to determine the specific_residues involved in each cross_link when identifying cross_linked peptide pairs clpp anchorms implements a mathematical_model to exclude false_positives by using a dynamic score threshold to estimate the number of false_positive peak matches expected in an ms_ms spectrum this model was derived from clpps with randomly_generated sequences anchorms does not require specific sample labeling or pre_treatment and anchorms is especially suited for discriminating between clpps that differ only in the cross_linked residue pairs many essential protein_complexes are composed of multiple subunits where an understanding of the structural arrangement and interactions between the constituent subunit_proteins is needed for a mechanistic insight into the function of the complex however large multi subunit protein_complexes are often not amenable to structural_elucidation by traditional_methods such as x_ray or nuclear_magnetic mass_spectrometry ms has been applied to enzymatic digests of chemically crosslinked protein_complexes to identify cross_linked peptides the identity of cross_linked peptides and the cross_linked residues indicates possible interaction surfaces this allowed the determination of the orientation and contact points of subunits within large_protein such as the subunit kda complex of pol_ii with tfiif this approach is termed ms d and requires specialized software for the analysis of the ms and the ms_ms perhaps the most challenging aspect of this type of analysis is the correct identification of low_abundance cross_linked peptide pairs clpps in complex sample mixtures a number of software_tools have been released to address this difficulty but many are orientated toward niche experimental_designs and sample treatments furthermore some implement sophisticated scoring_schemes and probability models to estimate the rate of false_positive identification generally these are either trained on specific empirical datasets or mathematically derived from theoretical principles of gas_phase peptide chemistry however if the experimental training_dataset is insufficiently diverse bias may be introduced into the resulting scoring_scheme or probability model anchorms was developed as an alternative general tool for identifying clpps in ms and ms_ms matches and the clpp length ion charge and tolerance the difference in the number of false_positive matches observed between absolute and relative tolerance modes was particularly noticeable the model is not dependent on residue composition and considers the aggregate of the residue compositions that were sampled anchorms implemented this calibrated mathematical_model as a dynamic false_positive threshold which is calculated for each putative clpp spectrum assignment those that score below the threshold value are excluded by anchorms
