hangout generating clean psi_blast profiles for domains with long insertions profile_based similarity_search is an essential step in structure_function of proteins however inclusion of non homologous sequence_segments into a profile causes its corruption and results in false_positives profile corruption is common in multidomain_proteins and single domains with long insertions are a significant source of errors we developed a procedure hangout that for a single domain with specified insertion position cleans erroneously extended psi_blast alignments to generate better profiles availability hangout is implemented in python and runs on all unix compatible platforms the source_code is available under the gnu gpl license atpsi blast is an indispensable tool for remote homology inference and structure function predictions however false_positives in psi_blast can cause errors in automated annotations one major source for such false_positives is profile corruption usually resulting from extension of alignments over non homologous sequence_regions for instance for two domain proteins ab and a c psi_blast may extend a correct alignment of the homologous domains a and a to include sequences from the non homologous domains b and c despite significant effort devoted to this multidomain problem no satisfactory solution exists currently the best approach is to start psi_blast with precisely_defined query_sequence bounds however we found that even a single well defined domain does not guarantee a corruption free profile domains hosting insertions which represent close to of domains in the structural_classification of proteins scop database may generate a corrupted psi_blast profile due to incorrect alignment extension around the insertion position our analysis shows that the n and c terminal segments of the host domain to whom correspondence should be addressed are frequently aligned as separate psi_blast high_scoring pairs hsps and the two hsps overlap when mapped onto the query_sequence each alignment can be divided_into two segments i correctly aligned and ii incorrectly aligned or extended and supplementary these incorrectly aligned overhangs are detected and removed by the hangout program to clean the profile and prepare it for consequent remote homology_searches with various tools such as psi_blast and hhsearch hangout is intended to clean psi_blast generated profiles of erroneous extensions caused by domain insertions one typical example of this domain problem is shown in an p loop hydrolase yellow in is inserted into an helical_bundle blue and red in corruption of the psi_blast alignment built from hits to the helical_bundle is evidenced by a profilebased similarity_search hhsearch which finds the p loop hydrolase domain with probability since the query helical_bundle does not share any sequence or structural_similarities with the hydrolase domain the high hhsearch probability results from profile corruption for details see supplementary given the success of this example we tested the ability of hangout to clean profiles of all scop domains with defined insertions domains as a basis for comparison psi_blast profiles were corrupted removehit cleans only of these profiles while hangout cleans all but one the single exception is probably due to distant homology since both the host and inserted domain represent similar doubly wound rossmann folds supplementary because the removal of sequence_segments from alignments may deprive the profile we also checked for the loss of true hits surprisingly cleaned hangout profiles retained of the homologs found by psi_blast profiles for removehit suggesting that useful information is not lost from the profiles compared to removehit the complexities of hangout that use domain boundary information are apparently needed to clean corrupted profiles the presence of overlapping hsps removed by removehit does not sufficiently indicate corrupted segments for remote_homologs only a single hsp may be found and incorrectly extended to cover part of the insertion although our current hangout procedure does not offer a comprehensive solution to the multidomain problem it addresses a special_case of domains with insertions that represent the major source of profile corruption when psi_blast is initiated with single discontinuous domain queries hangout will be especially useful for large_scale bioinformatics efforts that are initiated from defined structure domains and require uncorrupt sequence_profiles for subsequent analysis additional work will be done to offer a general solution without prior_knowledge of domain boundaries
