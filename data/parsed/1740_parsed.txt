genetics_and farvat a family based rare_variant test motivation individuals in each family are genetically more homogeneous than unrelated_individuals and family based designs are often recommended for the analysis of rare_variants however despite the importance of family based samples analysis few statistical_methods for rare_variant analysis are available results in this report we propose a family based rare_variant test farvat farvat is based on the quasi likelihood of whole families and is statistically and computationally_efficient for the extended families farvat assumed that families were ascertained with the disease status of family_members and incorporation of the estimated genetic_relationship matrix to the proposed method provided robustness under the presence of the population substruc ture depending on the choice of working matrix our method could be a burden test or a variance_component test and could be extended to the skat o type statistic farvat was implemented in c and application of the proposed method to schizophrenia data and simulated_data for gaw illustrated its practical importance availability the software calculates various statistics for the analysis of related samples and it is freely downloadable from http healthstats snu ac kr software farvat contact advances in genotyping technology have enabled researchers to conduct large_scale genetic_analyses and during the last decade genome_wide common genetic_loci associated with many phenotypes however heritabilities for most phenotypes are only partially explained by these significant findings and relatively small proportions of variance explained by common_variants have revealed the importance of association_analyses with rare_variants contrary to the analysis of common_variants single genetic_association with rare_variants is often associated with large false_negative unless sample_sizes or effect_sizes are very large thus association analysis with the collapsed genotype scores for a set of rare_variants has been suggested for instance minor alleles for all rare_variants in a gene or a region are counted and the disease status is regressed on minor_allele counts mac alternatively the collapsed amount of variance inflation for rare_variants can be compared between affected and unaffected individuals the former is often called a burden test while the latter is a variance_component test the burden test is statistically more efficient than variance_component methods such as c alpha and skat if most of the rare alleles have similar effects on the disease however if rare_variants with deleterious and protective_effects are combined the collapsed genotype scores for affected and unaffected individuals are similar and genetic_association with a burden test becomes inefficient whereas the variance_component method become more robust both methods can be combined into robust statistical strategies such as the skat o approach which is statistically efficient in both situations however despite these improvements in statistical_methods the high_cost of sequencing still prevents large_scale genome_wide rare_variant studies the common disease rare_variant hypothesis assumes genetic_heterogeneity between affected_individuals and selecting genetically homogeneous subjects obviously increases the rate of true_positive findings in particular family_members are genetically more homogeneous than random_samples and rare_variant with extended families can lead to identification of more disease_susceptibility variants for instance it has been shown that the enrichment of rare alleles in affected sib pairs can be equal to that of casescontrol pairs therefore rare_variant analysis with to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com carefully ascertained families seems to be an efficient strategy and the development of statistical_methods for family based samples is necessary recently family_based tests fbat statistics have been extended for application in rare_variant analysis the burden test and the variance_component test have been proposed according to the nature of fbat these tests are robust against the population_substructure and can be combined with rank_based p values based on the between family component proposed rare_variant extensions of the transmission_disequilibrium rv tdt methods which were extensions of the tdt fbat and rv tdt methods were shown to be robust and powerful for exploration of rare_variant in the population_substructure however even though robustness against the population_substructure can be provided those approaches do not take into account the parental phenotypes and power_loss can be substantial for extended_family designs alternatively studies have proposed the functional principal_component fpca and pedigree based combined multivariate and collapsing statistic pedcmc tests which are extended cochranarmitage tests for family based samples these tests use data from the whole family for rare_variant analysis and are expected to be more efficient than fbat tdt type statistics however if the effects of rare_variants are proportional to mac or the protective and deleterious variants are mixed in a gene these approaches can be less efficient in this report we propose a family based rare_variant test farvat we provide a burden test and a variance_component test for extended families and these approaches are extended to the skat o type statistic the proposed method assumes that families are ascertained based on the disease status of family_members and minor_allele mafs between affected and unaffected individuals are compared mafs for each rare_variant are estimated with the best linear unbiased estimators farvat is implemented with c and is computationally_efficient for the analysis of rare_variants with extended families with extensive simulations we compared the proposed methods with existing_methods and results showed that the proposed methods were the most efficient in the considered scenarios application of the proposed method to schizophrenia and gaw illustrated its practical value in real analyses in this article we proposed burden type c alpha type and skat o type statistics for the association analysis of rare_variants for binary_traits with extended families the proposed methods were compared with results of pedcmc fpca and rvtdt methods and with extensive simulations we showed that the proposed method was more efficient than existing_approaches in particular we found that the most efficient statistic among the proposed statistics differed according to the disease model however they were usually followed by the skat o type statistic in such scenarios and the power differences between the most efficient statistic and the skat o type statistic were small therefore farvat o seemed to be a robust choice for the analysis of rare_variants in extended families furthermore the proposed method was very rapid computationally and the farvat software for the proposed methods was implemented with c to enhance computational_efficiency the time complexity for the proposed method was and we found that analysis of the whole_genome sequence_data for individuals in the extendedfamily design could be conducted within a few hours farvat can handle various input file_formats such as the ped bed and vcf files and multithreaded genome_wide association_analyses can be conducted the software calculates various statistics for the analysis of extended families and it is freely downloadable from http biostat cau ac kr farvat however despite the analytical flexibility of the proposed method it has some limitations first the proposed method could be less efficient if some covariates associated with disease status or phenotypes of interest were continuous our recent investigation found that the power improvement of the analysis with phenotypes adjusted by blup could be substantial if each family was randomly_selected under certain scenarios however power_loss may be expected and the further investigation is necessary second we showed that incorporation of the estimated correlation_matrix to the proposed statistics provided sufficient robustness for the proposed method against the presence of population_substructure however if large_scale common_variants were not available or the level of population_substructure depended on the genomic location the proposed adjustment with the estimated correlation_matrix did not perform appropriately and different strategies would be necessary according to the level of population_substructure if large_scale common_variants are not available the fbat or tdt statistics based on so_called within family components is uniquely robust to population_substructure and the burdentype test for the fbat statistic or rv tdt methods can be used if the genomic ancestry for each individual differs for some genomic_locations the socalled hybrid analysis strategy can be a suitable alternative the proposed method can simply be extended to the statistic based on the between family component and its rank_based p value can be combined with the fbat burden type test or skat o type test advances in genotyping technology will lead to substantial cost reductions for genome_sequencing and it is expected that whole_genome may be feasible for less than a few hundred u s dollars in the near future importantly most of human genome_consists of rare_variants and thus we expect that the genetic_background for missing_heritability can be determined by rare_variant analysis however rare_variant analysis is disrupted by genetic_heterogeneity and in this context the importance of rare_variant with extended families has often been raised the proposed method enables the analysis of rare_variants within extended families and its application to extended families may provide a breakthrough for the success of genetic_association
