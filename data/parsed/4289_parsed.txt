sequence_analysis slope a quick and accurate method for locating non snp structural_variation from targeted next generation sequence_data motivation targeted deep_sequencing of specific genes or regions is of great interest in clinical cancer_diagnostics where some sequence_variants particularly translocations and indels have known prognostic or diagnostic_significance in this setting it is unnecessary to sequence an entire_genome and target capture methods can be applied to limit sequencing to important regions thereby reducing costs and the time required to complete testing existing next gen sequencing analysis packages are optimized for efficiency in whole_genome studies and are unable to benefit from the particular structure of targeted sequence_data results we developed slope to detect structural_variants from targeted short dna_reads we use both real and simulated_data to demonstrate slopes ability to rapidly detect insertion_deletion events of various sizes as well as translocations and viral_integration with high_sensitivity and low false_discovery availability binary code available atnext gen sequencing technologies_provide an enormous amount of genome data at a cost many orders_of lower than conventional capillary based sequencing methods while the use of next_generation has to date been largely confined to complex whole genome_analysis projects the technology can similarly be applied to targeted deep_sequencing of particular genes or regions of interest using this hypothesis driven approach selected genes can be analyzed for rare sequence_variants indels and translocations easily and at low_cost this approach is particularly useful in the clinical_laboratory where genes regions of known prognostic_significance can be analyzed simultaneously for structural_variation furthermore next generation technologies have the capacity to sequence multiple samples at once through the use of barcodes or indexed labels further driving down the cost of individual experiments to whom correspondence should be addressed all viral_dna red or chimeric viral human dna blue red the dna_fragments are processed into illumina paired_end libraries and hybridized with capture probes specific for viral dna_sequences fragments containing only non complementary human_genomic are washed away the captured dna including fragments with partial viral sequence matches are then eluted short cycle pcr_amplified using primers specific for the previously ligated adapters and sequenced using slope chimeric reads representing the human virus integration boundaries can be identified next generation sequence_data can be generated from whole genomes generally with coverage of to fold or from targeted_regions of interest with much higher fold coverage target enrichment_methods include standard pcr ligation mediated pcr or hybrid capture unlike pcr based_approaches hybrid capture enrichment is an amplification free method that uses labeled complementary dna_probes to hybridize to regions of interest in genomic_dna the hybridized captured dna_sequences are then physically immobilized while non complementary_sequences are washed away and the captured dna is eluted and sequenced a major benefit of hybrid capture over pcr is that non complementary_sequences adjacent to regions of complementarity are also captured permitting the identification of viral_integration as in this case or translocation breakpoints several programs including breakdancer pindel variationhunter modil and pemer to locate structural_variants from sequenced whole genomes exist however none of these software_packages isslope is a fast and accurate tool for locating translocations and other structural_variants from targeted resequenced dna slope was faster and more accurate than breakdancer in detecting real and simulated insertion_sites for mcpyv slope also required a much faster preprocessing_step alignment of the paired_end data to only the short viral_genome as compared with breakdancer which required pre alignment to a much larger genome in general the entire_human slope also had higher sensitivity_and than breakdancer for detecting indels from simulated_data slope was not quite as fast as or as specific as pindel for indel detection however except in the case of the smallest indels slopes sensitivity compared favorably with that of pindel which also does not detect translocations in addition to the efficiency attained by aligning only to the targeted reference_genome slope has the advantage of snp and gap tolerant alignments this tolerance may be an important feature for a program used to interrogate genomes of cancerous_cells we do emphasize however that slope is suitable only for targeted resequenced dna for whole_genome searches a program such as breakdancer which searches for discordant paired_reads to detect structural_variants in general or pindel which uses a fast but snp intolerant patternmatching algorithm to detect indels would be preferable another useful feature of slope is its ability to provide singlebase resolution of chimeric reads translocations are thought to underlie a wide_variety of tumor_types and specific chromosomal_rearrangements have prognostic value current methods to detect translocations including cytogenetics and fluorescence_in fish provide only a very low_resolution indicator of the chromosomal aberration furthermore cytogenetic_studies require actively_dividing cultured_cells which are not always available especially in the case of solid_tumors the ability to accurately locate and characterize translocations from a variety of specimen substrates including the ubiquitous ffpe_tissue may provide further diagnostic_information and may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which these translocations arise currently slope performs optimally for paired_end since this allows the sample to be narrowed to only those reads for which one end maps in its entirety to the reference_genome the algorithm works in just the same way for single_end however this is an important advantage in terms of analyzing data for clinical use as paired_end takes up to days as compared days for single_end sequencing use of single_end results in a widened sample space and somewhat noisier output it also results in a much slower search although the algorithm is trivial to parallelize future work will speed this search using a more sophisticated string matching algorithm given its ability to quickly and accurately define translocation breakpoints from target enriched sequence_data slope is well suited to both research and clinical_applications for example the myeloid leukemia_lymphoma mll gene on q is commonly translocated in both acute_myeloid and acute lymphoblastic_lymphoma however as more than mll translocation partners are known identification of partner_genes by fish is problematic use of a targeted sequenceenrichment approach in this case for the mll gene followed by next_generation and application of slope could theoretically identify all such translocations regardless of breakpoint location or partner gene additionally as next_generation methods are readily amenable to ffpe_tissue blocks identification of recurring translocations could easily be accomplished from page
