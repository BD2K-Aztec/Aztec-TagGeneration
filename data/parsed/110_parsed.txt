a dago fun an adaptable gene_ontology semantic_similarity based functional analysis tool gene_ontology go semantic_similarity are being used for biological knowledge_discovery based on go annotations by integrating biological_information contained in the go structure into data analyses to empower users to quickly compute manipulate and explore these measures we introduce a dago fun adaptable gene_ontology semantic_similarity based functional analysis it is a portable software_package integrating all known go information content based semantic_similarity and relevant biological_applications associated with these measures a dago fun has the advantage not only of handling datasets from the current high_throughput genome wide_applications but also allowing users to choose the most relevant semantic_similarity approach for their biological_applications and to adapt a given module to their needs availability_and a dago fun is freely_available to the research_community atrecent years have experienced an exponential_growth of publicly_available and accessible genomics proteomics and other biological data resulting from high_throughput biology technologies and computational scanning approaches retrieving information from these different biological data constitutes an essential step and challenging_task which requires the use of computational_tools and algorithms for translating these data into different applications in the context of functional_annotation data the gene_ontology provides a way of consistently describing genes and proteins in any organism producing a well adapted platform to computationally process data at the functional level currently proteins are already annotated with gene_ontology go terms in the existing biological_databases see the latest_version of goa uniprot version at http www ebi ac uk goa uniprot release released on thus enabling protein comparisons on the basis of their go annotations several semantic_similarity ss measures have been suggested to tackle major challenges for knowledge_discovery based on these go annotations the recent proliferation of these measures in the biomedical and bioinformatics areas was accompanied by the development of tools http neurolex org wiki category resource gene_ontology tools that facilitate effective exploration of these measures these tools include software_packages and web_based on line tools none of these tools support all relevant topology based_approaches in the context of go except the dago fun on line tool v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com implementing the go universal metric theapproaches the g sesame on line tool and the gosemsim r package which implement theapproach these tools are often context dependent and only implement ss measures shown to perform well in a specific application moreover these tools work only for proteins contained in the goa dataset or existing go annotated organisms for ss calculations and each has its specific gene or protein identifier id system making_it to meet input requirements of current genome and proteome wide_applications from high_throughput analysis here we present a dago fun adaptable gene_ontology semantic similaritybased functional analysis which overcomes these limitations enabling effective exploration of different protein functional similarity_measures calibrating datasets from high_throughput experiment analyses and providing researchers with the freedom to choose the most relevant measure for their specific applications using their gene or protein id system and associated go annotations a dago fun provides a python portable application to the large community of go users and to a broad computational audience enabling tool designers or developers and experienced end_users as well as non programmers to retrieve ss scores this application can be extended modified and adapted to a defined user need ensuring that go ss data and related biological_applications are conveniently accessible to researchers and can effectively be used in their functional_analyses based on go annotations
