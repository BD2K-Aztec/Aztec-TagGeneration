hyperscape visualization for complex biological_networks motivation network biology has emerged as a powerful_tool to uncover the organizational properties of living_systems through the application of graph_theoretic approaches however due to limitations in underlying data models and visualization software knowledge relating to large molecular_assemblies and biologically_active fragments is poorly represented results here we demonstrate a novel hypergraph implementation that better captures hierarchical structures using components of elastic_fibers and chromatin_modification as models these reveal unprecedented views of the biology of these systems demonstrating the unique capacity of hypergraphs to resolve overlaps and uncover new insights into the subfunctionalization of variant complexes availability_and hyperscape is available as a web_application at http www compsysbio org hyperscape source_code examples and a tutorial are freely_available under a gnubiological systems captured by proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks are typically represented as graphs in which proteins are projected as nodes connected by edges other graphs such as bi partite compound and metagraphs have been used to visualize more complex relationships however overlapping complexes have not been well supported because i the tracking of interaction data at the level of biological assemblages is relatively new for example although the biopax pathway language supports the definition of such assemblages only matrixdb appears to track interactions across hierarchies and ii existing visualization_tools such as cytoscape and visant created to support simple graphs have design considerations preventing the display of overlapping clusters to overcome_these hypergraphs have been proposed as viable alternative to more meaningfully represent biological_relationships a hypergraph is a set v of vertices and a set of non empty subsets of v called hyperedges despite their ability to better represent the complexity inherent in many biological_datasets tools enabling the practical implementation of hypergraphs on a wide scale have been lacking here we provide software to translate and render biomolecule descriptions as hypergraphs and we demonstrate the usefulness of hypergraph visualization in interpreting the organization of elastic_fibers major constituents of large blood_vessels and resolving overlaps in a network of chromatin_modification with increasing interest in applying hypergraphs to study protein_complexes metabolic_pathways regulatory and signaling_networks we believe hyperscape will find wide_application in systems_biology the elastic_fiber interactome and selected neighbors note overlapping assemblies as well as an additional hyperedge blue oval depicting the interaction between collagen_iv various assemblies and the laminin nidogen complex simple edges represent experimentally_determined physical inter actions supplementary methods neighbors were selected as needed to connect all elastic_fiber components efcs into a single connected subgraph and expanded to include all additional components of multimers associated with an efc or nearest_neighbor a complete set of neighbors are included in additional online material supplementary figs s s visualization for complex biological_networks
