genetics_and treesimj a flexible forward time population_genetic simulator motivation most population_genetic simulators fall into one of two classes backward time simulators that quickly generate trees but accommodate only relatively simple selective and demographic regimes and forward simulators that allow for a broader range of evolutionary_scenarios but which cannot produce genealogies thus few tools are available that allow for producing genealogies under arbitrarily complex selective and demographic models results treesimj is a forward time population_genetic simulator that allows for sampling of genealogies genetic data and many population parameters from populations evolving under complex evolutionary_scenarios the application provides many fitness and demographic models and new models are easy to develop data_collection is performed by a variety of independently configurable collectors which periodically sample the population and record statistics output options include writing traces histograms and summary_statistics from the data collectors in addition to sampled genetic_sequences and genealogies summary treesimj allows researchers to easily sample and analyze gene genealogies and related data from populations evolving under a wide_variety of selective and demographic regimes it is likely to be useful for population_genetic researchers seeking to understand the links between evolutionary and demographic forces genealogical structure and the resulting patterns of genetic_variation the simulation of evolving populations plays an important role in many aspects of biological inquiry including the validation of new inference methods comparison of empirical data to those generated under known conditions and exploration of the dynamics of complex evolutionary_processes many publicly_available tools exist to generate nucleotide_sequences under a variety of scenarios and they are often classified by the direction of time assumed backward time or coalescent simulators track only the history of a sample of individuals and thus can rapidly generate both trees and sequence_data from populations of arbitrary size e g however these simulators require some assumptions about the nature of the evolutionary_process that may not be met in every scenario especially regarding complex selective regimes alternatively forward time simulators model time as flowing in the usual direction and typically track the state of the entire population e g while forward time simulation is less computationally_efficient than coalescent_simulation a greater range of evolutionary_models can be considered however the burden of tracking the entire state of the population often means that the genealogical trees underlying the population are not tracked thus forward simulators typically do not allow access to the genealogies that underly the data and therefore examination of the trees generated under complex evolutionary_scenarios has remained difficult using current simulation software treesimj is a simulation tool that addresses this limitation by tracking in forward time an evolving population as well as all ancestors of the current_generation thereby combining the flexibility of a forward simulator with the genealogical capabilities typical of backward simulators this combination allows researchers to investigate how the properties of non recombining genealogies are affected by evolutionary_forces for instance how variation in the strength of selection coefficients at multiple sites affects the time to most_recent tmrca of a sample alternatively various measures of tree shape for instance tree depth skewness or the mean time for two individuals to first share a common_ancestor are easily collected and viewable as time traces or as a histogram of the aggregated values in addition to tracking genealogies treesimj can also be used to collect a variety of other statistics regarding the population including many familiar population_genetic values nucleotide_diversity tajimas d haplotype diversity etc
