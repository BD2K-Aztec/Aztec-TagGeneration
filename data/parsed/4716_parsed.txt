tppred detects and discriminates mitochondrial and chloroplastic targeting peptides in eukaryotic_proteins motivation molecular_recognition of n_terminal targeting peptides is the most common mechanism controlling the import of nuclear encoded_proteins into mitochondria and chloroplasts when experimental information is lacking computational_methods can annotate targeting peptides and determine their cleavage_sites for characterizing protein_localization function and mature protein_sequences the problem of discriminating mitochondrial from chloroplastic propeptides is particularly relevant when annotating proteomes of photosynthetic eukaryotes endowed with both types of sequences results here we introduce tppred a computational_method that given any eukaryotic protein_sequence performs three different tasks i the detection of targeting peptides ii their classification as mitochondrial or chloroplastic and iii the precise localization of the cleavage_sites in an organelle specific framework our implementation is based on our tppred previously_introduced here we integrate a new n to extreme learning machine specifically_designed for the classification task ii for the last task we introduce an organelle specific support_vector that exploits sequence_motifs retrieved with an extensive motif_discovery analysis of a large set of mito chondrial and chloroplastic proteins we show that tppred outperforms the state of the art methods in all the three tasks availability_and the method server and datasets are available at http tppred the vast_majority of proteins localized in mitochondria and chloroplasts are nuclear_encoded and synthesized by the cytoplasmic ribosomes then they target the different organelles with the aid of specific and different molecular machineries still partially_characterized one of most common ones requires the interaction between the import system and specific sequence signals called targeting or transit peptides routinely these signals are located in the n_terminal region of the native protein_sequence different proteolytic_enzymes cleave targeting peptides upon protein translocation across organelle membranes the recognition and annotation of targeting peptides starting from protein_sequence assumes an important role in the characterization of the protein sub cellular_localization and function for this reason over the past_years and mitoprot specialized on chloroplasts and mitochondria respectively both are able to detect the presence of targeting peptides and to predict the position of the cleavage_site along the sequence other tools such as targetp ipsort predotar predsl can predict both the presence of a targeting peptide and the localization of the protein only predsl and targetp however perform a prediction of the cleavage_site recently we introduced tppred a method based on grammatical restrained hidden conditional_random grhcrf predicting the presence of targeting peptides and the localization of cleavage_sites in both mitochondrial and chloroplastic proteins tppred however does not address the task of discriminating the subcellular_localization on the basis of the targeting peptide tppred was introduced in order to improve the prediction of cleavage_sites in mitochondrial_proteins it exploits the information extracted from sequence_motifs known in literature and particularly frequent in the regions containing the cleavage_sites of mitochondrial targeting peptides in this article we introduce tppred a comprehensive and integrated pipeline to address the prediction of organelle targeting peptides in eukaryotic_proteins and particularly in green ones indeed in photosynthetic eukaryotes targeting peptides should be differently recognized by the import machinery in order to address both mitochondria and chloroplasts our method is organized into three different modules which collectively accomplish the following tasks i the detection of the targeting signal in the n_terminal region of the protein ii the classification of the identified signal as mitochondrial or chloroplastic iii the precise identification of the targeting peptide cleavage_site in an organelle specific_manner for the first task detection of the targeting signal we rely on our previously_developed called tppred which is based on a discriminative probabilistic sequence labeling model the detected targeting peptide is then classified into two classes mitochondrial or chloroplastic by means of an n to extreme learning machine elm model an architecture of artificial_neural specifically suited to address classification_problems involving sequences finally a refining procedure is applied in order to better localize the cleavage_site this final task is addressed by means of two organelle specific support_vector svms that exploit information derived from organelle specific sequence_motifs surrounding the cleavage_sites we extracted them with an extensive motif_discovery analysis carried_out on two datasets of experimentally_validated mitochondrial and chloroplastic targeting peptides we trained and tested the whole pipeline on a non redundant dataset of proteins previously released to test tppred and tppred and generated a different dataset for motif_discovery our results show that tppred outperforms previous_approaches in the task of predicting organelle targeting peptides in particular by exploiting organelle specific motifs it is possible to reduce the error in the exact identification of the cleavage_site in both mitochondrial and chloroplastic protein_sequences
