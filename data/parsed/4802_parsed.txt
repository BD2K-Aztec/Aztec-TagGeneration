unveiling new biological_relationships using shared hits of chemical screening_assay pairs motivation although the integration and analysis of the activity of small_molecules across multiple chemical screens is a common approach to determine the specificity and toxicity of hits the suitability of these approaches to reveal novel biological_information is less explored here we test the hypothesis that assays sharing selective hits are biologically related results we annotated the biological_activities i e biological_processes or molecular activities measured in assays and constructed chemical hit profiles with sets of compounds differing on their selectivity level for assays of chembank repository we compared the similarity of chemical hit profiles of pairs of assays with their biological_relationships and observed that assay pairs sharing non promiscuous chemical hits tend to be biologically related a detailed analysis of a network containing assay pairs with the highest hit similarity confirmed biological meaningful relationships furthermore the biological_roles of predicted molecular_targets of the shared hits reinforced the biological associations between assay pairs the screening of a library of compounds in a biological assay is a common first step in drug_discovery to find chemical hits for the drug leads a single chemical_screening experiment provides information about the activity of compounds on a target or biological_process however to determine the suitability of the chemical hit as chemical_probe or drug lead it is important to know additional properties of the compound such as its specificity and toxicity an inexpensive and efficient manner to obtain information about these properties is to learn about the activity of this compound across multiple chemical screens this approach is followed routinely in chemical screening_programs such as the nci project run by us national_cancer nci where the activity of a compound across different cancer_cell is measured to detect selective chemical hits for a particular cancer and avoid general toxicity in the past_decade several initiatives including the nih molecular libraries program and chembank have compiled chemical_biology experiments performed by different laboratories using diverse experimental_set ranging from cell_free to cell based and even whole organism based assays the analysis of these heterogeneous datasets is challenging yet offers the possibility to obtain a global view of the chemical and biological_activities of chemicals in this regard the integration and analysis of the collection of assays stored in the pubchem bioassay repository has proven to be useful to predict adverse_drug and to determine chemical_properties of promiscuous compounds that is those that appear as frequent hitters in many high_throughput assays the results of these studies suggest that a plethora of hidden molecular and biological_information in these repositories can be uncovered using integrative computational_methods this is particularly relevant for the hits of phenotypic assays for which the underlying molecular_targets responsible for their activity is unknown to determine the protein targets of the chemical hits of these assays in silico target prediction_methods are arising as an efficient approach to obtain insights into the compound mode of action for instance young et_al have shown recently that the predicted molecular_targets of hits are able to explain complex readouts of high_content assays here we exploited the vast amount of publicly_available chemical_screening assays present in the chembank database to evaluate in a systematic manner if a pair of biological_processes or molecular activities hereafter named biological_activities modulated by common chemicals in phenotype or targetbased assays respectively is related we tested and confirmed this hypothesis by the systematic analysis of the biological_activities measured in pairs of assays sharing non promiscuous compounds in this repository subsequently to understand_the linking pairs of phenotypic assays sharing chemical hits we annotated the molecular_targets of the shared hits to that aim we used hitpick a recently_developed in silico target prediction method to predict the molecular_targets of compounds we found that the known biological role of the predicted targets of common chemical hits confirms the biological_processes relationships between the phenotypic assay pairs and provides mechanistic_understanding of the relationships this approach allows us to find relationships between biological_activities and to understand better the molecular basis of the shared biological_activities in this work we have integrated and analysed the information_stored in chembank and demonstrated that the biological_activities of assay pairs sharing selective chemical hits are often related the relationships between the biological_processes of phenotypic assays are furthermore supported by the role of protein targets predicted for the shared hits fingerprint based_approaches where profiles of a collection of predefined features of an object such as a compound or protein is compared have often been exploited in chemistry and biology fields to infer properties of compounds and genes these approaches are based on the observation that similar fingerprint profiles correlate with similar properties for example compounds with similar chemical fingerprint profiles tend to have similar biological_activities likewise compounds with similar modes of action have also been observed to exhibit similar behavior across multiple assays in contrast in this study we use chemical hit based fingerprints constructed with selective compounds to infer biological_relationships between assays interestingly we show that the relationships between assays can only be captured when a stringent selectivity_filter is applied to discard promiscuous compounds from the chemical hit profile currently there is no consensus for the definition of compound promiscuity and different promiscuity filters have been proposed in the literature sch urer et_al calculated an inhibition frequency index for each compound and applied a variable threshold ranging from to of screens depending on the number of hts screens a given compound had been through although these studies have revealed interesting chemical moieties associated to unspecific signals in chemicals screens the question of what level of selectivity is necessary to capture hits carrying information about specific biological_signals has not been addressed yet in this study we have shown that a stringent promiscuity filter that first selects hits active in of the projects filter f and subsequently retains compounds with activity in of the assays within a project filter f is necessary to enrich for hits with specific biological_activities we reason that the low number of projects performed in the same experimental backgrounds generating the same unspecific signals might be the cause for the lack of correlation between hit and similarity of biological_activities of two assays after the application of filter f although this is partially overcome by discarding compounds active in several assays of the same project and consequently performed in similar experimental backgrounds filter f our approach also detects connections between cell_free assays that are apparently unrelated for example the phospholypid hydrolysis assay is associated to the deubiquitilation assay a closer look at this connection reveals artefactual yet non promiscuous hits as the shared hits of the two connections appear active in the control assays of the project termed unspecific chemical hits see this indicates that the stringent promiscuity filters applied here might for some experimental_conditions be insufficient to discard unspecific hits and additional control assays might be necessary to remove non selective chemical hits the presence of unspecific hits is also evidenced by the occurrence of edges that connect control and experiment assays for example the e_cadherin synthetic_lethal cell_growth control assay that controlled for the cytotoxicity of compounds in the human mammary_epithelial hmle cell_line is connected to the wnt and lithum modulators wnt vector experiment assay suggesting that the shared hits of the pair are not specific of the wnt_signalling process this hypothesis is further corroborated by the known or suspected anticancer_activity of the predicted targets hdac fnta and sigma non opioid i
