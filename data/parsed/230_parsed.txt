bioinformatics_discovery alternative polyadenylation_sites reveal distinct chromatin_accessibility and histone_modification in human cell_lines motivation in addition to alternative_splicing alternative polyadenyla tion has also been identified as a critical and prevalent regulatory_mechanism in human gene_expression however the mechanism of alternative_polyadenylation selection and the involved factors is still largely_unknown results we use the encode data to scan dna functional_elements including chromatin_accessibility and histone_modification around transcript cleavage_sites our results demonstrate that polyadenylation_sites tend to be less sensitive to dnase_i however these polyadeny lation sites have preference in nucleosome depleted regions indicating the involvement of chromatin higher_order structure rather than nucleosomes in the resultant lower chromatin_accessibility more interestingly for genes using two polyadenylation_sites the distal sites show even lower chromatin_accessibility compared with the proximal sites or the unique sites of genes using only one polyadenylation site we also observe that the histone_modification mark histone h lysine tri methylation h_k exhibits different patterns around the cleavage_sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation_sites from those of genes using a single polyadenylation site surprisingly the h_k levels are comparable among the alternative polyadenyla tion sites themselves in summary polyadenylation and alternative_polyadenylation are closely_related to functional_elements on the dnapost transcriptional rna_processing including capping intron splicing rna_editing and polyadenylation poly a has been recognized as important regulation steps of gene_expression alternative_polyadenylation apa is a widespread mechanism in eukaryotic_cells to control gene_expression by producing transcript_isoforms with different poly a sites it has been reported that of human genes can select apa sites in their untranslated_regions utrs even though most of the genes with apa produce identical proteins apa can also alter gene_expression by changing micrornabinding regions transportation and protein production_rates recent research provides evidence that genes have preference for isoforms with shorter utrs in embryonic or cancer_cells because these isoforms have higher translational_efficiency than longer isoforms the study of polyadenylation in five mammals demonstrated that the usage of poly a sites is more conserved in the same tissue across different species than within a species all of these reflect the functional and evolutional importance of apa regulation in general poly a sites contain two core elements the conserved aauaaa hexamer in the upstream and the gu u rich region in the downstream the aauaaa referred as polyadenylation_signal pas is located nucleotides_upstream of the cleavage_site and acts as the binding_motif for the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor cpsf the gu or u rich region located nucleotides downstream of poly a sites is recognized by the cleavage stimulatory_factor cstf cstf is recruited by cpsf and assembled into a protein complex to process polyadenylation the high evolutional conservation of these two motifs indicates their critical roles in polyadenylation to investigate other factors related to polyadenylation and the alternative selection of poly a sites we combined different types of data from the encode_project including rna pet data dnase_seq data mnase seq data and chip_seq we observed the low chromatin_accessibility around poly a sites especially around the distal poly a sites of genes using two cleavage_sites this low chromatin_accessibility is not because of the high_density of nucleosomes conversely poly a sites prefer nucleosome depleted regions in addition the higher_level of tri methylated histone h at lysine h_k was observed around apa sites compared with unique poly a sites suggesting the role of histone_modification in simultaneously deploying multiple poly a sites for a single gene however no significant_difference was detected among the multiple poly a sites themselves we discovered the low chromatin_accessibility around poly a sites across six human cell_lines especially for the distal poly a sites of genes using multiple poly a sites the phenomenon of less number of nucleosomes located around poly a sites is consistent_with specifically regions around poly a sites contained higher at than those random exonic or exon ending sites e g p wilcoxon tests nhek cell_line therefore we excluded the possibility that the lower chromatin_accessibility around poly a sites was resulted from higher nucleosome_occupancy interestingly the proximal instead of the distal poly a sites exhibited similar chromatin_accessibility with the unique poly a sites although both the distal and the unique poly a sites were the final termini of gene_transcription h_k modification was found to peak within actively_transcribed especially in exonic_regions and therefore has been considered as an indicator for transcriptional regions of genes accordingly the unique poly a sites of genes with only one cleavage_site as the transcription termini were expected to have lower h_k compared with the proximal poly a sites of apa genes surprisingly there was no significant_difference between the distal and the proximal poly a sites of the same gene these apa sites all tended to have higher h_k than the unique poly a sites indicating the distinct role of h_k in genes using apa previous study reported that h_k was more enriched at poly a sites of short isoforms than those of long isoforms this discrepancy may be due to the distinct criteria for the selection of proximal and distal poly a sites we required the usage of both sites in the considered cell_line on the contrary they pooled the poly a sites from multiple breast_tissues to claim a short or long isoform and did not require the usage of both poly a sites when they compared histone_modification signals in a specific cell_line thus some of the poly a sites of their short or long isoforms can be the unique sites according to our definitions instead of using the windows they focused on the distributions of the distance between the poly a site and the nearest h_k mark when we applied the kolmogorovsmirnov test to our selected_sites in our considered cell_lines there was still no significant_difference for the distance distributions among the apa sites of the same genes p for all the six cell_lines for the h_k study to confirm there were no additional poly a sites in the downstream we searched for the longest genomic ranges of genes ab_initio instead of relying on the known gene_annotation as we showed in section thus after identifying the initial and terminal sites of transcripts from the rnapet reads overlapped transcripts were clustered and considered as the same genes similar_results we also examined the possible associations between poly a site signals and dnase hypersensitivity nucleosome_occupancy or h_k marks the range of significant spearmans rank correlation_coefficients was to for dnase hypersensitivity to for nucleosome_occupancy and to for h_k thus the association patterns were inconsistent among different cell_lines and the correlation magnitude was small as we mentioned before the rna pet data in the encode_project are of high_quality indicating the low false_discovery even for poly a sites with low rnapet signals furthermore the level of rna pet signals is confounded by gene_expression and gene_expression is also tightly associated with dnase hypersensitivity nucleosome_occupancy or h_k marks the human poly a sites identification had been implemented by machine_learning using sequence and structural patterns around poly a sites the accuracy rate for their model or polya svm was when applying coding_sequences as the negative set here we applied the support_vector method libsvm and input dnase sensitivity nucleosome_occupancy signals and histone_marks as features the accuracy was for poly a sites prediction for apa prediction and for proximal or distal poly a sites prediction the results suggest that our discovered dna functional_elements provide comparable information with the sequence and structural patterns when predicting poly a sites in the future we can develop a complicate model to use all these features to further improve the prediction of poly a sites in conclusion we observed distinct patterns of dnase_i sensitivity and h_k around the multiple cleavage_sites simultaneously used by a gene the detailed mechanism needs more specific biological examinations in the k cell_line the big arrows indicate the apa sites of dtnbp and the uniquely deployed poly a site of hccs in the considered cell_line the apa sites tend to display higher h_k modification than the unique poly a site
