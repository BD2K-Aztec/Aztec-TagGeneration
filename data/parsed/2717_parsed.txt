databases_and linc go a human lincrna function_annotation resource based on cerna hypothesis large_numbers of long intergenic non coding rna lincrna have been detected through high_throughput however currently we still know very little about their functions therefore a lincrna function_annotation database is needed to facilitate the study in this field in this article we present linc go a web_resource that aims to provide comprehensive functional_annotations for human lincrna microrna mrna and microrna lincrna interaction data were integrated to generate lincrna functional_annotations based on the competing endogenous rna hypothesis to the best of our knowledge linc go is the first database that makes use of the competing endogenous rna hypoth esis to predict lincrna functions availability freely_available atlong intergenic non_coding lincrnas are endogenous long_non molecules that transcribed from intergenic_regions of the genome in recent_years as highthroughput sequencing_technology developed more and more lincrna have been identified it has been demonstrated that lincrnas play_critical regulating multiple important biological_processes however currently most lincrnas are still poorly_studied owing to the importance of lincrna it has become very necessary to develop computational_tools to predict lincrna functions previous researchers have proposed a co expression based method to predict lincrna functions and achieved many meaningful_results that is if a lincrna is coexpressed with a protein_coding whose function is already known then the lincrna is predicted to take similar functions in this article we predict lincrna functions in a rather different approach and present linc go a novel lincrna function_annotation database instead of using the co expression information of lincrna and protein_coding our work is based on the competing endogenous rna hypothesis cerna hypothesis lincrna can function as microrna sponge to interact directly with microrna and prevent them from binding to mrna in this way lincrna regulates gene_expression and meanwhile regulates the biological_processes in which they get involved in for example maml and mef c are two important transcription_factors that activate muscle specific gene_expression marcellashowed that a lincrna linc md regulates muscle_differentiation by interacting with two micrornas mir and mir which can bind to maml and mef c to regulate their expressions based on the above fact it is natural to infer that if a lincrna and an mrna share some micrornas that can interact with both of them then the two have similar biological_functions in the finally generated functional_annotations there were lincrnas that were assigned with at least one go bp term we did a detailed analysis of go bp terms and showed that lincrnas play_critical multiple_biological such as nervous_system processes cellular development cell_cell biological adhesion cellular_component organization and so on see_supplementary as we know linc go is the first database that provides comprehensive human lincrna function_annotations the linc go has provided a user_friendly interface to access functional_annotations see supplementary three additional text_files in csv format that contain all predicted functional_annotations are also downloadable to provide convenient access in computational projects
