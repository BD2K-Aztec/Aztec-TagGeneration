gene_expression adaption of the global test idea to proteomics_data with missing_values motivation global test procedures are frequently used in gene_expression analysis to study the relationship between a functional subset of rna_transcripts and an experimental group factor however these procedures have been rarely used for the analysis of high_throughput data from other sources such as proteome expression data the main difficulties in transferring global test procedures from genomics to proteomics_data are the more complicated way of obtaining functional_annotations and the handling of missing_values in some types of prote omics_data results we propose a simple mixed_linear in combination with a permutation procedure and missing_values imputation to conduct global tests in proteomics experiments this new approach is motivated by protein expression data obtained by means of d gel elec trophoresis within a mouse experiment of our current research a simulation_study yielded that power and testing level of the mixed model alone can be affected by missing_values in the dataset imputation of missing_values was able to correct for a bias in some simulation_settings our new approach provides the possibility to rank gene_ontology go terms associated with protein_sets it is also helpful in the case in which a specific protein is represented by multiple spots on a d gel by considering these spots also as a protein set analysis of our data_points at correlations between the deficiency of the protein calreticulin and protein_sets related to biological_processes in the heart_muscle availability_and our proposed approach is included in the r package repeatedhighdim which already contains a global test procedure for gene_expression data the package can be retrieved from http cran rcan certain molecular_functions cellular_components or biological_processes be related to the levels of the grouping factor of a study or an experiment this question is frequently studied in the analysis of expression data from high_throughput experiments e g with dna_microarrays to answer_this expression levels of those features that are connected to a particular molecular_function can be compared between the different study groups with this approach grond for example detected a relation between a set of genes involved in the molecular_mechanisms of inflammation and acute_ischemic in another study detected a relation between genes involved in the p pathway and the union for international cancer control uicc stages of colorectal_cancer statistically the previously mentioned questions can be analyzed by means of global test procedures in contrast to methods that analyze the expression levels of all features from a highthroughput experiment individually a global test focuses on sets of features that are all involved in the same biological_function or cellular pathway although a number of global test approaches for the analysis of functional gene_sets have been published the idea was rarely considered in protein expression data from proteomics experiments in such experiments protein expression is usually measured in a high_throughput manner by either mass_spectrometry ms or d gel_electrophoresis de for protein expression data measured by ms a global test approach based on hotellings t statistic to relate specific phenotypes to functionally_related sets of proteins was proposed by besides an approach for testing protein set enrichment in ms experiments was presented in this article we present a new approach for global testing of functional protein_sets in the case where expression levels are measured by de although the ms based protein expression data referred to bypresent as a complete d n matrix i e without missing_values up to of entries may be empty in the matrix of de based expression data however missing_values are also not atypical in ms based data because of missing peaks in the mass_spectra here d denotes the number of proteins and n the sample_size missing_values in protein expression data from de are because features on a d gel are not placed on an ordered grid like the probe_sets on a dna_microarray where the location of each particular feature is known in contrast spots of labeled_proteins appear at more or less different locations on d gels and spot matching algorithms must be used to bring the information of the experimental replications in line for a number of protein_spots the matching fails and missing_values occur therefore a global test procedure for proteomics_data from de has to deal with two main difficulties on the one hand there is an issue of missing_values and on the other hand it is more complicated to get functional_annotations for the protein to whom correspondence should be addressed spots as these spots must first be removed from the gel and the underlying protein must be identified by ms unlike dna microarray_data where the identity of a probe set is given directly not specific for de data the problem for all high_throughput data is that the number d of features in a functional set can be much larger than that of the sample_size n the new approach we present here is based on a simple mixed_linear which is able to handle missing_values in combination with a permutation algorithm to account for the high_dimensionality we evaluate this approach when being applied on the incomplete_data on the one hand and on data filled up by a missing_value procedure proposed byon the other hand our article is structured as follows we first detail the mixed_linear the permutation procedure and the missing_value algorithm followed by a description of our proteomics experiment next we evaluate the methods in a simulation_study and apply them to the data example finally we provide a discussion of the results and give some conclusions the de is widely used in proteomics research to date gel spots are typically compared between the experimental_groups only individually also several spots may belong to the same protein or to the same functional term related to some biological_processes cellular_component or molecular_function like in dna microarray_analysis global tests for comprehensive testing of functional subsets of genes are not available for gel_based proteomics_data furthermore most global tests used for the analysis of genomics data do not allow for missing_values as typical in gel_based or ms based protein expression data in this regard we studied the applicability of a simple global test procedure to such proteomics_data and evaluated the effect of missing_values onto the testing level and the power our simulations with arranged and real_world covariance_matrices have shown that in combination with a permutation procedure a pre specified testing levels can be maintained in diverse scenarios permutation approaches were also successfully used in global test procedures in genomics to correct for biases in the testing level with regard to our simulation_results we would generallyrecommend the permutation approach for global tests on gelbased proteomics_data with missing_values without permutation procedures the global test performed poor in each of our simulated scenarios our simulations also yielded that scenarios with unequal sizes of the experimental_groups a a b b are critical with regard to testing level and power however in one of these cases b a bias through missing_values could be corrected by means of a missing_values imputation approach in more detail an inappropriate decrease of simulated levels was observed in scenarios a and a whereas an inappropriate increase of simulated levels was observed in scenarios b and b from these results we would recommend that users should use the mixed model without imputation procedure in the case of unequal sample_sizes interestingly the missing_values were more frequent in the calr than those in wt group in our example from this one could conclude that the missingness is group specific here however it is known that in multiplex gel approaches where a gel is prepared with more than one sample e g one treatment and one control sample missing_values appear parallel in both groups although the p values in our analysis of the real_data from our mouse experiment were not adjusted for multiple testing the generation of p values by the global test procedure allowed at least for a ranking of functional terms therefore we are cautious with the biological conclusions in this concrete example nevertheless the analysis of our mouse data_points at correlations between the deficiency of the protein calreticulin and protein_sets related to biological_processes in the heart_muscle these correlations were also reported in the context of other experiments moreover our analysis detected a correlation between the protein actin alpha cardiac_muscle and the experimental group factor calreticulin likewise this correlation was reported_earlier in another experiment both reproductions of known results show additional to the simulation_results that our methods produced reasonable_results it should also be pointed_out that the protein actin alpha cardiac_muscle was not detected in the analysis of the individual spots but detected only when analyzed as a set of multiple spots this might be explained by an increased statistical_power when testing a set of spots globally in comparison to individual testing an alternative to global tests can be enrichment_analysis in microarray_analyses for example enrichment tests are used to see whether a certain functional term is overrepresented among the differentially_expressed features compared to the non significant features in the context of gel_based expression data such an enrichment approach appears to be less reasonable because not each gel spot is identified and related to a functional_annotation an enrichment procedure proposed for mass_spectrometric protein expression data by is therefore not adequate for gel_based data thus our proposed global test procedure is a more useable approach for the biological_interpretation of group comparison in gel_based proteomics although we focused specifically on global tests for gel_based proteomics_data other proteomics_data e g from liquid_chromatography ms_ms lc_ms experiments are also concerned with missing_values for these cases further methodsnote the upper part lists the top five terms in the different ontology domains in the lower part gel spots that were assigned to the same protein were tested as a set for missing_values imputation have been proposed because the frequency of lc_ms experiments has overtaken that of de experiments in proteomics the adaption of the global test idea to these types of data presents an interesting challenge for subsequent research
