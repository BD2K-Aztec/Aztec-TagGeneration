gene_expression genome_wide in silico prediction of gene_expression motivation modelling the regulation of gene_expression can provide insight into the regulatory_roles of individual transcription_factors tfs and histone_modifications recently ouyang et_al in modelled gene_expression levels in mouse_embryonic mes cells using in vivo chip_seq measurements of tf_binding chip_seq tf_binding data however are tissue_specific and relatively difficult to obtain this limits the applicability of gene_expression models that rely on chip_seq tf_binding data results in this study we build regression_based models that relate gene_expression to the binding of different tfs histone_modifications and chromatin_accessibility dnase_i in two different tissues we find that expression models based on computa tionally predicted tf_binding can achieve_similar accuracy to those using in vivo tf_binding data and that including binding at weak sites is critical for accurate prediction of gene_expression we also find that incorporating histone_modification and chromatin_accessibility data results in additional accuracy surprisingly we find that models that use no tf_binding data at all but only histone_modification and chro matin accessibility data can be as or more accurate than those based on in vivo tf_binding data availability_and all scripts motifs and data presented in this article are available online at http research a key challenge in modern genomics is understanding the regulatory_interactions that occur to control gene_expression we can use predictive modelling techniques such as linear_regression to both determine the accuracy of our understanding of the mechanisms of the regulation of gene_expression and to interpret and offer insight into the roles played by the various regulatory_proteins rnas and other factors perhaps the most studied and best understood mechanism of gene_regulation is transcription_factor tf_binding tfs characteristically have sequence_specific preferences they typically bind sites that are short bp and often degenerate not surprisingly navenave computational_approaches that simply scan genomic_sequence for matching sites are highly prone to making false_positive in an attempt to overcome this methods incorporating evolutionary_information regarding the conservation of each putative site such as bbls have been proposed in reality however most researchers aim to make tissue cell or condition specific hereafter tissue_specific inferences regarding gene_regulation which evolutionary_information alone cannot provide histones are subject to many different covalent posttranslational_modifications such as methylation and acetylation these modifications can alter chromatin_structure and function and are known to comprise a tissue_specific histone code read by proteins to effect changes in gene_regulation and expression van recently global chromatin_immunoprecipitation with massively_parallel chip_seq maps of many histone_modifications have become available through the encode and nih roadmap epigenomics projects chip_seq is not just limited to interrogating histone state but also has become the gold_standard method for the genome_wide prediction of tissue_specific tf bound regulatory_regions unfortunately however tf chip_seq suffers from a major_drawback only one tf in a single tissue may be analysed at a time it would be an extremely significant endeavour to predict the binding of the known human sequence specific tfs in one tissue or condition as a result even large_scale projects to date have focused either on a small number of tfs across several tissues e g tfs in modencode or on a larger number of tfs in relatively few tissues e g three primary tissues in encode additionally determining an appropriate cutoff for declaring putative_binding is difficult and has been the focus of substantial research chip_seq tf_binding data have previously been used to construct a model of gene_expression in mouse_embryonic mes cells they used chip_seq binding data for tfs that are known to contribute heavily to maintaining pluripotency and thus are considered key factors_regulating gene_expression in es_cells performed linear_regression correlating binding by these tfs with the expression of all genes and found that it could explain of the variation in gene_expression in es_cells r this study did not consider the role of histone_modifications on expression but karlict al built a similar regression_model for human cd t cells using histone to whom correspondence should be addressed modification data rather than tf_binding data and also managed to explain a high degree of expression variance r in this study we use tf_binding histone_modification and chromatin_accessibility data to address three major questions i can we accurately_predict gene_expression using in silico predictions of tf_binding rather than in vivo binding data ii does adding histone_modification and chromatin_accessibility data improve the accuracy of predicted gene_expression iii are weak binding_sites important to accurately_predict gene_expression to answer_these we derive log_linear regressionbased models that relate gene_expression to the binding of different tfs to histone_modifications and to chromatin_accessibility we find that expression models based on computationally predicted tf_binding can achieve_similar accuracy to those using in vivo tf_binding data and that including binding at weak sites is critical for accurate prediction of gene_expression we also find that incorporating histone_modification and chromatin_accessibility data results in additional accuracy surprisingly we find that models that use no tf_binding data at all but only histone_modification and chromatin_accessibility data are essentially as accurate as those based on in vivo tf_binding data we have successfully explained the majority of variance in gene_expression in mes cells by building an integrated model of tfs seven histone_modifications and dnase hypersensitivity data in fact we find that gene_expression levels predicted by both the tissue_specific in silico models and the histone_modification and dnase only model are more highly_correlated with mesc rna_seq gene_expression data than microarray_data from the same tissue type the wide availability of tf_binding motifs gives our in silico method the advantage of allowing the evaluation of many different tfs without the cost and time required to perform tf chip_seq instead requiring only a pwm and h_k data in the tissue of interest surprisingly we find that using the seven histone_modifications and chromatin_accessibility dnase data alone produces a model as descriptive of expression as one using tf chip_seq by using histone_modifications and dnase data alone we explain more variation up to in gene_expression than other studies that use more complex in silico models of tf_binding which vary from to several of these models incorporate tftf interactions and other higher_order effects compared with our simpler log_linear regression_models we also find that models combining histone data with tf chip_seq outperform models using tf chip_seq alone this suggests that the histone_modifications perhaps capture an expression state containing information not captured by our tfs although using tissue_specific in silico pwm h_k predictions of our tfs alone does achieve a less accurate fit to rna_seq expression data than using chip_seq tfas we find that replacing a single tfas e f with chip_seq improves the accuracy of our tissue_specific in silico method to be indistinguishable from using all chip_seq tfass we hypothesize that this is due to both e f being the most informative of these tfs see_supplementary for predicting expression and the majority of its binding being indirect and thus not directly measurable by sequence_based replacing sox in silico tfas data with sox chip_seq tfas data however actually decreases the fit of the regression c we are unsure of why this is the case although it may be due to noise in the chip_seq dataset for sox re analyzing the sox chip_seq with more accurate chip_seq peak_calling algorithms may shed light on why the in silico sox tfas appears to give an improvement in fit over the chip_seq sox tfas a recent article shows that models using this tf chip_seq fit expression more accurately when the chip_seq are re analyzed with more accurate peak_calling algorithms using pca we extended the study of the roles of tfs to also include the roles of histone_modifications the results we obtain accurately assigning known roles to histone_modifications suggests that this method is of value for exploring regulation applying this method to the full set of histone_modification data from the nih roadmap epigenomics project would be of particular interest especially for the examination of less well studied histone_modifications due to the availability of data across a broad_spectrum of tissues some histone_modifications for example h_k are known to act combinatorially with other marks such as h_k similarly some marks are mutually_exclusive with other marks e g h_k and h k ac these marks have also been suggested to potentially play different regulatory_roles at different genomic_loci it has been suggested that the combination of marks around a tss or enhancer form a histone state using the histone states defined byrather than raw tag counts may prove to be more effective in our linear_model at capturing the combinatorial_effects of histone_modifications
