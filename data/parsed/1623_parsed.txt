genetics_and estimating and testing high_dimensional mediation_effects in epigenetic_studies motivation high_dimensional dna_methylation markers may mediate pathways linking environmental_exposures with health_outcomes however there is a lack of analytical_methods to identify significant mediators for high_dimensional mediation_analysis results based on sure independent screening and minimax concave penalty techniques we use a joint significance_test for mediation effect we demonstrate its practical performance using monte_carlo simulation_studies and apply this method to investigate the extent to which dna_methylation markers mediate the causal pathway from smoking to reduced lung_function in the normative aging study we identify cpgs with significant mediation_effects availability_and r package source_code and simulation_study are available at https github com yinanzheng hima mediation_analysis plays an important role in biomedical behavioral and psychosocial research studies typically to understand the mechanism whereby change in one variable causes change in another analytical_methods for mediation_analysis have been published extensively in the literature for example compared several methods to test the statistical_significance of the mediation effect via a monte_carlo study considered estimating and testing mediation_effects in censored_data investigated four applications of permutation_tests to the single mediator model presented the causal mediation formula based on the counterfactual approach zhang and wang introduced and compared four approaches to dealing with missing_data in mediation_analysis developed a permutation approach for testing multiple mediators for more details about mediation_analysis we refer to the review_papers by ten have and joffe and preacher a comprehensive list of literature on mediation_analysis is given in a webpage maintained by david kenny http davidakenny net cm mediate htm most of the above results are concerned with a single or multiple but low_dimensional mediators to the best of our knowledge there is very limited research on the high_dimensional mediation_effects however with the development of advanced data_collection techniques high_dimensional become increasingly common in many areas of scientific_research our motivating example is an epigenome wide dna_methylation study in the methylation process methyl_groups are added to dna at binding_sites typically referred to as cytosine phosphate guanine cpg islands which results in changes typically down_regulation to the expression of that dna illumina_infinium array is a widely used platform that allows to measure dna methylation_levels of roughly k probes resulting in high_dimensional specifically our clinical interest lies in the effect of smoking measured in pack_years on lung_function and the extent to which this effect may be mediated by methylation changes prior studies have identified cpg_sites associated with cigarette_smoking in both epigenome wide or gene specific analyses e g identifying which markers mediate the effect of smoking on lung_function is highly_desirable from a public_health perspective as it can lead to improved techniques for disease early detection and prevention however currently there are no appropriate statistical_methods developed for use in the high_dimensional mediation_analysis in this article we will adopt the multiple mediator models framework and extend it to the highdimensional setting then we propose a method to estimate and test mediation_effects in high_dimensional epigenetic_studies our key ideas are first reduce the pool of potential_mediators from a very large to a moderate number i e less than the sample_size next conduct the variable_selection with the minimax concave penalty mcp zhang third carry out joint significance testing for mediation_effects the structure of the article is given as follows in section we introduce the high_dimensional mediation regression_model and propose the estimation and inference procedures in section we illustrate the performance of our proposed procedure via extensive_simulation in section we apply our method to study the mediating effect of high_dimensional dna_methylation markers on the causal_effect of smoking on lung_function in the normative aging study section_presents some concluding_remarks and discusses further research topics
