sequence_analysis mmuflr missense_mutation and frameshift location reporter motivation cancer researchers seeking immunotherapy targets in cancer_cells need tools to locate highly_expressed proteins unique to cancer_cells missense_mutation and frameshift location reporter mmuflr a galaxy based workflow analyzes next_generation paired_read rna_seq output to reliably identify small frameshift_mutations and missense_mutations in highly_expressed protein_coding mmuflr ignores known snps low quality reads and poly a t sequences for each frameshift and missense_mutation identified mmuflr provides the location and sequence of the amino_acid in the novel protein candidates for direct input into epitope evaluation_tools next_generation ngs holds_promise for individualized targeted treatment particularly in the realm of cancer_immunotherapy identifying aberrant transcripts from a patients tumor_cells may provide candidate_target epitopes which can be used to generate patient specific vaccines given the quantity of data generated by ngs it is important to have an efficient and repeatable process to deconstruct the data and present the most relevant vaccine_targets which includes missense and small frameshift_mutations located in proteincoding regions of highly_expressed we offer missense_mutation and frameshift location reporter mmuflr as a process to analyze ngs rna_seq paired_read output to identify a limited set of peptides that may be targets for immunotherapy mmuflr is implemented as a workflow in galaxy galaxy is a server based workflow system designed to run a series of applications presented to the user as tools in an easy to use repeatable manner mmuflr uses a few custom developed galaxy tools and those in the standard distribution of galaxy in this pilot_project mmuflrs ability to identify potential vaccine_targets was tested in rna_seq derived from two benign human meningiomas however the use of mmuflr is not limited to cancer_immunotherapy it can also be used to locate prominent mutations responsible for cancer development and for other maladies such as genetic_diseases developmental defects and drug_resistance mmuflr was executed for two human meningioma rna_seq mg and mg mmuflr settings restricted the selection of candidate_genes with minimum coverage of five reads with a prevalence and a phred quality_score of or more mmuflr also ignored poly a t mononucleotide sequences of mmuflr identified frameshifts and missense_mutations in the mg sample and frameshifts and missense_mutations in the mg sample the candidates were evaluated for their presence in other samples sanger_sequencing of nine prominent candidates not found in other cancer samples verified the existence of the mutations within the tumor_samples with the mmuflr prevalence accurately reflecting the relative_abundance of the mutation within the total transcripts present because there were no normal samples available for comparison these mutations may represent rare germline variants
