genome_analysis a novel signal_processing approach for the detection of copy_number in the human_genome motivation human genomic variability occurs at different scales from single_nucleotide snps to large dna_segments copy_number cnvs represent a significant part of our genetic_heterogeneity and have also been associated with many diseases and disorders short localized cnvs which may play_an in human disease may be undetectable in noisy genomic_data therefore robust methodologies are needed for their detection furthermore for meaningful identification of pathological cnvs estimation of normal allelic aberrations is necessary results we developed a signal_processing based_methodology for sequence denoising followed by pattern matching to increase snr in genomic_data and improve cnv_detection we applied this signal decomposition matched filtering sdmf methodology to normal genomic_sequences and compared detected cnvs to those in the database of genomic_variants sdmf successfully detected a significant number of previously_identified cnvs with frequencies of occurrence as well as unreported short cnvs its performance was also compared to circular_binary cbs through simulations sdmf had a significantly_lower false detection rate and was significantly_faster than cbs an important advantage for handling large_datasets generated with high_resolution arrays by focusing on improving snr instead of the robustness of the detection algorithm sdmf is a very promising methodology for identifying cnvs at all genomic spatial_scales availability the data are available at http tcga data nci nih gov tcga the software and list of analyzed sequence ids are available at http www hsph harvard edu betensky a matlab_code for empirical_mode may be found at genome_wide dna aberrations duplications deletions and rearrangements are part of the normal human genetic_variability copy_number cnvs occur at thousands of loci across to whom correspondence should be addressed the genome to date over dna aberrations at loci have been identified and pairwise_comparisons of human_genomes suggest that they may differ by at least a fold_higher percentage than the previously_estimated based on single_nucleotide snp incidence cnvs have also been associated with many diseases and disorders and may specifically play_an in sporadic diseases array_comparative acgh is a highresolution technology that enables simultaneous interrogation of the entire_genome it involves hybridization of differentially fluorescent_dye labeled reference and test sequences on a microarray and estimation of relative allelic changes as the log_ratio of the two fluorescence_intensities cnv_detection is often limited by the resolution of the microarray and the data signal_to snr current platforms with million probes enable the detection of shorter cnvs kb and consequently capture the finer scale of genomic variability in practice detection of short cnvs is still limited by high noise levels in the data consequently methodologies that explicitly increase snr to improve cnv_detection are needed several detection methods have been proposed and applied to genomic_data with variable success they include smoothing procedures hidden_markov hmm circular_binary cbs a change_point method that segments a chromosome into regions of constant copy_number and the genome alteration detection algorithm gada based on bayesian learning these methods aim to improve the true_positive detection rate not to increase snr their performance also depends on the selection of appropriate thresholds for calling cnvs the false_discovery or the genomic identification of significant targets in cancer gistic approach are often used to establish these thresholds genomic and measurement noise as well as impurities and artifacts may contaminate acgh data decrease their snr and introduce spurious spatial correlations dimensionality_reduction methods including principal_component pca independent_component ica and wavelet_decomposition have been applied for denoising and artifactwe have developed sdmf a computationally_efficient methodology that combines the signal processing_tools of signal decomposition and matched filtering for cnv_detection in array_cgh data the latter are inherently noisy and robust cnv_detection is difficult at low snr sdmf treats genomic_sequences as spatially continuous non stationary signals which are denoised through elimination of noise related components spatially_localized matched filtering is then applied to identify regions of pairwise match mismatch through these two processes sdmf increases snr and improves the specificity of cnv_detection note that sdmf requires the selection of the matched filter length and thresholds for match mismatch and loss gain for cnv_detection these were not explicitly optimized in this study the choices of filter length and match mismatch thresholds are dataset dependent the log_ratio threshold depends on the goal of the study e g for detection of pathological cnvs it may be based on the log ratios of normal cnvs sdmf was applied to normal sequences from the
