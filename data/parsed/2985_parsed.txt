mirach efficient model checker for quantitative biological pathway_models model checking is playing an increasingly important role in systems_biology as larger and more complex biological_pathways are being modeled in this article we report the release of an efficient model checker mirach which supports any model written in popular formats such as csml and sbml mirach is integrated with a petri_net based simulation engine enabling efficient online on the fly checking in our experiment by using levchenko et_al model we reveal that timesaving gains by using mirach easily surpass compared with its offline based counterpart availability_and mirach was developed using java and thus executable on any platform installed with jdk not jre or later mirach along with its source codes documentation and examples are available atas larger and more complex biological_pathways are being modeled the manual validation of these models becomes tedious if not impossible therefore there is a growing interest in the development and application of model checking algorithms for biological pathway_models prism is a probabilistic_model checker that is widely used in many different domains as prism is meant for a wide_range of domains it has its own specific prism format for models to adhere to introduced biolab an algorithm to verify properties written in probabilistic bounded linear temporal logic using the bionetgen modeling rulebased framework genetic network analyzer gna is software for the modeling and simulation of qualitative models in the form of piecewise_linear differential_equations which also includes the ability to do model checking donaldson and gilbert a developed a monte_carlo offline based model checker mc mc has the advantage of being independent from the modeling framework and is able to perform model checking as long simulation_results can be obtained however this implies that to whom correspondence should be addressed the full simulation needs to be completed and all traversed states recorded before model checking can commence this wastes cpu and storage resources if the decision of validity or rejection for the simulation can be determined early in its execution online or onthe fly model checking does the exactly this it carries out model checking during the simulation run and results need not be recorded as simulation runs are only executed for as long as a decision needs to be made in this article we present an on the fly probabilistic_model checker mirach for quantitative pathway_models that supports popular formats such as sbml and csml http www csml org this quantitative model checker mirach would certainly be a valuable addition to the available arsenal of qualitative gna and rule_based biolab model checkers as for the latter we implemented wilson interval to estimate the confidence_interval of the probability that the property holds we have chosen to use wilson interval instead of the simpler normal_approximation interval because normal_approximation is known to perform badly when the sample probability is close to or and fail completely when it is at or due to this one cannot devise a sequential sampling algorithm that stops sampling once the confidence_interval falls below a certain value user_defined wilson interval does not have these limitations and allows us more flexibility and efficiency in our model checker in this article we have presented an efficient model checker mirach for validating the ever growing biological_pathway simulation modelsboth in complexity and quantity major_contributions include the implementation of the more efficient onthe fly approach that saves significant amounts of computation time with minimal memory increase the ability to accept quantitative_models directly in the popular sbml and csml formats and the first model checker to be integrated with the hfpne simulation engine an expressive and powerful petri_net framework for defining biological pathway_models
