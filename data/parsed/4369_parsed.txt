spladder identification quantification and testing of alternative_splicing from rna_seq motivation understanding the occurrence and regulation of alternative_splicing as is a key task towards explaining the regulatory_processes that shape the complex transcriptomes of higher eu karyotes with the advent_of of rna rna_seq the diversity of as transcripts could be measured at an unprecedented depth although the catalog of known as events has grown ever since novel transcripts are commonly observed when working with less well annotated organisms in the context of disease or within large populations whereas an identification of complete transcripts is technically_challenging and computationally_expensive focus ing on single splicing_events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful and sufficient for a wide_range of analyses results we present spladder an alternative_splicing toolbox that takes rna_seq alignments and an annotation file as input to i augment the annotation based on rna_seq evidence ii identify alternative_splicing present in the augmented annotation graph iii quantify and confirm these events based on the rna_seq and iv test for significant quantitative differences between samples thereby our main focus lies on performance accuracy and usability availability source_code are available for download at http github com rats chlab spladder example data introductory information and a small tutorial are accessible viaalternative splicing as is an mrna_processing mechanism that cuts and re joins maturing mrna in a highly_regulated manner thereby increasing transcriptome complexity depending on the organism up to of expressed genes are transcribed into multiple transcript variants where various transcripts with differing exon composition can arise from the same gene_locus throughout this text we will use the term transcript to identify a variant of a gene that was generated through transcriptional processing although these transcripts might never coexist at the same time and place each one of them can be essential for cell_differentiation development or play_an within signaling_processes thus the two major challenges in computational transcriptome_analysis are complexity and completeness in spladder we leverage evidence from rna_seq to compute a more complete representation of the splicing diversity within a sample and tackle the complexity with a reduction to alternative_splicing instead of full transcripts we provide open_source implementations for spladder in matlab and python that contain all features described below and produce v c the author published_by
