bioinformatics message from the iscb message from the iscb iscb ebola award for important future_research on the computational_biology of ebola_virus speed is of the essence in combating ebola thus computational_approaches should form a significant component of ebola research as for the development of any modern drug computational_biology is uniquely positioned to contribute through comparative_analysis of the genome_sequences of ebola strains and three_dimensional protein modeling other computational_approaches to ebola may include large_scale docking_studies of ebola proteins with human proteins and with small_molecule libraries computational_modeling of the spread of the virus computational mining of the ebola literature and creation of a curated ebola database taken together such computational efforts could significantly accelerate traditional scientific approaches in recognition of the need for important and immediate solutions from the field of computational_biology against ebola the international_society for computational_biology iscb announces a prize for an important computational advance in fighting the ebola_virus iscb will confer the iscb fight against ebola award along with a prize the international_society for computational_biology iscb is dedicated to advancing the understanding of living_systems through computation iscb now represents more than computational_biologists working in over countries it organizes more than seven annual international meetings and confers several major prizes including the iscb accomplishment by a senior scientist award the iscb overton prize and the iscb outstanding contributions award with the iscb fight against ebola award the society offers for the first time an award for a specific scientific objective thereby acknowledging the urgency of action required to fight a rising challenge
