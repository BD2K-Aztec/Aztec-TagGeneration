data_and deciphering the associations between gene_expression and copy_number using a sparse double laplacian shrinkage approach_motivation both gene_expression levels ges and copy_number cnas have important biological_implications ges are partly regulated by cnas and much effort has been devoted to understanding their relations the regulation analysis is challenging with one gene_expression possibly regulated by multiple cnas and one cna potentially regulating the expressions of multiple genes the correlations among ges and among cnas make the analysis even more complicated the existing_methods have limitations and cannot comprehensively describe the regulation results a sparse double laplacian shrinkage method is developed it jointly models the effects of multiple cnas on multiple ges penalization is adopted to achieve sparsity and identify the regulation relationships network adjacency is computed to describe the interconnections among ges and among cnas two laplacian shrinkage penalties are imposed to accommodate the network adjacency measures simulation shows that the proposed_method the competing alternatives with more accurate marker identification the cancer_genome data are analysed to further demonstrate advantages of the proposed method availability_and r code is available atboth gene_expression levels ges and copy_number cnas have important biological_implications ges are partly regulated by cnas in the recent multidimensional studies ge and cna measurements have been collected on the same subjects making it possible to study their regulation relationships analysing the regulation of ge by cna is challenging in general a cna is positively associated with the expression_level of its corresponding gene multiple studies have conducted bivariate_analysis and focused on the dependence between a ge and its corresponding cna for example proposed a procedure based on a modified correlation_coefficient to search for driver_genes of which both ges and cnas display strong equally directed abnormalities thus if we consider a regression_framework it should be multiple ges against multiple cnas as we need to search for the regulation relationships among a large number of ges and cnas with the often low sample_sizes regularized estimation and marker selection are needed the analysis gets more complicated with correlations among ges and among cnas specifically high correlations among cnas have been observed in both coding_and co regulated_genes can have highly_correlated expression levels recent_studies under simpler settings have shown that accounting for correlations is critical for analysing genetic data a few studies have addressed the correlations among measurements for example kim et_al developed the graph guided fused_lasso method to address the dependency_structure among responses proposed the remmap method to identify master cnas which affect most ges a common limitation of these studies is that correlation is only accounted for in one side of the regression_model and hence the analysis is not complete in addition ineffective estimation approaches have been adopted the goal of this study is to more effectively analyse ge and cna data so as to better understand their relationships to account for the fact that multiple cnas can affect the expression_level of a gene we simultaneously model the joint effects of multiple cnas for the identification of important cnas associated with a ge an effective penalization approach is adopted the most significant advancement is that networks are adopted to describe the correlations among ges and among cnas when the correlations among ges are taken into consideration the analysis becomes a multiple ges against multiple cnas regression_problem that is both the responses and predictors are highdimensional to accommodate the network_structures we propose a sparse double laplacian shrinkage sdls approach which combines the power of penalized variable_selection and laplacian shrinkage to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to effectively accommodate correlations in both sides of the ge cna regression it is noted that although our analysis focuses on ges and cnas the proposed method is potentially applicable to other types of genetic measurements multiple types of genetic epigenetic and genomic changes can happen on the human_genome it is important to understand their relationships using ge and cna as an example we have developed asdls method this method uses effective penalization for marker selection and regularized estimation significantly advancing from the existing_studies it adopts two laplacian penalties to accommodate the interconnections among ges and among cnas it has an intuitive formulation and can be realized using an efficient cd algorithm simulations show that it has comparable_performance as the alternatives when there are only weak correlations among ges and cnas however with moderate to strong correlations as has been commonly observed in practical data it has significantly better identification and prediction_performance in data analyses it identifies associations different from those using the alternatives the estimated regression_coefficient matrix has a higher_level of row and column similarity manually examining the analysis results for a few representative genes suggests reasonable analysis results to better accommodate finer data_structures the proposed method introduces new penalties with new tunings the computational_cost is thus higher than the alternatives which is the price paid for better modeling data however as the laplacian penalties are differentiable the computational_complexity is acceptable to reduce computational_cost one may set k k resulting in only two tunings our numerical experience suggests that three tuning parameters are also acceptable as the main objective is to develop the new method we have adopted only one adjacency measure we acknowledge that there may exist other perhaps better adjacency measures however it is not our goal to compare and draw_conclusions on the relative performance of different adjacency measures under multiple simulation_settings the proposed method has been shown to be superior more extensive simulations may be conducted in the future in data analyses the proposed method identifies associations different from the alternatives simple examinations suggest that the results are reasonable more extensive analyses are needed to fully validate the findings for the marginal approach a represents an identified association
