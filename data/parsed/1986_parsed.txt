systems_biology gene_set in the cloud cloud_computing offers low_cost and highly_flexible opportunities in bioinformatics its potential has already been demonstrated in high_throughput sequence_data analysis pathway based or gene_set of expression data has received relatively less attention we developed a gene_set algorithm for biomarker identification in the cloud the resulting tool yunbe is ready to use on amazon_web moreover here we compare its performance to those obtained with desktop and computing cluster solutions availability_and yunbe is open_source and freely_accessible within the amazon elastic mapreduce service at s nthe complexity and cost associated with recent_advances in highthroughput omic technologies have made cloud_computing a cost_effective and powerful resource for bioinformatics existing platforms such as those offered by amazon_web aws provide the computing environment including cpus storage processing memory networking and operating_systems required to deploy computationally_expensive algorithms and applications such environments allow users to configure and exploit resources on a pay as you use basis although cloud_computing applications are increasingly being made available for high_throughput dna sequencing_data there is a need for publicly_available algorithms that can enable other translational biomedical_research applications such as large_scale gene_set of expression data in this context expression data of thousands of genes are mapped to biologically_relevant sets of genes e g curated biological_pathways and differential_expression of such gene_sets is estimated across phenotypes the objective of our research is fold i to develop a cloud compute version of a published gene_set algorithm and ii to perform a comparative_analysis of performance across different computing platforms
