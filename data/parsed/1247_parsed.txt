sequence_analysis dafga diversity analysis of functional gene amplicons diversity analysis of functional marker_genes provides physiological insights into microbial guilds that perform an ecologically_relevant process however it is challenging to group functional gene sequences to valid taxonomic units primarily because of differences in the evolutionary_rates of individual genes and possible horizontal_gene events we developed a python script package named dafga which estimates the evolutionary_rate of a particular functional gene in a standardized manner by relating its sequence_divergence to that of the s rrna gene as a result dafga provides gene specific parameter_sets for operational_taxonomic clustering and taxo nomic assignment at desired rank and it can be implemented into the diversity measurements offered by qiime microbes are the most abundant and most diverse organisms on earth playing crucial roles in ecosystem_functioning massively_parallel of s rrna_genes allows us to explore the phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic_composition of microbial_communities in any environment e g contrary to the s rrna gene genes_encoding key catalytic enzymes define particular functional guilds that perform ecologically_relevant functions e g methane oxidizing bacteria pmoa and nitrogen_fixing bacteria nifh exploring the prevalence and diversity of these protein_coding can help identify novel lineages of particular functional guilds as well as physiologically differentiate closely_related phylotypes similarity of tree_topology with that of the s rrna gene should reveal the potential of a functional gene to be used as a phylogenetic marker protein_coding however evolve faster than the s rrna gene and at varying_rates there are considerable variations in the evolutionary_rates ers even among individual genes present in the same genome use of arbitrary threshold_values for clustering functional gene amplicons into operational_taxonomic otus could lead to incorrect estimates of microbial_diversity within functional guilds therefore computational_tools for functional gene amplicon analysis have to take into account the er of a targeted gene because variations in er result primarily from changes in the protein_sequence itself rather than from external_factors such as changing environment or lifestyle the er of individual genes can be measured in relation to that of s rrna_genes dafga compares the sequence_divergence of functional_genes with that of s rrna_genes obtained from the same source organisms it then extrapolates the sequence_identity thresholds that define different taxonomic ranks and use them for otu clustering and taxonomic_assignment to the lowest rank possible the most critical step in the diversity analysis of functional marker_genes and rrna_genes is to cluster taxonomically homogeneous sequences into valid otus dafga offers a standardized procedure to determine the er of functional_genes in relation to that of the s rrna gene and it provides sequence_identity thresholds that correspond to different taxonomic ranks as such dafga allows for the automated cluster_analysis and taxonomic categorization of environmental sequence_data and provides a computational means to evaluate the potential of a functional gene as a phylogenetic marker workflow of dafga a and correlation plot of pmoa and s_rrna divergence b the pmoa gene was selected as a representative example pmoa reference_sequences deposited in fungene http fungene cme msu edu were obtained in genpept format from ncbi non redundant protein database similarity and identity values of protein sequence_alignments were plotted in green and blue respectively dashed red line is a linear_regression curve of respectively similarity and identity of pmoa over s_rrna identity
