data_and question answering systems in biology and medicine the time is now downloaded from on february th it could be argued that the world quietly changed as a milestone in human history was reached a question answering qa system able to deconstruct a natural_language question into information_retrieval and analysis tasks implemented across cpus and embodied as an ibm engineered system named watson handily defeated the top two human champions on a game show called jeopardy similar to the achievement of ibms deep blue in beating chess champion gary kasparov in it was not a surprise to technology enthusiasts that such a feat was possible but it publicized the progress that has been made and the capabilities on information_retrieval that are within reach thus far the most salient examples of qa system implementations as well as publications are outside the biomedical_domain yet i would argue the sheer number of studied entities heterogeneous nature of the data exponential_growth of information and emphasis on generation of new knowledge makes biomedicine the field in most need of good qa systems anecdotally i was giving a talk to a couple hundred biomedical_scientists and clinicians a week after the watson challenge and only a couple dozen were aware of it when i asked there seems to be a gap of awareness between the eventual beneficiaries of advanced qa systems and the developers in terms of recognizing its potential this unfortunately might lead to marginalization of biomedical qa research in terms of publication and funding venues we should take the watson milestone as an opportunity to consider the ways biomedical researchincluding bioinformaticscan benefit from qa systems and some of the possible non technical hindrances to progress on the surface watsons performance would seem more a victory for trivia retrieval than scientific_research the most pressing scientific questions are not those that are limited by factual retrieval however the scientific endeavor is predicated upon both observation and inquiry as we gather observations we are naturally curious if they are consistent with other observations if what we observed has been reported before and if what we believe may be the implications of our observations have been explored by others this requires us to search the peer_reviewed which is not only large and growing_exponentially in terms of publications medline is currently growing year but the total searchable domain is becoming rapidly larger with an increasing use of supplementary_information and availability of full text thus the quest for answers can not only be time consuming but fraught with difficulties since the average research lexicon is filled with synonyms acronyms and variations in naming conventions a priority is placed on thoroughness i e sensitivity recall because not being aware of relevant prior art can render a completed project moot we are accustomed to trying to translate our questions into boolean based keyword searches that we hope will yield the best specificity to sensitivity trade_off in pubmed since it is not practical for us to sort through hundreds or even thousands of results when we know most of them are probably not directly relevant the most difficult part however is not locating documents with single facts but locating and connecting strings of facts that may be in different documents the potential to engage in factual inference is probably the most powerful and appealing advantage of qa approaches over traditional information_retrieval ir techniques while keyword based ir is a process researchers are accustomed to despite the inefficiencies what the jeopardy experiment showed us is that the technological know how is here to automate at least partially this part of the process and that relative to human_experts it can perform wellit is specific enough to get answers correct sensitive enough to find data hidden in mountains of text and smart enough to know when it does not know the answer even though the qa field itself goes back arguably to the s development of qa systems for biomedical_applications is a more recent phenomenon that has seen some but not much activity within pubmed cao et_al olvera lobo and gutierrez artacho overby et_al zweigenbaum even within bioinformatics journals yet there are many vibrant research programs across the world working on the issue much of their progress is being reported in conferences such as trec which had a genomic qa track from to hersh and voorhees and biocreative leitner et_al which focuses on information_retrieval a foundational technology for qa yet these are not often accessed by and perhaps not even targeted to biomedical_researchers in general the largest end_user audience for the product in defense of this apparent gap between producers and consumers it could be argued that biomedical qa systems are not as ready for prime time as watson was the issue is not one of whether or not outreach has taken place but how effective it has been or will be as a commercial endeavor ibm cannot afford to spend effort advancing qa capability for purely academic reasons and jeopardy was their showcase for their product sometimes it is argued the value of an advance is independent of its application but i would argue
