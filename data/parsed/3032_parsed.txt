model based detection of alternative_splicing signals motivation transcripts from of human multi exon genes are subject to alternative_splicing as the growing interest in as is propelled by its prominent contribution to transcriptome and proteome complexity and the role of aberrant as in numerous_diseases recent_technological enable thousands of exons to be simultaneously profiled across diverse cell_types and cellular conditions but require accurate identification of condition specific splicing changes it is necessary to accurately identify such splicing changes to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs or link the splicing changes to specific diseases results we present a probabilistic_model tailored for high_throughput as data where observed isoform levels are explained as combinations of condition specific as signals according to our formulation given an as dataset our tasks are to detect common signals in the data and identify the exons relevant to each signal our model can incorporate_prior about underlying as signals measurement quality and gene expression_level effects using a large_scale multi tissue as dataset we demonstrate the advantage of our method over standard alternative_approaches in addition we describe newly found tissue_specific as signals which were verified experimentally and discuss associated regulatory_features contact the proper_function of a living_cell depends on constant regulation of its biomolecular content both spatially_and one important regulated process is splicing where exonic segments of the transcribed pre_mrna are spliced together while intronic segments are removed in some cases different exons of the premrna may be retained leading to different transcripts called isoforms a process known as alternative_splicing as there are several known types of as with the most common one being cassette as illustrated in as plays_a in shaping how genetic_information is expressed in cells of metazoan species moreover of human disease mutations affect splice site_selection recent highthroughput_sequencing studies estimate that transcripts from of multiexon human genes undergo as with the majority of as exons displaying differential_expression across different tissues such high_throughput studies can be probed to identify condition specific splicing changes that subsequently can be linked to genetic disease alternatively groups of exons identified by these studies as exhibiting concerted changes across functionally_related conditions e g muscle_tissues can be used to look for a common regulatory program for example several works correlated splicing changes with potential binding_motifs recently developed a computationally derived regulatory code that includes combinations of motifs and non motif features such as transcript structure characteristics to directly predict splicing changes from genomic_sequence the focus of the work presented here is to facilitate such downstream_analysis by accurately identifying biologically informative condition specific splicing changes or as signals underlying high_throughput measurements high_throughput as measurements are typically acquired using microarrays or high_throughput accurate quantification of every isoform still poses computational and experimental challenges consequently much of the research_involving as and derived datasets focuses on the simpler task of quantifying splicing changes at the single_exon level such data can be quantified as the fraction of gene isoforms including an exon with additional information conveying the overall gene expression_level in each condition this representation is not only easier to derive but also corresponds well to the hypotheses accounting for regulated as the regulatory mechanisms_involved include various structural_features and cis_elements in the proximity of the alternative exon with splicing and transcription forming two distinct networks of regulation formally the measurements from high_throughput as studies can be represented as a matrix whose entries convey the fraction of inclusion and exclusion isoforms for each of the exons and each of the conditions monitored in the study similarly the overall expression levels of the genes containing each exon can be represented by a corresponding matrix a widely used approach for identifying common patterns in such data is clustering clustering the columns of the matrix derived from containing cassette exons profiled across mouse_tissues easily identifies a cluster of all central_nervous cns tissues evident on the left side of the clustergram in similarly clustering rows of the matrix which represent as profiles of exons identifies groups of exons that share a similar as profile across conditions while readily available and easy to apply to as datasets standard clustering_methods such as hierarchical agglomerative clustering and k_means suffer from several drawbacks first many splicing changes occur in functionally_related conditions such as cns or muscle_tissues standard clustering is not easily modified so as to incorporate such prior_knowledge second a splicing change high_throughput as data representation and analysis a isoforms including and excluding a cassette exon can be quantified using a single number representing the percent of isoforms that include the exon a separate number gives the overall gene expression_level not shown here b high_throughput as data as a matrix of percent inclusion values for different exons rows under different conditions columns c the same matrix for a real_dataset after agglomerative clustering inclusion levels are displayed as a heat map with the subset of cns tissues visible on the left d four examples of exons exhibiting condition specific splicing changes in cns muscle and embryo tissues arrows show the position of each exon in the clustergram these relative positions do not convey well the tissue groups in which each of these exons exhibit splicing changes e the five underlying as signals identified by our model and f how each of these signals is associated with the four exon examples in a subset of conditions may involve two types of effects one being a relative increase of exon_inclusion levels and the second being a relative decrease common distance measures used for clustering either distinguish between these two effect types or ignore the difference between the two e g correlation and absolute correlation_coefficients in practice however it is desirable to be able to distinguish between these two types of effects but still associate them since they may share_common regulatory_elements for instance splice factors such as nova fox and n ptb have been linked to both effects in the same tissues third another characteristic of as datasets not easily incorporated into standard clustering_methods is that exons may exhibit a combination of splicing changes in several functionally_related tissue groups such as muscle and cns but occurrence of regulated splicing changes across cellular conditions is expected to generally be sparse this expected sparsity is related to the experimental_setup where thousands of exons are monitored but most of these do not exhibit condition specific profiles fourth previous work has shown that while some exons exhibit a type of on off splicing profile others exhibit continuous splicing changes across tissues and may have different tissue independent baseline inclusion levels a closer look at the clustering_results illustrates the problems that arise from the inability to easily incorporate these domain characteristics into standard clustering exon of pank and exon of arfgap are an example of two exons positioned on opposite ends of the clustergram despite both exhibiting a profile containing a splicing change in cns tissues exon of pank and exon of nm are positioned far apart since their baseline levels of inclusion are distinctly different but both exhibit a similar pattern of increased inclusion in cns the pank exon also exhibits increased inclusion in muscle_tissues yet it is positioned adjacent to exon of fgf which exhibits an unrelated splicing profile switching to different similarity_measures e g from the default l norm used here to pearsons_correlation or mean squared error mse or between clustering_algorithms may help address some of these problems but does not offer an overall solution to the issues raised matrix_factorization algorithms such as principal_component pca factor_analysis fa and singular_value svd offer an alternative approach for analyzing high_throughput as measurements following the terminology of svd previously used for this task these algorithms are able to identify a set of c t underlying eigen exons termed components in pca and factors in fa and assign to each exon in the dataset a matching set of values that represent how much each of these eigen exons contributes to a given exon as profile this approach is thus more naturally suited for modeling as measurements as continuous combination of components where each component can have either a positive increased inclusion or negative increased exclusion effect and with different magnitude however these algorithms still lack i page i i i we used the dataset of comprising cassette exons measured across mouse_tissues to evaluate our computational_method the condition specific as signals corresponding to splicing changes in cns muscle embryo and digestive tissues are shown in the error_bars for the signals were derived by randomly sampling subsets containing of the original data the four tissue_specific as signals identified were also supported by a recent work where splicing changes corresponding to these four signals where predicted directly from genomic_sequence and verified experimentally using rt_pcr experiments in this work we presented a model based_approach to identifying condition specific as signals from high_throughput data unlike other approaches our generative_model is specifically tailored for this task it incorporates prior_knowledge about as including known correlation to expression levels modeling of a tissue independent signal the expected sparsity of the as signals and the fact that as signals may have either a positive_or effect the model is also able to incorporate specific knowledge about a given dataset including information about the quality of the measurements related gene_expression levels and knowledge of specific as signals in the data we compared our approach with commonly used alternatives and showed that on real_data it was able to produce superior results in terms of the signals identified their robustness and their assignments to biologically_important groups of exons for the latter we defined an independent measure of quality the fii performed a literature_search for tissue_specific splicing regulatory cis_elements and showed that the assignment of as signals by our method correlated significantly better with those elements our method was able to detect a novel split of the signal for splicing changes in cns tissues into two separate subgroups of tissues and a previously_unreported as signal associated with digestive tissues the four main tissue_specific as signals identified by our model are supported by a predictive_model derived from putative regulaotry features including experimental_testing of the models predictions previous work developing related models_include ifa and another form of a mixture of factor analyzers both of these models developed for different applications differ from ours in the mixture_model used and do not include domain specific elements such as the background model the gene_expression levels and the as baseline signals more recent work involving general matrix_factorization algorithms include the work by which was applied to gene_expression data and robust pca which involves sparse signal assignments and noisy_data in general the computational alternatives currently available can be broadly divided_into two supervised and unsupervised methods the first mostly consists of computing statistics such as the mean inclusion level for a predefined group of conditions while the other includes clustering_methods such as hierarchical agglomerative clustering as well as svd pca and other variants of matrix_factorization algorithms compared with those our modeling_approach can range between supervised and unsupervised signal identification depending on the amount of additional information incorporated into the model we were able to demonstrate the usefulness of this trade_off between search_space exploration and prior_knowledge exploitation for the identification of as signals in the data there are several direct computational extensions to the model presented here one extension involves defining the number of components in the model as a random variable and marginalizing over it a recent work by implemented such a model for factor mixtures using a beta process prior we note though that in our context we are not simply interested in marginalizing out the component number since the identity of the as signals and the exons associated with them are biologically_meaningful another possible direction for future work is to replace the gaussian mixture components used in our model with alternative distributions that would fit the data better this change would be of practical use if the better fit to the data would also lead to more accurate signal assignments to exons we briefly_reviewed some of the regulatory_elements we identified as enriched in groups of exons associated with the as signal reported many of these are in excellent_agreement with previously_published including the role and positional bias of cis_element known to bind nova ptb and fox some identified features such as the quaking motif upstream of exons highly included in cns offer possible insights to additional regulatory_mechanisms the correlation between signals identified by our model and regulatory_elements points to possible extensions and applicative potential of the modeling_approach we propose our probabilistic_framework can naturally be extended to a unified_framework where combinations of regulatory_features are used to explain identified as signals and the assignment of these signals to exons is subsequently used to refine the regulatory programs learned such a unified_approach for modeling regulatory programs has been applied successfully in other domains in our recent work the model described here was utilized to construct a regulatory code that predicts tissue_specific splicing changes directly from genomic_sequence our framework can be extended to incorporate additional information such as secondary_structure nucleosome_positions and splice factor binding measurements to gain further insights into the underlying regulatory_mechanisms associated with each as signal based on the analysis of as signals we report and the comparison of our method to standard computational alternatives we believe this work will facilitate the study of future high_throughput as datasets extending our understanding of the transcriptome complexity
