integrated structure and ligand based in silico approach to predict inhibition of cytochrome_p d motivation cytochrome_p cyp is a superfamily of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of drugs xenobiotics and endogenous compounds cyp d metabolizes about of drugs and predicting potential cyp d inhibition is important in early_stage drug_discovery results we developed an original in silico approach for the prediction of cyp d inhibition combining the knowledge of the protein_structure and its dynamic_behavior in response to the binding of various ligands and machine_learning modeling this approach includes structural_information for cyp d based on the available crystal_structures and molecular_dynamic md that we performed to take into account conformational changes of the binding_site we performed mod eling using three learning algorithms support_vector randomforest and naivebayesian and we constructed combined models based on topological information of known cyp d inhibi tors and predicted binding_energies computed by docking on both x_ray and md protein conforma tions in addition we identified three md derived structures that are capable all together to better discriminate inhibitors and non inhibitors compared with individual cyp d conformations thus ensuring complementary ligand profiles inhibition models based on classical molecular descrip tors and predicted binding_energies were able to predict cyp d inhibition with an accuracy of on the training_set and on the external validation_set cytochrome_p cyp is a superfamily of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of drugs xenobiotic substances and endogenous compounds it has been estimated that about of the marketed drugs are metabolized by cyps the major cyp isoforms being a c c c d and a these enzymes detoxify the organism from various xenobiotics and activate some prodrugs by oxidation yet oxidation sometimes leads to metabolites that are more active than the administrated drugs or activates pro carcinogens by creating highly_reactive metabolite species inhibition of cyp is a complex process because it can correspond to a competitive_inhibition in the active_site a modification of the substrate or metabolite flux between the active_site and outside of the enzyme or an inhibition by a drug itself or by its metabolites time dependent inhibition leading then to adverse drugdrug_interactions thus predicting potential cyp inhibition is important in early_stage drug_discovery cyp d metabolizes about of drugs although it represents only of hepatic cyps besides liver intestine and kidney cyp d is also expressed in brain cells where it may be involved in metabolism of neurotransmitters such as serotonin cyp d interacts with many drugs used for regulation of the central_nervous psychotropics or the cardiovascular system anti rhythmic drugs this isoform is of particular interest as a large amount of drugs can be metabolized only by cyp d moreover cyp d is highly_polymorphic with more than a hundred of allelic_variants leading to poor intermediate extensive or ultra rapid_metabolism that can render the administrated drug toxic or inefficient a number of modeling studies have been undertaken to understand the molecular basis of cyp d drug_interactions and cyp d related metabolism or inhibition most of these analyses have been executed on homology_models as the first x_ray structure of human_cyp d was solved in cyp inhibition is considered to be more difficult to predict than sites of metabolism som due to the lack of reactive_sites recently a new approach for prediction of cyp inhibition cyprules using decision_tree algorithm based on compound structural rules has been reported however the extensive flexibility of the cyp d structure which represents its natural mechanism to accommodate diverse ligands into the active_site can strongly_affect the prediction of cyp inhibition when one uses traditional ligand based quantitative structure_property qsar modeling vedani and co authors adopted a mixed model protocol in which ligand based pre alignment was followed by ligand_docking to the cyp d protein_structure with flexible side_chains which allowed a quantification of ligand_binding through multi_dimensional qsar modeling validated on cyp d binders the recently reported cyp d structures in complex with different inhibitors as well as the large number of experimentally_validated cyp d binders available in the pubchem bioassay database b permit to carry out a comprehensive analysis of cyp d inhibition in this study we developed a new integrated in silico approach to predict inhibition of cyp d the performed molecular_dynamic md provided new insights about the conformational changes in the active_site architecture of cyp due to the accommodation of different ligands we found a set of modeled cyp d conformations which all together are able to correctly retrieve after docking of the known cyp binders in of the screened compound library the computational protocol integrating docking into this pool and machine_learning modeling can be successfully_applied to predict cyp d inhibitors with of success we report an original in silico approach for cyp d inhibition based on the knowledge of the protein_structure and dynamic_behavior due to various ligand_binding combined with machine_learning modeling validated on a large number of active and inactive compounds we explored a large portion of the conformational_space of cyp d using md_simulations with three different substrates that do not have an experimentally known bioactive_conformation and identified md structures displaying better performance than the x_ray apo and holo structures with regard to distinguishing between active and inactive compounds in addition we identified three md derived structures that are capable all together to better retrieve the active_compounds compared with individual cyp d conformations confirming that these three binding_site conformations have different and complementary substrate profiles our models predicting cyp d inhibition showed an accuracy of on the external validation_set results competitive with other recently reported prediction_models note the performance of cyprules a method that uses compound structural_information is shown for the same external sets
