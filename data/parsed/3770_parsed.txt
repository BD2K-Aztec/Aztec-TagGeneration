prottest fast selection of best fit models of protein evolution we have implemented a high_performance hpc version of prottest that can be executed in parallel in multicore desktops and clusters this version called prottest includes new features and extended capabilities availability prottest source_code are freely_available under gnu license for download from http darwin uvigo es software prottest linked to a mercurial repository at bitbucket https bitbucket org recent_advances in modern sequencing_technologies have resulted in an increasing capability for gathering large_datasets long sequence_alignments with hundred or thousands of sequences are not rare these days but their analysis imply access to large computing infrastructures and or the use of simpler and faster methods in this regard high_performance hpc becomes essential for the feasibility of more sophisticatedand often more accurate analyses indeed during the last years hpc facilities have become part of the general services provided by many universities and research_centers besides multicore desktops are now standard the program prottest is one of the most popular tools for selecting models of amino_acid a routinary step in phylogenetic_analysis prottest is written in java and uses the program phyml for the maximum_likelihood ml estimation of model_parameters and phylogenetic_trees and the pal library to handle alignments and trees statistical model_selection can be a very intensive task when the alignments are large and include divergent sequences highlighting the need for new bionformatic tools capable of exploiting the available computational_resources here we describe a new version of prottest prottest that has been completely redesigned to take advantage of hpc environments and desktop multicore processors significantly_reducing the execution time for model_selection in large protein_alignments
