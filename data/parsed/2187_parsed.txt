structural_bioinformatics high_accuracy prediction of transmembrane inter helix contacts and application to gpcr d structure modeling motivation residueresidue contacts across the transmembrane heli ces dictate the three_dimensional topology of alpha_helical membrane_proteins however contact determination through experiments is difficult because most transmembrane_proteins are hard to crystallize results we present a novel method membrain to derive transmem brane inter helix contacts from amino_acid by combining correlated_mutations and multiple machine_learning tested on non redundant polytopic proteins using a strict leave_one protocol membrain achieves an average_accuracy of which is higher than the current best method from the literature when applied to recently solved g_protein the membrain contact predictions helped increase the tm_score of the i tasser models by in the transmembrane_region the number of foldable cases tm_score increased by where all g_protein templates and homologous templates with sequence_identity were excluded these results demonstrate significant progress in contact_prediction and a potential for contact driven structure modeling of transmembrane_proteins membrane_proteins constitute of the proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic_genomes and they participate in various crucial cellular_processes from basic small_molecule transport to complicated signaling_pathways it has been shown that of current drug_targets are membrane_proteins where the top four gene_families of food_and drugs are all membrane_proteins i e g_protein gpcr nuclear_receptors ligand_gated and voltage_gated membrane_embedded alpha_helical polytopic proteins constitute the majority of ion_channels transporters and receptors in living_organisms this class of proteins which accounts for of all membrane_proteins is infamously difficult for high_resolution structural studies due to the intrinsic structural_plasticity associated with many of these proteins the chance of obtaining crystals suitable for x_ray or electron_diffraction studies is small although helical membrane_proteins have many experimental_difficulties their structural conformation has been demonstrated to be predictable in a number of ways e g transmembrane_helix tmh domain topology structure_prediction of the tmh bundle for alpha_helical membrane_proteins can be fulfilled by first predicting tmhs and then applying helix packing constraints the first step of the tmh prediction has a long history and the current methods can achieve an accuracy of in the second step it has been widely_acknowledged that residueresidue contact_maps contain crucial constraints for ab_initio assembly of protein_structures in the past_years several methods have been proposed to predict inter tmh residue_contacts and tmhtmh interactions from the primary sequence these approaches generally can be classified into two categories i correlated mutation analysis cma based_approaches e g helixcorr and ii machine_learning ml based_methods e g tmhcon tmhit mempack and tmhhcp cma based_approaches identify co evolving residue pairs that tend to be in contact from multiple_sequence msas ml based_methods predict inter tmh residue_contacts by training statistical_models using various sequence derived features the predicted contacts are used to predict tmhtmh interactions despite the progress there is much space for improvement first in the case of cma based_approaches the performance depends highly on the number of aligned sequences in msas for example the recent cma based residue_contact algorithm psicov performs poorly on the casp hard targets which tend to have few homologous_sequences this indicates that contact_prediction based on cma alone is insufficient second from ml point_of inter tmh residue_contact is an imbalanced learning_problem where the number of samples in different classes contact versus non contact differs_significantly existing ml based_methods use random under sampling to whom correspondence should be addressed to select the negative samples except for random_forest in tmhhcp which used decision_trees all the existing predictors were trained with a single model using a or ratio of contact and non contact samples there is no single best ml algorithm because each has a different mathematical hypothesis therefore an ensemble classifier constructed by applying multiple algorithms on multiple training_sets can combine the diversities among different predictors and yield better results third in all the existing ml based models feature_vectors of two residues are serially concatenated together although this serial combination is widely used the doubled feature_vector dimensions may decrease performance due to over fitting effects of high_dimensional the parallel strategy is another feature fusion approach which represents the two vectors as real and imaginary parts in a complex space the benefit is that the dimension of the obtained complex vector is the same as the vector of each residue which we show improves_performance in this study we present a novel method called membrain to predict inter tmh residue_contacts by merging an ml based engine with the cma based_approach here we use the psicov algorithm to calculate correlated mutation scores cms the ml based engine in the proposed_protocol is implemented with an ensemble classifier it is the fusion of five oet knn classifiers and five svm classifiers where each independent classifier is trained with a different training_set obtained from five independent under samplings by doing so we can get the diversities from different algorithms and at the same time reduce the information_loss via multiple samplings our results demonstrate that the weakness of cma sufficient homology can be compensated for by combining it with ml methods and the weakness of statistical ml local condensed predictions can also be complemented by combining with cma based_approaches it would be interesting to investigate whether the idea of combining ml based_methods with cmabased approaches in membrain can also be used to enhance the contact prediction_accuracy in globular_proteins to demonstrate this we used psi_blast to search against uniref database for the targets containing free modeling or free modeling template_based domains in casp supplementaryshows the distributions of the number of homologous_sequences on the casp_targets the results in supplementarydemonstrate i although some targets have very few or no homologous structures in the pdb which causes difficulties for homology structure modeling they have a large number of homologous_sequences available for example four of these targets have more than homologous_sequences in the uniref database this means we can get reliable predicted contacts for these four proteins average_accuracy for top l predictions on the training data_set ii in the other targets of them contain less than homologous_sequences according to our results the accuracy of psicov in this group was very low in this work and the combination of ml based method with psicov is expected to improve the accuracy in this work furthermore there are six proteins in the homology size region of when directly applying psicov on this group the results are also not satisfactory in this work however the membrain prediction significantly_improves the results in this group in this work to further illustrate the potential merit of the combination of ml based_methods with cma based_approaches on globular_proteins we replaced the ml part of the membrain predictor with svmseq the predictions of svmseq for the targetstemplates whose sequence has x sequence_identity to the protein were removed faverage results of the top models where templates whose sequence has sequence_identity to the protein were removed gtemplates whose structure has tm_score to the native_structure were removed were extracted from http www predictioncenter org download area casp predictions which were merged with psicov outputs using a linear combination strategy supplementarylists the detailed performance of top l predictions for each range contact on the targets as can be seen the performance improved as expected from the results it is very interesting to see the following svmseq performs better than psicov on the short range contacts versus and worse than psicov on the long rang contacts versus this is consistent with our previous_observation that the ml based_approach gives more local condensed predictions the results also show that svmseq and psicov predictions are largely complementary on long_range which makes the combination of them more accurate these results suggest that a proper consensus of cma based_approaches with ml based_methods is also promising for enhancing the ab_initio contact predictions in globular_proteins besides inter tmh residue_contacts in tmhs denoted astype there exist two other contact types in tmh proteins contacts where one residue is in the membrane region and the other residue in the water_soluble loop region denoted as type and contacts where both residues are in the water_soluble region denoted as type these two types of contacts are also important for d structure_prediction especially for the loop region by observing the native contacts from known structures in the training and the independent data_set at the whole chain level we found that and are type contacts and and are type contacts hence predicting these two types of contacts will be important future work in this case the predictors developed for predicting residue_contacts in globular_proteins are expected to
