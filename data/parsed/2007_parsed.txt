genomecons a web_server for manipulating multiple genome sequence_alignments and their consensus_sequences genome sequence_alignments provide_valuable on many aspects of molecular biological_processes in this study we developed a web_server genomecons for manipulating multiple genome sequence_alignments and their consensus_sequences for high_throughput genome_sequence analyses this server facilitates the visual_inspection of multiple genome sequence_alignments for a set of genomic_intervals at a time this allows the user to examine how these sites are evolutionarily_conserved over time for their functional_importance the server also reports consensus_sequences for the input genomic_intervals which can be applied to downstream_analyses such as the identification of common motifs in the regions determined by chip_seq availability_and genomecons is freely_accessible atthe progress of genome_sequencing for various species has now made it possible to compare genome_sequences over a wide_range of related species genome sequence_alignments provided by the ucsc_genome greatly_facilitate the identification of the regions under strong_selective by measuring the conservation in related species genome sequence_alignments in the ucsc_genome are useful for the visual_inspection of a genomic_region of interest but they are not suitable for downloading to perform further detailed_analyses moreover the browser can handle only a single locus at a time making_it to survey many loci for example a set of the genomic_regions identified by chip_seq to conduct a large_scale analysis of genome sequence_alignments it is necessary to download and manipulate the data stored in the multiple_alignment format maf from the ucsc_genome as expected based on the length of an entire_genome and the number of species available the amount of data in these genome sequence_alignments is huge furthermore genome_sequences of any two species are not always collinear because of the genome_rearrangements that occur during the course of evolution thus genome alignments consist of a huge set of small alignment blocks because of the inclusion of species with various levels of diversity therefore it is not a trivial task to retrieve a genome sequence_alignment for a region of interest from a huge amount of maf files a possible solution to this problem is to use a set of specialized tools for manipulating genome sequence_alignments which have been implemented on the galaxy web_server recently another program maffilter was developed for this task these programs facilitate the highly_flexible manipulation of maf files but they also require command_line and or multi_step operations which arein this study we introduce our web_server genomecons a highly user_friendly dedicated web_server for manipulating genome sequence_alignments and for the automatic generation of consensus_sequences of the corresponding genomic_intervals in one step genomecons is well suited for large_scale analyses of genome sequence_alignments for example the identification of evolutionarily_conserved transcription_factor in the peak regions identified by chip_seq
