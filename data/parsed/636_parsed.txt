a weighted sampling algorithm for the design of rna_sequences with targeted secondary_structure and nucleotide distribution motivations the design of rna_sequences folding into predefined secondary_structures is a milestone for many synthetic_biology and gene_therapy studies most of the current software uses similar local search_strategies i e a random seed is progressively adapted to acquire the desired folding properties and more importantly do not allow the user to control explicitly the nucleotide distribution such as the gc_content in their sequences however the latter is an important_criterion for large_scale applications as it could presumably be used to design sequences with better transcription_rates and or structural_plasticity results in this article we introduce incarnation a novel algorithm to design rna_sequences folding into target secondary_structures with a predefined nucleotide distribution incarnation uses a global sampling_approach and weighted sampling_techniques we show that our approach is fast i e running time comparable or better than local search_methods seedless we remove the bias of the seed in local_search heuristics and successfully generates high_quality sequences i e thermodynamically_stable for any gc_content to complete this study we develop a hybrid method_combining our global sampling_approach with local search_strategies remarkably our glocal methodology overcomes both local and global approaches for sampling sequences with a specific gc_content and target structure availability incarnation is available at csb cs mcgill ca incarnation contact at the core of the emerging field of synthetic_biology resides our capacity to design and reengineer molecules with target functions rna_molecules are well tailored for such applications the ease to synthesize them they are directly transcribed from dna and the broad diversity of catalytic and regulation functions they can perform enable to integrate de_novo logic circuits within living_cells or reprogram existing regulation mechanisms future advances and applications of these techniques in gene_therapy studies will strongly rely on efficient computational_methods to design and reengineer rna_molecules most of rna functions are at least partially encoded by the d molecular_structures which are themselves primarily determined by the secondary_structures the development of efficient algorithms for designing rna_sequences with predefined secondary_structures is thus a milestone to enter the synthetic_biology era rnainverse pioneered rna_secondary design_algorithms it has been developed and distributed with the vienna rna package however only posterior experimental_studies revealed the potential and practical impact of these techniques thereby during the past_years many improvements and variants of rnainverse have been proposed conceptually almost all of existing algorithms follow the same approach first a seed_sequence is selected then a local search_strategy is used to mutate the seed and find in its vicinity a sequence with desired folding properties using this strategy info rna rna ssd aguirre hernandez and nupack design significantly_improved the performance of rna_secondary design_algorithms more recent research studies aimed to include more constraints in the selection_criteria rnaexinv focused on the design of sequences with enhanced thermodynamical and mutational robustness while frnakenstein enables to design rna with multiple target structures we recently_introduced with rna ensign a novel paradigm for the search_strategy of rna_secondary design algorithm instead of a local_search approach we proposed a global sampling strategy of the mutational_landscape based on the rnamutants algorithm this methodology offered promising performances but suffered from prohibitive runtime and memory_consumption following our work garciaproposed rnaifold an alternate methodology that uses constraint programming techniques to prune the mutational_landscape while also suffering from prohibitive running_times it is worth noting that this latter algorithm also proposes a seedless approach to the rna_secondary design problem in this article we introduce incarnation an rna_secondary design algorithm that benefits from our recent algorithmic advances to expand our original rna ensign algorithm incarnation addresses previous limitations of rna ensign and offers new functionalities first while our previous program had a running time complexity of on incarnation now runs in lineartime and space complexity allowing it to demonstrate similar speeds as any local_search algorithm next incarnation is seedless unlike rna ensign it does not require a seed_sequence to initiate its search finally incarnation implements a novel algorithm based on weighted sampling_techniques to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of

permissions_oup com that enables us to control for the first time explicitly the gc_content of the solution this functionality is essential because wild_type sequences within living_organisms often present medium or low gc_content presumably to offer better transcription_rates and or structural_plasticity previous programs do not allow to control this parameter and tend to output sequences having high gc contents we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on a set of real rna_structures extracted from the rna strand database to complete this study we develop a hybrid method_combining our global sampling_approach with local search_strategies such as the one implemented in rnainverse remarkably our glocal methodology overcomes both local and global approaches for sampling sequences with a specific gc_content and target structure
