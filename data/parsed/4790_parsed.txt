genome_analysis unifiedwmwqpcr the unified wilcoxon mann_whitney for analyzing rt_qpcr data in r motivation recently de neve et_al proposed a modification of the wilcoxonmannwhitney wmw test for assessing differential_expression based on rt_qpcr data their test referred to as the unified wmw uwmw test incorporates a robust and intuitive normalization and quantifies the probability that the expression from one treatment group exceeds the expression from another treatment group however no software_package for this test was available yet results we have developed a bioconductor_package for analyzing rt_qpcr data with the uwmw test the package also provides graphical tools for visualizing the effect_sizes availability_and the unifiedwmwqpcr package and its user documentation can be obtained through bioconductor conventional approaches for analyzing rt_qpcr data first adopt a separate normalization step e g using the bioconductor_package slqpcr before assessing differential_expression this preprocessing_step can obscure the interpretation of the statistical_test furthermore the type_i can be inflated as the additional uncertainty associated with normalization is typically ignored if c q denotes a quantification cycle associated with treatment group and c q a quantification cycle associated with group for a particular feature typically a gene or a microrna then the unified wilcoxonmann whitney uwmw test considers the null hypothesiswhere the probability px d y px y px y allows for tied quantification cycles if there is no need for normalization under the null_hypothesis of no treatment effect and the ordinary wilcoxonmannwhitney wmw test can be used however because of errors in the fluorescence quantification or differences in the amount of starting_material and enzymatic efficiencies among other reasons even in the absence of a treatment effect and hence normalization is required the uwmw test consists of the following steps i estimate based on housekeeping features or on all features when housekeeping features are not available the latter approach assumes up and downregulation to be balanced ii perform an adjusted wmw test to test h while accounting for the additional uncertainty caused by estimating from the data and iii provide standard_errors and p values h can be equivalently expressed in terms of odds and odds_ratios ors as followswhere oddsa pa pa andorc q d c q oddsc q d c q
