modularity and directionality in genetic_interaction maps motivation genetic_interactions between genes reflect functional_relationships caused by a wide_range of molecular_mechanisms large_scale genetic_interaction assays lead to a wealth of information about the functional_relations between genes however the vast number of observed interactions along with experimental_noise makes the interpretation of such assays a major_challenge results here we introduce a computational_approach to organize genetic_interactions and show that the bulk of observed interactions can be organized in a hierarchy of modules revealing this organization enables insights into the function of cellular machineries and highlights global properties of interaction maps to gain further insight into the nature of these interactions we integrated data from genetic_screens under a wide_range of conditions to reveal that more than a third of observed aggravating i e synthetic sick lethal interactions are unidirectional where one gene can buffer the effects of perturbing another gene but not vice_versa furthermore most modules of genes that have multiple aggravating interactions were found to be involved in such unidirectional interactions we demonstrate that the identification of external_stimuli that mimic the effect of specific gene_knockouts provides insights into the role of individual modules in maintaining cellular integrity availability we designed a freely_accessible web_tool that includes all our findings and is specifically intended to allow effective browsing of our resultsa major_goal in biology is to understand how thousands of genes act together to create a functional cellular_environment an emerging powerful strategy for investigating functional_relations between genes involves high_throughput genetic_interaction maps which measure the extent by which a mutation in one gene modifies the phenotype of a mutation in another the interactions in these maps can be divided to alleviating interactions where the defect of the double_mutant is less than expected frompage i i i interactions between these modules will account for a large portion of the data we show how the resulting representation facilitates better understanding of the underlying_cellular phenomena in turn we use these insights to shed light on the function of concrete cellular_pathways and also to provide information on the overall organization of the network we demonstrate how integration of data from genetic_screens for reduced fitness under various conditions results in automatic creation of biological_insights into the functional role of gene_modules
