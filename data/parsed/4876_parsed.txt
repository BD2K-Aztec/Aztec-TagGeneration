data_and viz grail visualizing functional_connections across disease_loci motivation as disease_loci are rapidly discovered an emerging challenge is to identify common pathways and biological functionality across loci such pathways might point to potential disease mechanisms one strategy is to look for functionally_related or interacting genes across genetic_loci previously we defined a statistical strategy gene relationships across implicated loci grail to identify whether pair_wise gene relationships defined using pubmed text similarity are enriched across loci here we have implemented viz grail a software_tool to display those relationships and to depict the underlying biological patterns results our tool can seamlessly interact with the grail web_site to obtain the results of analyses and create easy to read visual displays to most clearly display results viz grail arranges genes and genetic_loci to minimize intersecting pair_wise gene connections viz grail can be easily applied to other types of functional_connections beyond those from grail this method should help investigators appreciate the presence of potentially important common functions across loci availability the grail algorithm is implemented online atas genome_wide rapidly_identify genetic_loci for a broad range of phenotypes investigators are critically focused on identifying_key pathways and biological_processes suggested by genetic findings we have separately described a computational strategy gene relationships across implicated loci or grail that uses statistical text_mining strategy to rapidly_identify genes across multiple_loci that are similar to each other and to then assess if that degree of similarity is more than might be expected by chance the approach depends on pairs of related genes using pubmed article abstracts identified using word similarity_metrics grail has now been applied to prioritize snps for replication or to demonstrate common function among genes near associated snps across a wide_range of phenotypes including height rheumatoid_arthritis crohns_disease the figure see_supplementary briefly we define an objective_function that calculates the total burden of intersections weighing intersections between thicker connections more heavily then we iteratively chose random loci with at least one gene with an intersecting connection and then we try manipulating the arrangement by either i moving the locus to each of the different positions in the circle ii swapping the locus with every other locus in the circle or iii inverting different segments of the circle starting from that locus and ending at other positions at each iteration we chose the manipulation that most reduces the total number of intersecting connections and update the arrangement iteratively once the loci have been arranged then genes within each of the loci are permuted to reduce the number of total intersections
