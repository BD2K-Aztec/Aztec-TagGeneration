genome_analysis cnv guided multi_read for chip_seq motivation in chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq and other short_read sequencing_experiments a considerable fraction of the short_reads align to multiple_locations on the reference_genome multi reads inferring the origin of multi reads is critical for accurately mapping reads to repetitive_regions current state of the art multi_read algorithms rely on the read_counts in the local neighborhood of the alignment locations and ignore the variation in the copy_numbers of these regions copy_number cnv can directly affect the read densities and therefore bias allocation of multi reads results we propose cnvcsem cnv guided chip_seq by expectation_maximization a flexible framework that incorporates cnv in multi_read cnvcsem eliminates the cnv bias in multi_read by initializing the read allocation algorithm with cnv aware initial_values our data_driven simulations illustrate that cnvcsem leads to higher read_coverage with satisfactory accuracy and lower loss in read_depth recovery estimation we evaluate the biological_relevance of the cnvcsem allocated reads and the resultant peaks with the analysis of several encode chip_seq chromatin_immunoprecipitation chipseq is currently the dominant high_throughput assay in functional_genomics and epigenomic research especially for mapping transcription factordna tf dna interactions and histone_modifications in a typical chip_seq experiment tens of millions of dna_fragments usually bp are sequenced directly from one or both ends and short_reads usually bp are recorded the analysis of chip_seq starts with the mapping of the short_reads to a reference_genome with a short read_aligner e g bowtie and bwa because of repetitiveness of the genomes errors in reads and the short_read of the reads can map to multiple_locations common practice in chip_seq analysis is to use only uniquely mapping reads unireads and discard the reads that map to multiple_locations multi reads although using uni reads alone is adequate in many cases it makes any inference about the repetitive_regions challenging if not impossible in addition recently_developed multi_read methods have successfully argued that use of such reads leads to identification of many novel proteindna_interactions in chip_seq furthermore they illustrated that the effective increase in the coverage of the highly repetitive_regions owing to multireads can not be simply achieved by adjusting for low mappability during peak_calling although there are some specific modeling differences among different chip_seq aligners they predominantly operate by allocating multi reads to their mapping locations based on the read_counts of the local neighborhoods of the mapping locations which largely relies on the uni read_counts regions of high_sequence tend to have low uni read_counts making it challenging for the algorithms to distinguish between different mapping locations furthermore none of them take into account copy_number cnvs which are structural_variations of a genome that reflect the differences between the sample genome and the reference_genome in the number of copies of dna_segments cnv has a direct effect on read_depths of the sequencing samples in the literature this effect has been appreciated in peak_calling and in differential epigenome chip_seq analyses as of today none of the multi read_mapping methods has considered the potential effect of cnv on multi_read and the power it might provide for discriminating the mapping locations of multi reads the former methods estimate cnv from the mapped chip or control samples and incorporate this information during peak identification however if the reads are allocated without taking_into the cnv cnv estimated from such mapped_reads will be biased especially in the repetitive_regions e g furthermore even if the reads are mapped correctly their genome_wide coverage is not uniform and the high_copy regions identified from such data may be confounded with the open_chromatin this motivates us to correct the cnv bias at the stage of read allocation by using external cnv data instead of estimating it from the chip or control samples we refer tofor a similar discussion in a different setting to investigate the impact cnvs might have on multi_read we extracted all the reads that align to exactly two locations of the reference_genome in a ctcf chip_seq sample from gm cells such two locations are referred to as an alignment pair from hereon we found that for of reads that map two locations the copy_numbers of the alignment pairs differed by at least one supplementaryand supplementary and therefore we expect the cnvs to inform the multi_read for such reads even for the alignment pairs with the same copy_number cnvs may still have an indirect impact by affecting the allocation of other reads in the neighborhoods of these alignment locations for multi reads with more than two alignments the copy_numbers are more likely to vary among the alignment locations and a larger impact of cnv is expected in this article we develop cnvcsem cnv guided chip_seq by expectation_maximization a flexible framework that guides multi_read by cnvs the cnvcsem takes_advantage of the state of the art multi_read algorithms and incorporates cnv information parsimoniously we use the fact that various array and sequence_based cnv detection_algorithms have been developed and large consortia such as genomes have produced high_throughput sequencing_data for cnv_detection combining these efforts detecting cnv and estimating copy_number with a reasonable accuracy is possible our data_driven simulation_results show that i cnvcsem increases multi_read coverage and significantly_reduces allocation ambiguity in the segmental_duplication regions sdr with only a marginal loss in accuracy and ii cnvcsem also improves the accuracy of the read_depth recovery especially in the highly repetitive_regions with low copy_numbers our study of several encode tf chip_seq demonstrate the biological_relevance of the cnvcsem allocated reads and the chip_seq identified in the downstream_analysis in this section we compare the following three read allocation strategies using data_driven simulations and actual chip_seq uni only uni reads are kept and all the multi reads are discarded csem in addition to the uni reads all the alignments of multi reads with a csem posterior_probability are kept cnvcsem in addition to the uni reads all the alignments of multi reads with a cnvcsem posterior_probability are kept although keeping multi read allocations with a posterior_probability reduces the number of multi reads used it facilitates downstream_analysis with commonly adapted encode chipseq uniform analysis_pipeline which requires each read to map to a single location on the reference_genome throughout this article we used bowtie aligner specifically multi_read with csem and cnvcsem used reads with at most two mismatches and a maximum of alignment locations reads with only one reported alignment location are referred to as uni reads in chip_seq and other short_read sequencing_experiments a significant fraction of the reads map to multiple_locations processing of multi reads can impact the downstream_analysis of peak_calling significantly none of the currently available multi_read methods take into account cnvs in the sample genomes we showed in this article that using cnv provides additional information for discriminating mapping locations of a multi read with similar uni read_counts our datadriven simulations revealed significant improvements in multiread allocation accuracy and better read_depth recovery when using cnv information analysis of multiple encode datasets indicated that peaks identifiable only when using copy_number information in multi_read have biologically_meaningful characteristics in our framework we incorporated cnv in the initialization of the ems algorithm instead of explicitly including it in the model because of the nature of the cnv information intuitively copy_numbers should influence the elements of the read density as multipliers if the copy_numbers are already encoded in during the initialization step their influence will be preserved in the updates of the iterations except at the locations around the break_points of the cnv regions however the typical numbers of break_points are small for gm and gm experiments cnvnator detects cnv regions and consequently break_points the array based cnv annotation of hepg includes break_points compared with the length of the whole_genome this additional effect ofthe deletion regions include both heterozygous and homozygous_deletions in all of the uni only peaks are captured in both the extended lists of csem and cnvcsem however only of the multi common are identified in the extended peak list of uni reads notes and in the first column denote gm and gm cells respectively
