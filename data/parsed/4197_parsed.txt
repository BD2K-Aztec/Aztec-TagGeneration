gene_expression seqgsea a bioconductor_package for gene_set of rna_seq integrating differential_expression and splicing seqgsea is an open_source bioconductor_package for the functional_integration of differential_expression and splicing analysis in rna_seq seqgsea implements an analysis_pipeline which first computes differential splicing and differential_expression scores followed by integrating them into a per gene score that quantifies each genes association with a phenotype of interest and finally executes gene_set in a cutoff free manner to achieve biological_insights seqgsea accounts for biological_variability and determines the statistical_significance of gene pathways and networks using subject permutation and thus requires at least five samples per group real applications show that seqgsea detects more biologically_meaningful gene_sets without biases toward long or highly_expressed seqgsea can be set up to run in parallel to reduce the analysis time availability_and the seqgsea package with a vi gnette is available atby enabling simultaneous quantification of abnormal expression and aberrant_splicing high_throughput or rna_seq is providing unprecedented insight into disease and condition associated transcriptome alterations although these complex patterns of transcriptional_activity have a profound influence in the pathophysiology of disease we need tools that are capable of integrating their biological influences to determine their functional significance functional_annotation of independently differentially_expressed and their pathway analysis is ideal for investigating highly_controlled interventions in clonal or syngeneic systems with no underlying heterogeneity however when comparing conditions in outbred populations particularly for complex phenotypes or diseases biologically_significant effects are often distributed in pathways or networks such that the influence of individual genes is redundant and untraceable arguably the best alternative in thisituation is to consider related gene_sets using gene_set gsea to identify disturbances at the pathway and network levels that have biologically associated function although there are existing_tools for performing gsea on conventional gene_expression data there are currently no tools for implementing gsea with rna_seq that can efficiently incorporate gene_expression and alternative_splicing as for example goseq cannot account for as in its enrichment_analysis in higher primates the majority of genes undergo as especially in humans more than genes are alternatively_spliced recent_evidence splicing and transcription largely take place almost simultaneously and both result in the alteration of mrna composition stability localization and translation in this applications note we introduce a new software system for implementing a recently_proposed enrichment_analysis approach for rna_seq combining both overall differential_expression de and differential splicing ds we also demonstrate the utility of this approachdesignated seqgsea to maximize the yield of biological_insight from rna_seq without any biases toward long or highly_expressed in a number of data_sets
