databases_and autolabdb a substantial open_source database schema to support a high_throughput automated laboratory motivation modern automated laboratories need substantial data management solutions to both store and make accessible the details of the experiments they perform to be useful a modern laboratory_information lims should be flexible and easily extensible to support evolving laboratory requirements and should be based on the solid foundations of a robust well designed database we have developed such a database schema to support an automated laboratory that performs experiments in systems_biology and high_throughput results we describe the design of the database schema autolabdb detailing the main features and describing why we believe it will be relevant to lims manufacturers or custom builders this database has been developed to support two large automated robot scientist systems over the last years where it has been used as the basis of an lims that helps to manage both the laboratory and all the experiment data produced availability_and the database schema has been made available as open_source bsd_license so that others may use extend and improve it to meet their own needs example software interfaces to the database are also provided every laboratory has different priorities and so has different needs from their information management system the information structure of such a system must keep abreast of changes in the laboratory as new equipment is purchased and new workflows are made possible useful and flexible laboratory data management software is difficult to achieve and maintain commercially_available lims providers and systems include idbss activitybase cambridgesofts bioassay and accelryss assay explorer open_source lims include biorails openlims and bikalims www biorails org projects core www openlims org and www bikalabs com but none of these make their core database explicit or describe it in public documentation each of these attempts to cover some aspects of the processes performed in a typical laboratory however very few open_source lims are flexible yet detailed enough to be capable of assisting an automated laboratory in a full scientific work cycle in order to allow others to modify and extend autolabdb we have taken care to use hierarchical data_structures which can be extended or sub classed to use generic concepts wherever possible and to compartmentalize regions of the database so that future changes to one part are isolated from the rest we provide full schema diagrams and descriptions of the purpose of tables to enable engineers to plan and make suitable changes screensaver a recently_published open_source lims is perhaps the closest alternative to autolabdb it provides a web_based solution for high_throughput applications and just as autolabdb was originally developed to
