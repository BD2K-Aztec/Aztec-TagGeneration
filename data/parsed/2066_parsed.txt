glmgraph an r package for variable_selection and predictive_modeling of structured genomic_data one central theme of modern high_throughput analysis is to identify relevant genomic_features as well as build up a predictive_model based on selected_features for various tasks such as personalized_medicine correlating the large number of omics features with a certain phenotype is particularly challenging due to small_sample n and high_dimensionality p to address this small n large p problem various forms of sparse regression_models have been proposed by exploiting the sparsity assumption among these network constrained sparse regression_model is of particular interest due to its ability to utilize the prior graph network_structure in the omics_data despite its potential usefulness for omics_data analysis no efficient r implementation is publicly_available here we present an r software_package glmgraph that implements the graph constrained regularization for both sparse linear_regression and sparse logistic_regression we implement both the l penalty and minimax concave penalty for variable_selection and laplacian penalty for coefficient smoothing efficient coordinate descent algorithm is used to solve the optimization_problem we demonstrate the use of the package by applying it to a human_microbiome dataset where phylogeny structure among bacterial_taxa is available with the development of high_throughput technology such as next_generation biology has advanced into the big_data era though generation of these omics_data has become increasingly cheaper high_throughput analysis of the omics_data remains_challenging due to the massive_amounts of omics features one central_goal of genomic studies is to correlate these omics features with a variable of interest such as disease status sparse regression_models which jointly analyze the omics features have gained popularity for omics_data analysis due to its good model interpretability computational_efficiency and superior predictive_power the omics features are usually related by an underlying graph or network for example genes can be grouped into biological_pathways and metagenomic_sequences are related by a phylogenetic_tree incorporating the prior network information has been demonstrated to improve both model_selection and predictive_power the network constrained sparse regression_model proposed by which smoothes the coefficients with respect to the underlying network_structure by imposing a laplacian penalty provides an efficient way to utilize the prior structure information however no r package of the method has been available though it can be cast into a lasso problem by data augmentation approach for a continuous response it is not computationally_efficient and memory friendly especially when the dimension p is high since it converts an n p data matrix into an n p p augmented data matrix the data augmentation approach cannot be extended to handle the binary outcome and network constrained sparse logistic_regression requires specific algorithm moreover no software exists for the combination of laplacian penalty and non convex sparsity penalty such as the minimax concave penalty mcp though the superior property of the combination has been demonstrated in linear_regression setting therefore we aim to provide an r package with similar interface as the popularly used glmnet package to implement the network constrained sparse linear_and with sparsity options of l penalty and mcp direct cyclic coordinate descent algorithm is applied to speed up computation the r package glmgraph will be useful for variable_selection and prediction for high_dimensional when there exists graph network_structure among predictors
