paradigm_shift predicts the function of mutations in multiple_cancers using pathway impact analysis motivation a current challenge in understanding cancer processes is to pinpoint which mutations influence the onset and progression of disease toward this goal we describe a method called paradigm_shift that can predict whether a mutational event is neutral gain or loss of function in a tumor sample the method uses a belief_propagation algorithm to infer gene activity from gene_expression and copy_number data in the context of a set of pathway interactions results the method was found to be both sensitive and specific on a set of positive_and controls for multiple_cancers for which pathway_information was available application to the cancer_genome glioblastoma ovarian and lung squamous cancer datasets revealed several novel mutations with predicted high impact including several genes_mutated at low_frequency suggesting the approach will be complementary to current approaches that rely on the prevalence of events to reach statistical_significance availability all source_code is available at the github repositorya comprehensive cancer survey such as that being generated by the cancer_genome tcga program uncovers numerous genomic_events in tumors that are a mix of both causal driving events and neutral passenger events that accumulate as a result of dysregulated genomic surveillance and cell_proliferation with clonal_expansion over time exome and whole_genome sequencing_efforts uncover recurrent mutational_events in a few genes and low_frequency events in many other genes importantly examples of such low_frequency genes are known to be functionally_important to disease for example although braf v e is common in melanoma it occurs in only of non_small but is clearly a driver when present although there exist well described mutations in certain codons of key_genes that drive oncogenesis most somatic_mutations in cancer are neutral with respect to overall cell fitness many approaches exist to whom correspondence should be addressed to predict the impact of a mutation however no existing method incorporates pathway level information into the assessment of the consequences of a mutation investigating the impact of a mutated gene on its pathway neighborhood may provide_complementary to existing_approaches current methods often use the frequency of a mutated gene across a cohort the location of a mutation in the gene whether the mutations are silent or non silent frame shifting potentially protein domain altering found in more evolutionarily conserved_regions of the peptide_sequence or cluster together in the protein_sequence or structure although such methods have shown tremendous success they have limitations that impact their generality for example some methods must be trained from external datasets such as from the cosmic database which introduces possible circularity to the analysis and biases the discovery of genes whose mutational impact has already been characterized the most popular_approach builds gene_signatures by training machine_learning to recognize the presence and absence of mutations from molecular_features such as gene_expression data these methods can be applied to any number of genomic perturbations including mutations focal copy_number or losses or chromatin methylation events and have the potential of detecting whether mutations in regulatory_regions have functional significance genes with expression levels that are differentially associated with the presence compared with the absence of a mutation are candidates for inclusion in the gene_signature using any number of a variety of univariate_and machine_learning and feature_selection approaches one major_limitation is that signatures often fail to generalize from one dataset to another if our pathway_knowledge surrounding a particular gene is complete enough and we have enough data to provide information about the activity of neighboring genes then we can estimate the pathway consequences of a mutation in a tumor sample intuitively if a mutation influences the function of a focus gene fg it may create a particular signature on fgs local pathway neighborhood in the case of a loss of function lof event the regulatory inputs to the fg would indicate that the gene should be turned on at the transcriptional and or post transcriptional_levels for instance a transcription_factor and kinase that regulate different parts of fgs activity may themselves be active however whenpredicting the impact of a mutation based on the activity of a fg inferred from its local pathway context lof is predicted when fgs downstream_targets have activity consistent with a low activity of fg relative to what is expected given its upstream_regulators gof is predicted when the downstream regulators are consistent with a high activity of fg but the upstream_regulators are not one inspects the activity of genes downstream of fg one might find evidence that the fg is not active for example fg also may be a transcription_factor with target_genes exhibiting_low or undetectable_levels of expression in the gain of function gof case the opposite situation would occur where the downstream_targets are consistent with a higher activity of the fg than what would be expected from fgs regulatory inputs the method we introduce paradigm_shift detects a difference in the expected activity of a gene in its downstream neighborhood relative to what is expected given its upstream neighborhood it makes use of two key pieces of information i the known genetic_interactions of a gene and ii the activation or deactivation of these interacting genes to gauge the impact of a mutational event since the method uses the data of a sample to contrast the predicted regulatory input from the downstream output of a gene it should provide somewhat orthogonal information for annotating mutations than other approaches our approach uses different information compared with proteinsequence based_approaches it enables probing into infrequent events and can be used to detect the impact of non coding mutations in addition it may be useful for detecting those cases that harbor passenger_mutations where the mutation is either neutral or the cell has compensated somehow to keep the surrounding pathway intact finally since our approach couples single gene mutation_events with broader pathway activation signatures it could be used to place genes with unknown little known function and provocative mutations into new pathways as suggested by the case of huwe the method we describe has several limitations although absolute p shifts show a good overall correlation with mutsig several of the genes seem to have predictions on average in the opposite_direction than expected e g nf in gbm complex regulatory logic surrounding the gene may show a discrepancy but the direction of the discrepancy may not always be clear it will take further investigation into these cases to determine if a reliable direction can be inferred from the sign of the p shift score the selection of the upstream and downstream pathways are key_steps for accurate prediction of events in individual samples because of the combinatorial complexity of the selection problem research is needed to determine a neighborhood that gives maximum performance at identifying the presence and absence of mutations our results do indicate that even mild supervision of the neighborhood selection_step gives slightly better performance in addition an svm gene_expression based_approach provides higher accuracy in predicting the presence absence of mutations since the svm cannot be used to gauge the loss versus gof of a gene using the p shift together with the svm might improve the discrimination between mutant and non mutant samples as indicated in supplementarybut it will be interesting to see if the directionality of the shift is also improved in this investigation it would be informative to perturb neighborhood members connections parameters and neighborhood selection policies to measure how the performance varies to errors in the pathways finally the method can only be applied to genes with sufficient representation in the curated set of pathway interactions although current pathway_databases have a biased coverage of cancer_related many of the genes with low_frequency mutations are still among those with little pathway_information it is critical to expand pathways beyond the curated set to encompass such orphan genes into the analysis of mutation consequences indeed current efforts are underway to expand pathway_databases by including highthroughput functional_genomics results these efforts should greatly improve the breadth of genes to which pathway based mutation impact approaches can be applied
