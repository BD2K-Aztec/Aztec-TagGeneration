detecting host_factors involved in virus_infection by observing the clustering of infected_cells in sirna screening images motivation detecting human proteins that are involved in virus_entry and replication is facilitated by modern high_throughput rnai screening technology however hit lists from different laboratories have shown only little consistency this may be caused by not only experimental discrepancies but also not fully explored possibilities of the data analysis we wanted to improve reliability of such screens by combining a population analysis of infected_cells with an established dye intensity readout results viral_infection is mainly spread by cellcell contacts and clustering of infected_cells can be observed during spreading of the infection in situ and in vivo we employed this clustering feature to define knockdowns which harm viral_infection efficiency of human hepatitis_c images of knocked_down cells for human kinase genes were analyzed with an established point pattern analysis method ripleys k function to detect knockdowns in which virally infected_cells did not show any clustering and therefore were hindered to spread their infection to their neighboring_cells the results were compared with a statistical_analysis using a common intensity readout of the gfp expressing viruses and a luciferase based secondary screen yielding five promising host_factors which may suit as potential targets for drug_therapy conclusion we report of an alternative method for high_throughput imaging methods to detect host_factors being relevant for the infection efficiency of viruses the method is generic and has the potential to be used for a large variety of different viruses and treatments being screened by imaging_techniques contactdespite many remarkable discoveries in virology viruses are still a major cause of severe diseases including dengue_fever hepatitis immune_deficiency and severe influenza viruses employ specific human host_proteins host_factors for each step of their life_cycle discovering these host_factors may not only unravel fundamental principals of viral modes of operation like their replication but also notably may lead to promising drug_therapies to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as which are not affected by the high mutational variability in viral_populations fluorescence_microscopy imaging of rna_interference rnai knockdown screens has become a major method of choice to identify the function of the proteins corresponding to the silenced genes and specifically to detect potential_drug typically these screens are based on endpoint assays of transfected_cells with a direct intensity readout more recently large_scale imaging has been used to study the transfected_cells image_analysis was developed to segment cells and extract cellular texture_features enabling machine_learning to identify subcellular_location and to classify the mitotic phase of imaged cells for hiv three such genome_wide knock_down studies have been performed however there was only little overlap in the predicted host_factors reducing the infection this discrepancy might be due to differences in the experimental_conditions like using different viral_strains investigating different time intervals or using different silencing sequences in addition it may have also resulted from incomplete_data analysis therefore we developed an alternative approach to detect host_factors with such a screening method viruses can spread within the host by release of cell_free virions or direct passage between infected and non infected_cells in general direct cellcell transfer is considerably more efficient than a cellfree transfer and is supported by filopodial bridges as a consequence of such a viral cell cell_spreading clusters of infected_cells may be formed it was reported recently that spatial distribution of cells can influence the infection behavior snijder and co workers observed intriguing relationships between virus species the spatial distribution of cells and the infection rate while the infection efficiency of a rotavirus was considerably_increased in sparse populations dengue_viruses mainly employed cells located at edges of islets and murine hepatitis viruses were preferably found in dense cell_populations to analyze such clustering patterns systematically statistical_methods for point pattern analysis can be employed ripleys k function is an established measure for defining the degree of clustering it evaluates all interparticle distances over the studied area and compares the observed distribution with a random_distribution of spots ripleys k function has been used in ecology epidemiology and geography in cell_biology it was applied to study integrin sensingwe applied an image_processing analysis a clustering analysis method and statistical_analyses of intensity readouts to detect host_factors involved in hcv_infection instead of observing knockdowns of viral components we focused on specific proteins in the host_cell targeting host_factors which are relevant to viral_replication showed distinct lower clustering of the infected_cells specifically all three positive controls showed significantly low clustering scores additionally we got hits having significantly low viral gfp intensities observed in the primary screen and hits from a secondary screen_based on a luciferase read out computing the intersection of hits from all three approaches yielded five genes to be considered as attractive targets against hcv_infection besides two well known host_factors being relevant for hcv_replication cd and pi ka and one host_factor which has been described to phosphorylate an hcv protein we also found two new challenging candidates flt and slamf flt has interesting characteristics it was observed that it suited for a retrovirus to be genomically incorporated even though known virulence principles of hcv and retroviruses are very different such a mechanism may have similar advantages for replication of hcv as for the evolutionary benefits of the retrovirus to measure clustering we used the inhomogeneous ripleys k function which has been used in a broad variety of scientific applications ranging from the clustering behavior of infected habitants in a country to cell biological concerns as e g studying the clustering of integrins when cells sense the extra_cellular we used ripleys k function now for observing the clustering behavior of individual infected_cells in a cellular in vitro assay with such a clustering analysis method we were able to track infection populations in a systematic way and used it to support finding crucial host_factors for viral_replication besides applying ripleys k function to detect relevant host_factors as shown in this study it additionally may be applied to systematically investigate the infection behavior of different virus families snijder and co workers observed principal differences of virus entities to populate cell samples ripleys k function may be used to follow_up this study by a quantitative clustering analysis supporting putting up a taxonomy for virus strains based on their population characteristics in the host it is known e g that the dengue_virus infects edges of islets in cell colonies and therefore does not exhibit such a clustering tendency as hcv in an initial trial we observed distinct higher clustering scores for cells infected by hcv in comparison to cells infected by the dengue_virus applying a clustering analysis method for estimating the virulence in cellular assays is general and can be used for other screens to observe infectious propagation in cellular populations it may also be used for a quantitative and systematic analysis of the specific spreading and populating behavior of distinct virus families which may also have an impact on the discovery of their specific use of host_factors
