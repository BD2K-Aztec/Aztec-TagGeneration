simultaneous prediction of enzyme orthologs from chemical transformation patterns for de_novo metabolic_pathway motivation metabolic_pathways are an important class of molecular_networks consisting of compounds enzymes and their interactions the understanding of global metabolic_pathways is extremely_important for various applications in ecology and pharmacology however large_parts of metabolic_pathways remain_unknown and most organism specific pathways contain many missing enzymes results in this study we propose a novel method to predict the enzyme orthologs that catalyze the putative reactions to facilitate the de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways from metabolome scale compound sets the algorithm detects the chemical transformation patterns of substrateproduct pairs using chemical graph alignments and constructs a set of enzyme specific classifiers to simultaneously predict all the enzyme orthologs that could catalyze the putative reactions of the substrateproduct pairs in the joint learning framework the originality of the method lies in its ability to make predictions for thousands of enzyme orthologs simultaneously as well as its extraction of enzyme specific chemical transformation patterns of substrateproduct pairs we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by applying it to some ten thousands of metabolic compounds and analyze the extracted chemical transformation patterns that provide insights into the characteristics and specificities of enzymes the proposed method will open the door to both primary central and secondary_metabolism in genomics research increasing research productivity to tackle a wide_variety of environmental and public_health matters metabolic_pathways are an important class of molecular_networks that consist of chemical_compounds or metabolites enzyme proteins and their interactions the understanding of global metabolic_pathways is extremely_important for various applications in ecology heidel and pharmacology however large_parts of metabolic_pathways remain_unknown and most organism specific pathways contain many missing enzymes for example it is estimated that more than one million_compounds exist in the plant_kingdom although the number of enzymes that are experimentally_verified and approved by the international_union of biochemistry and molecular_biology iubmb is only approximately this indicates our lack of knowledge on enzymatic_reactions it is still difficult to experimentally verify enzyme functions in biological_processes thus there is a strong need for in silico metabolic_pathway a variety of methods have been developed for the in silico reconstruction of metabolic_pathways they can be categorized into three approaches the most traditional approach assigns putative enzyme genes to appropriate positions in pre defined reference pathways based on sequence_homology with genes across different v c the author published_by in this study we proposed a novel method for the de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways from metabolome scale compound sets this was made possible by elucidating the putative reaction_networks among compounds and by predicting the associated enzyme orthologs catalyzing the putative reactions in a seamless mannar particularly we developed a novel algorithm to predict enzyme orthologs catalyzing the putative reactions in the jl framework the originality of the method lies in its ability to make predictions for thousands of enzyme orthologs simultaneously as well as its extraction of enzyme specific chemical transformation patterns of substrateproduct pairs we demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed method in terms of prediction_accuracy large_scale applicability and interpretability of the predictive_models the proposed method will enable us to analyze both primary central and secondary_metabolism as well as underground metabolism the series of alternative reactions by known enzymes which is expected to be useful for various applications here we elaborate on the importance of predicting enzyme orthologs rather than predicting ec numbers there have been several previous_studies to predict ec numbers from chemical_structures an ec_number consists of four numerals connected by dots the first three numerals ec_sub represent an enzyme classification based on the reactions they catalyze whereas full ec numbers including the fourth numeral are enzyme identifiers rather than an enzyme classification when an enzyme is found to catalyze a previously_unknown reaction a new ec_number is assigned this makes it reasonable to find existing ec numbers for a known reaction but it makes no sense to predict existing ec numbers including the fourth digit for a previously_unknown reaction in contrast it still makes sense to predict existing ec_sub for a previously_unknown reaction however the number of ec_sub is much smaller than the number of enzyme orthologs meaning that an ec subsubclass generally corresponds to many enzyme orthologs which makes it ineffective to use ec_sub for enzyme prediction for this reason we attempted to directly link enzyme orthologs to reactions an ortholog is a group of highly homologous_genes or proteins that are considered to have the same biological_function across different organisms examples_include clusters_of and ko theoretically any set of ortholog groups can be used in the analysis but in this study we used the ko database because of its higher_coverage to date orthologs have been defined in the ko database of which there are enzyme orthologs the number of enzyme orthologs is larger than the number of ec_sub ec_sub more importantly enzyme orthologs represent groups of enzymes based on the sequence_homology not on the reactions they catalyze therefore the enzyme_function may change due to amino_acid a limited number of enzyme proteins within an enzyme ortholog catalyze a verified reaction some enzyme proteins may catalyze the same reaction or different reactions and others may catalyze no reaction at all it is therefore reasonable to assume that an enzyme ortholog may catalyze a novel reaction that is yet to be identified in order to elaborate on our results we examined the distribution of sequence_similarity calculated using the smith_waterman score smith and within the same enzyme orthologs and between different enzyme orthologs if the hierarchical classification of enzymes by ec numbers reflected the similarity of enzyme proteins then enzymes in the same ec sub subclass whould be more similar than those in different ec_sub however this is not always true the first second and third box plots inshow the distributions of sequence similarity_scores among enzymes associated with ec and ec seesimultaneous prediction of enzyme orthologs from chemical transformation patterns i a and b the median_scores between ec and ec were not significantly different from those within the same ec subsubclasses in fact these two enzymes had common characteristics in their reactions as shown_inand ec are very similar in terms of both enzymatic_reactions and enzyme proteins making it reasonable to predict the same chemical_transformations these results demonstrate an advantage of the enzyme ortholog over the ec subsubclass for the de_novo reconstruction of metabolic_pathways the proposed method is expected to reconstruct metabolic_pathways consisting of a wide_range of new reactions that are not defined within the existing ec numbers
