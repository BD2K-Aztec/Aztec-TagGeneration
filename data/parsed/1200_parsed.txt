crispr do for genome_wide crispr design and optimization motivation despite the growing popularity in using crispr_cas technology for genome_editing and gene_knockout its performance still relies on well designed single guide rnas sgrna in this study we propose a web_application for the design and optimization crispr do of guide sequences that target both coding_and in spcas crispr system across human mouse zebrafish fly and worm genomes crispr do uses a computational sequence model to predict sgrna efficiency and employs a specificity scoring_function to evaluate the potential of off target effect it also provides information on functional_conservation of target_sequences as well as the overlaps with exons putative regulatory_sequences and single_nucleotide snps the web_application has a user_friendly genomebrowser interface to facilitate the selection of the best target_dna for experimental_design availability_and crispr do is available at
