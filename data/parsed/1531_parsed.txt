editing validating and translating of sbgn maps motivation the recently_proposed systems_biology sbgn provides a standard for the visual representation of biochemical and cellular_processes it aims to support more efficient and accurate communication of biological_knowledge between different research_communities in the life_sciences however to increase the use of sbgn tools for editing validating and translating sbgn maps are desirable results we present sbgn ed a tool which allows the creation of all three types of sbgn maps from scratch or the editing of existing maps the validation of these maps for syntactical and semantical correctness the translation of networks from the kegg and metacrop databases into sbgn and the export of sbgn maps into several file and image formats availability sbgn ed is freely_available from http vanted ipk gatersleben de addons sbgn ed the web_site contains also tutorials and example files the systems_biology sbgn http sbgn org is an emerging standard for the visual representation of biological_networks this standardization aims to improve information_exchange and to support the collaborative creation of large maps based on individual modules such unified graphical_representation should overcome the current situation in which many different styles of networks are used in biochemical biological and medical books articles and online_resources especially in the growing field of systems_biology where increasingly_complex and large_networks have to be investigated sbgn offers a promising approach for creating more intuitive and unambiguous visualizations three different views of biological_processes cover different levels of detail process description pd which shows the temporal dependencies of biological_interactions in a network in detail entity relationship er which displays the relationships in which a given entity participates in a network without consideration of temporal aspects and activity flow af which shows the flow of information between biological_entities in a network in an abstract way to whom correspondence should be addressed drawing large interaction maps is a time consuming task to enhance the usability of sbgn tool support for creating editing and validating such maps is required currently several tools support or have started to consider sbgn for an overview see http sbgn org sbgn software here we present sbgn ed a vanted add on for editing validating and translating of sbgn maps sbgn ed contains a unique combination of features from sbgn map creation and editing to syntactic and semantic validation of sbgn maps to automatic translation of existing non sbgn networks from kegg and metacrop into sbgn and to the export of sbgn maps in different file and image formats furthermore all methods of the vanted system for integration and network based analysis of high_throughput data data visualization and network layout as well as constraint based model_simulation are fully accessible to the sbgn maps the vanted system and the sbgn ed add on form a comprehensive platform for sbgn supported analysis and visualization of biological_networks
