databases_and universal dynamical_properties preclude standard clustering in a large class of biochemical data motivation clustering of chemical and biochemical data based on observed features is a central cognitive step in the analysis of chemical substances in particular in combinatorial_chemistry or of complex biochemical_reaction often for reasons unknown to the researcher this step produces disappointing_results once the sources of the problem are known improved clustering_methods might revitalize the statistical_approach of compound and reaction search and analysis here we present a generic mechanism that may be at the origin of many clustering difficulties results the variety of dynamical behaviors that can be exhibited by complex biochemical_reactions on variation of the system parameters are fundamental system fingerprints in parameter_space shrimp like or swallow tail structures separate parameter_sets that lead to stable periodic dynamical_behavior from those leading to irregular behavior we work out the genericity of this phenomenon and demonstrate novel examples for their occurrence in realistic models of biophysics although we elucidate the phenomenon by considering the emergence of periodicity in dependence on system parameters in a low_dimensional parameter_space the conclusions from our simple setting are shown to continue to be valid for features in a higher dimensional feature_space as long as the feature generating mechanism is not too extreme and the dimension of this space is not too high compared with the amount of available data availability_and for online versions of super para magnetic clustering seebiological organisms are able to fabricate intricate machineries from the molecular_scale up to the macroscopic scale without the obvious need to store and to explicitly handle the corresponding information synthetic_biology molecular programming and nucleic_acid nanotechnology have thus become an experimental playground for the search for systems that carry out humandefined molecular programs to input output and manipulate molecular_structures for chemistry to become the next information_technology substrate improved tools for designing simulating and analyzing complex molecular circuits and systems are necessary on the dna nanotechnology model system corresponding knowledge is presently quickly growing and the area of alternative computing paradigms starting to take shape from a physics point_of biological and physical_processes start to converge so that to describe biochemical computation concepts from physics can be borrowed and applied see e g as will be exhibited below figs and most real_world systems exhibit a non trivial behavior of some observables in time many such processes exhibit periodicity the circadian_rhythm the cell_cycle reproduction which therefore has often been regarded as a key expression of the essential mechanisms of life conversely irregular behavior is often related to abnormal stimuli or to a defect or disorder of the generating mechanism the cortex however provides an example that shows that this does not necessarily have to be the case see modern_methods of measurements and modeling have now provided techniques that permit the observation of dynamical aspects of processes which in the past because of a lack of such technology were described as steady_state genetic expression processes are an example thereof recently it has been possible to measure down to single_cell expression which revealed different kinds of rhythmic to irregular expression_patterns in our study we will put forward a generic model that demonstrates that regular and stochastic expression may result from the same non linear system and that the transition among these states may require small parameter changes only in section we will exhibit how more general gene_expression complexity may emerge from the generic model a particular well known example of regular behavior is the circadian_clock decades_ago the circadian_rhythm was believed to be singularly implemented by means of a central clockwork or pattern generator it was however discovered that the mutation of a single allele of a single locus called the per gene triggers drosophila mutants with different circadian_rhythms many of the genes and proteins involved in this process have been evidenced in mammals as well where the circadian_clock arises from the temporally regulated activity of proteingene pairs a variety of tissues and cells containing functional autonomous clocks are to whom correspondence should be addressed able to maintain their oscillation when placed in vitro removed from any external cues or signals originating from environmental clocks this naturally leads to the hypothesis that the circadian_rhythm and more generally periodic dynamics is dispersed in any living system with potentially every cell containing a functional clock from the genetic base the circadian_rhythm is implemented by means of a gene_expression network hosting a delayed feedback_loop that causes the transcripts to oscillate with an approximate period of h a recently found period doubling in the mouse and oscillation bifurcations in the rat hint at the nonlinear nature of this effect non linearity is also at the heart of the phenomenon that we describe below the aim of this article is to demonstrate how the distribution of regular and irregular systems is governed by a systems non linearity in a generic manner and that from this consequences for the system biology analysis of data may emerge the two instances of system biological analysis that we discuss at the end of this contribution from this point_of are clustering on a system level and parameter_inference for biological_systems the identification of the areas in parameter_space responsible for periodic behavior is therefore an important task
