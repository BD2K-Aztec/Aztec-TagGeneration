sequence_analysis a tree based_approach for motif_discovery and sequence classification motivation pattern discovery algorithms are widely used for the analysis of dna and protein_sequences most algorithms have been designed to find overrepresented motifs in sparse datasets of long_sequences and ignore most positional_information we introduce an algorithm optimized to exploit spatial_information in sparse but populous datasets results our algorithm tree based weighted position pattern discovery and classification t wppdc supports both unsupervised pattern discovery and supervised sequence classification it identifies positionally enriched patterns using the kullback_leibler distance between foreground and background sequences at each position this spatial_information is used to discover positionally important patterns t wppdc then uses a scoring_function to discriminate different biological classes we validated t wppdc on an important biological problem prediction of single_nucleotide snps from flanking_sequence we evaluated separate experiments on datasets derived from multiple species t wppdc outperformed other pattern discovery methods and was comparable to the supervised machine_learning the algorithm is computationally_efficient and largely insensitive to dataset size it allows arbitrary parameterization and is embarrassingly parallelizable conclusions t wppdc is a minimally parameterized algorithm for both pattern discovery and sequence classification that directly incorporates positional_information we use it to confirm the predictability of snps from flanking_sequence and show that positional_information is a key to this biological problem contacts pattern discovery algorithms have been widely used in bioinformatics to analyze recurrent groups of symbols such to whom correspondence should be addressed as dna and protein_sequences existing_methods can be divided_into two classes based on their underlying approach probabilistic versus deterministic probabilistic methods maximize the likelihood between a motif pattern model and a background pattern model gibbs_sampling and its variants are the prototypical probabilistic methods some deterministic methods construct candidate patterns from a given pattern length and alphabet size e g oligo analysis dyad analysis van and ymf some enumerate possible patterns from given sequences e g mopac while others use tree structures e g weeder or other mathematical approaches e g projection despite this methodological diversity there are three issues not well addressed by the existing algorithms first positional variability in sequences is typically ignored most widely used pattern discovery methods focus on finding high_frequency sequences independent of their location primarily representing patterns with position_specific or markov_models however these techniques assume equal occurrence probabilities at all positions within a sequence this assumption does not hold for many biological_datasets a recent method amadeus uses a localization score to estimate whether the occurrences of the motif tend to cluster at specific distance from the transcription_start however they focused on the specific distance or a range of sequences not all the positions of each sequences second it is unclear how to handle the numerous lowinformation content motifs that occur in biological_datasets the presence of such motifs is a major reason for the low accuracy of current pattern discovery methods third current_algorithms focus on analyzing sparse datasets comprising a small number of long_sequences the advent of next generation genome_sequencing has led to much populous short sequence_data to address_these we developed a new pattern discovery algorithm called tree based weighted position pattern discovery and classification t wppdc t wppdc first applies kullbackleibler distance between foreground and background sequences to determine a weight for each sequence position it next integrates this spatial data to discover positionally important patterns such patterns are used to classify sequences moreover the tree_structure used by t wppdc allows handling of different
