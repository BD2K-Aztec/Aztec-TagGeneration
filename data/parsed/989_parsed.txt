clamms a scalable algorithm for calling common and rare copy_number from exome sequencing_data several algorithms exist for detecting copy_number cnvs from human exome_sequencing read_depth but previous tools have not been well suited for large population studies on the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of exomes their limitations include being difficult to integrate into automated variant_calling pipelines and being ill suited for detecting common_variants to address_these we developed a new algorithmcopy number estimation using lattice aligned mixture_models clamms which is highly scalable and suitable for detecting cnvs across the whole allele frequency_spectrum results in this note we summarize the methods and intended use case of clamms compare it to previous_algorithms and briefly describe results of validation experiments we evaluate the adherence of cnv_calls from clamms and four other algorithms to mendelian_inheritance patterns on a pedigree we compare calls from clamms and other algorithms to calls from snp_genotyping for a set of samples and we use taqman quantitative_polymerase to validate cnvs predicted by clamms at loci of rare_variants validate across common_variant loci the mean precision and recall are and respectively in the supplementary_materials available at the clamms github repository we present our methods and validation results in greater detail availability_and https github com rgcgithub clamms implemented in c detecting copy_number cnvs with whole exome_sequencing is challenging because cnv breakpoints are likely to fall outside of the exome almost all cnv_calling algorithms for whole_exome base their calls on read_depths within the cnv which are linearly correlated to copy_number state previously_published algorithms include conifer xhmm exomedepth and canoes depth of coverage is subject to both systematic_biases often related to sequence gc_content and stochastic volatility which is exacerbated by variation in input dna quality cnv callers must normalize coverage data to correct for systematic_biases and characterize the expected coverage profile given diploid copy_number so v c the author published_by
