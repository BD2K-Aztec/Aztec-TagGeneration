the tradis toolkit sequencing and analysis for dense transposon mutant libraries transposon_insertion sequencing is a high_throughput technique for assaying large_libraries of otherwise isogenic transposon mutants providing insight into gene_essentiality gene function and genetic_interactions we previously_developed the transposon directed insertion sequencing tradis protocol for this purpose which utilizes shearing of genomic_dna followed by specific pcr_amplification of transposon containing fragments and illumina_sequencing here we describe an optimized high yield library_preparation and sequencing protocol for tradis experiments and a novel software pipeline for analysis of the resulting data the bio tradis analysis_pipeline is implemented as an extensible perl library which can either be used as is or as a basis for the development of more advanced analysis tools this article can serve as a general reference for the application of the tradis methodology availability_and the optimized sequencing protocol is included as supplementary_information the bio tradis analysis_pipeline is available under a gpl license at https github com sanger pathogens bio tradissteady improvements in high_throughput have resulted in an increasing number of sequenced bacterial_genomes revealing extensive genetic_diversity both within and between species associated sequencing based_technologies such as rnaseq chip_seq and rip_seq provide insight into the effects of this variation on gene_expression and regulation however none provides direct information on cell_survival and hence how this genetic_variation may impact the fitness of the bacterium transposon_insertion sequencing tis bridges this gap between sequence and fitness by allowing for direct measurement of survival dynamics within a population of single transposon mutants by using sequencing_reads flanking transposon insertions as a readout of mutant frequency within the population we previously_developed a method for this purpose called transposon directed insertion sequencing tradis uses fragmentation of genomic_dna followed by specific pcr_amplification of transposon containing fragments to selectively enrich for transposon flanking_sequences and can be adapted for any transposon of interest through a simple redesign of sequencing primers tradis has since been applied to a variety of target organisms and transposons in a wide_variety of both in vivo and in vitro growth conditions these include tn based libraries in salmonella and escherichia and marinerbased libraries in clostridia and mycobacteria
