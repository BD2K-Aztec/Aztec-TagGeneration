bmix probabilistic modeling of occurring substitutions in par_clip data motivation photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced cross_linking and immunoprecipitation par_clip is an experimental method based on next_generation for identifying the rna interaction sites of a given protein the method deliberately inserts t to c substitutions at the rna protein interaction sites which provides a second layer of evidence compared with other clip methods however the experiment includes several sources of noise which cause both low_frequency errors and spurious high_frequency alterations therefore rigorous statistical_analysis is required in order to separate true t to c base changes following cross_linking from noise so_far most of the existing par_clip data analysis methods focus on discarding the low_frequency errors and rely on high_frequency substitutions to report binding_sites not taking_into the possibility of high_frequency false_positive substitutions results here we introduce bmix a new probabilistic_method which explicitly accounts for the sources of noise in par_clip data and distinguishes cross_link induced t to c substitutions from low and high_frequency erroneous alterations we demonstrate the superior speed and accuracy of our method compared with existing_approaches on both simulated and real publicly_available human datasets availability_and the model is freely_accessible within the bmix toolbox at www cbg bsse ethz ch software bmix available for matlab and r rna_molecules interact with proteins and form ribonucleoprotein_complexes actively involved in a plethora of essential_biological such as translational regulation alternative_splicing or rna transport a well known example of rna_binding rbps consists of members of the argonaute family components of the rna_induced risc which bind to diverse small rna_molecules and regulate gene_silencing report rbps in humans many of these having been found dysregulated in diseases_including therefore characterizing the interactions between rna and rbps represents an important step towards understanding rna function high_throughput allows querying the binding_sites of a specific rbp in a transcriptome_wide fashion one of the recently_developed high_throughput based experimental v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com protocols aiming to identify the binding_sites of rbps throughout the transcriptome is photo activatable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation par_clip according to this method a synthetic photoactivatable ribonucleoside such as s u thiouridine or less commonly s g thioguanosine is integrated into the rna of cultured_cells upon exposure to ultraviolet uv_light cross_linking of rbps to rna occurs the cross_linked rna rbp pairs are subsequently isolated using immunoprecipitation with an antibody targeting the protein of interest and the rna fragment is retrieved upon protein_digestion a complementary_dna cdna sequencing library is generated by reverse complementing the rna_fragments due to the incorporated nucleoside systematic t to c for s u or g to a for s g substitutions appear in the cdna_library at the interaction sites therefore par_clip brings the advantage of having an additional layer of evidence by introducing specific base changes at the binding_sites par_clip data are characterized by prevalent t to c substitutions observed at different mismatch frequencies however compared with rna_seq par_clip has been observed to also introduce a large number of other substitutions different from t to c notably at low and high mismatch frequency see section this indicates the presence of noise and contamination in the par_clip procedure which can as well introduce erroneous t to c substitutions with high potential to be mistaken for true cross_link alterations therefore of great_importance in parclip data analysis is discarding the low_frequency sequencing_errors as well as high_frequency spurious substitutions currently there is a handful of methods available for analyzing par_clip data trying to identify the rna rbp binding_sites using various techniques such as kernel_density non parametric mixture_models bayesian hidden_markov and binomial tests some of the available methods focus on analyzing data from one specific type of rbp such as e g ago par_clip data however the non cross_link high_frequency substitutions are usually reported within high_confidence binding_sites by most of these methods to the best of our knowledge only one of the currently existing parclip analysis methods namely wavcluster accounts for these substitutions show that cross_link loci reside in moderately altered sites and within the wavcluster package use a mixture_model based on the relative substitution frequencies to exclude sites with too low or high nucleotide substitution_rates however the method is not widely used due to complex implementation and long execution time additionally the approach underlying the wavcluster package does not explicitly_model read_counts within the genome and eventually uses a fixed cutoff of the substitution frequencies to select high_confidence t to c alterations which leads to a higher_error especially in low coverage regions here we present a novel probabilistic_approach based on a constrained three component binomial mixture to explicitly describe substitution counts observed in par_clip data the method coined bmix uses a maximum_likelihood approach to estimate the substitution_rates induced by parclip and separates both low and high_frequency erroneous t to c alterations from the true cross_link substitutions we perform an exhaustive comparison of bmix to existing_approaches and show its increased performance in terms of speed accuracy and consistency on synthetic and real_data we validated our model on synthetic and real human par_clip data and assessed its performance compared with paralyzer and wavcluster methods see section
