genome_analysis probabilistic alignments with quality_scores an application to short_read toward accurate snp indel detection motivation recent_studies have revealed the importance of considering quality_scores of reads generated by next generation sequence ngs_platforms in various downstream_analyses it is also known that probabilistic alignments based on marginal probabilities e g aligned column and or gap probabilities provide more accurate alignment than conventional maximum_score based alignment there exists however no study about probabilistic alignment that considers quality_scores explicitly although the method is expected to be useful in snp indel callers and bisulfite mapping because accurate estimation of aligned columns or gaps is important in those analyses results in this study we propose methods of probabilistic alignment that consider quality_scores of one of the sequences as well as a usual score matrix the method is based on posterior decoding techniques in which various marginal probabilities are computed from a probabilistic_model of alignments with quality_scores and can arbitrarily trade_off sensitivity and positive_predictive ppv of prediction aligned columns and gaps the method is directly applicable to read_mapping alignment toward accurate detection of snps and indels several computational_experiments indicated that probabilistic alignments can estimate aligned columns and gaps accurately compared with other mapping algorithms e g shrimp stampy bwa and novoalign the study also suggested that our approach yields favorable precision for snp indel calling a number of recent_studies have revealed the importance of considering quality_scores of short_reads produced by nextgeneration_sequencing ngs_platforms e g illumina ga roche flx and abiin various fundamental analyses on ngs_data mapping alignment of reads to reference_genomes lunter and goodson to whom correspondence should be addressed error_correction of reads insertion and deletion indel detection from mapped_reads and gene prediction from reads derived from metagenomic_data this is because error_rates of current ngs_platforms are relatively high and the errors cannot be ignored in those analyses several recent_studies also suggest that probabilistic alignment_techniques estimate more accurate alignment in terms of aligned columns or gaps than conventional maximum_score based alignments for example centroid alignment is theoretically suitable for accuracy_measures such as the sensitivity and positive_predictive ppv with respect to aligned bases we call it aligned column accuracy formally defined later in centroid alignment the marginal probability of aligned bases is employed on the other hand proposed probabilistic alignments which use the marginal probabilities of gaps as well as the marginal probabilities of aligned columns those probabilistic alignments are therefore appropriate for accuracy_measures in terms of prediction of gaps we call it gap accuracy when quality_scores are given to both or one of the sequences to be aligned probabilistic alignments that consider the quality_scores are useful for estimating accurate alignments there do not exist however any studies about this utilized conventional maximum_score based alignment not probabilistic alignments while considering quality_scores employed a probabilistic centroid alignment without considering quality_scores in this article we therefore propose two probabilistic alignment_methods that consider quality_scores explicitly the methods are based on posterior decoding techniques which use marginal probabilities that incorporate all the possible alignments with quality_scores to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods we apply them to short_read alignment to reference_genomes mapping short_reads is one of the most fundamental information analyses of ngs_data and a number of mapping algorithms have been proposed including bowtie shrimp bwa stampy novoalign maq perm and others those mapping tools mainly focus on accurate prediction of the genomic location of mapped_reads and in the evaluation a mapped read is considered to be correct if it overlapswe proposed two probabilistic alignment_methods centroid alignment and lama alignment in which quality_scores are naturally considered from a bayesian viewpoint to the best of our knowledge this is the first article that combines probabilistic alignments and quality_scores we implemented the methods in last http last cbrc jp and applied them to read_mapping and variant_calling compared with the original last probabilistic alignment slightly improves both aligned column accuracy and gap accuracy in read_alignment the probabilistic alignment also outperformed existing algorithms moreover by utilizing a parameter probabilistic alignments can trade_off sensitivity and ppv with respect to aligned columns and or gaps this property is useful for various downstream_analysis e g variant_calling or detection of un methylated nucleotides after read_mapping
