mass_spectrometry data_processing using zero crossing lines in multi_scale of gaussian derivative wavelet motivation peaks are the key information in mass_spectrometry ms which has been increasingly used to discover diseases related proteomic patterns peak_detection is an essential step for ms based proteomic_data analysis recently several peak detection_algorithms have been proposed however in these algorithms there are three major deficiencies i because the noise is often removed the true signal could also be removed ii baseline removal step may get rid of true peaks and create new false peaks iii in peak quantification step a threshold of signal_to snr is usually used to remove false peaks however noise estimations in snr calculation are often inaccurate in either time or wavelet domain in this article we propose new algorithms to solve these problems first we use bivariate shrinkage estimator in stationary wavelet domain to avoid removing true peaks in denoising step second without baseline removal zero crossing lines in multi_scale of derivative gaussian wavelets are investigated with mixture of gaussian to estimate discriminative parameters of peaks third in quantification step the frequency sd height and rank of peaks are used to detect both high and small energy peaks with robustness to noise results we propose a novel gaussian derivative wavelet gdwavelet method to more accurately detect true peaks with a lower false_discovery than existing_methods the proposed gdwavelet method has been performed on the real surface_enhanced time of flight seldi_tof spectrum with known polypeptide positions and on two synthetic data with gaussian and real noise all experimental_results demonstrate that our method outperforms other commonly used methods the standard receiver_operating roc_curves are used to evaluate the experimental_results mass_spectrometry ms is a crucial analytical tool in proteomics research to provide tremendous information for disease proteomics study and drug_targets identification at the protein peptide level due to measurement_error chemical and other background_noise ms usually contains high_frequency noise and consequently a multitude of misleading peaks peak_detection is one of the most important_steps in ms data analysis because its performance directly effects the final proteomics study results because the noise in ms comes from different resources and cannot be estimated false_positive peak_detection results are to whom correspondence should be addressed unavoidable this makes peak_detection as a challenging_problem in recent_years several peak_detection methods have been proposed most previous_algorithms have four common preprocessing_steps denoising baseline correction alignment of spectrograms and normalization after preprocessing local maxima is usually used to detect peak positions and design rules to quantify peaks in this article we will explore the limitations of existing peak_detection methods and propose several new algorithms to solve them most peak_detection methods_employed denoising step by removing noise in each scale of wavelet such as commonly used cromwell and continuous_wavelet cwt methods however true peaks in ms could have large frequency_response and be removed by denoising step as a result these true peaks cannot be detected we propose using bivariate shrinkage model which considers relationship of two neighbor scales to remove noise in stationary wavelet domain because utilizing relationship between two neighbor coefficients or two scales of wavelets can keep highfrequency true signal stationary wavelet_transform swt utilizes spatial_information of signals and suppress artifacts by redundant representations baseline removal step was widely used in peak_detection methods but it often got rid of true peaks and created new false peaks to avoid removing baseline the cwt based pattern matching algorithm was introduced in study by using mexican hat wavelet in multi_scale this method_gave good results in peak_detection with high_sensitivity and low false_discovery fdr however the more important property of multi_scale in wavelet domain was not used in this method instead of considering peaks as the sum of delta functions more generally we consider ms peaks as a mixture of gaussian in which each peak corresponds to one gaussian we propose to use gaussian derivative wavelet instead of mexican hat wavelet which is only the second derivative of gaussian wavelet zero crossing lines which are robust to noise are also introduced to replace ridge lines in we study the zero crossing lines in multi_scale wavelet and provide new theoretical_analysis in most peak_detection methods signal_to snr was used to remove the small energy peaks with snr values less than a threshold but ms noise cannot be correctly estimated in either time domain or wavelet domain thus in this article instead of snr frequency_response height and sd of gaussian peaks calculated by zero crossing in gaussian derivative wavelet domain are used to remove false peaks in order to improve sensitivity the envelope analysis is also used to save some important peaks with small energy
