databases_and snpdbe constructing an nssnp functional_impacts database many existing databases annotate experimentally_characterized single_nucleotide snps each non synonymous snp nssnp changes one amino_acid in the gene_product single amino_acid saas this change can either affect protein_function or be neutral in that respect most polymorphisms lack experimental annotation of their functional impact here we introduce snpdbesnp database of effects with predictions of computationally annotated functional_impacts of snps database entries represent nssnps in dbsnp and genomes collection as well as variants from uniprot and pmd saass come from organisms human being the most prevalent the impact of each saas on protein_function is predicted using the snap and sift algorithms and augmented with experimentally_derived function structure information and disease associations from pmd omim and uniprot snpdbe is consistently updated and easily augmented with new sources of information the database is available as an mysql dump and via a web front end that allows searches with any combination of organism names sequences and mutation ids availability http www rostlab org services snpdbe contact resources like dbsnp and uniprot contain many experimentally_determined nssnps but few of these are annotated with respect to function some databases e g pmd contain experimental annotations of functional effects of mutants however these are sparsely populated and do not directly link to dbsnp or uniprot for the vast_majority of mutations lacking experimental annotation we can gauge functional impact only via in silico analysis proper use of computational_methods requires specific skills and resources generally inaccessible to medical researchers or experimental biologists to help we created an mysql_database readily usable by non experts we collected saass from pmd dbsnp genomes genomes_project consortium and uniprot variants and mutants we also store conflict records to illustrate how sequencing discrepancies may lead to differing interpretations of the functional significance of a given to whom correspondence should be addressed sequence position for each saas we predict the functional effect using snap and sift where available predictions are augmented by experimental annotations and associated human_diseases we also compute evolutionary_conservation of the mutant positions a web_interface provides convenient access to underlying data via organism sequence and mutation id queries snpdbe is designed to fill the annotation gap left by the high_cost of experimental_testing for functional significance of protein variants it joins related bits of knowledge currently distributed throughout various databases into a consistent easily_accessible and updatable resource the major features distinguishing snpdbe from other databases are i the inclusion of a much wider array of organisms and data_sources and ii the explicit differentiation between functional structural effects and disease associations furthermore unlike snpdbe existing resources i lack experimental annotation of functional structural changes or offer only single tool e g sift predictions ii are limited to naturally_occurring variants iii are not consistently updated or iv do not offer pre_computed effects on a large_scale snpdbes database schema and management scripts are designed to easily handle the addition of new sequences and saass and the integration of new predictors and sources of experimental_data monthly updates are planned information about current versions of included databases and statistics is available from snpdbe website our ultimate_goal is to make snpdbe a toolbox for biologists and medical researchers dealing with mutation data computationally acquired predictions and annotations found in snpdbe will help design and prioritize further experimental research
