utilizing de_bruijn of metagenome_assembly for metatranscriptome analysis motivation metagenomics research has accelerated the studies of microbial organisms providing insights into the composition and potential functionality of various microbial_communities metatranscriptomics studies of the transcripts from a mixture of microbial_species and other meta omics approaches hold even greater promise for providing additional insights into functional and regulatory characteristics of the microbial_communities current metatranscriptomics projects are often carried_out without matched metagenomic_datasets of the same microbial_communities for the projects that produce both metatranscriptomic and metagenomic_datasets their analyses are often not integrated metagenome assemblies are far from perfect partially explaining why metagenome assemblies are not used for the analysis of metatranscriptomic datasets results here we report a reads mapping algorithm for mapping of short_reads onto a de_bruijn of assemblies a hash_table of junction k_mers k_mers spanning branching structures in the de_bruijn is used to facilitate fast mapping of reads to the graph we developed an application of this mapping algorithm a reference based_approach to metatranscriptome assembly using graphs of metagenome_assembly as the reference our results show that this new approach_called tag helps to assemble substantially more transcripts that otherwise would have been missed or truncated because of the fragmented nature of the reference metagenome metagenomes are being generated at an accelerating pace revealing important properties of microbiomes other meta omic e g metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic techniques can provide additional insights in particular into functional characteristics of microbial_communities such as gene activities and their regulatory_mechanisms bacteria have low inventories of short_lived mrnas as such fluctuations in their mrna pools provide a highly_sensitive bioassay for environmental signals e g the concentrations of dissolved_organic and pollutant_concentrations relevant to microbes the acquisition of meta omics_data on human microbiomes will enable us to refine the annotations of the metagenomes the encode and modencode projects are great exemplars and more importantly to study gene activity and its regulation in complex microbial_communities in order to understand how microbial organisms work as a community in response to changes in their environment e g health_conditions of their human_hosts a recent metatranscriptomic study of the human oral microbiome using patient matched healthy and diseased periodontal samples revealed that health and diseaseassociated communities exhibit defined differences in metabolism that are conserved between patients while the metabolic gene v c the author published_by we tested our tool tag on two metatranscriptomic datasets one derived from a mock microbial_community consisting of three bacterial_species and the other derived from a real microbiome sample in human stool results showed that our graph_based reads mapping algorithm read graph is efficient and tag which is based on the mapping algorithm significantly_improves the assembly of metatranscriptomes by considering reads mapping to branching structures in de_bruijn of matched metagenomes even though thousands of complete prokaryotic_genomes and many more draft_genomes are available metagenomes are constantly found to contain many new species and new genes it is therefore important to develop methodologies for metatranscriptome data analysis that are not constrained by the sequenced_genomes with matched metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets we believe that proper utilization of the metagenome data will help greatly the analysis of metatranscriptomic data and vice_versa the eventual integration of these datasets as well as other meta omic datasets will provide new insights on the composition function and regulation of microbiomes well assembled transcripts are important for the function_annotation of the metatranscriptome and also for inferring gene regulatory_mechanisms such as the operons we developed a novel reads mapping algorithm read graph that allows fast mapping of short_reads from transcriptome_sequencing onto the assembly graphs of reference_genomes we applied this mapping algorithm for metatranscriptome assembly showing the utility of the de_bruijn assembly_graph of the metagenome in downstream applications such as the metatranscriptome analysis our mapping tool is fast and can be applied to other applications for example mapping metagenomic sequencing_reads onto the de_bruijn of closely_related for estimating the relative_abundances of these species we have shown in a related research that genes are often broken into fragments in metagenome_assembly and multi edge spanning reads can stitch them together the mapping of multi edge spanning reads will also improve quantification of gene_expression based on read_counts in particular for genes from the same or different organisms sharing highly_similar sequences in reality however we may still miss the mapping of a small fraction of multi edgespanning reads if a read contains a sequencing_error in the occurrence of a branching k_mer we cannot find its location in the graph because of the low_error in illumina_reads we believe this fraction of reads is indeed negligible in metatranscriptomic data analysis we note that de_bruijn will naturally capture the genomic_variations of the metagenomes in the graphs e g the single_nucleotide are represented as bulges the variations in tandem_repeats are represented as wheels and structural_variations are represented long loops which is yet another advantage of using graphs instead of contigs to represent metagenomes genomic_variations in metagenomes are naturally handled by our graph centric mapping_approach we expect that a combination of different approaches reference based and de_novo need to be applied to accomplish the comprehensive metatranscriptome analysis as the references for metatranscriptome analysis the matched metagenome will never be perfect due to biological rare_species may be poorly sampled experimental some genomic_regions may not be covered well and computational assemblers are not perfect reasons integration of known reference_genomes matched metagenomes and even nonmatched metagenomes can maximize the coverage of references for reference based_approaches on the other hand if a microbial_community contains new rare but highly_expressed microbial_species their transcripts can only be revealed by de_novo metatranscriptome assembly but not by the reference based_approaches such as the one presented in this article
