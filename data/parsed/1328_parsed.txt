databases_and deori a database of eukaryotic_dna origins dna_replication a central_event for cell_proliferation is the basis of biological inheritance the identification of replication_origins helps to reveal the mechanism of the regulation of dna_replication however only few eukaryotic replication_origins were characterized not long_ago nevertheless recent genome_wide approaches have boosted the number of mapped replication_origins to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of eukaryotic replication_origins we have constructed a database of eukaryotic oris deori which contains all the eukaryotic ones identified by genome_wide analyses currently available a total of eukaryotic replication_origins have been collected from eukaryotic_organisms in which genome_wide studies have been performed the replication origin numbers being and for humans mice arabidopsis_thaliana kluyveromyces_lactis schizosaccharomyces_pombe and drosophila_melanogaster respectively availability database of eukaryotic oris deori can be accessed fromthe initiation of replication is the central_event in the cell_cycle in all three domains of life dna_replication begins at specialized loci termed replication_origins in bacteria replication initiates from a single replication origin whereas eukaryotic_organisms exploit many replication_origins in eukaryotes the origins of dna_replication in the budding_yeast and fission_yeast have been well characterized recently a high_resolution genome_wide map of dna replication_origins in kluyveromyces_lactis has also been generated however only few origins were characterized in the genomes of higher_eukaryotes not long_ago fortunately recent development of genome_wide approaches has led to a boost in the number of replication_origins that have been mapped in eukaryotic_genomes including those in human mouse arabidopsis_thaliana and drosophila_melanogaster the availability of increasing origins throughout the genomes has created opportunities for analysis of the origins on a genome_scale up to date the dna to whom correspondence should be addressed replication origin database for budding_yeast has been built whereas the database of other eukaryotic origins has not been available in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of eukaryotic replication_origins we have constructed a database of eukaryotic oris deori which contains all the eukaryotic_dna origins identified by genome_wide analyses currently available consequently we have constructed a database deori which contains all the eukaryotic_dna origins identified by genome_wide analyses currently available with the availability of the origins newly_identified by genome_wide analyses we will update deori constantly to include more entries and integrate more information for each entry this database will facilitate the comparative_genomic of replication_origins and provide some insight into the nature of replication_origins on a genome_scale one of the applications is to predict replication_origins based on homologous sequence_search against the origins of closely_related in deori for example if query_sequences in the rice_genome using blast have homologous origins of a thaliana in deori it is likely that the query_sequences are also served as origins in the rice_genome another application is to find some principles for specific organisms by the genome_wide characterization of the origins in deori which will be useful to develop new algorithms to predict replication_origins for example we can use some tools for motif_discovery to find the conserved elements within the origins of a specific organism
