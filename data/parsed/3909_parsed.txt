sequence_analysis rdp a flexible and fast computer program for analyzing recombination rdp is a new version of the rdp program for characterizing recombination_events in dna sequence_alignments among other novelties this version includes four new recombination analysis methods seq visrd phylro and ldhat new tests for recombination hot_spots a range of matrix methods for visualizing overall patterns of recombination within datasets and recombination aware ancestral sequence reconstruction complementary to a high degree of analysis flow automation rdp also has a highly interactive and detailed graphical_user that enables more focused hands on cross checking of results with a wide_variety of newly implemented phylogenetic_tree construction and matrix based recombination signal visualization methods the new rdp can accommodate large_datasets and is capable of analyzing alignments ranging in size from kilobase sequences to megabase sequences within h on a desktop pc supplementary_information the rdp program manual contains detailed_descriptions of the various methods it implements and a step_by guide describing how best to use these
