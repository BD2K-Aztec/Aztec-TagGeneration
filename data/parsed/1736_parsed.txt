genetics_and famcnv copy_number variant association for quantitative_traits in families downloaded from a program package to enable genome_wide association of copy_number cnvs with quantitative phenotypes in families of arbitrary size and complexity intensity signals that act as proxies for the number of copies are modeled in a variance_component framework and association with traits is assessed through formal likelihood testing availability_and the java package is made available at copy_number cnvs have recently attracted increasing interest as a source of phenotypic_variation in humans with both rare and common cnvs being associated with different complex_diseases e g diskin et_al walters et_al and gene_expression levels henrichsen et_al the availability of high coverage snp_arrays and the development of methods for making cnv_calls from snp data are now being exploited to evaluate genome_wide association with cnvs e g glessner et_al at present fbat ionita laza et_al is the only other available algorithm that performs association test of normalized signal_intensity measurement variations reflecting cnvs in family based datasets the family_based test implemented in fbat uses only the within family variation although that is one of the possible approaches to control for population_stratification disregarding the between family variation might lead to decreased statistical_power aulchenko et_al famcnv uses information from both within and between family variations while population_stratification issues can be detected and corrected using standard methods although qualitative cnv_calls from existing algorithms can be incorporated as multiallele loci in a family_based test direct testing of the underlying quantitative cnv measurement to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as has been shown to be more robust in identifying genuine associations in many cases mccarroll and altshuler stranger et_al moreover quantitative_trait designs are less likely to be affected by differential errors that can arise in case_control we have implemented a java program famcnv that uses intensity signals such as the log_ratio from array_comparative acgh or the log_ratio of observed to expected signal_intensity lrr from illumina genotyping_arrays the quantitative_trait of interest is analysed in a variance_component framework to model the resemblance among relatives and to remove possible bias from familiality abecasis et_al a linear_mixed is fitted to data to partition the total phenotypic_variance into a polygenic component a determined by additive_genetic and a residual variance e determined by the unique individual environment including measurement errors the variance_covariance for the subjects in each family is a l e where is the matrix of the expected proportion of alleles that are identical by descent among the family_members used to correct for the sample structure and l is an identity matrix variance_component analysis allows simultaneous modeling of the trait mean as a where is the trait mean a is a matrix of covariate_effects and the corresponding regression_coefficients the test is evaluated by comparing the likelihood of the full model where signal_intensities are included in the mean model and the likelihood of the null_model where the effect of the signal_intensities is constrained to zero twice the difference between the logarithms of the full and the null likelihoods asymptotically follows a chi_square distribution with one degree of freedom and can be used to evaluate the difference in goodness_of between the two models amos when using data from genotype arrays the b allele_frequency bafrepresenting the proportion of the total signal deriving from the b allele can also be included in both the full and null_models to control for misleading differences in an lrr distribution between genotypes that may have arisen due to errors during the array normalization process peiffer et_al the identified loci either via the reported p value or via meeting a threshold for the false_discovery fdr storey and tibshirani are expected to reflect probes that are both genuinely copy
