gene_expression inter_species inference of gene_set in lung_epithelial from proteomic and large transcriptomic datasets motivation translating findings in rodent_models to human models has been a cornerstone of modern biology and drug_development however in many cases a naive extrapolation between the two species has not succeeded as a result clinical_trials of new drugs sometimes fail even after considerable success in the mouse or rat stage of development in addition to in vitro studies inter_species translation requires analytical_tools that can predict the enriched_gene in human cells under various stimuli from corresponding measurements in animals such tools can improve our understanding of the underlying biology and optimize the allocation of resources for drug_development results we developed an algorithm to predict differential gene_set as part of the sbv improver systems_biology verification in industrial methodology for process verification in research species translation challenge which focused on phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic measurements of normal human bronchial epithe lial nhbe primary cells under various stimuli and corresponding measurements in rat nrbe primary cells we find that gene_sets exhibit a higher inter_species correlation compared with individual genes and are potentially more suited for direct prediction furthermore in contrast to a similar cross_species response in protein_phosphorylation states and min after exposure to stimuli gene_set h after exposure is significantly different in nhbe cells compared with nrbe cells in spite of this difference we were able to develop a robust algorithm to predict gene_set activation in nhbe with high_accuracy using simple analytical_methods availability_and implementation of all algorithms is available as source_code in matlab at http bhanot biomaps rutgers edu wiki codes sc predicting genesets zip along with the relevant data used in the analysis gene_sets gene_expression and protein_phosphorylation data are available on request although rodents diverged from primates around million_years the common_origin of eukaryotic multicellular_organisms suggests that basic_mechanisms in all complex life should be governed by similar pathways and principles this simple observation has led to the successful use of in vivo rat and mouse_models to understand biological_mechanisms in humans in particular the initial phases of drug_development rely heavily on knowledge gained from in vitro and in vivo experiments on model_organisms primarily from rat and mouse_models however rats or mice often differ from humans in their response to stimuli an open_problem in the field is to understand these differences especially those that affect mechanisms of pathway activation there remains a continuing need to develop better analytical_methods and modeling techniques to translate information from in vitro rat mouse studies to accurate_models of pathway activation in humans in addition to response differences at the tissue level one also expects differences at the cellular_level in rat and human cells subject to the same stimulus part of the difference in cellular response is probably because of changes in the promoter and gene sequence that alter cellular_pathways this would result in changes in expression levels thresholds reaction_rates and activation times resulting in differences in the way a stimulus may activate a given pathway for instance mouse_embryonic self renew when the lif stat_signaling is activated but human_embryonic do not both cell_types however respond similarly to wnt activation similarly mouse and human_leukocytes respond differently in terms of their gene_expression to stimuli that induce_inflammation in general one expects that there may be significant differences between species in the way single genes get activated however the regulation of collections of genes that act in concert gene_sets to activate pathways or respond to activation of a pathway might be expected to be more similar as many cellular_pathways are to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

original_work regulated by phosphorylation levels of specific families of proteins one way forward is to develop methods to predict activation of pathways in human cells from measurements of protein_phosphorylation and gene or gene_set expression levels in rats under a variety of stimuli the sbv improver systems_biology verification in industrial methodology for process verification in research_challenges are an industry initiative focused on verifying the strengths_and of systems_biology methods on a variety of biological_problems by tapping the wisdom of crowds as a part of this goal the organizers held the species translation challenge stc a challenge specifically focused on translating biological_responses observed in rat to human given the same set of perturbations in comparable cell_lines this challenge allowed teams of researchers including us to compare the performance of different methods to translate results within and between species in the specific challenge described here the so_called inter_species pathway perturbation challenge sub challenge or sc we used phosphorylation level and gene_expression data from normal rat bronchial epithelial nrbe and normal human_bronchial nhbe cells to develop a predictive_model of the activation of pathways gene_sets in humans from measurements in rats the model was trained on a set of stimuli and tested on data from the same experimental_design using different stimuli in the training data we were provided with measurements on both rat and human cells whereas in the test data we were provided only with measurements in rat the challenge was to develop a model on the training data and use it to predict pathway activation in human cells using the rat test data the results from each team were compared with a gold_standard dataset on human cells using the same stimuli our method which we describe below was judged to be the best performer in this sub challenge the outline of the article is as follows first we describe how the raw_data were processed to identify statistically_significant signals next we discuss inter_species correlations human and rat for both gene_sets and gene expression_level data in principle there are two possible strategies available to predict differential_expression enrichment of human gene_sets from the rat data see i one possibility is to use a direct method where the human gene_set enrichment_scores are learned from those in rat training data rat a human a and then applied to the rat test data gene_set scores rat b to predict human gene_set scores ii the second possibility is to use an indirect method where human gene_expression levels are learned from gene_expression levels in rat in the training data and applied to the rat b gene_expression test data to get human expression predictions finally the predicted human b gene_expression levels could be used in a gene_set algorithm gsea to predict human gene_set scores although we attempted both methods for our final prediction we used only the direct method below we outline our reasons for choosing the direct method followed by a detailed_description of the prediction algorithm we used for our predictions we devised an algorithm to predict differential gene_set in nhbe primary cells under various stimuli from measurements of nrbe primary cells exposed to the same stimuli as a part of our analysis we computed the mi between the differential enrichment of the corresponding gene_sets and also ortholog pairs of genes in the two species mi objectively quantifies the predictive_power of the rat data without a need to assume an underlying model it also determines the level of difficulty of the prediction higher mi naively implies that inference should be easier we found that h after exposure gene_set in nhbe is significantly different than in nrbe despite almost identical response in protein_phosphorylation states measured and min after exposure as phosphorylation happens close to the beginning of the signaling_cascade it is expected that the response at a fixed early time point should be more conserved between the two species as the signal is transmitted further along the signaling_pathway slight_differences between the two species can result in divergence of their response at later time points this is principally manifested in the inverse relationship observed between the human and rat gene_set that had the highest mi dna_replication gene_set to rule out a bias from gsea analysis as the cause we computed the mi directly for each pair of ortholog genes the ortholog gene_pair with the highest mi dpp was also negatively_correlated in expression levels between the two species how can a gene_set be differentially_expressed in the nhbe cells when they are not in rat cells and vice_versa under the same stimuli one possibility is that this reflects an evolutionary_divergence of the particular pathway in the two species however this is unlikely as it would imply that biological modules are completely anticorrelated in function in nhbe cells compared with nrbe cells a more likely explanation is that the discrepancy stems from a time difference between rat and human in how the phosphorprotein activates downstream_genes it reflects the limitation of the measurement process used in this challenge where gene_expression levels were measured at the arbitrary time point top training the algorithm to predict gene_set g in human under stimulus s first represent the rat nes scores under the stimuli of set a as points in n dimensional_space where n is the number of principal_components used the figure shows a diagram for n we used n for the actual prediction label each of the points as either off or on based on the human fdr value of gene_set g under the same stimuli next identify the hyperplane that best separates the two types of labels bottom predicting gene_set g under stimulus s of set b introduce a new point corresponding to the reduced representation of rat nes score under stimulus s depending on which side of the hyperplane the point falls on and its separation distance from the plane classify as either and and associate a statistical significancethe algorithm described in this article is that of team the predicted response to the stimuli of set b is compared with the measured response using the aupr pearson_correlation and bac for details on these metrics and the scoring see asterisk denotes the authors team number in the challenge the blue line corresponds to correlating the prediction to the binarized known fdr values on when fdr and the red line to correlation with the fdr values converted to a continuous scale using fdr value of h in both species it is conceivable that the pathways exhibit non trivial dynamics following activation_inactivation by the same stimulus during the response some genes might oscillate or transiently be under expressed following a spike in expression levels in fact dna_replication genes are normally tuned to the cell_cycle related pathways such as p are known to exhibit such oscillation if the phase or the period of these oscillations is different in rat and human a snapshot measurement can potentially exhibit anticorrelations this would explain why we find that anticorrelated pathways have the highest mi because they are the ones that are oscillating after being triggered by the stimulus to validate and further understand the role of such dynamics the microarray_analysis would need to be repeated for a number of time points following stimulation a time series of the gene_expression levels would then elucidate the differences between the dynamics of the response in the two species shedding more light on the underlying biology despite the low mi between the gene_sets of the two species we were able to make non trivial predictions of the response of nhbe cells based on measurements in nrbe cells which were verified experimentally the inference algorithm relied only on the state of the gene_sets we found that the individual ortholog genes did not exhibit significantly_higher mi it is plausible that biological modules and pathways are better conserved across the two species whereas expression levels of individual genes are not more measurements are needed to verify this claim predicting coarse_grained modules at various levels of hierarchy could be more biologically_relevant for species translation as opposed to predicting expression levels of individual genes or post_translational state of individual proteins we relied heavily on pca of the gene_sets to make the inference pca served two broad purposes first it allowed us to eliminate noise in the gene_set enrichment_scores more importantly it enabled us to naturally account for intra species correlations between gene_sets by linearly combining the gene_sets we could predict enrichment of gene_sets in human that had almost no correlation with their counterpart in the rat but were wellcorrelated with other human gene_sets we did not explicitly consider possible correlations in the response between different stimuli from their underlying biology as the inference was made with no knowledge of the test_stimuli inter_species inference of gene_expression is potentially more difficult than inter_species inference of protein_phosphorylation states and intra species prediction of gene_expression from protein activation nevertheless the methods described here could infer differential gene_set in human_epithelial lung cells from proteomic and transcriptomic_data on rat epithelial_cells with reasonable accuracy such a framework is potentially useful to translate measurements in rats to humans with therapeutic_applications in drug_development or for understanding basic biological_mechanisms
