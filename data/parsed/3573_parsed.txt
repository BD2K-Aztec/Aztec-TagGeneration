pingo a cytoscape_plugin to find candidate_genes in biological_networks pingo is a tool to screen biological_networks for candidate_genes i e genes predicted to be involved in a biological_process of interest the user can narrow the search to genes with particular known functions or exclude genes belonging to particular functional_classes pingo provides support for a wide_range of organisms and gene_ontology classification_schemes and it can easily be customized for other organisms and functional classifications pingo is implemented as a plugin for cytoscape a popular network_visualization platform availability pingo is distributed as an_open package under the gnu_general http www gnu org and can be downloaded via the cytoscape_plugin manager a detailed user guide and tutorial are available on the pingo websitea key problem for many molecular_biologists is the identification of candidate_genes to advance the study of a process or pathway of interest a variety of strategies have been developed over the years to identify such candidate_genes mostly based on the guilt by association principle two broad classes of methods can be distinguished network based_methods or direct methods and module based_methods in modulebased methods the data for instance gene_expression or interaction networks are clustered into modules which are functionally annotated using gene_ontology go or another functional categorization scheme the functional_annotation of a module is then transferred to its member genes some evidence however indicates that the module based_approach to predicting gene function may not be optimal for example established that simply taking the top correlated expression partners to predict the function of genes works better than traditional clustering_methods similarly found indications that network based_methods outperform module based_methods although a comprehensive comparison was not performed among the network based_methods simple first neighbor based_methods like the majority vote algorithm to whom correspondence should be addressed where the function of a gene is predicted to be the most frequently occurring function among the genes direct network neighbors often yield surprisingly good results compared with more sophisticated methods involving propagation of functional information through the network lossless propagation of functional_annotations through the network e g by considering the n neighborhood of a gene with n generally gives rise to decreased performance indicating that direct neighbors are the most relevant for predicting a genes function a range of network based function prediction_methods have been developed that employ more sophisticated machine_learning and references therein these outperform naive methods but are computationally_expensive and because of this most of them have not been implemented as gui based tools a couple of web_based tools for instance aranet endeavour and genemania allow users to prioritize_candidate using probabilistic integrated networks although very useful these tools are focused on one or a few organisms and with the exception of genemania do not allow users to upload their own datasets despite the importance of candidate gene_discovery for molecular_biology research only a limited number of flexible tools have been developed for this purpose here we present pingo a user_friendly that answers questions of the type are there genes of class a in the network that are significantly connected to known class b genes but have no known role in process c the main use for pingo is to screen networks for novel genes that could be involved in a particular process for instance if one would be interested in discovering novel transcriptional_regulators of conjugation in yeast the above sentence would read are there transcriptional_regulators in the network that are significantly connected to known conjugation genes but have no known role in conjugation see pingo is implemented as a plugin for cytoscape an open_source platform to visualize analyze and integrate molecular_networks pingo implements a simple but efficient algorithm to find candidate_genes in biological_networks pingos main strengths are its userfriendliness and flexibility
