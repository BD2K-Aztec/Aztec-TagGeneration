genetics_and xibd software for inferring pairwise identity by descent on the x chromosome xibd performs pairwise relatedness mapping on the x chromosome using dense single_nucleotide snp data from either snp_chips or next_generation data it correctly accounts for the difference in chromosomal numbers between males_and and estimates global relatedness as well as regions of the genome that are identical by descent ibd xibd also generates novel graphical summaries of all pairwise ibd_tracts for a cohort making it very useful for disease_locus mapping genomic_regions that have been inherited from a common_ancestor are said to be identical by descent ibd identification of ibd regions has proven useful in many applications including discovery and quantification of unknown or misspecified familial relatedness and disease mapping where a region inherited in multiple affected_individuals is indicative of a critical_region containing disease susceptibility_genes several methods have been proposed for inferring ibd however few allow for analysis of the x chromosome this is unfortunate as the x chromosome allows for inference of more distant relatedness than autosomes since fewer recombination_events occur resulting in ibd segments that are sustained over longer_periods of time current ibd analysis of the x chromosome is based on identity by state sharing which is non probabilistic and does not necessarily imply ibd here we present xibd the only hidden_markov hmm that infers ibd on the x chromosome in addition to the autosomes where ibd is detectable between individuals with a recent common_ancestor within generations rather than more distant relatedness many ibd methodologies rely on large cohorts to estimate allele_frequency data or to infer linkage_disequilibrium structure xibd can be applied to as few as two samples with the option to use hapmap allele_frequency data for populations furthermore it can be applied to either single_nucleotide snp chip or next_generation ngs_data exome or genome_wide
