structural_bioinformatics computing cavities channels pores and pockets in proteins from non spherical ligands models_motivation identifying protein cavities channels and pockets accessible to ligands is a major step to predict potential proteinligands complexes it is also essential for preparation of proteinligand docking experiments in the context of enzymatic_activity mechanism and structure_based results we introduce a new method implemented in a program named cccpp which computes the void parts of the proteins i e cavities channels and pockets the present approach is a variant of the alpha shapes method with the advantage of taking_into the size and the shape of the ligand we show that the widely used spherical model of ligands is most of the time inadequate and that cylindrical shapes are more realistic the analysis of the void parts of the protein is done via a network of channels depending on the ligand the performance of cccpp is tested with known substrates of cyto chromes p cyp a and a involved in xenobiotics metabolism the test results indicate that cccpp is able to find pathways to the buried heminic p active_site even for high_molecular cyp a substrates such as two ketoconazoles together an experimentally_observed situation availability free binaries are available through a software repository atprotein concavities play_an for biological_functions at the molecular level such as ligand_binding knowledge of proteinligand binding_sites and their access routes contributes to optimize virtual_screening of chemical libraries and then to propose new potential drugs the concavity containing the active_site may be located at various places in the protein when it is at the surface of the protein the concavity is called a pocket and it is called a cavity when the active_site is buried inside the protein in which case the route to the active_site is called a channel in any case defining the shape of the protein needs to locate the boundary between the protein and its void parts many algorithms were proposed in the literature to solve this non trivial problem in a recent review geometric algorithms were reported plus algorithms based either on genomic_information or on energy calculations these latter being devoted to proteinligand complexes energy calculation by docking seefor a review they are outside the scope of this article we report ina nonexhaustive list of geometric algorithms and their variants there are several ways to classify them the main criteria are i the computation is dependent or not on probes spheres assumed to represent ligands ii the computation is based either on a rectangular grid or on a delaunay triangulation or on none of them it has to be noticed that building the delaunay triangulation of n input vertices in the d space consists practically in partitioning the smallest convex polyhedron enclosing the n input vertices into non overlapping adjacent tetrahedra with endpoints edges at input vertices such that none interior of the spheres circumscribed to these tetrahedra contains any of the input vertices the dual structure of the delaunay triangulation is the voronoi diagram which roughly speaking is the union of the n polyhedral cells defined from the set of the planes mid perpendicular to the sides of these tetrahedra to each of the input vertices k k n is associated its polyhedral cell possibly unbounded which is the domain containing all points of the space closest to k than to any of the n other vertices this important property explains why voronoi tessellations were used to visualize the shape of proteins such as in voro d grid methods offer several drawbacks the orientation of the d grid is arbitrary and most of the time an increase of the precision by needs to increase the number of nodes by thus increasing computing times by it is the case when the measures of cavity volumes are estimated from the number of nodes or from the number of voxels i e the d analogs of pixels when the grid nodes are in a graph in which paths are seeked to identify channels the number of paths to be enumerated increases exponentially with the number of nodes to overcome this problem the user can define an arbitrary upper_bound to whom correspondence should be addressed of the shortest_paths but in this case the major part of the network of channels is lost at the opposite of a grid of virtual nodes the delaunay triangulation of the n atomic centers is more natural and efficient algorithms exist the main one being based on a d convex_hull it is why the seminal concept of alpha shape appears in most modern pockets and channels calculation algorithms as seen in this concept was first introduced in the plane by and then was generalized to higher dimensional spaces and proposed for molecular applications by edelsbrunner and muckemucke alpha shapes are a generalization of the convex_hull of the n points this latter being the smallest convex polyhedron enclosing the n points a spherical probe sphere of radius alpha erases from the polyhedral hull any point at distance less than alpha to the sphere center for all positions where the sphere does not enclose any of the n points the resulting object is called an alpha hull substituting straight edges for the circular ones and triangles for the spherical caps the final object is the alpha shape of the n points set when alpha tends to zero the alpha shape reduces to the n points when alpha is large enough the alpha shape is the convex polyhedral hull of the points for intermediate alpha values the alpha shape is not convex and can be used as a model of the protein shape the original variant of the alpha shape concept that we introduce is described in the next section we presented a new algorithm to compute cavities channels and pockets in proteins and we developed a software called cccpp which implements this algorithm and outputs the full network of cavities the void parts are bounded by the convex_hull of the atoms of the protein the structure of the network is stored in a text_file and is written in a molecular file to be displayed with any molecular viewer it was proved that cylindrical ligands shapes are much more realistic than spherical ligands shapes on the basis of this unusual cylindrical model cccpp was successful in explaining how large_molecules can be admitted in front of the buried heminic active_site of cyp s for these latter cccpp indicated that there is a complex network of channels rather than a small finite number of channels it also indicated that the final part of the network in front of the heme lies at its distal face which is in agreement with physico_chemical data we do not claim that our methodology is superior to the tenths of available other ones we just point out that our methodology gave rise to an alternative tool providing new information about pockets and channels in proteins it can be used in a virtual_screening context eventually in addition to energy based_methods
