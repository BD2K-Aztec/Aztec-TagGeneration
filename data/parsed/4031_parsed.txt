sequence_analysis rna pareto interactive analysis of pareto_optimal rna_sequence structure alignments incorporating secondary_structure information into the alignment process improves the quality of rna sequence_alignments instead of using fixed weighting parameters sequence and structure components can be treated as different objectives and optimized simultaneously the result is not a single but a pareto set of equally optimal solutions which all represent different possible weighting parameters we now provide the interactive graphical software_tool rna pareto which allows a direct inspection of all feasible results to the pairwise rna_sequence structure alignment problem and greatly_facilitates the exploration of the optimal_solution set availability_and the software is written in java graphical_user and c dynamic_programming the source_code for linux windows and mac os are freely_available atnoncoding rnas play_important in translation or gene_regulation many families of noncoding_rna show little sequence_similarity but a conserved secondary_structure furthermore the function of rna_molecules besides their sequence is mainly defined by their secondary_structure cf if the sequence_identity is too low standard sequence_alignment tools fail to produce reliable alignments consequently both sequence and secondary_structure need to be taken into account sankoffs algorithm solves this by a dynamic_programming which does not only compute a sequence_alignment but solves the consensus folding problem simultaneously the result is a sequence structure alignment that is optimal with respect to some fixed objective_function which is the weighted_sum of a sequence and a structure component this algorithm has triggered the development of many tools which try to improve the original performance by restricting the solution_space or by introducing heuristics the fixed weighting between sequence and structure objectives which has to be estimated or optimized in advance is one of the limitations of all of these approaches this problem is not new and approaches using paretooptimality are also found in other domains such as economics and classification in sequence_alignment e g constructs a set of pareto_optimal by using the number of gaps and mis matches as separate objectives describes an evolutionary algorithm and accompanying web_tool for pairwise rna sequence_alignment and uses a structure score derived from the alignment as a second objective for the approximation of a predefined number of pareto_optimal here we now calculate an exact set of pareto_optimal sequence structure alignments using distinct objectives for sequence and structure based on this method we present an interactive tool which allows the user to investigate and explore these pareto_optimal
