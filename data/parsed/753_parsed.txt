bioinformatics_discovery systems_biology bioinformatics driven discovery of rational combination for overcoming egfr_mutant cancer resistance to egfr therapy motivation nonsmall_cell nsclc is the leading cause of cancer death in the united_states targeted tyrosine_kinase inhibi tors tkis directed against the epidermal_growth egfr have been widely and successfully used in treating nsclc patients with activating egfr_mutations unfortunately the duration of response is short_lived and all patients eventually relapse by acquiring resistance_mechanisms result we performed an integrative systems_biology approach to determine essential kinases that drive egfr_tki resistance in cancer_cell we used a series of bioinformatics_methods to analyze and integrate the functional genetics screen and rna_seq to identify a set of kinases that are critical in survival and proliferation in these tki resistant lines by connecting the essential kinases to compounds using a novel kinase connectivity_map k map we identified and validated bosutinib as an effective compound that could inhibit proliferation and induce_apoptosis in tki resistant lines a rational combination of bosutinib and gefitinib showed additive and synergistic_effects in cancer_cell resistant to egfr_tki alone conclusions we have demonstrated a bioinformatics driven discovery roadmap for drug_repurposing and development in overcoming resistance in egfr_mutant which could be generalized to other cancer_types in the era of personalized_medicine availability_and k map can be accessible at http genomic medicine has dramatically_increased our knowledge of the molecular changes that underpin disease_states understanding alterations in gene_expression can identify proteins and signaling_pathways which might serve as therapeutic_targets moreover recent technologic_advances in nextgeneration_sequencing facilitate the rapid assessment of gene_expression changes in specific patients allowing for individualized treatment although personalized genomics heralds the age of precision_medicine the comprehensive datasets obtained through sequencing require sophisticated bioinformatics_tools to identify the critical genes that influence disease once these critical genes are identified the next challenge is to predict what drugs would be useful in reversing the disease_states the connectivity_map represents the first attempt to provide a computational framework to connect genes drugs and diseases based on gene_expression this method assumes gene_expression changes could be used as a universal language to connect distinct biological_states e g diseases allowing for the successful repurposing of compounds in short drugs known to be effective in one disease can serve as candidates for use in other diseases marked by similar gene_expression changes the power of this method has inspired other related work with the goal of improving the utility of the connectivity_map in drug_repurposing and development nonsmall_cell nsclc serves as an ideal disease for a connectivity_map based_approach nsclc accounts for of lung_cancers and is the leading_cause in the united_states and worldwide comprehensive characterization of cancer_genomes have increased our understanding of cancer_biology and moved nsclc beyond standard clinico_pathologic classifications and staging to include molecular characterization based on newly_identified oncogenic drivers such as the mutant epidermal_growth gene egfr although therapies directed against egfr such as gefitinib have revolutionized nsclc care the duration of response is short_lived and all patients eventually relapse through acquired resistance_mechanisms to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors identification of new targeted_therapeutics is a priority yet the ability to translate genomic_datasets into new drugs has been limited we devised an integrative systems_biology approach using a functional screen combined with rna_seq expression data to determine essential kinases other than egfr that drive proliferation and survival in egfr_mutant we performed an initial focused functional genetic_screen using short_hairpin shrnas that target the kinome kinases in the h lung_cancer cell_line this line harbors an egfr_mutation yet is intrinsically resistant to egfr_tkis we used bioinformatics for next_generation bings a novel bioinformatics pipeline to analyze and interpret functional genomic screening data by next_generation to identify essential kinases that drive the survival and proliferation signaling_pathways of this egfr mutant_line next we determined the differentially_expressed kinases in this cancer cell_line by next_generation rna_seq integrative_analysis was performed to identify kinases that were essential and dysregulated and the list of essential and functional kinases was connected to explore therapeutic_opportunities using the kinase connectivity_map k map the efficacy of the k map prediction of kinase_inhibitors was then validated in vitro essential kinases identified by the bings analysis to determine essential kinases other than egfr that drive the oncogenic signaling_pathways in nsclc we performed a functional kinome genetic_screen using h an nsclc line with an egfractivating mutation deletion exon yet for unknown reasons is relatively resistant to egfr_tkis from this kinome essentialscreen we identified candidate kinases calm cdk cdk ddr egfr epha gne ipmk mark pbk pkn rock rprd a and tbk as essential for survival of this cell_line see supplementaryand supplementary methods for details importantly egfr was identified from this functional genetic_screen as essential in h to determine_whether these kinases were mutated in this cell_line we queried the comprehensive curated catalogue of somatic_mutations in cancer cosmic database according to the cosmic database besides egfr no other known somatic_mutations have been reported in the other essential kinases in h differentially_expressed kinases identified by the rna_seq analysis to determine the differentially_expressed kinase genes in h we compared the expressed kinome of h defined by targeted rna_seq with four normal human atii cells the putative cell of origin for lung_adenocarcinomas a histologic_subtype of nsclc from the rna_seq we focused on the kinases that were the same kinases targeted in the functional genetic_screens we identified kinases overexpressed and underexpressed comparing the h data with the normal atii rna_seq fdr fold_change again egfr was the top overexpressed gene in the list supporting h s dependence on this oncogene the heat map of this analysis is illustrated in supplementaryand supplementary table s integrating a functional kinome genetic_screen and rna_seq analysis to refine the panel of identified key kinases driving the survival and proliferation of h cells we sought to integrate the candidate kinase genes identified from the essential kinome screen with differential kinase transcriptional_profiling two different yet complementary approaches transcriptional_profiling analysis_identifies kinases that are differentially_expressed compared with normal lung atii cells yet provides no insight on kinase function conversely the functional genetic_screen allows discovery of kinases required for cell_survival yet provides no information specific to transformation therefore integrating these two analyses will provide a list of functionally essential potentially transformative kinases in h by comparing the candidate gene_lists obtained from the two approaches seven kinases cdk egfr mark pbk tbk ddr and epha were found to be common to both lists connecting the essential potentially transformative kinases to therapeutics using the k map we next asked what compounds could inhibit these essential and possibly transformative kinases and serve as a potential therapy to inhibit proliferation of this cell_line we queried the k map using the seven essential and potentially transformative kinases to connect them to drugs based on two different kinase_activity assays ic and k d the top connection in both assays was staurosporine a natural_product isolated from the bacterium streptomyces staurosporeus staurosporine is a potent general atp_binding inhibitor across kinases lacking any specificity interestingly bosutinib a src and abl dual inhibitor was also positively connected and ranked and in the k d and ic assays respectively and supplementary as expected the two fda_approved egfr specific tkis for treating nsclc patients gefitinib and erlotinib were not connected by the k map as effective therapy for the queried essential kinases experimental_validation of the compounds identified by k map analysis to test whether compounds identified by the k map could provide better growth_inhibition of h cells compared with the current standard of care with egfr specific tkis we selected bosutinib as the candidate compound prediction of the k map and validated its effect on cell_survival in comparison we selected gefitinib a drug approved for use in egfrmutant nsclc which was not identified using our strategy and therefore we predicted would be less efficacious in h cells to further test our algorithm and k map we identified sorafenib connectivity scores of and in both kinase_assays as a compound which was predicted to be ineffective against the h cell_line to evaluate the sensitivity of bosutinib gefitinib and sorafenib h nsclc cells were exposed_to of these individual_drugs and assessed for proliferation as depicted in bosutinib had the lowest ic among the three tested compounds conversely gefitinib and sorafenib had higher ic_values ic mm indicating both drugs were less effective in inhibiting the growth of h cells as an additional negative control we validated ci a compound that has a connectivity score of minimal effect and ranked of drugs and was the least effective of the four drugs tested ic mm in h supplementary to estimate the statistical_significance of the connection we used the connection testing proposed by where the two tailed p value associated with the observed connection score is the number of times the connection score obtained by a random gene_signature with the same number ofgenes when queried to the database given a reference_database and a query signature s with m kinases here m the k map connectivity score is ks s and the two tailed p value is estimated as p prob jks r j jks s j where ks r is the connection score obtained from the random query signature with m kinases for this particular study we performed permutations and computed the p value of the bosutinib connection as p see supplementary methods for details as demonstrated by the experimental_validation this indicates that the connection is not a false_positive identified by the method generalizing the k map prediction to acquired egfr_tki resistance acquired_resistance to egfr_tkis after therapy is universal in lung_cancer patients limiting their usefulness as a treatment of nsclc drugs that can overcome this resistance would dramatically impact lung cancer_care to explore whether bosutinib can be extrapolated as an effective therapy for an acquired mutation conferring resistance to egfr_tkis we tested h a nsclc line that harbors egfr t m a gatekeeper mutation that is commonly acquired during treatment with egfr_tkis and renders standard egfr_tkis ineffective as illustrated in the ic value of bosutinib on h was mm as a negative control we also determined the ic value of gefitinib sorafenib and ci for this cell_line as and mm respectively and supplementary thus bosutinib is effective in inhibiting the proliferation of a nsclc line with an acquired egfr resistance mutation rational combination of bosutinib and gefitinib shows synergistic_effects in egfr_mutant cells we further hypothesized that the addition of bosutinib to gefitinib would be synergistic in egfr_mutant cells resistant to single_agent egfr_tki treatment indeed the combination of bosutinib and gefitinib demonstrated additive or synergistic_effects in both egfr_mutant lines and d combination_therapy was significantly_improved in h and h p welch two sample t test in inhibiting cell_proliferation when compared with individual drug alone and d based on the additivism models in h combination_therapy was synergistic hsa and bliss whereas in h was additive hsa and bliss see supplementary methods for details immunoblotting of h and h revealed an increase of cleaved_caspase casp an apoptotic marker in the bosutinib and combination treated cells as compared with gefitinib alone and vehicle as early as h after treatment comments and suggestions from the three reviewers that have helped to improve the
