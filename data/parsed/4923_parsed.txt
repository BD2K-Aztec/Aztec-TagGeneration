gene_expression whole_genome rvista a tool to determine enrichment of transcription_factor in gene_promoters from transcriptomic_data we have developed a web_based query tool whole_genome rvista wgrv that determines enrichment of transcription_factors tfs and associated target_genes in sets of co regulated_genes wgrv enables users to query databases containing pre_computed genome coordinates of evolutionarily_conserved transcription_factor in the proximal promoters from bp to kb_upstream of human mouse and drosophila genomes tf_binding are based on position_weight from the transfac professional database for a given set of co regulated_genes wgrv returns statistically enriched and evolutionarily_conserved binding_sites mapped by the regulatory vista rvista algorithm users can then retrieve a list of genes from the query set containing the enriched tf_binding and their location in the query set promoters results are exported in a bed format for rapid visualization in the ucsc_genome flat files of mapped conserved sites and their genomic_coordinates are also available for analysis with stand alone software methods for transcriptome_analysis e g microarray and rna_sequencing have revolutionized our ability to identify global changes in mrnas during cellular remodeling a continuing challenge for such analyses is identifying the key signaling_events that mediate the observed gene_expression changes transcription of mrna is a dynamic process controlled by many factors including chromatin_states cofactors rna_polymerase and the dynamic_regulation of transcription_factors tfs the gene_ontology consortium has classified human tf genes that encode for proteins with sequence_specific activity tfs by their very nature are key_regulators of the observed transcriptional changes during cellular remodeling tfs can be regulated post_transcriptionally e g by phosphosphorylation and or changes in intracellular location and thus may not be altered in expression alongside their target_genes the enrichment of tf_binding tfbs near target_genes however can be used as a surrogate for predicting altered tf_activity thus we developed whole_genome rvista wgrv a web_based for finding overrepresented evolutionarily_conserved tfbs within the proximal promoter_regions of a set_of searching proximal promoters for tfbs often results in many false_positives this is because the positional weight matrices that are used to computationally predict tfbs are often short in length and degenerate at specific positions the use of phylogenetic_footprinting to filter tfbs that are conserved in gene_promoters between two relatively closely_related has been shown_to false_positive sites chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high content sequencing chip_seq has emerged as the method of choice for determining bona_fide tfbs chip_seq studies however require a priori_knowledge of the tf for which binding_sites are to be determined moreover such studies require a validated antibody and can be costly_and wgrv queries are fast compared with chip_seq and the queries can be carried_out simultaneously for all tfbs stored in the database at no cost we believe wgrv is an excellent method to computationally identify potentially relevant tfs that drive tissue and cellular remodeling which can then be followed up with chip_seq for further validation
