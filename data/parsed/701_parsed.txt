data_and becas biomedical concept recognition services and visualization the continuous growth of the biomedical scientific_literature has been motivating the development of text_mining tools able to efficiently process all this information although numerous domain specific solutions are available there is no web_based concept recognition system that combines the ability to select multiple concept types to annotate to reference external databases and to automatically annotate nested and intercepted concepts becas the biomedical concept annotation system is an api for biomedical concept identification and a web_based that addresses these limitations medline_abstracts or free_text can be annotated directly in the web_interface where identified concepts are enriched with links to reference_databases using its customizable widget it can also be used to augment external web_pages with concept highlighting features furthermore all text processing and annotation_features are made available through an http rest api allowing integration in any text processing pipeline availability becas is freely_available use atexponential growth of the biomedical_literature during the past_decades has prompted the development of automatic techniques and systems to ease the task of finding relevant_information in unstructured documents however the offer of no installation no maintenance and online modular solutions for concept annotation that can be easily integrated in any text processing pipeline is still scarce whatizit for instance offers dictionary based annotation of documents with a large set of vocabularies and is available both through a web_service and a web_page yet annotation of concepts from different types is only possible by repeating the annotation_process several times and combining the results generated by different pipelines ihop is a web_application offering programmatic_access to pre annotated abstracts from medline it is a protein centric system and does not allow the annotation of external documents submitted by the user another solution focused on genes proteins and small_molecules is reflect a web_service that annotates these concepts on web_pages and provides through popups additional information such as synonyms database_identifiers and related literature cocoa is a multiple concept annotator with an online interface and an http api http npjoint com it annotates entities in user submitted text but it is limited to named_entities and does not provide concept identifiers or external references and for medline_abstracts which are automatically fetched from pubmed becas provides three distinct user_interfaces for biomedical concept identification presenting state of the art performance as evaluated on various corpora it currently recognizes and annotates million concepts and enriches them with million external references to online_resources the rest api is suitable for integration in custom text processing pipelines whereas the widget can be easily integrated in any web_page finally users can also use becas annotation services as a stand alone web_application in the future we plan to add support for more entity types and continue to improve annotation performance with focus on concept disambiguation
