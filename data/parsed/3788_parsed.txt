databases_and ptid an integrated web_resource and computational_tool for agrochemical discovery although in silico drug_discovery approaches are crucial for the development of pharmaceuticals their potential advantages in agrochemical industry have not been realized the challenge for computer_aided methods in agrochemical arena is a lack of sufficient information for both pesticides and their targets therefore it is important to establish such knowledge repertoire that contains comprehensive pesticides profiles which include physicochemical_properties environmental fates toxicities and mode of actions here we present an integrated platform called pesticide target interaction_database ptid which comprises a total of pesticides with rich annotation of ecotoxicological and toxicological_data as well as interactions of pesticide target and protein terms via text_mining additionally through the integration of chemmapper an in house computational_approach to polypharmacology ptid can be used as a computational platform to identify pesticides targets and design novel agrochemical products agrochemical products help us and our crops defend from the invasion of insects weeds and fungi unfortunately the resistance arising from the increasing selection_pressure as well as the cross_resistance of pesticides acting on the same target limits the continuing use of almost all pesticides on the other hand environmental_safety and toxicity are major factors to the failures in last stages of pesticides development in the face of ever increasing stringent demands of efficacy and environmental_safety the discovery of new agrochemicals is clearly imperative since the s in vivo and in vitro high_throughput screen has been routinely used in agrochemical discovery however both of these random screening methods require a large number of compounds and produce few hits in the past_decade rational methods such as structure_based were introduced into agrochemical industries and the combination of rational and non rational methods was realized to be more efficient than traditional high_throughput screen recently in silico approaches which are routine methods for developing new pharmaceuticals have entered the lead_discovery processes of agrochemical industry b these methods can discover new active_ingredients with ideal properties at lower cost in much quicker time additionally risk_assessment and toxicity prediction are also considered however both of rational in vitro and in silico approaches and analysis demand enormous information not only on the structure physicochemical_properties toxicity and mode of action of existed pesticides but also the structural data of the active_sites although these data are available via a diversity of sources including government departments manufacturers and universities the dispersed data source and a lack of search and analysis tools make accessing inconvenient moreover insufficient knowledge of targets and three_dimensional structures also impedes the applications of computer_aided methods consequently there is a severe need for a comprehensive database covering physicochemical_properties environmental fates and mode of action with integration of high_level search system and analysis tools for novel pesticide discovery and risk_assessments the purpose of pesticide target interaction_database ptid is to establish a web accessible database providing association information of pesticides and corresponding potential targets via text_mining the current version of ptid contains pesticides with annotation of toxicity and environmental fates more than potential target terms were derived by text_mining tool sequence_data were also annotated for each target term in addition to these data several computational_tools for target exploration and virtual screen were also integrated into ptid potential application of ptid includes identification of pesticides by structures or properties interest prediction of potential targets or assessment of toxicity and environmental effect to our knowledge ptid is the first attempt to establish a pesticide database which is integrated with the knowledge of proteinprotein_interactions it is expected that ptid will serve as a useful resource for the development of agrochemicals
