databases_and brisk research oriented storage kit for biology related data motivation in genetic science large_scale international_research collaborations represent a growing trend these collaborations have demanding and challenging database storage retrieval and communication needs these studies typically involve demographic and clinical data in addition to the results from numerous genomic studies omics studies such as gene_expression eqtl genome_wide association and methylation studies which present numerous challenges thus the need for data_integration platforms that can handle these complex data_structures inefficient methods of data transfer and access control still plague research collaboration as science becomes more and more collaborative in nature the need for a system that adequately manages data_sharing becomes paramount results biology related information_storage kit brisk is a package of several web_based data management_tools that provide a cohesive data_integration and management platform it was specifically_designed to provide the architecture necessary to promote collaboration and expedite data_sharing between scientists availability_and the software documentation java source_code and demo are available at http genapha icapture ubc ca brisk index jsp brisk was developed in java and tested on an apache tomcat server with a mysql_database in biomedical_studies statistical_power is important because some associations can be undetected if statistical_power is low a simple way to improve power is to increase the sample_size this drives scientists to collaborate and share their data several consortia have been created to facilitate collaborative scientific efforts on national and international scales large_scale collaborations generate substantial_amounts of data that is useful for analysis but can be difficult to manage delegating access and managing information for such large sets of data can be problematic if not appropriately handled labs can adequately manage large_amounts of data by using laboratory information management systems however delegating access to data can be a problem as some groups may want to limit access to unpublished_data studies of scientific_publications from the past_years have shown a continuous increase in collaboration between scientists to whom correspondence should be addressed new tools need to be developed to account for the increasingly collaborative nature of science we were driven to develop biology related information_storage kit brisk to facilitate collaboration and simplify data_sharing for investigators in the allergen the allergy genes and environment network consortium http www allergen nce ca and http genapha icapture ubc ca index do brisk is an opensourced software_package that provides the infrastructure necessary for efficient communication between collaborators regarding data and sample_storage data_formats and data_retrieval it has the ability to handle and organize large_datasets including data generated in longitudinal_studies brisk has been used by investigators to retrieve information from high_throughput genomewide_association gwas with hundreds of thousands of markers to smaller_scale illumina golden gate arrays with markers brisk was built taking_into the growing collaborative nature of science data management in collaborative_research involves working with restrictions and protocols that are not routinely found in research carried_out in a single laboratory researchers must consider how the data will be stored and distributed so anyone that needs to access the data can do so without difficulty on the other hand they must also restrict access to sensitive and undisclosed data data integrity is ensured through a multi tier login system each user account can only access data in their account tier by providing efficient data storage and features that cater to the needs of researchers brisk sets itself apart from other database management_tools there is a similar open sourced data management package called simbioms the feature_set offered by simbioms is oriented toward storage and retrieval related functions used in collaborative_studies many of these features are also present in brisk however in addition to these basic_features brisk contains tools that help researchers organize mine and analyze study data furthermore there are tools in brisk that allow researchers to test and explore additional data for further analysis these features enable brisk to act as a centralized hub where users can go to access information brisk is an advance from biowarehouse in that brisk unifies information from clinical_phenotypes laboratory slims biological_samples and gwas association results with electronic online database resources biowarehouse compiles information from a variety of electronic resources such as enzyme kegg and biocyc and integrates the information from these sources using a mulitdatabase approach biowarehouse does not incorporate analysis tools clinical or genotype_information biowharehouse retrieves and stores information locally the advantages of this approach are that users can select which version of a database they wish to interrogate and they are not limited in the types of databases that can be queried the disadvantage is that the data is stored locally and may not be up to date similar to biomediator and the bioconductor platforms that have been developed for the analysis of gene_expression arrays brisk uses a semantic architecture such that the data stays at the source ncbi resources this architecture has several advantages the data is stored managed and maintained at the source rather than locally this avoids data warehousing which helps to manage and maximize local_resources by cutting down on the storage space necessary for brisk it also ensures that at query time when the data is accessed the data is up to date and accurate we are able to do this because the ncbi resources can be queried via the internet although the number of queries per user per minute is limited genetics is a rapidly_evolving and changing discipline and information is being changed compiled and updated daily given these conditions dynamic access is preferred over data warehousing also similar to biomediator and bioconductor brisk is an open_source project we anticipate that ongoing_development will be collaborative brisk has been proven in heavy use and has been developed and maintained by a professional_development team to facilitate the ongoing_development of brisk we have published the project on google code see http code google com hosting each service has its own project site investigator services http code google com p brisk investigator services web information services http code google com p brisk web information services and brisk sample based laboratory_information http code google com p brisk slims this will allow brisk to further evolve to meet the needs of its users and developers world_wide limitations brisk currently manages and maintains genotype clinical and laboratory information it works well with gwas level data but we acknowledge that brisk does not address all the needs of omics studies we have not addressed gene_expression methylation or sequence level data concerns in this release as these utilities are currently in development data_integration platforms are an emerging endeavor and there is no one size fits all approach at this time this is likely because the development of these platforms has been driven by the research needs of the groups they serve brisk and genapha www genapha ca were developed to meet the needs of an emerging genetics_consortium whose needs were the management of laboratory samples clinical_phenotypes exposure and questionnaire data and genotypes from candidate_gene and gwas brisk has numerous utilities to address these needs however sequence level data will soon be the norm for genetic consortium studies and new data models will need to be developed that can handle the complexity and size of genome_wide sequence_data data import and exporting of genome_wide sequence_data within a mysql_database framework is unlikely to be feasible as it will be prohibitively time consuming data management needs are growing rapidly and the need for new tools that can organize and integrate data from diverse data_structures and sources are urgently_needed
