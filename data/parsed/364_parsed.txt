sequence_analysis an mcmc_algorithm for detecting short_adjacent shared by multiple_sequences motivation repeats detection problems are traditionally formulated as string matching or signal_processing problems they cannot readily handle gaps between repeat_units and are incapable of detecting repeat patterns shared by multiple_sequences this study detects short_adjacent with interunit insertions from multiple_sequences for biological_sequences such studies can shed light on molecular_structure biological_function and evolution results the task of detecting short_adjacent is formulated as a statistical_inference problem by using a probabilistic generative_model an markov_chain algorithm is proposed to infer the parameters in a de_novo fashion its applications on synthetic and real_biological show that the new method not only has a competitive edge over existing_methods but also can provide a way to study the structure and the evolution of repeat containing genes availability the related c source_code and datasets are available atin the past_decades the identification of repetitive patterns in biological_sequences especially approximate tandem_repeats in dna_sequences has attracted researchers from many fields yet it still remains as a challenging_problem a tandem_repeat in dna is a sequence segment containing two or more contiguous approximate copies of a pattern of nucleotides in this article we expand our views by relaxing the constraint of consecutiveness and allowing of short gaps i e interunit insertions between neighboring units because gaps have been frequently observed in natural repeats we name this type of repeats with short gaps as short_adjacent an example of short adjacent repeat would be at atgcg atccgt atccgcc atccctc where a gap composed of one background nucleotide t is inserted between the second repeat_unit and the third repeat_unit and another gap composed of two background nucleotides cc is inserted between the third repeat_unit and the fourth repeat_unit the consensus of its sequence pattern atccg has a width of bp and the copy_number to whom correspondence should be addressed of this repeat equals to the lower case highlights the variations from the consensus the detection of short_adjacent is of considerable significance taking tandem_repeats as an instance in recent decades more and more researches have suggested that tandem_repeats play_an in genetic_mapping gene_regulation and human_diseases almost all repeats detection methods formulated it as either a string matching problem or a signal_processing problem to avoid excessive running time most of the string matching algorithms are composed of two steps they first filter out obvious non repetitive_regions of the sequence using some statistical_properties or find out repetitive_regions using some heuristical methods and then search locally for a match between a pattern and a subsequence in those candidate repetitive_regions recently more and more signal_processing based_methods have been proposed signal_processing such as discrete_fourier short time periodicity transform exact periodic subspace decomposition and autoregressive modelling are used for spectral_analysis the above formulations often suffer from two constraints i as they largely rely on the periodicity of a short_segment they cannot readily handle gaps between repeat_units ii they could be used to detect tandem_repeats in one sequence only in other words they are blind to the enriched repetitive pattern shared by multiple_sequences where the polymorphic nature might contribute to specialization and generation of diversity in biological_functions this article attempts to tackle both issues specifically we not only generalize the repeat model by introducing gaps between neighboring repeat_units but also expand the scope of identifying short_adjacent to multiple_sequences this is especially helpful in the case where interunit insertions appear to be common and where the sequence pattern shared by multiple_sequences from some particular loci shed light on molecular_structure biological_function and evolution our full probabilistic_model for repeats detection was inspired by which used the sequence_motif model to detect the enriched dispersed pattern in multiple_sequences in the scenario of repeats detection the same pattern is also enriched in a local neighborhood within each sequence our model is built to make use of the two levels ofpage in this article we expand the views of tandem_repeats by introducing short_adjacent in order to handle gaps between neighboring repeat_units we design a baseg numeral vector data_structure also we expand the scope of identifying short_adjacent to multiple dna_sequences by relaxing the implicit assumption of a single dna_sequence in existing_methods this is helpful for analyzing the relationship among input_sequences e g dna_sequences of different species in the course of evolution to detect short_adjacent we introduce a full probabilistic generative_model to model repeats in multiple_sequences in this article we only considered the case where each sequence contains only one repeat segment if there are indeed more than one repeat segment in one sequence basard is likely to report the most probable one it is also possible that no repeat segment exists in some sequence in this case basard might report a repeat segment made up of only one repeat_unit and its starting position might vary randomly in order to help exclude this kind of false_positive basard also reports the significance_level of each estimated repeat_unit i e the p value of such repeat_unit under the background distribution if the p value is larger than a prespecified threshold it is recommended to deny the corresponding estimated repeat_units and conclude that the corresponding sequence actually does not contain the repeat pattern similar to the motif_discovery problem in our algorithm can be extended to allow multiple repeat segments per sequence by introducing an indicator vector for each sequence indicates that a repeat segment occurs from position l within the n th sequence otherwise n l we introduce a bayesian_approach to detect short_adjacent in a de_novo fashion to improve computing efficiency we use a collapsing technique to reduce the dimension of the parameter_space after the mcmc chain converges the sampled parameter_values give us a whole picture of their joint posterior_distribution in the end we demonstrate the effectiveness of basard through experiments on both synthetic data and real_data the bayesian_model and its metropolis in gibbs_sampling strategy for identifying short_adjacent in multiple_sequences can find many applications not only in areas of biology but also in other fields our work takes the initial step to enable this repeat identification across multiple_sequences and serves as a call for participation many interesting and important directions are worth exploring for example our work is limited by not allowing intraunit insertions_and we might refer to motif_discovery work byto deal with this kind of variations same as most existing purely likelihood based_methods the length bias page
