data_and literature mining of host_pathogen comparing feature_based supervised_learning and language based_approaches motivation in an infectious_disease the pathogens strategy to enter the host organism and breach its immune_defenses often involves interactions between the host and pathogen proteins currently the experimental_data on hostpathogen interactions hpis are scattered across multiple_databases which are often specialized to target a specific disease or host organism an accurate and efficient method for the automated extraction of hpis from biomedical_literature is crucial for creating a unified repository of hpi data results here we introduce and compare two new approaches to automatically detect whether the title or abstract of a pubmed publication contains hpi data and extract the information about organisms and proteins involved in the interaction the first approach is a feature_based supervised_learning method using support_vector svms the svm models are trained on the features derived from the individual sentences these features include names of the host pathogen organisms and corresponding proteins or genes keywords describing hpi specific information more general proteinprotein_interaction information experimental methods and other statistical_information the language based method employed a link grammar parser combined with semantic patterns derived from the training examples the approaches have been trained and tested on manually_curated hpi data when compared to a nave approach based on the existing proteinprotein_interaction literature mining method our approaches demonstrated higher accuracy and recall in the classification task the most accurate feature_based approach achieved_accuracy depending on the test protocol availability both approaches are available through philm web_server http korkinlab org philm htmlinfections are complex biological_processes that target host_organisms from virtually all kingdoms of life and involve a variety of microbial_pathogens such as viruses bacteria fungi protozoa multicellular parasites and even proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed the pathogens strategy to enter the host organism and breach the hosts immune_defenses often involves interactions between the host and pathogen proteins systematic determination and analysis of hostpathogen interactions hpis provides a challenging_task for both experimental and computational_approaches and is critically dependent on previously_obtained knowledge about these interactions for example several bioinformatics approaches apply the homology_information to predict new hpis characterize the interaction structures or find conservation patterns across hpi networks other approaches either manual or reliant on the existing databases collect the hpi molecular or genetic data into a centralized repository however a fully_automated system for extracting molecular hpi data directly from the biomedical_literature is yet to be built rapid_growth of published biomedical_research has resulted in the development of a number of methods for biomedical_literature mining during the last decade the methods dealing with the biomolecular information are generally divided_into three categories based on the domain of biomedical knowledge they target i automated protein or gene identification in a text ii literaturebased functional_annotation of genes and proteins and iii extracting the information on the relationships between biological_molecules such as proteins and rnas or genes the relationships detected by the methods from the third category range from a co occurrence of the genes and proteins in a text to detecting the proteinprotein_interactions ppis and identification of signal_transduction networks and metabolic_pathways related to the problem of mining hpis the problem of extracting general ppis from the text has received an increasing amount of attention from the community a number of approaches have been recently_proposed to extract ppis from text a basic approach determines an occurrence of a ppi by detecting the co occurrence of names of the interacting_proteins or genes in the same sentence a more advanced approach relies on pattern matching to capture the semantic structure from the text phrasesin this work the problem of mining interactions_occurring between proteins genes of a pathogen organism and its host from the abstracts of biomedical publications was addressed to do so two new approaches were introduced a feature based_approach which relied on svm methodology and a language based_approach which employed the link grammar three basic hpi mining tasks were defined for each task the approaches were evaluated and compared with each other the performance of the two approaches was also compared with a nave approach utilizing a publicly_available state of the art method for mining ppis the evaluation demonstrated that both approaches could mine the hpi information more accurately than the nave
