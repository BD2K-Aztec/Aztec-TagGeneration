databases_and lipidgo database for lipid related go terms and applications motivation lipid an essential class of biomolecules is receiving increasing attention in the research_community especially with the development of analytical_technique like mass_spectrometry gene_ontology go is the de facto standard function_annotation scheme for gene_products identification of both explicit and implicit lipid related go terms will help lipid research in many ways e g assigning lipid function in protein_function results we have constructed a web_site lipidgo that facilitates browsing and searching lipid related go terms an expandable hierarchical go tree is constructed that allows users to find lipid related go terms easily to support large_scale analysis a user is able to upload a list of gene_products or a list of go terms to find out which of them is lipid related finally we demonstrate the usefulness of lipidgo by two applications i identifying lipid related gene_products in model_organisms and ii discovering potential novel lipid related molecular_functions availability_and lipidgo is available atlipid and their metabolites are essential in many processes in biology like energy_homeostasis signaling neurobiology infectious_diseases and so forth the development of analytical_technique like mass_spectrometry gives rise to the field of lipidomics an important goal in lipidomics research is to identify genes and proteins involved in lipid_synthesis metabolism and other relevant processes as with other subfield of biology lipid researchers are primarily interested in elucidating functions of gene_products the gene_ontology go is the most widely used control vocabulary in functional_annotation of genes products and it is being widely used by wet_lab researchers and bioinformaticians alike thus the identification of lipid related go terms can facilitate lipid research either directly or with other bioinformatics tool involving go terms for example lipid related go terms were used to identify novel lipid associated complexes involved in cancer_progression go consists of three independent subontologies biological_process bp cellular_component cc and molecular_function mf go is a directed_acyclic with multiple inheritance property in go there are several relationship types however in the lipidgo project where the focus is on the lipid relatedness property only is a relationship is considered more on term relationship is elaborated in the appendix and in the documentation section of our web_site the lipid related go terms in lipidgo are discovered by curation and computational_approach detailed procedures and issues are given in section all the lipid related go terms found are subject to stringent predefined curation rules the rules can be found in the documentation at our web_site or appendix in our web_site the following notations are used to describe class_labels of go terms bp for lipid related bp terms bp for nonlipid related bp terms and bp for bp terms whose lipid relatedness has not been examined by a curator similar notations are defined for cc terms cc cc cc and mf terms mf mf mf we will talk about the unknown class_labels in section
