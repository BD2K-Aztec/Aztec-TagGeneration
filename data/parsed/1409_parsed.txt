discovering transcriptional modules by bayesian data_integration motivation we present a method for directly inferring transcriptional modules tms by integrating gene_expression and transcription_factor binding chip_chip data our model extends a hierarchical_dirichlet mixture_model to allow data fusion on a gene by gene basis this encodes the intuition that co expression and co regulation are not necessarily equivalent and hence we do not expect all genes to group similarly in both datasets in particular it allows us to identify the subset of genes that share the same structure of transcriptional modules in both datasets results we find that by working on a gene by gene basis our model is able to extract clusters with greater functional coherence than existing_methods by combining gene_expression and transcription_factor binding chip_chip data in this way we are better able to determine the groups of genes that are most likely to represent underlying tms approaches to the elucidation of gene_regulatory have often relied on the use of clustering methodologies grouping genes on the basis of expression_patterns over time treatments and or tissues the genes in a given cluster are usually assumed to be potentially functionally_related or to be influenced by common upstream factors for example found that in the yeast_saccharomyces genes that clustered together did indeed often share similar biological_function and a large number of subsequent authors have found the same sometimes even being able to verify the results experimentally e g application of these approaches to gene_expression data have led to the recognition that gene_regulation is often performed by regulatory programmes or transcriptional modules tms sets of co regulated_genes that share a common biological_function and are regulated by a common set of transcription_factors devised a method for identifying tms by assigning genes to clusters in a context dependent_manner a gene could be assigned to several clusters resulting in overlapping tms a feature which is biologically_meaningful since a gene could be involved in multiple_biological clustering on the basis of expression data alone however only indicates co expression and does not directly identify co regulation to whom correspondence should be addressed the expression_patterns of genes in the same cluster may be correlated for reasons other than co regulationthe effects of experimental measurement_error may be important for example due to the complexity of gene_regulatory as well as the limitations of any given source of noisy experimental_data it is advantageous to make tm inferences using multiple sources of data in addition to gene_expression data a range of other data types have been used to enhance the reconstruction of gene_networks these include information about transcription_factor binding derived from experimental_techniques such as chip_chip sequence_data and even information derived from relevant scientific_literature bothhave described methods to integrate expression and sequence_data within the framework of a probabilistic_graphical using the method of expectation_maximization a statistical technique for maximum_likelihood of model_parameters from incomplete_data applied a variant of this approach to infer regulatory_modules in s cerevisiae together with their component regulators under the assumption that the regulators themselves are transcriptionally_regulated at least under a subset of conditions described a method to integrate chip_chip and expression data based on an exhaustive iterative search over possible combinations of regulators which identifies a subset of gene_targets with highly_correlated expression_patterns dirichlet_process mixture_models are a class of bayesian non parametric_models that has been widely used for clustering dpms have the interesting property that the prior probability of a new data point joining a cluster is proportional to the number of points already in that cluster thus encoding a natural clustering tendency clustering strength is controlled via a hyperparameter which sets the expected number of clusters as a function of the number of clustered items by inferring we can therefore determine the posterior_distribution of the number of clusters hierarchical_dirichlet models hdpms as defined byare the hierarchical extension of dpms they consist of a dpm for each of a number of different contexts with the mixture components for each context being drawn from a master list of mixtures from the next level of the hierarchy a wider_range of hdpms are reviewed in teh and jordan use a type of hdpm to identify tms from transcription_factor sequence_data use hdpms to model gene_expression programs in a variety of tissues effective combination of different datasets can be an effective way to identify tms introduced a hdpm that assigns a dpm to each of a pair of datasets e g gene expressionthe results of each data_integration analysis are rich and detailed in this section we consider a number of metrics and highlight significant aspects of the results for each dataset for comparison we also run clustering analyses using the bhc algorithm to analyse the gene_expression data alone this gives us a baseline result with which to compare the data_integration results it is important to assess the convergence of any mcmc analysis all analyses on the galactose dataset comprise mcmc chains each of samples after removal of burn in samples all analyses on the cell_cycle data_set comprise mcmc chains each of samples after removal of burn in samples to speed up our subsequent analyses we sparse sample each chain by a factor of we include as supplementary_material plots of d hyperparameter posterior pdfs both overall and for each mcmc chain these demonstrate that the mcmc analyses are converging adequately we also perform geweke convergence tests on the hyperparameters of each chain and for the w case for the galactose dataset we find of tests chains hyperparameters have a z_score with a maximum outlier of for the cell_cycle dataset we find of tests have a z_score with a maximum outlier of we conclude that our chains are reasonably well although not perfectly mixed although in both cases it is important that we combine multiple chains the algorithm is implemented in matlab and run on ghz cluster nodes in parallel one per mcmc chain on the galactose utilization dataset genes the code produces samples per chain per hour on the cell_cycle dataset genes the code produces samples per chain per hour on a larger sample of genes from the stress data of the code produces samples per chain per hour this scaling suggests that for large genome_scale datasets it may be of value to investigate for example fast variational methods as an alternative to mcmc both gene_expression and chip_chip data contain information about the biological_functions of different genes but it is non trivial to combine them in a sensible way both due to their noisy nature and also because co expression and co regulation may not necessarily be equivalent for all genes our results show that by treating data fusion on a geneby gene basis the model we present here is able to produce superior extraction of functionally coherent groups of genes from a combination of gene_expression and chip_chip data our model also has special cases given by w and w that produce data_integration results that outperform the single dataset analyses including a fast bhc clustering using expression data only however the model we present is both more flexible and outperforms these special cases in both the examples we have considered in this article the key innovation in our model is that the data_integration is treated on a gene by gene basis this allows crucial flexibility because we can distinguish between genes that are likely to be fused and those that are not we can extract genes that are closely_related on the basis of both datasets while rejecting those that are not it is these genes that are most likely to represent the underlying tms
