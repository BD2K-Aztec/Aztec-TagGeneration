predicting synergistic_effects between com pounds through their structural_similarity and effects on transcriptomes motivation combinatorial therapies have been under intensive_research for cancer treatment however due to the large number of possible combinations among candidate compounds exhaustive screening is prohibitive hence it is important to develop computational_tools that can predict compound combination effects prioritize combinations and limit the search_space to facilitate and accelerate the development of combinatorial therapies results in this manuscript we consider the nci dream drug synergy prediction challenge dataset to identify features informative about combination effects through systematic exploration of differential expression_profiles after single_compound treatments and comparison of molecular_structures of compounds we found that synergistic levels of combinations are statistically_significantly associated with compounds dissimilarity in structure and similarity in induced gene_expression changes these two types of features offer complementary information in predicting experimentally_measured combination effects of compound pairs our findings offer insights on the mechanisms_underlying different combination effects and may help prioritize promising combinations in the very large search_space availability the r code for the analysis is available on https github com yiyiliu drugcombination designing_effective therapies for cancer treatment is an important yet challenging_task although monotherapies are commonly used to treat_cancer they suffer from many problems such as acquired_resistance and poor safety combinatorial therapies by utilizing compounds impacting multiple_biological simultaneously have great potentials to overcome these problems and are attracting growing interest in drug_development indeed there are many effective combinations used in practice for example the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine can achieve_improved efficacy in breast_cancer treatment in this study we focus on two way combinations because most studies and available data to date are on two way combinations and yet all existing_methods are still limited in their performance in predicting the effectiveness of two way combinations generally when two compounds act together their combination effect can be categorized into three main types additive if the effect of combination is equivalent to the sum of the effects of two compounds acting individually synergistic if the combination effect is greater than additive and antagonistic if the combination effect is less than additive typically compound combination effects are inferred through cell_culture where cell viabilities under treatment with compounds in combination and treatment with compounds individually are measured and compared however since the number of possible combinations grows rapidly with the number of compounds under consideration exhaustive experimental screening of all these combinations is prohibitively costly therefore it is very useful to develop computational_methods that can prioritize different combinations in order to associate editor dr jonathan wren reduce_the for screening experiments there are inspiring attempts made towards this goal however while it is known combination effects can be cell_line specific most existing computational_methods were trained using only the specific types of combination effects synergistic additive antagonistic collected from literature_review or databases without considering the cell_lines they were tested on or other experimental contexts besides many of these methods rely heavily on prior_knowledge of drug_combination mechanisms which is far from complete and accurate in this paper we aim to identify features informative on combination effects of compound pairs using the dataset from the nci dream drug synergy prediction challenge this dream_challenge measured gene_expression of ocl ly diffuse large bcell lymphoma cells pre_and single_compound treatments and experimentally_evaluated the combination effects of pairwise combinations of these compounds in the original challenge participants proposed different methods to predict combination effects using gene_expression but no unanimous conclusion could be drawn on the relation between synergistic_effects and transcriptome changes induced by single compounds although a few participants considered compound chemical molecular_features such as structure the relevance of these features to combination effects was not demonstrated in this paper we adopt the structural_similarity of compounds defined in and consider four similarity_measures for gene_expression changes resulting from single_compound treatments we systematically explore whether the structural_similarity and expression similarity is associated with combination effects using pc index and resampled spearman_correlation because we are interested in prioritizing compound pairs likely having synergistic_effects we also evaluate the area under the receiver operation characteristic curve auc for synergistic combination prediction using structural_similarity and expression similarity individually and jointly for the nci dream_challenge data_set we find that synergistic_effect prediction using gene_expression similarity defined with one of the four measures outperforms the best method reported in the original challenge and that prediction using structural_similarity also outperforms most of the methods proposed for the original challenge moreover combining gene_expression and structure information together further improves predictive_power for synergistic_effects our findings in this paper may lead to better computational_methods to prioritize compound combinations and facilitate future drug_development we evaluated the structural_similarity of the compounds and also compared their effects on the transcriptome of the ocl ly cell_line following the performance evaluation methods of the original dream_challenge we used pc index and resampled spearman_correlation to measure the associations between these similarity_scores and the synergistic levels additionally we evaluated these scores ability to predict synergistic combinations using auc from cross_validation
