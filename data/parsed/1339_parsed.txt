genome_analysis detect a density estimation tool for enzyme classification and its application to plasmodium_falciparum motivation a major_challenge in genomics is the accurate annotation of component genes enzymes are typically predicted using homology_based search_methods where the membership of a protein to an enzyme_family is based on single sequence_comparisons as such these methods are often error_prone and lack useful measures of reliability for the prediction results here we present detect a probabilistic_method for enzyme prediction that accounts for the sequence_diversity across enzyme families by comparing the global_alignment scores of an unknown protein to those of all known enzymes an integrated likelihood_score can be readily calculated ranking the reaction classes relevant for that protein comparisons to blast reveal significant improvements in enzyme annotation accuracy applied to plasmodium_falciparum we identify potential annotation errors and predict novel enzymes of therapeutic interest availability a standalone application is available from the website http www compsysbio org projects detect contact comprising the entire network of chemical_reactions carried_out by a living_cell metabolism represents sets of enzymes and pathways that drive the synthesis and degradation of the essential molecules of life the reconstruction of these networks through genome analyses are beginning to reveal a considerable diversity in metabolic complements reflecting fundamental biological and ecological adaptations as such there is increasing interest in the accurate reconstruction of metabolic_networks for purposes of metabolic_engineering and drug_discovery prior to the advent of genomic_sequencing metabolic_network construction involved painstaking studies focused on individual enzymes derived from an organism of interest as a result only a small number of reconstructions were possible to whom correspondence should be addressed but are very well developed and serve as models for the reconstruction_process in other organisms the challenge is now to apply this knowledge to help annotate the increasing numbers of genomes that are currently being sequenced the process has been aided by the development of the enzyme commission ec hierarchy in which sequences are mapped to distinct enzymatic functions due to the large_number encoded by a genome the annotation_process is reliant on the use of automated methods based on sequence_similarity or profile discovery commonly used tools such as blast are useful when looking for homologues based on overall sequence_similarity while more sensitive profile based_methods e g pfam prosite focus on the conservation of domains sequence_patterns and even single residues although widely_applied in databases such as kegg and biocyc sequence_based suffer from limitations when dealing with enzymatic proteins in particular homology transfer methods typically ignore the range of sequence_variation characterizing individual enzyme classes while certain enzymes are relatively easy to classify based on sequence_conservation there are numerous examples of enzymes that share high_sequence and catalyze different reactions furthermore the use of only a single protein match to assign function usually the highest scoring homolog greatly impacts the reliability of the assignment in the absence of some measure of reliability genes may be indiscriminately annotated with incorrect ec numbers that can lead to non biologically_relevant interpretations consequently there is a need to associate enzyme annotations with an appropriate confidence_score which is lacking even in recently_developed functional_classification tools in an attempt to circumvent these issues enzyme databases such as kegg and biocyc devote considerable effort to manual_curation to improve on the quality of annotations however critical comparisons of these databases reveal numerous discrepancies highlighting the importance of developing consistent methods and standards for assigning reliable gene_annotations here we describe a new probabilistic_method for enzyme prediction based on both global and local sequence_alignment which we term density estimation tool for enzyme classification detect detect uses a bayesian_framework that integrates_information from density estimation profiles generated for each ec_number instead of relying on similarity to a single_sequence page
