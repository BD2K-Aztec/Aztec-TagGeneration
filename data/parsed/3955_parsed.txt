genetics_and regsnps a strategy for prioritizing regulatory single nucleotide_substitutions motivation one of the fundamental_questions in genetics study is to identify functional dna_variants that are responsible to a disease or phenotype of interest results from large_scale genetics studies such as genome_wide gwas and the availability of high_throughput technologies_provide opportunities in identifying causal_variants despite the technical_advances informatics methodologies need to be developed to prioritize thousands of variants for potential causative effects results we present regsnps an informatics strategy that integrates several established bioinformatics_tools for prioritizing regulatory snps i e the snps in the promoter_regions that potentially_affect phenotype through changing transcription of downstream_genes comparing to existing_tools regsnps has two distinct_features it considers degenerative features of binding_motifs by calculating the differences on the binding_affinity caused by the candidate variants and integrates potential phenotypic_effects of various transcription_factors when tested by using the disease_causing documented in the human gene_mutation database regsnps showed mixed performance on various diseases regsnps predicted three snps that can potentially_affect bone_density in a region detected in an earlier linkage study potential effects of one of the variants were validated using luciferase_reporter a key goal in human_genetics is to identify the functional dna_variants that give rise to phenotypic_differences among individuals recent_studies of complex_diseases and phenotypes have tended to focus on genome_wide gwas employing hundreds of thousands of single_nucleotide snps gwas target common dna_variants which could either directly contribute to the clinical phenotype or provide an indirect proxy for functional_variants which are in linkage_disequilibrium ld with the snp being tested distinguishing between direct mechanistic contributions emanating from the functional_variants themselves and indirect associations resulting from ld is challenging and improved methods are needed one feasible_solution is to catalog all dna_variants in the ld region of the association both common and rare by utilizing next_generation ngs_technology the large number of variants that will be identified generates an urgent need for bioinformatics and computational_approaches capable of prioritizing the variants most likely to underlie the observed association for further biological testing nonsynonymous substitutions within coding_regions directly affect protein_structure and are likely to affect protein_function a variety of algorithms including polyphen sift toposnp pmut ls snp snpeffect v snps d and polydoms were designed to identify functional nonsynonymous substitutions synonymous coding variants may also exert phenotypic effect by influencing the conformation splicing and stability of pre mrnas or by altering the expression_level of a given protein coding_sequences make up of the human_genome the regulatory_component of the human_genome is much less well defined but based upon conservation is to times larger than the coding_region regulatory variants can affect the transcription_initiation rate microrna binding and protein expression but are far more difficult to identify it should therefore come as no surprise that many of the variants associated with common complex disease by gwas do not alter coding_sequences but rather occur within the non coding_regions of genes or intergenic_regions tools such as fastsnp pupasuite and snplogic have been designed to identify snps residing in known transcription_factor
