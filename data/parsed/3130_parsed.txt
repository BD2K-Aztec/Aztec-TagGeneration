genetics_and mtg an efficient algorithm for multivariate linear_mixed analysis based on genomic_information we have developed an algorithm for genetic_analysis of complex_traits using genome_wide snps in a linear_mixed framework compared to current standard reml software based on the mixed model equation our method is substantially faster the advantage is largest when there is only a single genetic covariance_structure the method is particularly useful for multivariate_analysis including multi trait models and random regression_models for studying reaction norms we applied our proposed method to publicly_available mice and human data and discuss the advantages and limitations availability_and mtg is available in https sites google com site honglee previously methods were developed to estimate genetic_variance and genetic_correlations between complex_traits explained by genome_wide snps using linear_mixed as genetic_relatedness among conventionally unrelated subjects could be estimated based on genomic_information which replaces family studies with population studies the model allows estimation of the genetic effects to be much less confounded with family environmental effects for this same reason the approach has also been proposed as a more powerful_tool to detect genotype environment interaction g e that is in the presence of g e the genetic_correlation between genetic effects in different environments is significantly_lower than one in order to capture g e across a trajectory of multiple environments random regression_models have been proposed for evolutionary and livestock genetics the random regression_model is also known as the reaction norm model in estimating genetic_variance explained by genetic_markers lee and van_der werf introduced an efficient average information ai algorithm to obtain residual maximum_likelihood reml estimates as opposed to using hendersons mixed model equation mme the algorithm was based on using the variance_covariance of phenotypic observations directly hence the term direct ai algorithm the algorithm is particularly advantageous when using a dense covariance_matrix such as the genomic relationship matrix grm and with a large number of multiple variance components the direct ai algorithm has been implemented in gcta greml and multiblup that have been widely used in human evolutionary and livestock genetics here we combine the direct ai algorithm with an eigen decomposition of the grm as first proposed by we apply the procedure to analysis of real_data with univariate multivariate and random regression linear_mixed with a single genetic covariance_structure and demonstrate that the computational v c the author published_by when using the heterogeneous mice data n for the multivariate linear_mixed with up to five traits mtg only took afor mtg and gemma it took s for the eigen decomposition which is only required to be done once per dataset then can then be reused for multiple analyses a gemma does not have a function for the random regression_model there are two main limitations to mtg as well as gemma the eigen decomposition technique cannot be used with more than one grm as also noted by zhou and stephens unless a special condition is satisfied i e one full rank grm and multiple low_rank grms are provided in models with multiple grms gemma cannot be used and mtg becomes slow although it is still considerably faster than asreml and wombat supplementary second the eigen decomposition technique_requires a balanced design i e no missing phenotypes across traits phenotypic imputation can be used for missing phenotypic values in this work we used imputed missing phenotypes for the mice data missing for each trait although mtg without the eigen decompostion could still be used for the data including the missing_values we observed that the results from the data with and without the imputed missing phenotypes were not very different supplementary table s and for the human data missing phenotypes were less than therefore the results with and without the imputed missing phenotypes were almost identical results not shown finally both mtg and wombat are able to facilitate a parallel computation that further raises efficiency
