genome_analysis scaffolding low quality genomes using orthologous protein_sequences motivation the ready_availability of next_generation has led to a situation where it is easy to produce very fragmentary genome_assemblies we present a pipeline swips scaffolding with protein_sequences that uses orthologous_proteins to improve low quality genome_assemblies the protein_sequences are used as guides to scaffold existing contigs while simultaneously allowing the gene structure to be predicted by homology results to perform swips does not depend on a high n or whole proteins being encoded on a single contig we tested our algorithm on simulated next generation data from ciona_intestinalis real next generation data from drosophila_melanogaster a complex genome_assembly of homo_sapiens and the low coverage sanger sequence_assembly of callorhinchus milii the improvements in n are of the order of for the c intestinalis and h sapiens assemblies which is significant considering the large size of intergenic_regions in these eukaryotes using the cegma pipeline to assess the gene space represented in the genome_assemblies the number of genes retrieved increased by for c milii and from to for c intestinalis the scaffold error_rates are low of scaffolds are fully correct and of local contig joins are correct availability swips is available freely for download atnew sequencing_technologies have lowered the cost of generating genomic dna_sequence to the point where high coverage of a moderately sized animal genome e g gb can be obtained for a few thousand euros currently short_read i e bp present_challenges for assembling sequence into a complete genome usually owing to an inability of short_reads to bridge repetitive sequence this problem can be circumvented by using paired_end or mate paired_reads with different insert_sizes long enough to span repetitive_regions for instance the genome of the giant panda and more recently the one of the naked_mole have been sequenced using short_read sequencing_technology alone and achieved high_quality both projects used multiple libraries the latter used paired_end libraries with different insert_sizes spanning bp to kbp this strategy has the disadvantage of incurring significant extra cost and large insert_size libraries require larger amounts of dna that may not be readily available for some taxa apart from mainstream de_novo assemblers several groups have worked on incorporating available related assembled_genomes into the assembly process for instance it is standard procedure e g the orangutan genome_project to use whole_genome alignments to build super scaffolds by aligning the new assembly to the high_quality genome of closely_related many species however are sequenced precisely because they are not closely_related to species for which a complete genome is available thus other approaches have been adopted to increase assembly contiguity in for example researchers exploited the eukaryote exonintron gene structure and used rna_seq to scaffold contigs from a caenorhabditis nematode genome increasing the initial n from to kb this strategy obviously requires the generation of rna_seq in addition to genomic_sequence and genes that are not expressed in the rna_seq library will not be available for scaffolding as protein_sequences are generally well conserved across distant taxa compared with non coding or dna_sequences a possible way to deal with fragmented initial assemblies is to use orthologous_proteins to guide the scaffolding of contigs that encode fragments of the same proteins surget groba and montoya burgos used orthologous_proteins to guide transcriptome_assembly by mapping contigs onto a related protein set and improved the n of their zebrafish transcriptome_assembly by up to surget the presence of introns large intergenic_regions and the much larger_volume of data involved in genome_assemblies however make this a fundamentally more difficult problem salzberg et_al introduced a gene boosting algorithm that used amino_acid from predicted proteins to improve the scaffolding of a mb bacterial_genome although again as bacterial_proteins lack introns this is a somewhat easier problem to approach here we present an algorithm that uses proteome sets from different species to guide scaffolding of genome_assemblies of various qualities including highly fragmented ones e g n kb in this article we use the term scaffolding to refer to the process of ordering and orienting contigs although we recognize that we do not estimate distances between contigs we call this swips scaffolding with protein_sequences existing algorithms and strategies including the ensembl genebuild process for low coverage assemblies and

a gene may be spread over multiple contigs swips uses orthologous_proteins possibly from distantly_related as guides to link exons of the same protein that may be situated on different contigs to our knowledge only one other published method esprit does this esprit was used to bridge callorhinchus milii contigs from a sanger based assembly together and reported precision of esprit however assumes a uniform evolutionary_rate over the entire length of split proteins something that is clearly questionable in the general_case we present a novel score optimization framework for scaffolding contigs and a strategy to optimize this score to improve the contiguity of novel assemblies reduce their fragmentation as well as predict the content of their exomes we tested swips on a set of genomic assemblies of simulated ciona_intestinalis next_generation data real sequencing_data from drosophila_melanogaster as well as the sanger sequenced but low coverage assembly of c milii and a pre assembled genome of homo_sapiens we have shown that our method is able to use protein_sequences to order and orient contigs into scaffolds thus improving assembly contiguity and gene prediction showing significant improvements over the only other available tool although the overall improvements in n found by swips may appear modest they should be understood with reference to the fact that the majority of most animal_genomes is composed of non coding_sequence and thus not amenable to scaffolding via protein_coding to confidently scaffold exon containing regions on different contigs we need to be sure that they come from the same gene in the context of this problem the most obvious way of doing this is by assuming that our guide protein comes from a gene that shares a or many orthologous relationship with the gene encoded by the exons we thus need to test that each exonicsince human genes are known to possess longer introns than general eukaryotic_genes we allowed kb instead of kb to assess the accuracy of swips on the human assembly example of five contigs scaffolded using swips protein sacc links contigs scaffold c and scaffold together whereas spur links contigs scaffold c and scaffold together the two protein models allow swips to scaffold all contigs together each arrow represents a region of homology dark grey the intronexon structure light grey and dark grey of the orthologous_proteins is clearly represented within each scaffold y i li and r r copley
