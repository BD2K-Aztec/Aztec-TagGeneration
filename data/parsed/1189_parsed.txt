genome_analysis coverage tradeoffs and power estimation in the design of whole_genome sequencing_experiments for detecting association motivation whole_genome wgs allows direct interrogation of previously_undetected uncommon or rare_variants which potentially contribute to the missing_heritability of human disease however cost of sequencing large_numbers of samples limits its application in casecontrol association studies here we describe theoretical and empirical design considerations for such sequencing studies aimed at maximizing the power of detecting association under the constraint of study wide cost results we consider two cost regimes first assuming cost is proportional to the total amount of base_pairs to be sequenced across all samples which is a practical model for whole_genome we explored the tradeoff in terms of study power between increasing the number of subjects and increasing_depth coverage we demonstrate that the optimal power of detecting association is achieved at medium depth coverage under a wide_range of realistic conditions for case only sequencing designs second if cost is fixed per sample which is approximately the case in exome_sequencing we show that in a simple case control sequencing study the optimal_design should include cases totaling e of all subjects availability a web_tool implementing the methods is available atgenome wide association studies gwas have greatly_improved our understanding of the genetics of human_diseases however for the majority of common diseases substantial fractions of heritability remain to be explained rare_variants which are under the radar of gwas are suggested to have significant_contributions to missing_heritability complete ascertainment of rare_variants requires genome_wide resequencing which is now feasible thanks to the development of next_generation exome_sequencing and whole_genome wgs have been successfully_applied to to whom correspondence should be addressed identify rare causal_variants of mendelian_diseases in these studies a causal gene was implicated if it harbors rare functional mutations that are shared among cases but absent in controls or single_nucleotide snp databases extending this approach to association studies of complex_diseases requires more than a handful of samples because the causal_variants of such conditions only have statistical effect therefore it is necessary to carefully consider the design of such studies under the constraint of limited resources a critical technical attribute of wgs_data is the number of times each site is observed in a sequencing read usually termed the depthof coverage depth of coverage is a key_determinant of quality for sequencing information and in particular w r t rare_variants accuracy and completeness of detection and calling such variants from sequencing depend on high depth of coverage due to the randomness of read placement and non negligible error_rate higher depth coverage for variant discovery and genotyping is attainable by using more sequencing resources e g illumina lanes per sequenced sample however given a fixed budget more sequencing per sample is in conflict with analyzing a large_sample which is required for adequate_statistical of detecting associations here we propose to resolve this tradeoff by finding the design that maximizes the power for detecting associations of rare_variants we define rare_variants as the ones with minor_allele maf in the population and uncommon variants as the ones with maf between and here we use the term rare_variants to include both rare and uncommon variants
