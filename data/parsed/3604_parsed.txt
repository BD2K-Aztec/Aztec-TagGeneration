genome_analysis pooled assembly of marine metagenomic_datasets enriching annotation through chimerism motivation despite advances in high_throughput marine metagenomic_samples remain largely opaque a typical sample contains billions of microbial organisms from thousands of genomes and quadrillions of dna base_pairs its derived metagenomic_dataset underrepresents this complexity by orders_of because of the sparseness and shortness of sequencing_reads read shortness and sequencing_errors pose a major_challenge to accurate species and functional_annotation this includes distinguishing known from novel species often the majority of reads cannot be annotated and thus cannot help our interpretation of the sample results here we demonstrate quantitatively how careful assembly of marine metagenomic_reads within but also across datasets can alleviate this problem for simulated_datasets each with species complexity modeled on a real counterpart chimerism remained within the same species for most contigs for real pyrosequencing datasets assembly increased the proportion of annotated reads and even more so when datasets were pooled by on average max for species max for pfam protein_domains and max for panther gene_families our results outline exciting prospects for data_sharing in the metagenomics community while chimeric sequences should be avoided in other areas of metagenomics e g biodiversity analyses conservative pooled assembly is advantageous for annotation specificity and sensitivity intriguingly our experiment also found potential prospects for low_cost discovery of new species in old data high_throughput of microbial_communities metagenomics has greatly expanded our knowledge reviewed broadly in for example new marine biology a better understanding of biogeochemical cycles and more are keenly anticipated from this currently still main option for characterizing unculturable species at the molecular level in marine metagenomics and for samples derived from other habitats full realization of the potential of next_generation ngs relies on high_quality species and functional_annotation of the now hundreds of datasets available to the scientific_community however metagenome annotation is confounded by i the shortness of ngs_reads review this challenge and others which merely characterize small_fragments of genes and ii by the small fraction of known microbes represented in sequence_databases often described as the culturable in traditional genomics assembling reads into contigs is common practice by contrast metagenomes are primarily released to the community as reads predominantly from sanger or pyrosequencing to date and even some gold_standard annotation_pipelines are optimized for unassembled data concern over chimeric contigs may explain the reluctance to assemble for example only of the datasets in this work were assembled according to the publications in which they first appeared this may seem justified to an extent by pyrosequencing read_lengths which typically range from around nt in publically available sets depending on how recently the data were obtained while some annotation can be derived from individual_reads in this range it is plausible that assembly should add value to the data by improving annotation however the potential benefits for annotation have not been quantified rigorously previous smaller_scale work with simulated assemblies already suggests that chimeric contigs may not be as common as feared for example reported that of contigs from assemblies of the most species rich set of their simulated sanger sequencing_data did not mix genomes neither did the majority of contigs assembled from simulated pyrosequencing reads in other work by the moya group in in v azquez below we give this question a deeper look but we also take a step further to ask is it advisable for deriving species and function_annotation to cautiously consider not only data from one sample but also from others by allowing limited chimerism within and across samples we may strike a balance between information_gain and precision with respect to an individual cells genome that is beneficial if used strictly for annotation for example a contig identified as trichodesmium erythraeum is informative even if the contig mixes strains of this bacterium whereas refusal to call the species because a contig fails to match precisely a known strain tells us nothing to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com
