gestodifferent a cytoscape_plugin for the generation and the identification of gene_regulatory describing a stochastic cell_differentiation process the characterization of the complex phenomenon of cell_differentiation is a key goal of both systems and computational_biology gestodifferent is a cytoscape_plugin aimed at the generation and the identification of gene_regulatory grns describing an arbitrary stochastic cell_differentiation process the dynamical_model adopted to describe general grns is that of noisy random boolean_networks nrbns with a specific focus on their emergent dynamical_behavior gestodifferent explores the space of grns by filtering the nrbn instances inconsistent with a stochastic lineage differentiation tree representing the cell_lineages that can be obtained by following the fate of a stem_cell descendant matched networks can then be analyzed by cytoscape network_analysis algorithms or for instance used to define multiscale models of cellular_dynamics availability freely_available bimib disco unimib it index php retronetgestodifferent or at the cytoscape app storecell differentiation is the process by which the progeny of totiand multi potent stem_cells progressively develops in more specialized cell_types characterized by particular properties and functions the characterization of this complex and still mostly undeciphered phenomenon is of key importance for both computational and systems_biology to address this problem we here introduce gestodifferent a plugin for cytoscape that builds on the dynamical_model of cell_differentiation introduced in the key hypothesis of the model is that cell_types are characterized by coherent gene activation patterns of the underlying gene_regulatory grns and that the degree of differentiation is correlated with the stability of these patterns to noise and perturbations e g mutations in particular more differentiated_cells would show more sophisticated control mechanisms against noise and mutations compare hoffman et_al and references therein in this is achieved by considering noisy random boolean_networks nrbns as a grn model and by focusing on the dynamical_behavior that emerges from the interaction of a large_number the model is general i e it does not refer to any specific organism and was proven to reproduce some key_properties of the differentiation process namely i the presence of different degrees of differentiation i e from toti multi potent stem_cells to intermediate states to fully differentiated_cells ii the stochastic differentiation process according to which a population of toti multi potent cells generates progenies of distinct types by means of a stochastic_process and iii the induced pluripotency phenomenon according to which fully differentiated_cells can achieve a pluripotent stage through the perturbation of some key_genes within this framework gestodifferent can generateaccording to some specific user_defined featuresand select grns that display an appropriate emergent behavior matching an input cell_lineage differentiation tree e g that of intestinal_crypts or hematopoietic_cells the cytoscape environment then allows for further network specific analysis and matching against well known biological_databases our group is working on meshing different simulation levels for intestinal crypt development in conjunction with colorectal_cancer development gestodifferent has been used to identify grns describing the lineage_commitment tree of cell_populations in colonic_crypts in de matteis et_al submitted for publication matched networks have been subsequently used within a multicellular and multiscale simulation_model which we used to study some key cellular_processes such as cell_growth migration sorting division and lineage_commitment the selected nrbns are consistent with the expected behaviour and are amenable to perturbation studies finally new matching filters could in principle be devised to consider epigenetic_factors pertaining to the cell_differentiation process
