data_and protein homology reveals new targets for bioactive_small motivation the functional impact of small_molecules is increasingly being assessed in different eukaryotic_species through large_scale phenotypic screening initiatives identifying the targets of these molecules is crucial to mechanistically understand their function and uncover new therapeutically_relevant modes of action however despite extensive work carried_out in model_organisms and human it is still unclear to what extent one can use information obtained in one species to make predictions in other species results here for the first time we explore and validate at a large_scale the use of protein hom ology relationships to predict the targets of small_molecules across different species our results show that exploiting target homology can significantly improve the predictions especially for molecules experimentally tested in other species interestingly when considering separately orthology and paralogy relationships we observe that mapping small_molecule interactions among ortho logs improves prediction_accuracy while including paralogs does not improve and even sometimes worsens the prediction_accuracy overall our results provide a novel approach to integrate chemical_screening results across multiple species and highlight the promises and remaining challenges of using protein homology for small_molecule target_identification availability_and homology based_predictions can be tested on our website_http www swisstargetprediction ch small_molecules provide remarkable tools to modulate molecular_mechanisms in cells with therapeutic_applications in human and veterinary biotechnological or agricultural applications in many other species from animals to plants to microorganisms small_molecules displaying bioactivity in a given organism typically bind specific proteins and modify their activity mapping the actual protein targets of small_molecules is therefore a key_step toward a better understanding of their mechanisms of action in addition several molecules bind to more than one target which can be unrelated in terms of both sequence and function these secondary targets are typically responsible for many favorable or unfavorable side_effects of known drugs unraveling small_molecule secondary targets is helpful to predict and elucidate these side_effects moreover it is a promising approach to repurpose existing_drugs toward new applications by exploiting their activity on other proteins than those they were initially_developed for several experimental and computational strategies have been developed to determine the interacting_partners and the activity of small_molecules small_molecules can bescreened in vitro against large arrays of proteins such as kinases or g_protein in parallel in vivo screening approaches are increasingly being developed using model_organisms such as yeast or zebrafish several of these chemogenomics screens use the power of genetics to provide indirect information about the actual targets of small_molecules for instance by comparing the activity of small_molecules across different mutant_strains in yeast from the computational point_of most target prediction_approaches use similarity relationships between a new molecule and known ligands there top predicted targets are identified as those with one or more ligands that display high similarity with the query molecule different similarity_measures between molecules can be used for this purpose other studies have explored the use of additional information such as side effect similarity or gene_expression similarity to expand the similarity beyond features determined solely by the molecular_structure of the compounds other groups have also used protein_structures to predict small_molecule targets and potential binding_modes computational target prediction_tools are especially useful to analyze the results of high_throughput phenotypic assays that are increasingly being used to identify bioactive_compounds in different species but do not provide direct information about their targets data from thousands of such assays are available in public_repositories such as chembank or pubchem in silico target predictions have been successfully_applied to the results of phenotypic screening assays performed in diverse systems ranging from cell_lines to zebrafish unfortunately most current experimental and computational_approaches to determine small_molecule targets focus on one species such as human mouse or rat as such information about protein orthology_relationships to make predictions in less studied species or improve predictions in model_organisms by integrating data from other species has been mostly disregarded for instance only a handful of recent_studies investigated the properties of ligands binding to related proteins in distinct organisms or within the same organism this is in stark_contrast with many areas of biology and bioinformatics where the ability to transfer results obtained in one organism to others is a central dogma for instance mapping protein_function based on orthology has proved extremely useful protein_structure predictions rely heavily on the existence of homologous_proteins with available crystal_structures proteinprotein_interaction predictions also strongly benefit from information obtained in orthologous species all these studies have clearly established the use of homology relationships to better predict the properties of proteins this lack in conceptual understanding and computational_techniques to exploit target homology in small moleculeprotein interaction predictions is strongly limiting the scope of chemoinformatics approaches for two main reasons first beyond model_organisms such as human or rat very few data are available in public_databases for other organisms e g zebrafish and bacteria and accurate_predictions would be very useful in these species second it would be highly_desirable to integrate data obtained in close orthologous species to improve existing techniques predicting small_molecule protein interactions even in well studied organisms understanding how small_molecule targets can be mapped across species is also critically_important for therapeutic_applications since small_molecules of therapeutic interest are first tested in model_organisms e g mouse or rat before being considered for clinical_trials in human here we introduce a new strategy to integrate data from different species to improve small_molecule target predictions our results reveal that protein orthology leads to improve prediction_accuracy and is powerful to uncover new small moleculeprotein interactions especially in species with less experimental_data interestingly paralogy relationships do not appear to improve prediction_accuracy finally our findings provide a strong basis for expanding small moleculeprotein target predictions beyond well studied organisms the workflow of our method is illustrated on as in other ligand based_approaches it relies on the observation that similar bioactive_compounds tend to have similar targets in this framework the predicted targets for a query molecule are those interacting with ligands displaying the highest similarity with this molecule to integrate target homology a small_molecule with reported bioactivity in a given species s is compared with all known ligands of proteins from other organisms that have at least one homolog in s predicted targets are determined as those with homologous_proteins binding to the most similar ligands in other species in the absence of small moleculeprotein interaction data in s predictions rely only on target orthology alternatively if some ligands are reported in s ligands of homologous_proteins are added to the list of similar molecules when considering paralogy relationships potential predicted targets are proteins from s either with known ligands or having a paralog in s with known ligands similar to the query molecule see example in an example of a successful prediction in human using similarity with a ligand_binding to a mouse orthologous protein is shown in a special situation arises when a query molecule has been already tested in another organism in this case the most a schematic description of the homology_based prediction method in species s the most similar ligands l and l to a query molecule are first determined cyan dashed arrows the targets of these ligands are identified in

ligand will be the molecule itself and the top predicted targets will be the orthologs of the targets in the species where the molecule has been tested to explore the use of homology_based target predictions we used the swisstargetprediction method to assess similarity between molecules and predict their targets this algorithm was built using the chembl database version as a reference dataset of small moleculeprotein interactions and includes data from human mouse rat cow and horse since horse has only three targets with reported ligands it was not included in this work thus homology based_predictions were tested considering four different organisms human rat mouse and cow to test the use of homology relationships we used for each organism separately all compounds in chembl that do not appear in our reference dataset derived from chembl see section for more details the total number of small_molecules in this dataset is displayed in gray bars for each species the number of molecules that were tested in chembl in one of the three other organisms is shown in black bars in apart from cow most compounds of our dataset are not found in chembl in any of the four organisms predictions were carried_out as described inin each organism considering no homology orthology paralogy and both orthology and paralogy relationships it is important to note that including homology and especially orthology_relationships increases significantly the number of potential targets available for prediction for rat mouse and cow as observed in green bars this is because the number of targets on which ligands have been tested in these species is much smaller than in human therefore including orthology based_predictions with orthologous human targets expands significantly the number of potential predictable targets in human the number of proteins without ligands in our reference dataset but with orthologs in mouse rat or cow that have known ligands is much smaller therefore including orthology_relationships does not increase much the total number of targets available for predictions in human paralogy relationships provide on average a increase in the number of potential predictable targets orange bars for each molecule in our dataset the performance was assessed using auc as well as the fraction of ligands with at least one correct target among the top predictions see section in terms of auc values indicates that including orthology_relationships between targets leads on average to better auc especially for rat mouse and cow interestingly we observe that the use of paralogy relationships in general does not result in better auc values and most often give rise to lower values considering both target orthology and paralogy gives similar performance as when only target orthology is used as noted in previous_studies small moleculeprotein interaction data display strong biases and redundancies in part because of the systematic exploration of sidechain replacements that preserve the compounds scaffold in medicinal_chemistry experiments this makes target prediction much easier for molecules belonging to chemical series intensively explored as a consequence the auc value calculated from the entire dataset does not reflect the predictive_ability of the approach for molecules belonging to new chemical series one way of addressing this issue consists in preventing comparisons between ligands with the same scaffold see section as expected auc values are lower when preventing comparison between the same scaffolds but the same trend is visible supplementary we further investigate the situation where molecules in our dataset have been previously_tested in another species this corresponds to the case where target orthology_relationships are expected to be most beneficial we observe that auc values are higher and as before target orthology leads to improved auc values while paralogy relationships result in few changes the same results hold when preventing comparisons between ligands with the same scaffolds supplementary auc values provide an unbiased measure of prediction_accuracy however for practical purposes only the top predicted targets are typically tested_experimentally we therefore consider a second measure of performance defined as the fraction of ligands for which at least one of the top predicted targets is a known one i e true_positive in our dataset this can be seen as the probability of having at least one hit when experimentally testing top predicted targets which is most useful to guide experimental_approaches in the general_case although orthology_relationships gave better auc values we observe that the likelihood of obtaining a correct hit among the top predicted targets decreases for rat mouse and cow and is only very slightly_higher in human when considering orthology based_predictions target paralogy also results in lower performance however if we only consider molecules that have been tested in other species the fraction of query molecules with at least one known target in the top is higher for human rat and mouse when using protein orthology_relationships this result confirms that target orthology_relationships are especially useful to map the targets of molecules that have been directly tested in another organisms the apparent_discrepancy between auc values and the fraction of compounds with at least one known target among the topresults obtained with the subset of small_molecules in our dataset that have been tested in at least one other organism predicted ones can be understood by observing that the number of potential predictable targets is much larger when orthology based mapping is allowed and last column suggesting that for many new targets that can be predicted by homology no ligand has simply been tested_experimentally moreover most of the targets in our dataset are already present in previous assays even without considering target homology column to explore the effect of this potential_bias we restricted the predictions to targets that are present in our reference dataset remarkably in this case we see a constant improvement when including orthology_relationships for all four organisms and d green versus gray bars the same results hold when considering the sensitivity see supplementary this suggests that the lower performance of orthology based_predictions observed inalso comes from the much larger number of targets that are available for predictions when considering orthology_relationships because for many of these new targets no ligand has been tested a larger number of data annotated as negative are present in our dataset which is known to affect measures considering the top predictions such as the one used in overall these results suggest that orthology based_predictions work especially well for compounds_tested in some other organism in our benchmarks we further observe that ligands of old targets can be predicted using target orthology for the other predicted protein targets it is important to realize that many of them have not been considered in experimental assays therefore some of the orthology based_predictions may be correct but do not appear as true_positives in our dataset because of the lack of experimental_data for these targets to explore the potential of the proposed_framework in other species we display inthe number of targets available for predictions in a wide_range of organisms as expected this number is lower for invertebrates since there exist less orthologs in these species nevertheless a significant number of proteins can still be accessed by orthology in these distant_species we also note that the higher number of targets in zebrafish compared with other vertebrates likely arises because of the whole_genome event in teleosts most importantly indicates that orthology based_predictions have the potential to significantly impact small_molecule target discovery well beyond the four species considered in this work mapping the properties of proteins across different species using orthology is a well established way of harnessing the wealth of data available in some organisms to make new and accurate_predictions in others however this property has not been exploited to predict interactions between proteins and small_molecule ligands here we observe that target prediction_accuracy is improved both in terms of auc and of the fraction of molecules with at least one correct target among the top predicted ones when including data from other organisms in all four species analyzed in this work this is especially striking when the query molecule has been already tested in some other species which corresponds to the most straightforward way of mapping small moleculeprotein interactions across species the much larger number of potential targets that can be predicted using orthology and can sometimes result in lower number of correct predictions among the top predicted targets however when including only targets on which ligands have been tested in previous assays here in version of chembl we observe that target orthology_relationships lead to a clear improvement especially in rat mouse and cow this is likely because targets used in older assays are often reused in new ones as observed in first many of these old targets have been selected based on their therapeutic or biotechnological interest and therefore are more likely to be studied second when planning new experiments researchers are typically guided by previous successful studies and therefore tend to preferentially study targets with already known ligands last and possibly most importantly old targets often have well established experimental assays possibly commercially_available that are more likely to be reused by experimentalists rather than setting up a whole new assay for new targets for these reasons it is not surprising that orthology based_predictions resulting in many more potential targets give lower performance in terms of the fraction of ligands with validated targets among the top predictions and b however when correcting for the bias toward reusing the same targets in experimental_studies we see a clear improvement in the predictions and d based on the improved accuracy when considering only old targets it is tempting to speculate that many of the orthology based_predictions for new targets especially in rat mouse and cow may actually be correct but simply have not been tested we observed that mapping small_molecule targets between paralogs is often detrimental to the predictions this likely reflects several factors first evolutionary_studies indicate that paralogs have diverged more than orthologs as a consequence protein_function is often more conserved among orthologs than paralogs in terms of proteinligand_interactions previous work also suggested that orthologous_proteins share more of their ligands number of proteins that can be predicted as small_molecule targets in different species using orthology_relationships from known human rat mouse and cow protein targetsshows how many of them are available in our predictions without including homology relationships column shows how many in total are available for predictions gray bars column shows how many of the targets in our dataset are available in our predictions when including target orthology_relationships column shows how many in total are available for predictions when considering target orthology_relationships green bars compared with paralogs kr ger and overington second small_molecules are often designed to target only some specific members of a protein_family e g specific kinase_inhibitors therefore mapping their interactions within a family of paralogs may often lead to false_positives although some of these results might have been guessed our work demonstrates for the first time that paralogy relationships are in general not appropriate for transferring small moleculetarget interactions within an organism to validate and compare predictions with and without orthology_relationships we used auc and the fraction of ligands with at least one correct target among the top predictions this strategy does not require fixing an arbitrary threshold on the target scores which may not be the same for all ligands and takes a more pragmatic_approach correct prediction among the top predicted targets which corresponds to what can be reasonably tested_experimentally other studies have used measures such as sensitivity_and assuming a fixed and uniform threshold to separate interacting from noninteracting pairs a natural question is whether orthology based_predictions will be as successful in more distant_species such as those displayed in unfortunately much less data are available in most species apart from human rat mouse and cow for instance horse zebrafish or worm have less than five targets each with reported binding data in chembl when attempting to check the predictions in these species with little interaction data we could not find significant validations of the predictions however because of the sparsity of data we expect that this observation may not truly reflect the reality in particular orthology based target predictions are likely to be useful in species like zebrafish as attested by many biological studies that map small_molecule activity across vertebrate_species our work is the first attempt to establish the use of protein homology for bioactive small_molecule target predictions at a large_scale overall we observe that clear improvement can be achieved by using target orthology whereas paralogy relationships do not result in significantly better predictions in this work we used our previously_published method to determine ligand similarity and ligandtarget interaction scores however the idea of integrating orthology_relationships into target predictions can be easily generalized to other small_molecule similarity_metrics our analysis also reveals a strong bias in recent small moleculeprotein interaction datasets where the same targets are used over and over this aspect should be considered when benchmarking cross_species target prediction_approaches although there are many practical reasons for this bias this work could serve as a guide to develop new assays to test potentially interesting targets in different species these would increase our sampling of the ligand space for many proteins which could then further improve the in silico predictions from model_organisms to humans homology based_predictions can be tested at our website http www swisstargetprediction ch
