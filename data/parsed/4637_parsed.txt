databases_and the semantic measures library and toolkit fast computation of semantic_similarity and relatedness using biomedical_ontologies the semantic measures library and toolkit are robust open_source and easy to use software solutions dedicated to semantic measures they can be used for large_scale computations and analyses of semantic similarities between terms concepts defined in terminologies and ontologies the comparison of entities e g genes_annotated by concepts is also supported a large collection of measures is available not limited to a specific application context the library and the toolkit can be used with various controlled_vocabularies and ontology specifications e g open biomedical ontology resource_description the project targets both designers and practitioners of semantic measures providing a java_library as well as a command_line that can be used on personal_computers or computer clusters biomedical_ontologies provide well structured and controlled_vocabularies of specific domains e g biological_processes and clinical healthcare terminology they are increasingly used to drive data_integration information_retrieval data annotations and decision_support to cite a few open repositories such as the open biomedical ontology obo_foundry or bioportal provide access to hundreds of biomedical_ontologies expressed in various formats e g resource_description rdf obo web_ontology owl these structured vocabularies are used to characterize entities through conceptual annotations for instance genes products can be annotated by gene_ontology go terms to define their molecular_functions their cellular locations or the biological_processes in which they are involved those unambiguous annotations can therefore be used to query large collections of data taking_into the knowledge defined in the ontology i e practitioners searching for genes_annotated to nucleoside binding will also retrieve genes_annotated to atp_binding as the ontology specifies that atp_binding is a specific type of nucleoside binding however in some cases exact searches are too constraining and we search for entities that are similar or related to the query such an imprecise search is based on information_retrieval techniques that require a function to estimate whether or not two entities are similar or related with regards to their conceptual annotations therefore to exploit ontologies and corresponding annotations semantic measures are required they aim to compare concepts by taking_into the semantic space in which they are defined they can therefore be used to assess the degree of likeness of concepts defined in ontologies or between entities annotated by those concepts an increasing number of algorithms rely on semantic measures for instance to analyze genes based on their molecular_functions or related_diseases semantic measures can also assist in comparisons of patient_records chemical_compounds diseases or any entity that can be characterized by unambiguous terms or concepts defined in ontologies or thesauri numerous communities are involved in the study of semantic measures e g bioinformatics natural_language artificial_intelligence and semantic_web owing to their popularity many measures have been designed for different ontologies and treatments e g gene analysis information_retrieval a recent survey distinguished tens of measures dedicated to the go alone however communities focusing on other types of annotated entities e g patient_records also benefit theoretical findings made by studying measures in other specific domains such as molecular_biology and vice_versa nevertheless most software solutions related to semantic measures are developed for a specific terminology ontology and only focus on a limited set of measures to federate efforts related to the design and analysis of semantic measures and to respond to the need for a generic software_tool dedicated to them we developed the semantic measures library sml this article_presents its benefits for the computation of semantic measures using bio ontologies
