bioimage_informatics html pivotviewer high_throughput visualization and querying of image data on the web motivation visualization and analysis of large_numbers of biological images has generated a bottle neck in research we present html pivotviewer a novel open_source platform independent viewer making use of the latest web technologies that allows seamless access to images and associated metadata for each image this provides a powerful method to allow end_users to mine their data bioimaging and associated informatics are generating unprecedented amounts of data new sophisticated imaging_techniques yield large heterogeneous multidimensional datasets that need to be viewed analysed annotated queried and shared development of automated_image methods has been facilitated by various tools such as imagej fiji using the built in macro functions but when there are large_amounts of data and associated images reviewing and analysing the results is burdensome there are no powerful and intuitive web_tools available that allow filtering and sorting of images based on the derived properties of these images omero provides a comprehensive database for storing and viewing large_amounts of images however viewing and querying thousands of images using the omero insight client or omero web is slow microsoft live labs pivot has been used in a neuroimaging setting but the silverlight version although powerful required a specific plug in and was not accessible on all platforms and cannot be easily extended in addition support for silverlight is being phased out our goal was to develop an open_source extensible viewer specifically_designed using the standard html canvas element and javascript technologies this enables informaticians to create dynamic and interactive_visualizations of the results of image_analysis or large image datasets providing a powerful but simple and intuitive front end that works in any modern web_browser it allows users to see their data filter sort and identify relationships based on the metadata supplied for each image because the technology is based on open standards there is potential to integrate with other html based libraries such as d http d js org icanplot for statistical visualization and scribl for multiple region genomic visualization
