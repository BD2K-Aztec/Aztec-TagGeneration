ngsrelate a software_tool for estimating pairwise relatedness from next_generation pairwise relatedness estimation is important in many contexts such as disease mapping and population_genetics however all existing estimation methods are based on called genotypes which is not ideal for next_generation ngs_data of low depth from which genotypes cannot be called with high certainty results we present a software_tool ngsrelate for estimating pairwise relatedness from ngs_data it provides maximum_likelihood that are based on genotype likelihoods instead of genotypes and thereby takes the inherent uncertainty of the genotypes into account using both simulated_and we show that ngsrelate provides markedly better estimates for low depth ngs_data than two state of the art genotype based_methods estimation of how related two individuals are from genetic data plays_a in several research_areas including medical_genetics and population_genetics for example in medical_genetics it is used for excluding closely_related individuals from association studies and thereby to avoid inflated false_positive how related two individuals are is usually described through the concept of identityby descent ibd i e genetic identity due to a recent common_ancestor historically several summary_statistics have been used such as the kinship coefficient h however almost all of these statistics can be calculated from r k k k where k m is the fraction of genome in which the two individuals share m alleles ibd for example h k k we will therefore here focus on r many estimators for r have been proposed both method of moments and maximum_likelihood ml estimators common to them all is that they are based on genotype data and it has been shown that they work well on single_nucleotide snp chip data however next_generation ngs is becoming increasingly common and often ngs_data are only of low depth which means that genotypes can only be called with high uncertainty o for such data it has been shown that it can be an advantage to take the uncertainty of the genotypes into account by basing statistical_methods on so_called genotype likelihoods gls instead of genotypes motivated by this we developed ngsrelate a ml method for estimating the pairwise relatedness parameter r from ngs_data based on gls in the following we present this method and show that for low depth ngs_data it performs markedly better than two state of the art genotype based_methods
