gene_expression robnca robust network_component for recovering transcription_factor activities motivation network_component nca is an efficient method of reconstructing the transcription_factor activity tfa which makes use of the gene_expression data and prior information available about transcription_factor tf gene regulations most of the contemporary algorithms either exhibit the drawback of inconsistency and poor reliability or suffer from prohibitive computational_complexity in addition the existing algorithms do not possess the ability to counteract the presence of outliers in the microarray_data hence robust and computationally_efficient algorithms are needed to enable practical_applications results we propose robust network_component robnca a novel iterative algorithm that explicitly_models the possible outliers in the microarray_data an attractive feature of the robnca algorithm is the derivation of a closed form solution for estimating the connectivity matrix which was not available in prior contributions the robnca algorithm is compared with fastnca and the non iterative nca ni nca robnca estimates the tf_activity profiles as well as the tfgene control strength matrix with a much higher degree of accuracy than fastnca and ni nca irrespective of varying noise correlation and or amount of outliers in case of synthetic data the robnca algorithm is also tested on saccharo myces cerevisiae data and escherichia_coli data and it is observed to outperform the existing algorithms the run time of the robnca algorithm is comparable with that of fastnca and is hundreds of times_faster than ni nca recent_advances in technology have enabled monitoring of cellular_activities using more sophisticated techniques and have provided a deluge of biological data using these data to unravel the underlying phenomena that regulate various activities in a living organism offers the potential to reap numerous benefits one of the key_biological is transcriptional_regulation which controls the gene_expression and amount of rna produced this process is regulated by transcription_factors tfs which are specialized proteins causing the genes to express by binding onto the gene_promoters a thorough understanding of this complex transcriptional_regulation and tfgene interaction will potentially aid in predicting the biological_processes and designing control strategies to cure and or avoid the diseased conditions lahdesmakilahdesma microarray_technologies are able to measure the level of gene_expressions and quantify them in the form of gene_expression data such data are widely used in the inference of genegene_interactions transcription_factor activity tfa which is defined as the concentration of its subpopulation with dna_binding ability controls the transcriptional_regulation the correlation between tfas and tf expression_level is modified at the posttranscriptional and post_translational stage it is therefore much harder to measure tfa profiles experimentally and scientists have resorted to computational_methods for their estimation several statistical_techniques including principal_component pca and independent_component ica have been used to deduce useful information from sets of biological data however the successful application of these algorithms hinges on the assumptions of orthogonality and independence between the signals which do not hold for biological_signals in practice in fact some prior information is usually available for many systems and it should be incorporated in the system model e g chipchip data indicates which tfs and genes are known to interact the gene_regulatory can be modelled linearly as follows where y is the n k gene_expression data matrix a is the n m control strength or connectivity matrix and s is the m k matrix denoting the tfas the uncertainties in the observation data are assumed to be gaussian and are represented by the entries of the noise matrix genes and tfs are known to interact in a dynamic and non linear manner however a log_linear relationship provides a good approximation because a particular tf regulates only a few other genes the connectivity matrix a is expected to be sparse the problem then boils down to estimating s and to whom correspondence should be addressed a where y is available and some a priori information about the matrix a is known network_component nca proposed by provides a more accurate model for tfgene regulation and makes use of the related prior information available it was shown that provided certain conditions are met the nca algorithm produces a unique_solution of the aforementioned estimation problem in the absence of noise the nca criteria require that i the matrix a is full column rank ii if a row is removed from s as well as the output elements connected to it the updated control strength matrix should still be of full columnrank iii the tfa matrix s should have a full row rank these criteria guarantee that the solution obtained is unique up to a scale ambiguity when the nca criteria are satisfied the optimization_problem reduces to where k k f denotes the frobenius norm and i is the set of all indices where the entries of matrix a are known to be zero the algorithm in allows the recovery of source signals when the microarray_data consist of fewer data_points and formulates the incorporation of regulatory knockout constraints as well the nca problem in was first solved by using alternate least_squares als for both a and s however because the als solution requires solving a high_dimensional matrix optimization_problem at each iteration it entails prohibitive computational_complexity for large_datasets which often need to be handled in gene_networks fastnca provides a closed form solution for a which uses singular_value svd and is several tens of times_faster than the als algorithm the authors in propose a non iterative version of nca herein referred to as ni nca which offers greater_consistency in terms of tfa estimation at the cost of much higher computational_complexity than fastnca however because the decomposition techniques used to derive these algorithms are susceptible even to the presence of small amount of outliers their performance is expected to deteriorate significantly when data_points are corrupted by outliers it is commonly known that the microarray_data are noisy and are corrupted with outliers because of erroneous measurements and or abnormal response of genes and robust algorithms are required for gene network_inference therefore it is imperative to develop an nca algorithm that has an inherent ability to mitigate the effect of outliers and also entails low computational costs and provides good consistency and accuracy it is precisely this avenue which is the focus of our current work the main contributions of this article can be summarized as follows a novel algorithm robust network_component robnca is proposed which has the inherent ability to counteract the presence of outliers in the data y by explicitly modelling the outliers as an additional sparse matrix the iterative algorithm estimates each of the parameters efficiently at each iteration and delivers superior consistency and greater_accuracy for tfa estimation a particularly attractive feature of the robnca algorithm is the derivation of a closed form solution for the estimation of the connectivity matrix a a major source of high_computational in contemporary algorithms to further lower the computational_burden a still faster closed form solution is derived that requires matrix inversion of much smaller_size the resulting algorithm is comparable with fastnca in terms of computational_complexity and is hundreds of times_faster than ni nca the performance of robnca is tested on haemoglobin test data from for both low and highly_correlated source signals robnca is seen to outperform the state of the art algorithms for estimating both a and s in terms of mean square error mse in addition robnca is applied to yeast_cell data and escherichia_coli data and by plotting the standard_deviation of estimates it is observed that robnca offers better consistency than fastnca and ni nca
