databases_and the biopax validator biopax is a community developed standard language for biological_pathway data a key functionality required for efficient biopax data_exchange is validationdetecting errors and inconsistencies in biopax documents the biopax validator is a command_line java_library and online web_service for biopax that performs classes of consistency checks availability_and the validator recognizes common syntactic errors and semantic inconsistencies and reports them in a customizable human_readable format it can also automatically fix some errors and normalize biopax data since its release the valida tor has become a critical tool for the pathway informatics community detecting thousands of errors and helping substantially_increase the conformity and uniformity of biopax formatted data the biopax validator is open_source and released under lgpl v license all sources binaries and documentation can be found at sf biopax is a community developed standard language for biological_pathway data biopax is defined in web_ontology owl and can represent a broad_spectrum of biological_processes including metabolic and signaling_pathways molecular_interactions and gene_networks pathguide org lists the pathway_databases and tools that support biopax owing to the complexity of biological pathway_knowledge and the rapid_growth of the biopax corpus manual validation and review of data exports is impractical unless this process is automated a substantial number of errors would be left undetected and propagate to other resources and tools making it more difficult for researchers to use pathway data for each user must debug the errors trace its origin and contact the data providers to fix them other xml encoded systems_biology standards have developed custom validator services although generic owl validators can be used to perform basic biopax validation they are not sufficient the biopax specification contains a number of best practices and constraints that cannot be formally defined in owl e g regarding external ontology_terms standard identifiers or the constraint that each side of a transport interaction must contain participants from different cellular_compartments checking some of these rules requires accessing external databases and non owl ontologies other constraints can only be checked algorithmically such as circular nesting of protein_complexes moreover a tiered reporting format is required to differentiate between violations of invariants and best practices we developed a comprehensive biopax validator that recognizes syntactic errors semantic inconsistencies and violations of best practices in biopax models these are defined as an expandable rule set written in java and are reported in a human_readable html format or xml the validator can also normalize biopax models based on community defined best practices and automatically fix some common errors the validator substantially facilitates pathway data_integration and analysis by increasing the conformity and uniformity of the available biopax formatted data
