data_and exploring high_dimensional with butterfly a novel classification algorithm based on discrete dynamical_systems motivation we introduce a novel method for visualizing high_dimensional via a discrete dynamical system this method provides a d representation of the relationship between subjects according to a set of variables without geometric projections transformed axes or principal_components the algorithm exploits a memory type mechanism inherent in a certain class of discrete dynamical_systems collectively referred to as the chaos game that are closely_related to iterative function systems the goal of the algorithm was to create a human_readable representation of high_dimensional patient data that was capable of detecting unrevealed subclusters of patients from within anticipated classifications this provides a mechanism to further pursue a more personalized exploration of pathology when used with medical data for clustering and classification protocols the dynam ical system portion of the algorithm is designed to come after some feature_selection filter and before some model evaluation e g clustering accuracy protocol in the version given here a univariate features selection_step is performed in practice more complex feature_selection are used a discrete dynamical system is driven by this reduced set of variables which results in a set of d cluster models these models are evaluated for their accuracy according to a user_defined binary_classification and finally a visual representation of the top classification_models are returned thus in addition to the visual ization component this methodology can be used for both supervised and unsupervised machine_learning as the top performing models are returned in the protocol we describe here results butterfly the algorithm we introduce and provide working code for uses a discrete dynamical system to classify high_dimensional and provide a d representation of the relationship between subjects we report results on three datasets two in the article one in the appendix including a public lung_cancer dataset that comes along with the included butterfly r package in the included r script a univariate feature_selection method is used for the dimension_reduction step but in the future we wish to use a more powerful multivariate feature_reduction method based on neural_networks kriesel there is an n dimensional geometry associated with any given dataset consisting of any number of subjects and n variables depending on the choice of which variables to include or emphasize the geometry changes for example consider a dataset consisting of two clusters e g responders_and to some treatment under optimal circumstances a small set of variables e g a subset of gene_expression values can be used to separate the groups these selected_variables determine the relationship between patients in a geometrical way via the distance between patients how can one explore this space in an efficient accurate and reproducible way so that one can study different scenarios i e different sets of variables and the corresponding relationships between subjects in two dimensions butterflys most powerful feature is its ability to reveal subclusters of data_points even within apparently homogeneous main clusters thus butterfly provides a tool for the bottom up exploration of data in addition to a procedure that can be used for standard training and testing protocols real_life datasets are invariably heterogeneous and many powerful nonlinear data exploration tools overfit the data due to the presence of noise mainly this is because conventional tools require the establishment of complex frontiers to separate classes in the case of butterfly the data_points are transformed into a d representative space which is the attractor space of the dynamical system and clusters are separated by straight_lines thus non linear correlations are identified between features whereas the relationship in space between subjects e g patients remains simple the main purpose of this work is to introduce butterfly and its efficacy in handling molecular_profiling datasets we present it as a data exploration and machine_learning classification_tool that can be applied to high_dimensional following any feature_reduction step which brings down the dimensionality to around or below we do not discuss the technical nuances behind the algorithm nor compare it with other methods in this article we introduce the algorithm and highlight its ability to accurately classify data future_research will focus on butterflys ability to to whom correspondence should be addressed conserve the relationships between high_dimensional data_points even after they are projected to a d plane the main use of butterfly in the research_setting is the ability to view the relationship between subjects e g patients from the vantage of a set of interesting variables with the specific goal of identifying homogeneous subgroups further the identification of the main variables that lead to a particular classification is returned to the user many of the modern non linear clustering dimensional reduction methods rely on the mathematics that drives principle_component or k means because the mathematics that drives butterfly is fundamentally different from these methods we have found that exploratory_analyses based on butterfly and one of these other approaches provides comprehensive_analyses and that butterfly complements these established approaches effectively in this article we presented an algorithm for the visualization clustering and classification of data that is based on a simple discrete dynamical system the novel aspect of the classification protocol is the dynamical system portion sandwiched between a feature_selection filter and model evaluation algorithm the iterative dynamical system transforms a multidimensional dataset into a d representation without using typical geometric and algebraic approaches found in other methods thus butterfly is ultimately a data visualization_tool that allows researchers to probe their data by reviewing a set of high_ranking models and observing the relationships between subjects in a d space each model is based on giving priority to a set of features and providing a human_readable representation of the resulting relationships between subjects however our methodology allows for both supervised and unsupervised machine_learning the main benefits of using butterfly to build predictive_models is that only a simple linear split in a d space is required to separate groups and this minimizes the chances of over fitting noise in data and its ability to provide a human_readable representation of the structure of the data including subclusters within expectedclusters the benefit over support_vector is that with butterfly this is always done in a d space where as the support_vector has to establish the separating contour in a space whose dimension is equal to the number of variables considered butterfly has a lot in common superficially with principal_components but they are sufficiently different mathematically to justify using both as data exploration tools in fact principal_components can be used as a variable reduction tool before using butterfly to examine subgroups butterflys ability as an effective multivariate feature_selection tool will be the subject of a future publication
