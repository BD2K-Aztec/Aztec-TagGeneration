tarpmir a new approach for microrna target_site prediction motivation the identification of microrna mirna_target is fundamentally_important for studying gene_regulation there are dozens of computational_methods available for mirna_target despite their existence we still cannot reliably identify mirna_target partially due to our limited understanding of the characteristics of mirna_target the recently_published clash crosslinking ligation and sequencing of hybrids data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the characteristics of mirna_target and improve mirna target_site prediction_methods results applying four different machine_learning to the clash data we identified seven new features of mirna_target combining these new features with those commonly used by existing mirna_target prediction_algorithms we developed an approach_called tarpmir for mirna_target testing on two human and one mouse non clash datasets we showed that tarpmir predicted more than of true mirna_target in each dataset compared with three existing_approaches we demonstrated that tarpmir is superior to these existing_approaches in terms of better recall and better precision the prediction of microrna mirna_target is critical in understanding mirna function and their involvement in various biological_processes mirnas are short noncoding_rnas that bind and regulate their target_mrnas in a variety of biological_processes such as cell development differentiation proliferation and apoptosis pathways the binding of mirnas to their target_mrnas degrades the target_mrnas and or prevents the target_mrnas from being translated into proteins and thus modulates gene_expression at the post_transcriptional level by identifying mirna_target the target_mrnas and the potential functional_roles of mirnas may thus be discovered several features are commonly believed to be important for predicting mirna_target among them seed match the exact sequence_matching between the positions of an mirna and a segment of nucleotides nt_long in target_mrnas has been reported to be essential for mirnamrna binding accessibility which measures how likely a region in an mrna sequence is open or accessible for an mirna to bind is well known to be important for functional mirnamrna binding in addition other features such as au content folding energy and conservation are also regarded as informative indicators of functional mirnamrna bindings dozens of tools for mirna_target have been developed in the past_decade based on different subsets of the aforementioned features for instance miranda utilizes the features of seed match conservation and free_energy for target_site prediction targetscan uses seed match pairing of mrnas with of mirnas local au content etc for target_site identification in addition to these traditional mirna target_site prediction_tools recently several tools based on next_generation have been developed for instance mirtarclip identifies mirna_target from the data generated by high_throughput of rna isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation hits_clip experiments and photoactivatableribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation par_clip experiments despite the existence of dozens of computational_methods computational_identification of mirna_target remains_a partially due to our limited understanding of the characteristics of mirna_target for instance although matching seed is not always sufficient for a functional mirnamrna interaction it has been thought to be necessary for most animal mirnamrna binding however studies have shown non canonical pairings that allow g u wobbles and even mismatches can be functional recent crosslinking ligation and sequencing of hybrids clash experiments have further shown that seed match including canonical and non canonical seed matching is not required for certain mirnamrna interactions the clash experiments provide an unprecedented opportunity to advance_our of mirna_target and to develop better computational_methods for mirna_target compared with other highthroughput experimental_approaches such as hits_clip and par_clip that identify mirna target_sequences only clash experiments provide both mirnas and their corresponding target_sequences with thousands of target_sequences for dozens of mirnas in one clash experiment new features of mirna_target may be inferred and better computational_methods for mirna_target may be developed in this study we developed a new approach for mirna_target called target prediction for mirnas tarpmir tarpmir applies a random_forest based_approach to integrate six conventional features and seven new features to predict mirna_target these features were learned from the only clash dataset in mammal that is made publically available by by cross_validation we showed that tarpmir had an average recall of and an average precision of tested on three independent datasets including two human par_clip datasets and one mouse hits_clip dataset we demonstrated that tarpmir identified more than of known mirna_target in each dataset compared with three existing_approaches we found that tarpmir is superior to existing_approaches in terms of both higher recall and higher_precision the tarpmir method is implemented in a python_package which is freely_available hulab ucf edu research_projects mirna tarpmir in this study we identified seven new features together with six conventional features of mirna_target based on these selected_features we developed a new approach_called tarpmir to predict mirna_target we tested tarpmir on a human clash dataset two human par_clip datasets a mouse hits_clip dataset and a general dataset from tarbase and showed that tarpmir performed at least the same or better than three existing_approaches tarpmir is freely_available hulab ucf edu research_projects mirna tarpmir not all new features were completely new we claimed some features as new because they were not used by most of the existing_tools such as miranda targetscan diana microt cds rna gui targetminer pita and rnahybrid kr ger and however several new features were mentioned in previous_studies directly_or for instance stated that some validated mirna_target do not have a complete seed match but instead exhibit continuous base_pairs in the central_region of the mirna we observed similar target_sites in the clash dataset and proposed the feature the length and position of the longest consecutive pairs the selected new features significantly_improved the prediction_accuracy of tarpmir to show the contribution of the new features to the accuracy of tarpmir we removed the seven new features and retrained random_forests in tarpmir compared with the original tarpmir with features the recall and precision of the modified tarpmir dropped and respectively we also compared the predicted true target_sites by different approaches supplementary_file s tarpmir had the largest number of predicted true sites shared by other tools however the percentage of shared true target_sites predicted by tarpmir was lower than that of other tools suggesting that tarpmircomplements existing_tools by predicting sites that cannot be predicted by other tools in fact there are non seed matching sites in the first clash test_dataset tarpmir was able to identify of those sites on the other hand miranda and targetscan were only able to predict and sites respectively this also suggested that the traditional tools like targetscan and miranda almost cannot predict non seedmatching binding_sites it is also worth mentioning that clash experiments may pick up direct and indirect mirna_target the argonaut proteins are guided by mirnas to bind mrnas which is referred to as mirna dependent recruitment and results in direct mirna_target there is also a mirna independent argonaut protein recruitment mechanism in which argonaut proteins are recruited to target_mrnas by proteinprotein_interaction with rna_binding and thus mirnas do not interact with the mrnas directly in the future one may want to distinguish these two types of target_sites from the clash experiments before training predictors for target_site prediction in this way we may also obtain better features and improve_the because of the existence of indirect target_sites in clash data the recall of tarpmir on the clash testing datasets may be underestimated in fact tarpmir had a much higher recall on the three independent human and mouse datasets suggesting that tarpmir may have a recall larger than on the other hand tarpmir had a much lower precision on the independent datasets which may be underestimated as well this was because we treated all segments other than the ccrs or identified mirna_target in these independent datasets as true negative target_sites which may not be the case by the time of this study only one clash dataset was publicly_available this human clash dataset was used to train tarpmir we applied tarpmir to human and mouse datasets and demonstrated that it works well on these datasets in the future with more clash datasets available more important mirna target_site features including tissue_specific features may be discovered and the accuracy of tarpmir especially its precision may be further improved
