computational discovery and in vivo validation of hnf as a regulatory_gene in planarian regeneration motivation automated computational_methods can infer dynamic regulatory_network models directly from temporal and spatial experimental_data such as genetic_perturbations and their resultant morphologies recently a computational_method was able to reverse_engineer the first mech anistic model of planarian regeneration that can recapitulate the main anteriorposterior patterning experiments published in the literature validating this comprehensive regulatory model via novel experiments that had not yet been performed would add in our understanding of the remarkable regeneration capacity of planarian worms and demonstrate the power of this automated methodology results using the michigan molecular_interactions and string databases and the mocha software_tool we characterized as hnf an unknown regulatory_gene predicted to exist by the reverse engineered dynamic_model of planarian regeneration then we used the dynamic_model to predict the morphological outcomes under different single and multiple knock downs rna_interference of hnf and its predicted gene pathway interactors b catenin and hh interestingly the model predicted that rnai of hnf would rescue the abnormal regenerated phenotype tailless of rnai of hh in amputated trunk fragments finally we validated these predictions in vivo by performing the same surgical and genetic experiments with planarian worms obtaining the same phenotypic outcomes predicted by the reverse engineered model conclusion these results suggest that hnf is a regulatory_gene in planarian regeneration validate the computational predictions of the reverse engineered dynamic_model and demonstrate the automated methodology for the discovery of novel genes pathways and experimental phenotypes planarian worms despite their complex morphology have the extraordinary ability to regenerate a complete body after almost any kind of amputation with the goal to unravel the mechanisms responsible for this outstanding regenerative_capacity a large dataset of experiments including surgical amputations genetic_perturbations and pharmacological_interventions and their resultant phenotypes have been reported in the literature and curated in the planform centralized database however due to the complex feed back loops and non linear interactions typical of biological regulatory_networks understanding how the wormhere we presented the computational discovery and in vivo validation of hnf as a regulatory_gene in planarian regeneration starting from the prediction of an unknown necessary gene from a reverse engineered dynamic_model we characterized it with the use of the mimi and string databases and the mocha tool then we used the reverse engineered dynamic_model to produce exact predictions of the regenerated morphologies when perturbing hnf and their regulatory interacting genes in the predicted pathway this in silico study revealed the ability of rnai of hnf to rescue the abnormal regenerated phenotype tailless due to the rnai of hh we then used an in vivo approach to validate at the bench all the predictions of the model using rnai to knock_down single and double genes involved in the pathway we performed similar surgical amputations and genetic knock downs rnai in planarian worms the results confirmed that rnai of hnf produced the wild_type morphology when applied alone but when combined with rnai of hh it rescued the tailless phenotype caused by rnai of hh alone a statistical_analysis further confirmed the significance of these results in summary these results show how the reverse engineered model remarkably predicted a non trivial regulatory_role of hnf in planarian regeneration the dynamic nature of the presented model explains in a mechanistic way the morphologies resulting from the different perturbations when both hh and hnf are knock_down the level of tail signal is naturally higher than the trunk signal that is the default outcome is tail when only hnf is knock_down the tail signal is even higher since hh enhances tail and the trunk signal stays the same than in the double knock_down so the wild_type morphology is still regenerated however when only hh is knock_down hnf is higher expressed since hh represses hnf which results in a higher signal of trunk since hnf enhances trunk and higher than tail which is also lower than the wild_type since hh enhances tail producing the no tail morphology finally with no knock downs the presence of hh produces higher signal of tail and reduces the signal of trunk since hh enhances tail and represses hnf which enhances trunk resulting in the wild_type morphology computational_approaches are indispensable for the construction of predictive_models of complex biological_phenomena and the understanding of their regulatory_networks these methods can automatically formulate mathematical_models that can recapitulate the observed phenotypes crucially these reverse engineered models can formulate testable_predictions including the prediction of novel regulatory_elements and experimental phenotypes here we validated the novel predictions of a comprehensive dynamic_model of planarian regeneration including the discovery of a novel regulatory_gene hnf and its capacity to rescue an abnormal phenotype the model accounts for the minimum set of interactors needed to explain the resultant head versus tail morphology from a comprehensive set of perturbation experiments in a future work we will validate the second unknown regulatory_gene predicted by the model which was preliminary characterized as the frizzled family of receptors further regulatory_elements are indeed needed to control other aspects of tail regeneration such as the specific round shape determination of tissue_types epithelium muscle nerves etc in the correct locations and the dorsalventral axis regulation adding perturbation experiments involving these elements to the input dataset will allow for the discovery of more detailed models by the reverse_engineering system extending the pathways presented here this work serves as a proof_of for a pipeline for converting models discovered by machine_learning into predictive hypotheses that can be tested at the bench to uncover novel biological_interactions interaction_databases such as mimi or string enable the characterization of unknown elements predicted by these models importantly the interaction confidence_scores included in these databases summarize the quality of the available evidence and can be used to rank candidate interactions being the ones with higher score the best candidate interactions to test at the bench this approach demonstrates the strength of automated reverseengineering methods for the discovery of predicted mechanistic_models of developmental and regenerative biology
