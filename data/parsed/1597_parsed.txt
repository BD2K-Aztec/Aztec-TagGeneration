epigenomic k_mer dictionaries shedding light on how sequence_composition influences in vivo nucleosome_positioning motivation information_theoretic and compositional_analysis of biological_sequences in terms of k_mer dictionaries has a well established role in genomic and proteomic_studies much less so in epigenomics although the role of k_mers in chromatin_organization and nucleosome_positioning is particularly relevant fundamental_questions concerning the informational content and compos itional structure of nucleosome favouring and disfavoring sequences with respect to their basic building_blocks still remain_open results we present the first analysis on the role of k_mers in the composition of nucleosome enriched and depleted genomic_regions ner and ndr for short that is i exhaustive and within the bounds dictated by the information_theoretic content of the sample_sets we use and ii informative for comparative epigenomics we analize four different organisms and we propose a paradig matic formalization of k_mer dictionaries providing two different and complementary views of the k_mers involved in ner and ndr the first extends well known studies in this area its comparative nature being its major merit the second very novel brings to light the rich variety of k_mers involved in influencing nucleosome_positioning for which an initial classification in terms of clusters is also provided although such a classification offers many insights the following deserves to be singled out short poly da dt tracts are reported in the literature as fundamental for nucleo some depletion however a global quantitative look reveals that their role is much less prominent than one would expect based on previous_studies availability_and dictionaries clusters and supplementary_material are available online atstudies investigating the information_theoretic content and composition in particular in terms of k_mers of sequences are pervasive in computational_biology however although it is well established that dna_sequence has a role in epigenomics there are very few studies that have systematically applied compositional and linguistic techniques for the identification of sequence_features associated with epigenomic functions they are reviewed by to the best of our knowledge no information_theoretic study is present in epigenomics we focus on the following particular research area in epigenomics the identification of mechanisms accounting for nucleosome_organization and positioning in chromatin it was initiated more than years_ago by kornberg and thanks to advances in microarray and sequencing_technologies it has prospered in the past_few an extensive overview of its many aspects is provided in particularly relevant for this paper are the findings outlined next the chromatin_organization of eukaryotic_genomes has been successfully argued that it is dna_encoded therefore it seems natural to complement such an argument with an information_theoretic study aiming at establishing the similarity and differences in terms of their information_theoretic content between ner and ndrs on a genomic_scale such a study is not available it is also a well established fact that sequence_motifs and regularities influence nucleosome_positioning the ones that have been identified are i the bp periodicity of the dinucleotides aa tt ta that oscillate in phase with each other and out of phase with a similar perodicity of the gc denuclotides ii poly da dt tracts i e stretches of as or ts and iii the g c content of a genomic_region with its a t content also playing some role in terms of specific k_mers studies about their role in favouring nucleosome_positioning have only identified a handful of them e g and no systematic study seems to be available the above state of the art clearly indicates that the literature has not addressed the following foundational issues an information_theoretic characterization of the ner and ndr highlighting similarities and differences a structural_characterization of the world of k_mers in terms of their involvement in the composition of genomic_sequences rich or depleted of nucleosomes with the possible identification of groups of similar k_mers that play a role in that composition we provide contributions to both issues in particular we present the first information_theoretic analysis of ner and ndr among the other useful insights it establishes that the information content of ner is surprisingly very close to that of ndr yet such a difference is statistically very significant as for the second issue we provide a computational and statistical methodology that is used to build epigenomic dictionaries for the case of nucleosome_positioning in vivo that is catalogues of k_mers each having a statistical score assessing to which extend it favours or inhibits nucleosome formation based on a sound information_theoretic argument kmers of at most basis are considered in this study interestingly k_mers that are known to favour or inhibit nucleosome_positioning from previous_studies are correctly_classified in our dictionaries and a rich never highlighted before variety of k_mers involved in nucleosome_positioning comes to light for the first time a final introductory remark is in order the only previous study of which this one can be seen as its natural continuation is the one by where in vivo data have been used we adhere to that choice here pointing out the need for a genome_wide analysis comparing k_mer preferences for nucleosome formation in vitro and in vivo the very discriminative and methodologically_sound techniques given here are a relevant technical step_forward for its successful realization whose outcome would add another important tile to the puzzle of sequences and nucleosomes
