data_and tissue aware data_integration approach for the inference of pathway interactions in metazoan organisms motivation leveraging the large compendium of genomic_data to predict biomedical pathways and specific mechanisms of protein interactions genome_wide in metazoan organisms has been challenging in contrast to unicellular organisms biological and technical variation originating from diverse tissues and cell_lineages is often the largest source of variation in metazoan data com pendia therefore a new computational strategy accounting for the tissue_heterogeneity in the functional genomic_data is needed to accurately translate the vast amount of human genomic_data into specific interaction level hypotheses results we developed an integrated scalable strategy for inferring multiple human gene interaction types that takes_advantage of data from diverse tissue and cell_lineage origins our approach specifically predicts both the presence of a functional association and also the most likely interaction type among human genes or its protein products on a whole genome_scale we demonstrate that directly incorporating tissue contextual_information improves the accuracy of our predictions and further that such genome_wide results can be used to significantly refine regulatory_interactions from primary experimental_datasets e g chip_seq mass_spectrometry availability_and an interactive website hosting all of our interaction predictions is publically available at http pathwaynet princeton edu software was implemented using the open_source sleipnir library which is available for download at https bitbucket org libsleipnir libthe molecular activity in a cellular system is maintained by a complex_interplay between genes gene_products metabolites and the environment in particular intricate biomolecular pathways are formed by a combination of diverse types of mechanistic pairwise interactions including physical binding in proteinprotein_complexes small moleculebased modifications and regulatory actions by activators and repressors mapping out these cellular_pathways at a whole_genome level is a crucial step forthe advancement of human systems_biology aiding at every level from deciphering cellular function to understanding the molecular cause of many complex human_diseases functional genomic_datasets such as gene_expression cellular_localization and dna protein binding_assays each captures distinct aspects of the cellular activity across multiple cell_types and perturbations however turning these different instances or views of a complex system into an understanding of pathways has proven to be a challenging undertaking especially in complex metazoan organisms such as humans tissue and cell_type expression underlie cellular development function and homeostasis consequently much of the biological and technical variation of the functional genomic_data is driven by tissue and cell_lineage heterogeneity translating the vast amount of genomic_data into specific pathway level hypotheses thus requires development of algorithmic and statistical_approaches that satisfy three requirements i inferring specific individual types of gene interactions ii being scalable to the whole_genome and iii robust in leveraging biological data from any of the diverse tissue contexts i e experimental_results drawn from differing tissues and potentially mixed_samples or samples from tissue_culture experiments in this work we developed a tissue context aggregation based_approach for predicting and studying multiple types of pathwaylevel gene interactions for metazoan mammalian organisms specifically applying this approach to the human data compendium for our approach we first built a catalog of tissue and interaction type specific gold_standards e g phosphorylation kinase substrate_interactions among brain expressed proteins restricted to gene_pairs coexpressed in any of tissues based on curated pathway_databases and gene to tissue expression_profiling we then utilize a support_vector svm to generate initial predictions of multiple gene interaction types independently in the context of each tissue i e utilizing the tissue_specific gold_standard by integrating heterogeneous human experimental_datasets e g mrna_expression transcription_factor tf and kinase motifs and post_translational finally we aggregate the tissue context based_predictions to obtain the most probable set of interaction labels or each gene_pair across the set of pathway level interaction types in this study we predict transcriptional_regulation co complex phosphorylation and the more general post_translational our methodology uniquely allows us to harness the wealth of information in high_throughput collections by simultaneously separating the heterogeneity originating from diverse tissues to improve signals for predicting different individual interaction types to our knowledge prediction of such genome_wide pathwaylevel interaction networks in metazoans is an open_problem many recent_studies have begun to address the challenges by inferring or experimentally capturing physical_interaction networks genetic_interaction networks bayesian integration for functional association networks or predicting regulatory_networks from specific primary datasets however most previous_efforts for predicting pathway interactions have been focused on unicellular model_organisms e g escherichia coli while genome_wide integrated analysis in mammalian organisms have been focused on cross_species integration for inferring multiple types of functional couplings e g co membership to metabolic_pathways signaling_pathways or proteinprotein_interactions ppi no prior integrative_method to our knowledge utilizes one of the most significant and important sources of biological_variation in human datasets tissue context although several tissue_specific datasets have been generated and analyzed in previous work we demonstrate that methodological development is required in addition to the inclusion of tissue_specific data to improve_the of integrated interaction predictions in metazoans our work extends the methodological advancements achieved studying pathway interactions among a focused subset of genes or in unicellular model_organisms and provides a platform for applying such methods to human data by addressing the challenge of tissue_heterogeneity ultimately we envision that our genome_wide interaction networks cannot only be useful to biology researchers investigating a specific protein or interactions of interest but also be leveraged to increase the interpretability of new high_throughput studies chip_seq proteomics disease samples etc that capture conditionspecific cellular_states as a proof_of we demonstrate the utility of our networks by overlaying our interaction networks to identify potential regulatory_targets of tfs on chip_seq experimental_datasets generated by the encode_project in addition we generated the first in vivo derived binding recognition motifs for cancer associated tank binding kinase tbk by integrating our predicted phosphorylation network with a recent tbk knockdown phospho proteomics study finally we provide a web_based interface for exploring all our interaction networks and integrative_analysis of user data at http pathwaynet princeton edu we demonstrate the advantage of incorporating tissue context for predicting multiple pathway level interaction types transcriptional_regulation co complex phosphorylation and the more general posttranslational regulation specifically we compare our tissue aware learning approach with a simpler version that does not use information about tissue_heterogeneity among human protein_coding i e tissue unaware learning in total we apply our tissue aware learning methodology integrating genome_scale experiments to generate whole_genome networks prioritizing gene protein interactions with strong supporting evidence for each of the predicted pathway level interaction types prediction schematic shown in we demonstrate the utility of our interaction networks in robustly retrieving pathway members across expert curated pathways in addition we show our interaction networks can be used to accurately identify false_positive regulatory_targets in primary user datasets generated by chip_seq and mass_spectrometry based phospho proteomics
