data_and shiny phyloseq web_application for interactive microbiome_analysis with provenance tracking we have created a shiny based web_application called shiny phyloseq for dynamic_interaction with microbiome data that runs on any modern web_browser and requires no programming increasing the accessibility and decreasing the entrance requirement to using phyloseq and related r tools along with a data and context aware dynamic interface for exploring the effects of parameter and method choices shiny phyloseq also records the complete user input and subsequent graphical results of a users session allowing the user to archive share and reproduce the sequence of steps that created their resultwithout writing any new code themselves availability_and shiny phyloseq is implemented entirely in the r language it can be hosted launched by any system with r installed including windows mac os and most linux distributions information_technology administrators can also host shiny phyloseq from a remote server in which case users need only have a web_browser installed shiny phyloseq is provided free of charge under a gpl open_source through github atanalysis of microbial_communities requires the interpretation of one or more high_dimensional abundance matrices and its relationship with other datasets using a complex and emerging suite of methods from ecology genetics phylogenetics multivariate statistics visualization and testing filtering custom curation and transformation of the abundance data are also required usually but the precisely reproducible workflow from raw_data to final analyses is often difficult or impossible to reproduce exactly ideally published scientific analyses are completely reproducible in as easy a fashion as possible and anything less represents an impediment to both progress and peer_review fortunately r is well suited for the analytical aspects of microbiome research with an interaction oriented functional programming design r development core that includes support for reproducible_research we recently described a software_package for the r language phyloseq dedicated to the object oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census_data one of the originally stated goals of phyloseq was to leverage r based resources for reproducible_research and thereby improve the reproducibility and portability of published microbiome analyses unfortunately for many microbiome researchers with classical training in biology learning a programming languageeven a functional interactive language like rhas proven to be a prohibitive investment of time and effort however most of the necessary computations are not only tractable by r but also fast enough for dynamic_interaction via a graphical_user gui here we describe our release of shiny phyloseq a web_browser gui that leverages phyloseq and other r resources for the analysis of microbiome census datawhile also allowing the user to archive the complete code and data necessary to exactly reproduce their session results although it is difficult for any single gui application to support the full range of analyses required in microbiome research shiny phyloseq provides a compelling framework and introduction to microbiome_analysis in r its modular opensource design encourages modification customization and code reuse there are other resources with gui elements available for the analysis of microbiome census_data including mg rast qiime and clovr to our knowledge there are no guis available for the analysis of microbiome census_data that also leverage the r programming_language ggplot and phyloseq while also providing a provenance record of a users session
