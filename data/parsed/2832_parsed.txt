structural_bioinformatics mdpocket open_source cavity detection and characterization on molecular_dynamics trajectories motivation a variety of pocket detection_algorithms are now freely or commercially_available to the scientific_community for the analysis of static protein_structures however since proteins are dynamic entities enhancing the capabilities of these programs for the straightforward detection and characterization of cavities taking_into protein conformational_ensembles should be valuable for capturing the plasticity of pockets and therefore allow gaining insight into structurefunction relationships results this article_describes a new method called mdpocket providing a fast free_and tool for tracking small_molecule binding_sites and gas migration pathways on molecular_dynamics mds trajectories or other conformational_ensembles mdpocket is based on the fpocket cavity detection algorithm and a valuable contribution to existing analysis tools the capabilities of mdpocket are illustrated for three relevant cases i the detection of transient subpockets using an ensemble of crystal_structures of hsp ii the detection of known xenon binding_sites and migration pathways in myoglobin and iii the identification of suitable pockets for molecular_docking in p map_kinase availability mdpocket is free_and and can be downloaded at http fpocket sourceforge net over the past_two a variety of algorithms have been proposed with the aim to identify binding_pockets for small_molecules in biomolecular targets these algorithms can be classified into three broad classes depending on the general method used for cavity detection i geometrybased ii energy based or iii sequence_based the first class relies on geometrical features of pockets with no or few to whom correspondence should be addressed considerations for the interaction_energy between a putative ligand and the pocket energy based_algorithms estimate the suitability of a pocket to bind a molecule using probepocket interaction_energy calculations the latter methods are usually computationally more expensive and require specific atom typing and the use of underlying force_fields sequence_based exploit the propensity of conserved_residues in the binding_site last various hybrid methods combining at least two of the previous_approaches also exist the reader is directed to recent_reviews for a detailed discussion of different cavity detection_algorithms the vast_majority of cavity detection_algorithms have been developed to treat static structures like crystal_structures of proteins available in the protein_data pdb however this represents a serious limitation to account for the intrinsic plasticity of the binding_pocket protein dynamics act on a multitude of aspects in protein_function for instance side chain flipping or domain motions can obstruct or free internal cavities or channels that allow migration of ligands and reshape the binding_sites in turn these findings raise challenging questions about the impact of protein_flexibility on the topological_features of cavities and their binding_properties few works have attempted to account for the dynamical behaviour of proteins in the identification of binding cavities and tunnels the interplay between protein dynamics and ligand migration pathways can be characterized by tools that rely on prior molecular_dynamics mds simulations and further post_processing of the trajectory voidoo allows internal cavity and volume calculations but it is rather time consuming and its use is not straightforward caver is a pymol plugin that allows internal channel detection on md trajectories caver was recently improved to a software called mole using computational geometry principles instead of grid based calculations more recently wolfson and coworkers have proposed a method called molaxis for detection of channels from the interior of the protein to the bulk_solvent these methods are designed to detect channels on static structures or conformational_ensembles of the protein in order to examine the suitability of internal pathways for ligand migration more time consuming techniques like implicit ligand sampling have been proposed glazer et_al have used mds for the identification of calcium binding_sites and have shown that the inclusion of dynamic behaviour can improve function prediction recently a matlab based approach_called dynamic map ensemble dyme has been proposed for the analysis of putative internal channels from md trajectories using voronoi tessellation and clustering techniques regarding the binding of ligands in cavities protein dynamics has been accounted for by using a set of privileged static structures which are chosen as representative conformational_states of the pocket based on experimental x_ray structures or from md_simulations of the target more recently eyrisch and helms established a protocol for the detection of transient cavities in proteinprotein_interfaces by using md_simulations and the cavity detection algorithm pass other approaches combine conformational_sampling and or selection from md_simulations to allow pocket adaptation to a given ligand positioned in the binding_site finally a distinct strategy has been adopted in pele as internal pockets and channels are identified based on localized perturbations that combine monte_carlo sampling and energy_minimization calculations to track and predict ligand migration pathways in this work a new generic pocket detection program called mdpocket is presented the aim of mdpocket is to identify and characterize binding_sites and channels that might be transiently formed in the protein from the analysis of conformational_ensembles generated by mds or other sources the core of this new program is the recently_published open_source platform fpocket le which is a very fast geometry based cavity detection algorithm the platform relies on three programs i fpocket which identifies cavities in a protein ii dpocket which extracts descriptors of the pocket and finally iii tpocket which allows assessment of pocket scoring_functions one main advantage of fpocket is its adaptability to a given problem initially_developed for the discovery of small_molecule binding_sites it can detect different types of cavities including very small pockets ligand_binding or even tunnels via a proper choice of parameters available through command_line mdpocket is fast and well suited for the study of processes where tracking of cavities is of interest in particular the capabilities of mdpocket are illustrated by examining i the plasticity of the hsp binding_site using a set of x_ray ii the analysis of xenon binding_sites and migration pathways in myoglobin mb and iii the selection of suitable docking sites for p asp phe gly dfg in binders the software is freely_available as part of the fpocket software_package and can be downloaded from http fpocket sourceforge net mdpocket is a new tool intended to facilitate the qualitative_and analysis of transient pockets and channels from conformational_ensembles that account for the intrinsic dynamics of proteins mdpocket is based on fpocket a general_purpose pocket detection program allowing adaptable fast free and reliable pocket detection the accuracy of pocket prediction is mainly limited by two factors i the grid based nature of mdpocket and ii the choice of parameters for filtering and clustering spheres as mdpocket uses a grid based_methodology the results can be affected by the necessary structural superimposition of the snapshots results derived for p map_kinase where the two domains exhibit large relative_motion with respect to each other show a dependence on the set of atoms used for alignment if the alignment is done using as reference one of the two subunits pocket detection and averaging during time will be altered for all pockets on the other subunit consequently pocket frequency and density on the second subunit are underestimated in such a case one should perform the structural_alignment on the cavity of interest the active_site in our case and bear in mind that pockets found on other places of the protein might not be representative of the whole trajectory the use of different parameter_sets for pocket detection can have a major influence on results here three parameter_sets have been assessed each addressing a given purpose for exploratory mdpocket runs probably water probe sized spheres parameter set are sufficient to give insights into the pocket behaviour during md trajectories however if the main aim is to explore internal pathways in the protein matrix parameter set is better suited this is illustrated by the analysis of the ns md_simulation of mb mdpocket was capable of identifying crystallographically known xe binding_pockets and infer putative connections between these binding_sites in agreement with the experimental_data furthermore mdpocket allows for identification of the hise migration pathway which is considered to be the main entry of diatomic ligands to the distal haem cavity exploration of binding_sites adapted for compounds i e drugs substrates larger than gaseous small_molecules can be simply made by changing the search parameters default parameter set this versatility is illustrated by simulating the docking of ligands to p map_kinase virtual screening_techniques often consider a rigid receptor conformation or at most a set of receptor conformations page
