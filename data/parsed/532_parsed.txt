systems_biology assigning spectrum specific p values to protein_identifications by mass_spectrometry motivation although many methods and statistical_approaches have been developed for protein identification by mass_spectrometry the problem of accurate assessment of statistical_significance of protein_identifications remains_an the main_issues are as follows i statistical_significance of inferring peptide from experimental mass_spectra must be platform independent and spectrum specific and ii individual spectrum matches at the peptide level must be combined into a single statistical measure at the protein level results we present a method and software to assign statistical_significance to protein_identifications from search_engines for mass_spectrometric the approach is based on asymptotic theory of order_statistics the parameters of the asymptotic distributions of identification scores are estimated for each spectrum individually the method relies on new unbiased estimators for parameters of extreme value distribution the estimated parameters are used to assign a spectrum specific p value to each peptide spectrum match the protein level confidence measure combines p values of peptide to spectrum matches conclusion we extensively tested the method using triplicate mouse and yeast high_throughput proteomic experiments the proposed statistical_approach improves the sensitivity of protein_identifications without compromising specificity while the method was primarily designed to work with mascot it is platform independent and is applicable to any search_engine which outputs a single score for a peptide spectrum match we demonstrate this by testing the method in conjunction with x tandem improvements in specificity sensitivity and throughput of protein_identifications progress at unprecedented pace however the scope of available mass_spectrometric and informatics technologies and divergence of their physicochemical and algorithmic bases contributes to growing concern regarding the reproducibility transparency and statistical reliability of the proteome_analysis in bottom up proteomics the identification proceeds via matching peptide ms_ms to a database of sequences the identity of proteins present in the sample is then inferred from individual peptide matches while many peptide_identifications are seemingly undisputed within any statistical_framework a large fraction of hits fall into borderline_significance range the ability to accurately assess_the of these identifications would increase specificity and sensitivity of mass_spectrometry analyses more importantly at the protein level a single estimate of statistical_significance should combine evidence from all tandem_mass matched to the same protein arbitrary conventions that are employed for maintaining protein identification consistency will be rendered unnecessary by such estimate at the peptide level current identification methods can be classified into false_discovery fdr approaches p value based_approaches and posterior_probability based_approaches fdrs are typically estimated by searches against a decoy_database e g a database of reversed and or randomized protein_sequences a threshold determining statistical_significance is selected specifically for a given dataset and a given peptide to spectrum scoring metric more sophisticated statistical_approaches involve simulations and analytical approximations however a single fdr threshold is applied to all spectra from the dataset therefore it is not informative about statistical_significance of individual matches and the estimate of the fdr threshold usually has a large variance specificity and sensitivity of identifications can be increased by stratifying peptide_spectrum psms using properties of spectra or peptide length in a statistical or machine_learning framework a number of recently_developed report p values specific to individual spectra these methods are primarily basedpage we tested the method using two proteomic_datasets obtained from in gel trypsin_digestion of i yeast and ii mouse_brain proteins analyzed with a thermo ltq ft mass_spectrometer see section the datasets represent highly complex_peptide from the two species to confirm that p values accurately estimate fraction of false_positive identifications we run searches in two sets of decoy databases p values corresponding to individual peptide or protein_identifications determined in one decoy_database set are plotted against the corresponding fractions of identifications in the other qq plot by the definition of p value the fraction of false_positive identifications estimated by the fraction of identifications in the decoy databases at a given p value should ideally be equal to this p value the qq plots are shown_inand in supplementary figures s and s as seen from the qq plots p values provide practically acceptable approximation of the rate of false_positive identifications i e predict fraction of decoy_database hits below a specified p value threshold for example the fraction of falsepositive identifications at p value threshold in the three mouse datasets is in the range of and in the yeast datasets of next p values generally discriminate between searches in the forward real and reverse decoy databases better than peptide ion scores assigned by mascot at the fdr threshold as determined by the search against the decoy_database selecting database hits by p value rather than by score increases the number of identifications in the forward real sequence database in addition we tested the performance of spectrumspecific p values using one other measure recommended by matrix science www matrixscience com pdf wkshp pdf shows the roc_curve when mascot ion score minus identity score is used as a discriminant_function similar to we find that ion minus identity score performs approximately equally well to ion score in discriminating true page positive versus false_positive hits spectrum specific p values outperform either combination of ion and identity scores to test whether spectrum specific p values indeed allow peptide_identifications with borderline ion scores we analyzed the distribution of reverse database hits with respect to both ion score and p values as seen from upper part the fraction of reverse database hits for scores in the range is approaching the fraction of forward database hits indicating that in this score range any forward hit is as likely to be true as false the fraction of reverse database hits for scores in the range compared with forward identifications is much smaller however it is still of the order of applying strict p value threshold eliminates almost all reverse database hits lower part and supplementary tables s and s while retaining significant number of forward database hits most of these forward hits were supported by at least two confident peptide_identifications from the same protein confirming that these forward hits are likely correct and supplementaryis another demonstration that identification by spectrum specific p values significantly_outperforms identification by mascot ion score we count the fraction of reverse database hits at fdr level obtained using mascot ion score but not by the fdr threshold if sorted by p value conversely we count the fraction of reverse database hits at the fdr level obtained by sorting database hits by p value but not by mascot ion score shows that the fraction of peptides passing only fdr cutoff is significantly_higher than the fraction of peptides passing only mascot score cutoff in all datasets results of the search according to p values leads to higher number of true_positive hits approximated by hits in the database of real protein_sequences per false_positive hit approximated by hits in the database of reversed protein_sequences selecting peptide_identifications by p value rather than score leads to increased sensitivity at any specificity threshold supplementary figs s and s in addition to the performance comparison with raw mascot scores we tested the fdrs obtained with our method against those obtained using peptideprophet peptideprophet source_code tpp v was downloaded from http proteinprophet sourceforge net for each of the three mouse and three yeast datasets we ran xinteract to identify psms in combined target plus reversed database supplementaryshows the comparison of fdrs for peptides identified with peptideprophet and using spectrum specific p values spectrum specific p values outperform peptideprophet by depending on the dataset at the protein level the use of p values combining evidence from multiple peptides increases sensitivity over a conventional method of protein identification based on the score of the best scoring peptide from the protein supplementary figs s s importantly the major increase in the number of truepositive identifications per false_positive identification increase in sensitivity at a given specificity level is observed at strict thresholds corresponding to low rate of false_positive identifications this means that spectrum specific p values confidently validate mediumscoring true_positives while efficiently suppressing high_scoring false_positives to exclude the possibility that these additional identifications in the forward database are false identifications we repeated the analysis limiting it to confidently identified proteins i e proteins with at least three matching peptides supplementary spectrum specific p values increase the number of these confidently true_positive identifications at any fdr cutoff to demonstrate generality and platform independence of our approach we applied spectrum specific p values to identifications made by x tandem platform supplementary_materials we computed peptide p values using parameters estimated from top hits according to x tandem hyperscore in searches against decoy databases these p values are shown to provide accurate rate of false_positive identifications as seen from qq plots supplementary discrimination between searches in forward and reverse databases by p values versus x tandem e values is shown in supplementary figures s and s we propose a method and software to assign statistical_significance to peptide and protein identification by mass_spectrometry a single probabilistic confidence measure p value is assigned to each identification this p value is spectrum specific and independent of instrumentation or software scoring_method the platform independence is achieved because the method makes very few assumptions about the distribution of the psm scores it is based on the asymptotic extreme value distribution the parameters of the extreme value distribution are estimated using newly obtained analytical unbiased_estimates
