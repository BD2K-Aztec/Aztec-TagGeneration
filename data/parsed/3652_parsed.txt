structural_bioinformatics predicting protein b sheet contacts using a maximum_entropy based correlated mutation measure motivation the problem of ab_initio is one of the most difficult in modern computational_biology the prediction of residue_contacts within a protein provides a more tractable immediate step recently_introduced maximum_entropy based correlated mutation measures cmms such as direct information have been successful in predicting residue_contacts however most correlated mutation studies focus on proteins that have large good quality multiple_sequence msa because the power of correlated mutation analysis falls as the size of the msa decreases however even with small autogenerated msas maximum_entropy based cmms contain information to make use of this information in this article we focus not on general residue_contacts but contacts between residues in sheets the strong constraints and prior_knowledge associated with contacts are ideally_suited for prediction using a method that incorporates an often noisy cmm results using contrastive divergence a statistical machine_learning we have calculated a maximum_entropy based cmm we have integrated this measure with a new probabilistic_model for contact_prediction which is used to predict both residue and strand level contacts using our model on a standard non redundant dataset we significantly_outperform a d recurrent neural_network architecture achieving a improvement in true_positives at the false_positive at the residue_level at the strand level our approach is competitive with the state of the art single methods achieving precision of and recall of while not requiring residue solvent_accessibility as an input availability the problem of ab_initio is one of the most difficult in modern computational_biology the prediction of residue_contacts within a protein provides a more tractable immediate step and these contacts can be used as a guide to generate the tertiary_structure of the protein correlated mutation cm methods first pioneered by valencia and colleagues take a multiple_sequence msa profile of evolutionarily_related proteins and attempt to predict residues that have co evolved if residues have co evolved this may imply proximity in the native_structure for example if a small residue increases in size by mutating a proximal residue may have to reduce in size to retain the viability of the fold many cm methods have been developed using pearson_correlation adaptions of mutual_information perturbation methods and dynamic_bayesian a recently_developed correlated mutation measure cmm the direct information is a global measure that is derived from modelling the entire msa specifically defining the probability of each sequence being a member of the msa this distribution shares the same low order moments as the msa and the maximum_entropy principle is used to fully specify the distribution have used this measure to successfully aid the folding of a diverse range of proteins however like the majority of cm studies these authors focused on a small number of proteins for which there is a large high_quality msa because all cmms suffer as the size of the msa decreases a key distinction of this work is that we focus on a wide selection of proteins that have a variety of sizes of msas we also automate the generation of msas and do not rely on a large high_quality msa being available in an attempt to improve the power of cm methods the dynamic_bayesian of burger and van nimwegen incorporates primary sequence distance into an informative prior for the model the incorporation of this knowledge substantially improves the results inspired by this we have chosen to predict the lateral pairs of residues in interacting strands contacts using a cmm contacts are associated with strong constraints for example sequential pairs of residues form contacts and residues can only be in contact with up to two other residues these constraints mean contacts are ideally_suited for prediction using a cmmthe noise associated with the cmm is compensated for by incorporating the strong contact constraints the prediction of contacts can be used to aid tertiary_structure explore energy_landscapes in designing proteins and understanding protein_folding pathways to whom correspondence should be addressed we highlight betapro the work of which uses a three stage method to predict topologies and was the first method to take into account the global nature of topologies firstly a d recurrent neural_network is used to generate a residue_level pairing map secondly a dynamic_programming is applied to this map to derive strand level pseudo binding_energies and finally a graph_matching algorithm is used to predict strand contacts there are a variety of other existing_methods for contact_prediction they include the use of statistical_potentials information_theoretic approaches integer linear optimization hybrid neural_network probabilistic_models and markov logic networks mlns in this article we have developed a global probabilistic_model for contact_prediction inspired by the secondary_structure models of schmidler which can be used to predict both residue and strand level interactions we have integrated this model with a cmm similar in nature to direct information and using this model on a standard dataset significantly_outperform the recurrent neural_network of betapro and are competitive with the best single methods currently available unlike these methods our approach does not require additional information such as residue solvent_accessibility to be entered as an input to the model in common with other methods we assume the native secondary_structure is known however our framework can be easily extended to predict both secondary_structure and contacts simultaneously and this is the focus of our current work
