structural_bioinformatics pywater a pymol plug in to find conserved_water in proteins by clustering conserved_water play_a in protein_structure stabilization of secondary_structure protein activity flexibility and ligand_binding clustering of water_molecules in superimposed protein_structures obtained by x_ray at high_resolution is an established method to identify consensus water_molecules in all known protein_structures of the same family pywater is an easy to use pymol plug in and identifies conserved_water in the protein_structure of interest pywater can be installed via the user_interface of pymol no programming or command_line knowledge is required for its use availability_and pywater and a tutorial are available at https github com hiteshpatel pywater pymol is available at http www pymol org or http sourceforge net_projects pymol water_molecules play_a in protein_structures their stabilization flexibility and activity one approach to finding conserved_water is to calculate energy_terms of the molecules in protein_structure models that can be achieved by energy_minimization molecular_dynamics simulations or quantum_mechanics grid determines energetically_favorable binding_sites for water_molecules rank uses the hint force_field and classifies water_molecules based on the number of hydrogen_bonds and their binding_strength these methods are precise and can be applied to a single available structure but they are computationally_expensive and only applicable for expert users if many crystal_structures are available for a protein conserved_water can be also determined via cluster_analysis and electron_density of existing crystal_structures the method waterscore uses a regression_analysis to establish a statistical_correlation between the structural_properties of water_molecules of a free protein crystal_structure compared with the ligand complexed form b os and pleiss predicted six conserved_water located at the loop in class a lactamases with the watch software and showed that these conserved_water reduce the flexibility of the loop b os and a similar approach has been used to identify and analyze the consensus water sites in thrombin and trypsin these highly_conserved water_molecules generally have more protein atom neighbors a more hydrophilic environment and hydrogen_bonds to the proteins making them less mobile major_histocompatibility mhc_class proteins have three highly_conserved water_molecules which are believed to be involved in stabilizing the twistedturn modulating peptide recognition and determining the position of n_terminal segment of the helix cluster_analysis of water_molecules in alanine racemase reveals the consensus water sites in the active_site and at the interface of two monomers where they play a structural role in maintaining and stabilizing the alanine racemase dimer by a similar method loris et_al identified conserved waters in a large family of microbial ribonucleases rnase t and in legume lectin crystal_structures using deuterium exchange mass_spectroscopy and molecular_dynamics simulations teze et_al predicted conserved_water channels to be probably involved in the function of family glycosidases as the importance of conserved_water is generally_accepted a simple and rapid tool for their identification in protein_structures is desirable before structural_bioinformatics studies are performed up to now two tools are available sanschagrin and kuhn presented a command_line called watch and c a bottoms et_al described a semiautomated method to identify_conserved solvent sites and studied conserved waters in six protein_families no other comprehensive open_source tools with a graphical_user gui are available for such kind of analyses here we present a tool pywater with an intuitive graphical_user that can be seamlessly integrated into pymol http sourceforge net_projects pymol including all important_steps that are crucial for identifying the conserved_water
