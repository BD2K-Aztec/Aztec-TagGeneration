side chain rotamer changes upon ligand_binding common crucial correlate with entropy and rearrange hydrogen_bonding motivation protein movements form a continuum from large domain rearrangements including folding and restructuring to side chain rotamer changes and small rearrangements understanding side chain flexibility upon binding is important to understand molecular recognition_events and predict ligand_binding methods in the present work we developed a well curated non redundant dataset of proteins in pairs of structures in the apo unbound and holo bound forms to study the extent and the factors that guide side chain rotamer changes upon binding results our analysis shows that side chain rotamer changes are widespread with only of binding_sites displaying no conformational changes overall at most five rotamer changes account for the observed movements in of the cases furthermore rotamer changes are essential in of flexible binding_sites the different amino_acids have a fold_difference in their probability to undergo changes side chain flexibility represents an intrinsic property of amino_acids as it correlates well with configurational entropy differences furthermore on average b factors and solvent accessible surface areas can discriminate flexible side_chains in the apo form finally there is a rearrangement of the hydrogen_bonding network upon binding primarily with a loss of h bonds with water_molecules and a gain of h bonds with protein residues for flexible residues interestingly only of side_chains capable of forming h bonds do so with the ligand upon binding in terms of drug_design this last result shows that there is a large number of potential interactions that may be exploited to modulate the specificity and sensitivity of inhibitors proteins bind small_molecules as substrates cofactors and allosteric regulators in order to perform essential cellular_functions as a consequence of induced_fit conformational selection or more likely a combination of both the ligand bound protein may display a wide gamut of structural changes these changes can range from large movements of entire domains to small side chain rearrangements in the binding_site it is widely_accepted that flexibility is essential for protein_function studying dynamic aspects of protein_structure using nuclear_magnetic to whom correspondence should be addressed spectroscopy for example is still sufficiently costly_and as to prevent its use in the same scale as x_ray x_ray produces a snapshot of a protein that offers little information on dynamic aspects of structure however it is possible to compare different snapshots to infer dynamic_properties of the protein for example one can compare two structures of the same protein crystalized in different conditions say in the bound holo and unbound apo forms although this type of comparison is neutral with respect to the mechanism of binding induced_fit or conformational selection it makes possible given the amount of available data to perform statistically_significant large_scale studies of conformational changes associated to ligand_binding understanding the factors that affect protein_flexibility has important practical_applications as efforts in trying to simulate flexibility even restricted to side chain movements have been limited so_far by the drastic increase in the size of the associated conformational search_space for example docking algorithms are an example in which the flexibility of the protein can have a drastic impact on the results as such any knowledge that can be applied to decrease in a sensible way the size of the search_space is advantageous our earlier study among the first statistical studies of side chain flexibility upon ligand_binding uncovered general_features regarding side chain rearrangements we used a dataset of paired x_ray structures of the same protein in bound and unbound forms comprising complexes representing different proteins we used a bullet dihedral_angle difference threshold to denote the occurrence of conformational changes using this definition we showed that up to three flexible residues account for the conformational changes observed in of all bindingsites studied and that different amino_acid types have different probabilities to be observed in conformationally different states upon binding more recently a study revisited the question of side chain flexibility upon binding measuring cartesian coordinate differences using an ensemble of complexes the authors measured root_mean differences rmsd of cartesian coordinates between atoms in the apo form and those in the holo form bound to all ligands necessary for the reaction at hand for example if an enzyme requires a cofactor or multiple substrates the holo form used for comparisons was that containing all such ligands present the authors calculated the rmsd between i all atoms in the superimposed structures ii atoms belonging to residues that bind the ligands or iii those implicated in catalysis as a control the authors calculated the rmsd between pairs of different apo form structures of the same
