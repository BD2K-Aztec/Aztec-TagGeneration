sequence_analysis accusa multi purpose snv calling enhanced by probabilistic integration of quality_scores direct comparisons of assembled short_read stacks are one way to identify single_nucleotide single_nucleotide detection is especially challenging across samples with different read_depths e g rna_seq and high background_levels e g selection experiments we present accusa to identify variant positions where nucleotide frequency_spectra differ between two samples to this end accusa integrates quality_scores for base_calling and read_mapping into a common framework our benchmarks demonstrate that accusa is superior to a state of the art snv caller in situations of diverging read_depths and reliably detects subtle differences among sample nucleotide frequency_spectra additionally we show that accusa is fast and robust against base quality_score deviations availability accusa is available free of charge to academic users and may be obtained from https bbc mdc berlin de
