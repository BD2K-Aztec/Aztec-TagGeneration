genotype_calling from next_generation data using haplotype_information of reads motivation low_coverage provides an economic strategy for whole_genome when sequencing a set of individuals genotype_calling can be challenging due to low sequencing_coverage linkage_disequilibrium ld based refinement of genotyping calling is essential to improve the accuracy current ld based_methods use read_counts or genotype likelihoods at individual potential polymorphic_sites ppss reads that span_multiple ppss jumping_reads can provide additional haplotype_information overlooked by current methods results in this article we introduce a new hidden_markov hmm_based method that can take into account jumping_reads information across adjacent ppss and implement it in the hapseq program our method extends the hmm in thunder and explicitly_models jumping_reads information as emission probabilities conditional on the states of adjacent ppss our simulation_results show that compared to thunder hapseq reduces the genotyping error_rate by from to the results from the genomes_project show that hapseq reduces the genotyping error_rate by and from and to and for individuals with european and african_ancestry respectively we expect our program can improve genotyping qualities of the large number of ongoing and planned whole_genome sequencing_projects contact recent_advances in array based genotyping technologies and the detailed catalog of genetic_variants from the hapmap project have enabled genome_wide gwas to successfully_identify hundreds of common_genetic that are associated with common human_diseases however majority of those common_variants only explain a small proportion of the estimated heritability of common diseases therefore efforts are turning to identify to whom correspondence should be addressed other factors including rare genetic_variants that may account for the missing_heritability of common diseases although arraybased genotyping technologies can genotype previously identified_variants they are ineffective to identify novel rare_variants across the human_genome recent_advances ngs technologies_provide an affordable way to capture both common and rare_variants effectively indeed low_coverage has already been adopted by the genomes_project aiming to establish an unprecedented comprehensive catalog of human genetic_variants in multiple_populations due to plummeting sequencing_costs whole_genome is becoming increasingly practically affordable in genetic_association of complex human_diseases where hundreds_or individuals are sequenced we predict that a flood of sequencing_data will soon be available for genetic researchers the meaningful analysis of ngs_data depends crucially on the accurate genotype_calling essentially ngs_technologies randomly fragment the whole_genome or targeted_regions of the genome for a number of individuals and generate short_reads typically bp in length which are then mapped back to a reference_genome often snp_calling refers to the identification of potential polymorphic_sites ppss while genotype_calling refers to the determination of actual genotype for each individual at each pps while these two tasks are not as clearly separated in sequencing based as in array based genotyping genotype_calling methods typically rely on a set of preliminary single_nucleotide snp calls and infer genotypes based on the counts and qualities of reads covering ppss carrying the reference and alternative alleles unlike array based genotyping technologies that read out image intensities at each site probed sequencing based genotyping_methods typically start with counts of reads carrying the reference allele or an alternative allele or an inferred genotype likelihood at each pps although the raw sequencing_error of individual_reads are about these errors can accumulate when we are looking at billions of positions across the genome moreover due to the randomly sampling nature of shotgun_sequencing some genomic_regions may be covered by very few reads or even no readsthis problem is especially severe when dealing with low_coverage data several methods have been developed for genotyping calling early methods generally consider the counts at each pps for each individual separately thus ignoring the linkage_disequilibrium ld between nearby ppss it has been shown that such methods work well with high_coverage data but have lower power and higher_error for low coverage data for example reported an accuracy of with coverage le and durbin applied samtools to samples of coverage and found that the genotype error_rate can be as high as for heterozygous sites therefore newer_methods that utilize the ld among nearby ppss are developed although the specific models used in ld based_methods for genotype_calling from ngs_data are different their underlying principle is the same short segments of chromosome haplotypes are shared among individuals due to the ld so the genotype at nearby ppss can be used to infer genotypes at the pps of interest ld based_methods achieve high_accuracy for genotype_calling with low_coverage data reported that their hidden_markov hmm implemented in thunder has an accuracy of for genotype_calling with coverage data compared the gatk unified genotyper and the ld based method beagle and found that the use of ld_information greatly_improved the accuracy for genotype_calling beagle has an accuracy of whereas gatk has an accuracy of for high call rates an important piece of source of haplotype_information is ignored by existing ld based genotype_calling methods the haplotype_information within individual_reads for example we observe a read having allele a at the pps j and b at the pps j we know that one of haplotypes of that individual is likely to be ab across ppss j and j existing_methods essentially break the haplotype_information of multiple ppss covered by a single_read and only use counts observed at each pps separately one may argue that most ngs_technologies generate short_reads and thus it is unlikely that a read will span more than one pps and thus haplotypes within individual_reads may not offer much information we have the following reasons supporting the use of such haplotype_information first with the rapid advances of ngs_technologies new version of these technologies can generate longer_reads thus the haplotype_information provided by these reads can be substantial and used to improve the accuracy for genotype_calling second many new ngs_technologies can generate paired_end which means both ends of a dna_segment are sequenced apparently paired_end provide the long_range haplotype_information over ppss third although the density of true polymorphic_sites may not be high genotype_calling will be working on a set of ppss made by a preliminary snp caller that may contain false_positives i e falsely reported ppss that are actually monomorphic haplotype_information in reads covering more than one pps will be useful for genotype_calling in this work we introduce a new hmm that extends the thunder hmm ofto incorporate such haplotype_information in reads that cover two or more adjacent ppss we derive probability calculations to have similar computational_efficiency as thunder we compare our method with thunder through extensive simulations and real sequencing_data from the genomes_project our simulation and real_data show that our method outperforms the thunder method in terms of accuracy for genotyping calling in many practical settings of sequencing_experiments the meaningful analysis of low_coverage data relies critically on the accurate genotype_calling we have developed an ld based method and implemented an efficient algorithm for genotype_calling that can incorporate the haplotype_information from reads that cover two adjacent ppss our method is based on the hmm implemented in mach and thunder thus shares many advantages with the original method more importantly our method uses the haplotype_information of jumping_reads that cover two adjacent ppss and explicitly_models such haplotype_information as emission probabilities from states at two adjacent sites our studies from simulated and the genomes_project data show that the use of haplotype_information of jumping_reads indeed improves the accuracy of genotype_calling for simulated_data thunder has an average_accuracy of while hapseq can reduce the error_rate by about with an average_accuracy of for the results from the genomes_project pilot_data hapseq reduces the genotyping error_rate by and from and to and for the ceu and yri individuals respectively this improvement will have significant impact to the extraordinary large_scale population sequencing_efforts that are currently ongoing or planned for example the genomes_project low coverage pilot sequenced yri individuals at and identified over m snps sites using our method we expect to correct about m yri genotype_calls made by thunder this improvement will likely to have an even greater impact for the full scale phase of the genomes projects and numerous other population sequencing_projects the performance_gain of hapseq over thunder is brought by the use of haplotype_information in jumping_reads from our simulations the percentage of ppss covered by jumping_reads ranges from to the percentage of sites in the genomes_project low coverage pilot projects covered by jumping_reads is and for the ceu and yri individuals respectively however one may argue that a jumping read is only informative if it covers two heterozygote sites of an individual thus the prevalence of informative jumping_reads is much lower if genotypes are already known only jumping_reads of an individual that cover two heterozygote sites are informative however genotypes are unknown for the ngs_data and are the very purpose of genotype_calling even we only observed the counts of one allele at a pps for an individual the genotype at that site for that individual could still be heterozygote therefore any haplotype from jumping_reads is potentially informative and can be used to improve overall accuracy of genotype_calling indeed we performed a simulation to only include jumping_reads at two heterozygote sites with a subset of simulation_settings here a heterozygote site of an individual refers to a site that both alleles are observed from the counts data of that individual from the results in supplementary table s we found that across eight simulation_settings hapseq using all jumping_reads has the smallest genotypic discordance rate of whereas hapseq using only jumping_reads at two adjacent heterozygote sites and thunder have a genotypic discordance rate of and receptively these results suggest that all jumping_reads should be included in the analysis to improve genotype_calling the use of haplotype_information of jumping_reads from two adjacent ppss in hapseq brings additional computational_cost to investigate the computational_complexity of the hmm in thunder and hapseq we recorded the running time of thunder and hapseq on a linux server with amd opteron ghz cpus and gb ram supplementary hapseq has similar computational_complexity as thunder o k s where k is the number of samples and s is the number of ppss supplementary although hapseq has additional computational time for those ppss covered by jumping_reads our data confirmed that the running time of hapseq is about three times of the running time of thunder when the percentage of those ppss covered by jumping_reads is high supplementary for hapseq only haplotype_information of jumping_reads from two adjacent ppss are considered longer_reads can cover more than two adjacent ppss thus provide haplotype_information over
