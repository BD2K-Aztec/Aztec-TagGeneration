systems_biology predicting protein_phosphorylation from gene_expression top methods from the improver species translation challenge motivation using gene_expression to infer changes in protein phos phorylation levels induced in cells by various stimuli is an outstanding problem the intra species protein_phosphorylation challenge organized by the improver consortium provided the framework to identify the best approaches to address_this results rat_lung epithelial_cells were treated with stimuli and gene_expression and phosphorylation levels were measured competing teams used gene_expression data from stimuli to develop protein_phosphorylation prediction_models and were ranked based on prediction_performance for the remaining stimuli three teams were tied in first place in this challenge achieving a balanced accuracy of about indicating that gene_expression is only moderately predictive of protein_phosphorylation in spite of the similar performance the approaches used by these three teams described in detail in this article were different with the average number of predictor genes per phosphoprotein used by the teams ranging from to however a significant_overlap of gene_signatures between teams was observed for the majority of the proteins considered while kyoto_encyclopedia kegg_pathways were enriched in the union of the predictor genes of the three teams for multiple proteins availability_and gene_expression and protein phos phorylation data are available from arrayexpress e mtab software implementation of the approach of teams and are available atinferring biological_mechanisms and pathways from high_throughput in vitro and or in vivo experimental_data remains an outstanding problem to address_this in detail one would need to measure messenger_rna at multiple time points and have information on the methylation states of genes knowledge of transcriptional_regulation and histone_modifications information on copy_number and mutational_status of genes and regulatory_regions given the difficulty and prohibitive cost of performing such experiments such detailed knowledge and data are likely to remain unavailable for some time the problem is further confounded by the complexity of cellular_responses to variations in their environment regulatory feedback_mechanisms and varieties of organspecific time scales and tolerances consequently bioinformatics studies need to develop methods and stochastic probabilistic bayesian approaches to understand biological_phenomena from insufficient data and limited knowledge one goal of such studies is to predict the likelihood that given the data some particular sets of proteins or pathways are activated an even more difficult problem in this context is to assess the degree to which the results of such predictions in one species are relevant to another species this understanding is critical if we are to accurately translate data from experiments_conducted on model species such as mice and rats to humans this article_describes the methods and results of three teams that were tied in first place in the systems_biology verification improver sub challenge sc intra species protein_phosphorylation prediction sc assessed the degree to which gene_expression data could be predictive of changes in protein_phosphorylation in rat_lung epithelial_cells and hence provided a baseline performance for the next challenge sub challenge sc which dealt with protein_phosphorylation translation from rat to human for lung_epithelial under a variety of stimuli phosphorylation levels were measured at and min after cells were exposed to of stimuli to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as and gene_expression levels were measured h after such exposure measurements in untreated cells were also available in each experimental batch differences in gene_expression levels between treated and control cells were expected to be the result of upstream signaling_events driven by active phosphorylation cascades in treated cells hence the sc sought to determine_whether changes in gene_expression levels were sufficiently informative to infer the molecular modifications observed upstream in particular the phosphorylation status of effector_proteins it was expected by the organizers of the competition that data derived from this challenge might be informative not only for the remaining sub challenges but also provide information to understand i intra species mechanisms operative when lung_epithelial are treated to a variety of stimuli ii the relationship between these two layers of signaling_responses and iii the degree of cross_platform translatability between the two measurement technologies animal_models are often used in biomedical_research for testing the effect of various stimuli e g drugs before considering them for testing in humans the general assumption is that biological_processes in animals e g mice or rats are similar to biological_processes in humans under analogous conditions however few studies have addressed the limitation on which biological_events observed in rodents can be translated to humans for instance gene expression_level changes in murine and human models were not at all correlated in peripheral_blood as a response to inflammatory injuries such as burns blunt force trauma as well as to endotoxin in human patients and in mice the species translation challenge comprising four sub challenges was developed to systematically assess translatability of protein_phosphorylation and pathway activation in response to a range of stimuli the aim of the first sub challenge the intra species protein_phosphorylation prediction sub challenge was to assess whether downstream in time gene_expression data are sufficiently informative to infer protein_phosphorylation status of some key signaling_molecules and provide a baseline performance expectation for the translation from rat to human three teams ranked first in this challenge based on the fact that their performance was not distinguishable by the prespecified ranking methodology the performance of these three teams was also significantly better than any one of the remaining teams as determined using a rank stability analysis the prediction_performance results of these top_ranked teams suggest that a snapshot of the transcriptomic activity in rat epithelial_cells contains a moderate level of information regarding protein_phosphorylation levels with the average sensitivity_and being about improved_performance might be obtained if the gene_expression data were collected at multiple time points following treatment to capture important time dependent effects non linearity and multi node cooperation in geneprotein interactions in this article we have described in detail the approaches of the three teams tied for first place in this sub challenge each team used a different method to select predictor genes namely ranking genes by moderated t test p values between classes and choosing a handful of the top ones team using mi between each gene and the outcome and performing dimensionality_reduction via pca team and performing gene ranking by ridge_regression team a large variation in the number of predictor genes was observed for each given protein from one team to the next with the most parsimonious approach team using on average less than four predictor genes moreover the types of models used to make predictions based on the selected genes were also very different among teams team used an lda model team used a voting procedure which combined the predictions from a method based on mi with one based on an lda model trained on principal_components team results were based on svr with rbf kernels however an important aspect of the model development was common among the three teams namely that the optimalnumber of predictors used was automatically determined based on cross_validated model performance even though the specific performance_metrics used were different this element was also in common among the best and third best teams in the improver diagnostic signature challenge despite the very different prediction_approaches and gene_signatures the performance results of these three teams were very similar the main reasons for this were i a redundancy in the gene_signatures of teams and and ii strong correlations between predictor genes selected by different teams as suggested by although an analysis of the overlap of predictor genes found more common genes than expected by chance among the three teams this analysis did not account for extra overlap that could have occurred simply by modeling the noise in the data i e when the phosphorylation status of proteins were randomly_assigned to the different training_stimuli another common aspect among the approaches described herein is the fact that they used only information from the training data to make inference on the phosphorylation status of the proteins after treatment with stimuli in the test_set alternative_approaches could have relied at least in part on prior_knowledge regarding the target_genes of the proteins under the study the top three teams considered that an unbiased approach in which all genes are treated as potential candidates for being informative of the phosphorylation status of a given protein would have a better chance to maximize prediction_performance than relying on the literature evidence of potential gene_targets for each protein moreover these data_driven methodologies can be applied to proteins for which no potential targets are available a kegg_pathway enrichment_analysis on the union of predictor genes from the three teams was done to determine_whether biological_pathways are activated for each of the phosphorylation proteins we found that five proteins have at least one enriched pathway false_discovery of the results are presented in the supplementary this analysis found also that almost half of the predictive genes associated with fak and ptn activity are related to metabolism pathways this should not be surprising because metabolism is a fundamental_process that the cell regulates in response to any stress however it suggests that genes related to metabolism may be the best predictors of phosphorylation activity for ptn we also found activation of four gene_sets which are related to signaling in cancer similarly for mk k two cancer related pathways show some evidence of enrichment although not significant after adjustment for multiple testing this is consistent with the role of mk k in cancer signaling and in particular p activation for ikba we found that many enriched pathways are related either to metabolism or to the function of ikba as a key_regulator of the immune_response nuclear_factor kappa_light enhancer of activated b cells nfkb pathway a limitation of this analysis is that the predictor genes of the most two parsimonious approaches teams and have limited or no contribution respectively to the pathway enrichment results as the union of predictor genes for each protein is dominated by genes selected by team in summary the intra species protein_phosphorylation prediction sub challenge of the improver species translation challenge was designed to identify the extent to which it is possible to predict upstream protein_phosphorylation effects from a snapshot of downstream transcription activity this crowdsourcing initiative identified three approaches described in detail herein that were ranked best among participating teams two of these three approaches teams and were also applied successfully in the inter_species protein_phosphorylation prediction sc and therefore sc represented a case study for the different teams to tune their approaches for sc
