semantic body browser graphical exploration of an organism and spatially_resolved expression data visualization advancing technologies generate large_amounts of molecular and phenotypic_data on cells tissues and organisms leading to an ever growing detail and complexity while information_retrieval and analysis becomes increasingly time consuming the semantic body browser is a web_application for intuitively exploring the body of an organism from the organ to the subcellular_level and visualising expression_profiles by means of semantically annotated anatomical illustrations it is used to comprehend biological and medical data related to the different body structures while relying on the strong pattern_recognition capabilities of human users availability_and the semantic body browser is a javascript web_application that is freely_available attechnological innovations of the last decades have revolutionized current bio medical_research high_throughput sequence_data is widely_adopted and repositories like gene_expression or arrayexpress provide access to large_amounts of expression data imaging and functional analysis tools improve phenotypic cell and tissue_characterization while text_mining facilitates big_data applications with increasing importance in current research thus scientists and clinicians are faced with an ever growing detail and complexity resulting in an increasing amount of time and resources that are needed to retrieve and process the right information which constitutes one of the major_obstacles for their efficient use most data resources provide text_based information_retrieval only meaning that the user searches for keywords of a desired target while this is sufficient when the target is known by name it often fails or is time consuming when the exact target name is unknown similarly large tables of numbers are suitable for computational_analysis but require expert_knowledge and time to be analysed manually while graphs or diagrams can greatly summarize numbers concepts or other data their representation remains abstract and does not close the gap between complexity of data and intuitiveness of access in biomedical_research reality it is highly_desirable to have quick and intuitive access to a broad range of information and data types which cannot easily comprehend by conventional_means the semantic body browser sbb exploits the visual pattern_recognition capability of human users to provide this access the sbb uses the anatomy of an organisms body itself as starting_point to browse for information associated with organs tissues cells or cellular_structures besides very fundamental computer skills no preknowledge is required to use the sbb the representation of data is facilitated by means of interactive annotated anatomical illustrations through a user_friendly web_application for fast access to upto date computationally derived data an organism is explored along the four dimensions resolution location gross body to subcellular_level developmental_stage e g carnegie stages species e g human and mouse and gender male_and to our knowledge the sbb is the first web_based for browsing and searching large sets of diverse biological_information guided by interactive anatomical illustrations that integrate different levels of resolution developmental_stages gender and species the two_dimensional d representation of an organisms anatomy using vector_graphics facilitates high_accuracy dynamic interactions and element wise ontological annotations while maintaining simplicity and usability across a wide_range of devices existing d representations like bodyparts d zygote body http zygotebody com or the worm browser http browser openworm org conversely emphasize on graphical_representation of the organisms gross_anatomy rather than on exploration across many different dimensions to summarize the sbb is an intuitive user_friendly web_application for graphically browsing an organisms body for cell and tissue associated data it is meant to enhance the information_retrieval and visualization of biological data without requiring computational background_knowledge
