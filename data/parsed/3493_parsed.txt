gene_expression pepc proteomics software for identifying differentially_expressed based on spectral_counting identifying biologically_significant changes in protein_abundance between two conditions is a key issue when analyzing proteomic_data one widely used approach centers on spectral_counting a label_free method that sums all the tandem_mass for a protein observed in an analysis to assess the significance of the results we recently combined the t test and g test with random permutation analysis and we validated this approach biochemically to automate the statistical_method we developed pepc a software_program that balances the trade_off between the number of differentially_expressed identified and the false_discovery this tool can be applied to a wide_range of proteomic_datasets making data analysis rapid reproducible and easily_interpretable by proteomics specialists and non specialists alike two important objectives of proteomicsglobal assessment of protein expression levels and biomarker discoverydepend critically on measuring relative protein_abundance mass_spectrometry ms has emerged as the leading technology for this purpose because it is easily applied to high_throughput analyses and provides broad coverage of the proteome a potential limitation is that results are generally semiquantitative isotope labeling of peptides has been developed to circumvent this problem labeling methods are expensive and limited in the number of samples that can be coordinately interrogated making application to samples from large_scale clinical studies difficult spectral_counting and peptide ion intensity are alternative label_free methods for quantifying relative protein_abundance spectral_counting sums all ms_ms observed for to whom correspondence should be addressed peptides derived from a single protein because abundant proteins are more likely to be identified during data dependent ms_ms scanning spectral_counting has the potential to quantify protein levels indeed studies have shown strong correlations between relative protein_abundance as assessed by peptide ion intensities and spectral_counting more recent_studies that the accuracy of spectral_counting can be improved by normalization_methods such as correction for sampling depth protein molecular_weight or number of tryptic_peptides expected reviewed in a variety of statistical_approaches have been developed to assess differences in spectral counts however a key issue is correcting for multiple_comparisons overly stringent significance cutoffs identify few differentially_expressed while looser criteria identify more proteins at the expense of increased false_discovery fdrs therefore the development of rigorous_statistical strategies that maximize the identification of significant differences in protein expression while minimizing the fdr is of critical importance in proteomics we recently_developed a novel method for identifying statistically_significant differences in protein_abundance based on spectral_counting and validated our results biochemically we then used this approach to identify an atherogenic protein network in macrophages in this application note we describe freely_accessible software pepc for automating our approach pepc is a tool for identifying differentially_expressed based on spectral count measurements in ms_ms studies input_data for the program can be i protxml files that are introduced directly in tpp or ii spreadsheets in csv file_format corresponding to spectral counts extracted from protxml files we recommend the latter as it allows the user to curate protxml files to minimize problems associated with detecting multiple identifiers for the same protein e g international protein index moreover it enables implementation of spectral_counting normalization_methods prior to data analysis with pepc after the data are uploaded pepc calculates the g statistic g test and p value t test for each protein in the biological comparison group a versus b and in the randomly permuted data these measurements are subsequently used to quantify the number of proteins identified presented as a heatmap and the fdr at each combination of confidence_intervals using the slider control or max fdr dialog box the user sets the maximum fdr desired pepc eliminates significance cutoffs with fdrs that exceed this value and resets the heatmap to display the combination of g statistic and p value that yields the maximal number of differentially_expressed colored yellow in this manner the user can monitor the trade_off between the number of proteins identified and the fdr proteins that pass the chosen significance criteria are listed in the bottom panel along with their respective average spectral counts and statistical parameters
