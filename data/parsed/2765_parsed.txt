databases_and m sg mapping human disease related genetic_variants to protein_sequences and genomic_loci online_mendelian omim is a manually_curated compendium of human genetic_variants and the corresponding phenotypes mostly human_diseases instead of directly documenting the native sequences for gene entries omim links its entries to protein and dna_sequences in other databases however because of the existence of gene isoforms and errors in omim records mapping a specific omim mutation to its corresponding protein_sequence is not trivial combining computer programs and extensive manual_curation of omim full text descriptions and original literature we mapped of omim amino_acid aass and all swissprot variant swissvar disease related aass to reference_sequences and confidently mapped of all aass to the gen_omic loci based on the results we developed an online database and interactive web_server m sg to i retrieve the mapped omim and swissvar variants for a given protein_sequence and ii obtain related proteins and mutations for an input disease phenotype this database will be useful for analyzing sequences understanding the effect of mutations identifying important genetic_variations and designing experiments on a protein of interest availability_and the database and web_server are freely_available atonline mendelian_inheritance in man omim consists of full text overviews of phenotypes especially human_diseases and the corresponding genetic_variants including substitutions deletions insertions and intervening sequences the information in omim is derived from literature and documented manually by human curators omim is a valuable database to associate phenotypes and human_diseases with particular genes however it is not a reliable resource to assign these phenotypes to certain mutations in the corresponding proteins a previous_report suggested that of amino_acid aass in omim cannot be mapped to the canonical sequences in swissprot i e either the mutation position or the residue type is inconsistent with the swissprot sequence this discrepancy mainly results from omim mutations being derived from literature where authors report different gene isoforms in addition errors in the manual omim records are another obstacle for confident mapping previous_studies attempted to map the omim aass onto swissprot sequences however the mutations that cannot be confidently mapped were simply excluded or ignored in martin designed an automated procedure to maintain a validated mapping between omim aass and swissprot entries however the performance was not sufficient in all of all the entries fall into their class c meaning not all the associated mutations could be mapped in addition the simple offset approach they applied could cause a considerable rate of false_positives combining automatic tools and manual_curation we mapped of omim aass and all disease related genetic_variants in swissprot variant swissvar to swissprot reference_sequences rss and compiled a database m sg mapping mutations to sequence and gene a detailed comparison between our work and previous_studies is in supplementary in all of these mutations are mapped to the genomic_loci and can be attributed to either single_nucleotide snps in dbsnp database or putative snps which validated our mapping at the protein level in addition we provide a userfriendly interface to search the database with various queries we expect it to be a useful resource for understanding the effects of mutations and experimental work on the disease_related we mapped of omim aass and the number of mutations mapped by each method is shown in although the majority of omim mutations can be confidently mapped by computer programs manual_curation was applied to a considerable portion a small portion of omim mutations could not be mapped due to the lack of evidence even in the cited literature supplementary or missing crosslinks between omim and swissprot entries to make the mutations consistent with the rs out of omim mutation records were modified most of these modifications involved a shift in the residue number and corrected other omim annotation errors supplementary the current m sg database includes aass from omim entries and disease related aass from proteins in swissvar omim and swissvar aass overlap partially and our mapping revealed redundant aass in omim resulting in a total of proteins with aass interestingly out of functionally neutral mutations in swissvar are disease_causing according to omim supplementary indicating possible errors in either database in all of the mutations in m sg are mapped to the genomic_loci and can be attributed to either snps in the dbsnp or other single nucleotide changes in the genomic_loci which validated mutations in m sg in contrast original omim mutation records yielded a failure_rate for this genomic_loci and snp mapping our results are presented as an online database with a userfriendly interface the database can be queried by protein_sequence original omim entry number uniprot accession_number protein name gene name or disease phenotype supplementary the returned web_page contains the most relevant protein and correctly mapped mutations supplementary
