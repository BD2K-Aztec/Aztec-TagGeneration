integrative random_forest for gene_regulatory motivation gene_regulatory grn_inference based on genomic_data is one of the most actively pursued computational biological_problems because different types of biological data usually provide_complementary regarding the underlying grn a model that integrates big_data of diverse types is expected to increase both the power and accuracy of grn_inference towards this goal we propose a novel algorithm named irafnet integrative random_forest for gene_regulatory results irafnet is a flexible unified integrative framework that allows information from heterogeneous data such as proteinprotein_interactions transcription_factor tf dna_binding gene knock_down to be jointly considered for grn_inference using test data from the dream and dream challenges we demonstrate that irafnet outperforms the original random_forest based network_inference algorithm genie and is highly comparable to the community learning approach we apply irafnet to construct grn in saccharomyces_cerevisiae and demonstrate that it improves the performance in predicting tf target_gene regulations and provides additional functional insights to the predicted gene regulations availability_and the r code of irafnet implementation and a tutorial are available atunderstanding the complex gene_regulatory grn has an important role in current biomedical_research with the advent_of technologies such as transcriptomic and proteomic_profiling computational inference of grn at genome_scale are feasible and a large number of models have emerged common challenges exist for inferring grns including the non linearity of regulatory_relationships among genes the incompleteness and noisiness characterizing genomic_data the presence of relatively fewer samples compared with the number of genes the large p small n problem therefore successful grn_inference algorithms need to be sensitive to capture the non linearity among genes robust to avoid over fitting and resilient to the limited number of samples among the various approaches developed so_far random_forest has emerged as a strong player as an ensemble learning algorithm random_forest performs extensive bootstrap sampling and random feature_selection and relies on combining the outputs from a collection of non linear learners to derive the final model such practice allows the delivery of excellent_performance with moderate sample_size requirement random_forest has been used as an efficient and flexible tool to predict disease_phenotypes and its utility has been demonstrated in a variety of biological_applications introduced genie a random_forest based algorithm for the construction of grn the performance of genie was evaluated on the dream in silico size challenge the dream in silico multifactorial challenge and the dream network_inference challenge in particular genie was the best performer in both the dream in silico multifactorial challenge and dream network_inference challenge in order to better capture the direction of regulatory_relationships proposed a random_forest based algorithm which infers grn from time series data in particular they demonstrated the superior_performance of their algorithm over other existing_methods such as dynamic_bayesian and ordinary_differential models although being very successful these random_forest based models derive grn from a single data type namely the gene_expression data there is no direct way to integrate_multiple genomics data such as proteinprotein_interactions and expression from perturbation experiments in current implementations the importance of integrating_multiple genomics information has been well recognized by the research_community one reason of doing so is that different data types usually provide non redundant information about regulatory_relationships e g proteinprotein_interactions are particularly informative for the topological_structure of the network and the functions of neighboring genes while gene_expressions from perturbation and time series experiments often provide more insights on the directionality or the causality of regulatory_relationships multiple integrative_models have been developed so_far such as bayesian_networks models sparse structural_equation and consensus techniques the limitations of many existing_methods are the linearity and normality assumptions often made on gene regulations for example due to the computational_complexity of the models gene dependence_structure is often approximated via a linear_regression which may not perform well under the presence of higher_order interactions in the data on the other hand algorithms making no assumption on the linearity or normality can easily become computationally_intractable when the number of genes significantly increases and therefore their applicability is limited to the construction of relatively small networks in this article we propose irafneta new algorithm in which different data types are integrated under a unified random_forest framework the key idea of irafnet is to introduce a weighted sampling scheme within random_forest to incorporate information from other source of data specifically the model considers the expression of each gene as a function of the expression of other genes for each node in the tree ensemble instead of randomly sampling n genes from the entire gene_set as done by genie irafnet samples genes the potential_regulators according to the information provided by other data such as proteinprotein_interactions or expression data from perturbation experiments so that genes supported by other data as potential_regulators will be favorably sampled by doing so information embedded in other datasets is integrated into the network construction while the effective search_space of potential_regulators is significantly_reduced to demonstrate the advantage of integrating_multiple data in the construction of grn we consider synthetic data from the dream and the dream challenges which have been used as gold test data_sets for objectively comparing the performance of various grn_inference models we show that irafnet performs better than previous_models in most considerations as a real_data application we apply irafnet to the inference of yeast grn by integrating_multiple public data_sets we show that our new approach has an improved_performance in predicting transcription_factor tf regulations and it also provides additional functional insights to the predicted gene regulations in this article we develop irafnet a unified_framework based on random_forest which constructs grns by integrating information from multiple data types specifically information from different data_sources is used to derive a series of weights which then are utilized for sampling potential_regulators during the tree construction this weighting_scheme provides multiple benefits compared with the sampling procedure adopted by the standard randomfor both genie and irafnet we consider the set of highest scored directed edges referred to as d as shown the number of unique undirected edges a b was and for genie and irafnet respectively for each method we show the number of go categories with significant_enrichment for different p value thresholds and for each model the auc and the aupr and corresponding confidence_intervals are reported i f forest in the original random_forest algorithm at each node sampling is done by randomly selecting n potential_regulators and among them the predictor maximizing the decrease in node impurity is chosen for the splitting rule this strategy may be less effective when the number of informative predictors is small compared with the total number of genes in such case informative predictors have small chance of being chosen as candidates for the splitting rules this will cause the importance scores of informative predictors to be lower compared to the cases when they have larger chance of being chosen as potential_regulators simply increasing the number of trees may not resolve the aforementioned problem in order to better illustrate this point we applied genie to infer network from the dream_challenge using different tree numbers as shown in the predictive_performance is relatively unchanged when we increase the tree number from to this result is not surprising since a larger tree number is not going to significantly change the average_score of a feature across all trees when t is already large our approach of weighted sampling allows potential_regulators identified as informative by other genomic_data to be more favorably selected as a result the corresponding importance score will be more favorably measured compared with other regulators with no prior support the importance of appropriate prioritizing relevant_features in highdimensional learning has been recognized by multiple works for example a recent work showed that using a bootstrap ranking to derive a robust prioritization of snps could significantly increase the performance of disease risk prediction our work provides another demonstration on this concept and points out a direction to further improve the prediction_performance under random_forest framework besides reducing the curse of dimensionality irafnet is expected to increase accuracy and coverage of grn_inference through integrating diverse information using its weighting_scheme of course this may not always be the case as we have seen that when datasets of different quality and different origin are combined the overall performance may actually reduce in this work we only illustrate the integration of limited types of genomic_data however irafnet can be utilized to integrate almost any data type as long as its information can be transformed into prior_knowledge regarding potential regulatory_relationships when compared with other integrative_models like bayesian_network the advantage of irafnet relies on its computational_efficiency and the robust predictive_performance resulting from its nonparametric nature in fact a limitation of many existing_methods such as bayesian_networks are the linearity and normality assumptions often made to reduce the computational_complexity of the algorithm although non parametric bayesian_networks have been proposed in literature they are computationally_intensive and generally require very large_sample the computational_complexity of bayesian_networks is amplified by the difficulties_encountered in parallelizing the algorithm in contrast to bayesian_networks irafnet can flexibly model non linearity and higher_order interactions while being efficient on large_scale applications as it can be easily executed with parallelization moreover the performance of irafnet is in general robust to the number of trees in the random_forest upon our investigation one open question in the estimation of grn is whether the best performance is achieved by single models or by community methods which derive a consensus network combining results from different models recently claimed that community methods perform better than single methods despite their predictive_performance community methods remain computationally_demanding algorithms which require the estimation of many different models followed by the estimation of the consensus network for the dream_challenge our algorithm was compared to community which integrated the predictions of teams participating in the challenge as we showed in the manuscript irafnet is comparable to if not better than the community and therefore represents an efficient alternative for the datasets used in this work irafnet can finish in less than an hour on a cluster running in parallel in our implementation of irafnet we treated time series and steady_state gene_expression data separately one for deriving prior information regarding potential_regulators while the other as main input for random_forest construction alternatively they could be combined as a single dataset and be used as input for a single source based random_forest algorithm although combining the two datasets would increase the sample_size and generally provide greater_power in detecting regulations problems may arise when the sample_sizes of the two data_sets are imbalanced in such situation the construction of tree ensemble may be largely driven by the dataset with more samples while the signals embedded in the smaller dataset may be concealed this would be less an issue when the two datasets are used separately to train different models for this reason we decided to integrate time series and steady_state gene_expression in two stages a rigorous test should be considered to evaluate and compare the performance of either combining datasets or treating them separately in a two stage learning procedure it is also worth noting that prior weights may be computed using alternative_methods for example in section instead of using the jaccard_index other methods may be utilized to measure the similarity between genes because the best methods for prior weights calculation may depend on the data inputs users are encouraged to explore different options when calculating the prior information additional work is needed to improve the way that different data types are integrated in its current_implementation prior biological data such as proteinprotein_interactions and expression fromnetwork from the dream_challenge is considered and performance measured in terms of auc and the aupr cardinality n e n d of sets r e r d let r tk be the set of the first t h directed edges with highest_scores with t h
