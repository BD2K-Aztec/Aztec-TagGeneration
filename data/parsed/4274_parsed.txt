genome_analysis sist stress_induced structural transitions in superhelical dna_supercoiling imposes stress on a dna_molecule that can drive susceptible sequences into alternative non b form structures this phenomenon occurs frequently in vivo and has been implicated in biological_processes such as replication transcription recombin ation and translocation sist is a software_package that analyzes sequence_dependent structural transitions in kilobase length superhelical dna_molecules the numerical algorithms in sist are based on a statistical_mechanical model that calculates the equilibrium probability of transition for each base_pair in the domain they are extensions of the original stress_induced duplex destabilization sidd method which analyzes stress driven dna_strand separation sist also includes algorithms to analyze b z transitions and cruciform extrusion the sist pipeline has an option to use the dzcbtrans algorithm which analyzes the competition among these three transitions within a superhelical domain availability_and the package and additional documentation are freely_available at https bitbucket org benhamlab sist codes negative supercoiling in dna can drive regions with susceptible sequences from the native b form into alternate structures such transitions lower the superhelical energy so they become favored at equilibrium when the stress energy they relax exceeds their cost as the transition relaxes superhelicity its effect is felt throughout the domain involved this makes superhelical transitions globally competitive several types of superhelical transitions have been shown to occur in vitro including local strand separations z dna cruciform extrusion and others in vivo supercoiling is imposed by dna gyrases in prokaryotes and by transcriptional_activity in all organisms recently the ssdna seq technique has mapped the genome_wide occurrence of in vivo alternate dna structures this method found that increasing the cellular transcriptional_activity substantially increases the occurrence of open regions throughout the genome these denatured regions are accurately_predicted by the sidd algorithm competing superhelical dna structural transitions are known to play roles in important biological_processes the c_myc oncogene has a sidd site called fuse located kb_upstream from its promoters three alui fragments containing z forming sites and a potentially either g quadriplex forming or h forming site called the ct element kb_upstream from the promoters experiments have shown that each of these sites can be driven into their alternate structure by the superhelicity that is induced by transcription see and references therein cruciforms have been implicated in chromosomal_translocations see zhabinskaya and benham and references therein the algorithms that underlie sist can include any transition whose energetics have been experimentally_evaluated at present there are only three such transitions strand separation b z transitions and cruciform extrusion other conformations that dna can assume include the g quadriplex and the h form triplex but their energetics are not yet fully characterized however the sist algorithms are written to permit the inclusion of additional types of transitions into the model as more experimental information about their energetics becomes available the sist package provides researchers with an accessible and flexible way to analyze the propensities of dna_sequences to form alternate structures under a variety of environmental_conditions users can access the sist source_code through bitbucket which will enable them to extend the method to suit their evolving needs they may for example include other transitions or update energy parameters with new experimental_evidence in the near future we plan also to release our windowing algorithm this will allow users to analyze long_sequences including complete chromosomes transition_probabilities calculated by sist as functions of base_pair position are shown for a sequence where regions susceptible to melting z dna and cruciform extrusion were inserted into the pbr plasmid the results are shown for the three way competition algorithm trans compete run with default_parameters the sequence and instructions on how to generate these results can be found in the example directory in the bitbucket repository
