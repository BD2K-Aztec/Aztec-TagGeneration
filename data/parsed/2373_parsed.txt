genome_analysis improved rat_genome gene prediction by integration of ests with rna_seq information motivation rna_seq also called whole transcriptome_sequencing is an emerging technology that uses the capabilities of next_generation to detect and quantify entire transcripts one of its important_applications is the improvement of existing genome_annotations rna_seq provides rapid comprehensive and cost_effective tools for the discovery of novel genes and transcripts compared with expressed_sequence est which is instrumental in gene_discovery and gene sequence_determination the rat is widely used as a laboratory disease model but has a less well annotated genome as compared with humans and mice in this study we incorporated deep rna_seq from three rat tissuesbone marrow brain and kidneywith est data to improve the annotation of the rat_genome results our analysis identified transcripts including known transcripts novel isoforms and new genes which almost doubled the numbers of transcripts in the current public rat genome_database rn comparisons of our predicted protein_coding gene_sets with those in public datasets suggest that rna_seq significantly_improves genome_annotation and identifies novel genes and isoforms in the rat importantly the large majority of novel genes and isoforms are supported by direct evidence of rna_seq experiments these predicted genes were integrated into the rat genome_database rgd and can serve as an important resource for functional studies in the research_community availability_and the predicted genes are available at http rgd the rat rattus_norvegicus is the first mammalian_species to be domesticated for scientific_research with work dating back years the rat has become a widely used disease model in the fields of physiology pharmacology toxicology nutrition behavior and immunology the genome_sequence of the brown_norway bn rat_strain is the third completed mammalian_genome after the human and mouse genomes however its genome_annotation has progressed slowly genome_annotation is the process of attaching biological_information to sequences one of the most important_steps of genome_annotation is to find regions of genomic_sequence that encode genes this includes annotation of protein_coding and rna genes such as micrornas small_nucleolar and long_non in this article we focused on improving annotation of protein_coding in the rat compared with the human and mouse genomes the current build of rat_genome rn is considerably less comprehensive as of november the human build hg annotated mrnas and consensus protein_coding and the mouse build mm annotated mrnas and genes these are compared with mrnas and genes in the rat build rn existing annotation methods fall into two groups according to the type of data used for gene_discovery the first group consists of ab_initio programs which are intrinsic methods based on gene content and signal_detection all the programs in this group use only queried genomic_sequences as input for gene_discovery the second group is composed of extrinsic methods which comprise all programs that use data such as cdna or protein other than the query genomic_sequence to improve the accuracy of gene_finding a few programs such as augustus combine extrinsic and ab_initio approaches by mapping protein and expressed_sequence est data to the genome to validate ab_initio predictions augustus is one of the most accurate programs for gene_discovery due in large part to its ability to incorporate multiple hints into gene prediction_models making it a flexible program capable of using information from various sources these hints are pieces of extrinsic evidence which includes the location of exons introns and biological_signals of a given input dna to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com sequence and can be retrieved from est rna_seq and other data_sources ests are short subsequences of a cdna_library and are one source of extrinsic data they are an enormous resource for determining the exonintron structures of genes however ests are often incomplete and only reflect small pieces of full mrnas rna_seq also called wholetranscriptome sequencing is a recently emerging technology that uses the capabilities of next_generation to detect and quantify entire transcripts this technology is a more rapid comprehensive and cost_effective approach in the discovery of novel genes and transcripts compared with est data from conventional sanger_sequencing rna_seq mapping of short_reads in exon_junctions can reveal the precise location of exon_intron boundaries to a singlenucleotide resolution and thus has the potential to significantly improve existing genome_annotations moreover because a larger number of reads can be obtained with deep_sequencing rna_seq has the sensitivity to detect transcripts for genes with low_expression which are often missed by est analysis in this study we developed an analysis_pipeline in which we incorporate high_throughput rna_seq from three rat_tissues kidney brain and bone_marrow into a gene prediction model based on the augustus algorithm we compared our predicted protein_coding gene_sets with public datasets and found that rna_seq significantly_improved genome_annotation and identified novel genes and gene isoforms in the rat these predicted genes were deposited into the rgd http rgd mcw edu supplementary and may serve as an important resource for the research_community compared with the human and mouse genomes the rat_genome is not as highly annotated in this study we improved the prediction of protein_coding after incorporation of rna_seq evidence of transcription from bone_marrow brain and kidney_tissues our analysis yielded nearly twice the number of transcripts in the public rat genome_database rn that currently contains transcripts that span loci specifically we identified transcripts including known transcripts novel isoforms and new genes in general the new analysis predicted longer and more complete transcripts and discovered more isoforms per gene_locus when compared with the public database a large majority of novel genes and isoforms identified in our analyses resulted from the use of rna_seq this was because the rna_seq contain abundant evidence from transcribed sequences that may be unavailable in ests in addition the high depth of sequence_coverage of the rna_seq in our experiments allows the detection of extremely lowexpressed transcripts in each rat tissue which are usually missed by est methodology we used rpkm to measure mrna_abundance in rna_seq experiments and found that novel genes tend to have smaller rpkm than known genesthat are present in the public database in addition to their lower expression novel transcript_isoforms within known gene_loci are usually expressed in a tissue specific_manner because of these features deep rna_sequencing of multiple tissues and from different experimental_conditions may be ideal for predicting protein_coding in less well annotated eukaryotic_genomes this method can provide a more rapid comprehensive and cost_effective discovery of novel genes and transcripts compared with ests from conventional sanger_sequencing we noticed that although the large majority of predicted transcripts are common between rnaseq and est rnaseq they also had unique sets of transcripts integration of different sets of extrinsic hints may lead to different predicted proteincoding_genes transcripts augustus is based on a generalized hidden_markov and searches the most likely gene structure given queried genomic_sequences and extrinsic hints as a consequence of this the introduction of hints changes the relative likelihood of the gene structures the introduction of hints has two effects on the prediction of gene structure the bonus effect and malus effect the former increases the likelihood of a particular gene structure that is compatible with the hint whereas the latter decreases that likelihood combined hints from rna_seq and est i e the est rnaseq method do not necessarily increase the relative likelihood of a particular gene structure that was initially predicted by the rnaseq several caveats from our analysis should be acknowledged first the rat shows high genetic_similarity to both human and mouse in our approach to more accurately identify transcripts and genes we filtered results from augustus by considering their phylogenetic conservation across species and homology with known gene and transcripts although such a filtering strategy is extremely useful to identify a list of transcripts genes with high_confidence supplementary it could potentially overlook a small proportion of species specific genes in the rat_genome it should also be noted that the number of the identified transcripts with high_confidence is almost doubled when compared with the current public database second we have demonstrated that many of novel transcript_isoforms are expressed in a tissue specific_manner supplementary in our study this included only three tissues and thus genome_annotation could be further improved through analysis of more tissues under additional experimental_conditions third to detect transcripts with low_expression we combined rna_seq from multiple libraries of the same tissues from different genetic_backgrounds this might overlook some strain specific_transcripts nevertheless such strain specific_transcripts account for of total number of the identified transcripts supplementary in summary we have demonstrated that incorporation of rna_seq with est data into a gene prediction procedure significantly_improves annotation of the rat_genome our study has identified more high_confidence novel genes and or isoforms in the rat the large majority of novel genes and isoforms are supported by direct evidence from rna seqexperiments these predicted genes were integrated into the rgd http rgd mcw edu and can serve as an important resource for further studies by the research_community accessing the predicted genes in the rgd is detailed in supplementary
