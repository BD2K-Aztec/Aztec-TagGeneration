genetics_and seraphim studying environmental rasters and phylogenetically informed movements seraphim studying environmental rasters and phylogenetically informed movements is a suite of computational_methods developed to study phylogenetic reconstructions of spatial movement in an environmental_context seraphim extracts the spatio temporal_information contained in estimated phylogenetic_trees and uses this information to calculate summary_statistics of spatial spread and to visualize dispersal history most importantly seraphim enables users to study the impact of customized environmental_variables on the spread of the study organism specifically given an environmental raster seraphim computes environmental weights for each phylogeny branch which represent the degree to which the environmental variable impedes or facilitates lineage movement correlations between movement duration and these environmental weights are then assessed and the statistical significances of these correlations are evaluated using null distributions generated by a randomization procedure seraphim can be applied to any phylogeny whose nodes are annotated with spatial and temporal_information at present such phylogenies are most often found in the field of emerging_infectious but will become increasingly common in other biological disciplines as population genomic_data grows availability_and seraphim is freely_available from http evolve zoo ox ac uk r package source_code example files tutorials and a manual are also available from this website phylogenetic techniques are now a standard tool in the study of the spatial and demographic_history of organisms e g in the context of infectious_diseases for example phylogenetic_inference can be used to reconstruct epidemic history e g of most relevance here phylogeographic methods such as that implemented in the software_program beast enable the reconstruction of the dispersal history of a phylogeny of a given set of genomes sampled through time in continuous space the current version of this approach uses a relaxed random_walk model to reconstruct historical dispersal phylogeographic methods model the geographic_locations of nodes in a phylogeny and can therefore be considered a type of phylogenetic character mapping_approach trees inferred using this method or related methods such as the structured_coalescent model can be visualized in a geographical context such that each branch is interpreted as a vector that characterizes a distinct path through time and space thus the tree represents a collection of phylogenetically informed v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com movement events and contains useful information about the past dynamics of spatial spread here we present seraphim studying environmental rasters and phylogenetically informed movements a new suite of computational and statistical_methods developed to study the environmental_context of spatio_temporal phylogenies seraphim is available as a r package r core team http www r pro ject org that i extracts spatio temporal_information from a set of phylogenetic_trees ii estimates and plots dispersion statistics and iii statistically test_hypotheses regarding the relationship between dispersal velocity and environmental_variables such as altitude population_density and land_cover
