sequence_analysis sitepainter a tool for exploring biogeographical patterns as microbial ecologists take advantage of high_throughput analytical_techniques to describe microbial_communities across ever increasing numbers of samples the need for new analysis tools that reveal the intrinsic spatial_patterns and structures of these populations is crucial here we present sitepainter an interactive graphical tool that allows investigators to create or upload pictures of their study site load diversity analyses data and display both diversity and taxonomy results in a spatial context features of sitepainter include visualizing diversity using taxonomic summaries visualizing diversity using results from multidimensional_scaling methods and animating relationships among microbial_taxa or pathways overtime sitepainter thus increases the visual power and ability to explore spatially_explicit studies availability https sourceforge net_projects sitepainteras sequencing capacity increases microbial_community is undergoing a revolution in throughput where it was once a monumental task just to analyze microbial_communities in a handful of samples we can now process thousands of samples in a single sequencing run accordingly instead of describing those communities in a few samples collected under a few specific conditions we can now perform comprehensive spatial sampling exploring interactions among members of the microbial_communities and revealing large_scale spatial dynamics however the power of these analyses is often limited by our ability to visualize the data when analyzing biogeographical data researchers would like to know where specific microbes live how abundant they are and whether there are any notable patterns relating microbial_taxa to each other or to environmental_conditions traditional ordination methods for visualizing large_numbers of microbial_communities such as principal coordinates analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed pcoa are extremely useful for reducing the dimensionality of vast multivariate datasets but the patterns are often unclear especially when the results do not map easily onto the sampling structure for example it may not be clear that all the points that cluster together at one end of an axis are on the surface of a complex shape without closely examining the sample identifiers to address this key barrier to microbial_community research we developed sitepainter that provides compelling visualizations that allow the researcher to better explore spatial_patterns in microbial_communities sitepainter allows the user to draw or import representative images for biogeographical sites in the example we show a human_hand c although any picture from micro to landscape scale is possible and regions within that site e g a finger palm finger tips etc once the biogeographical image is drawn the user can import tab_delimited text_files such as those produced by quantitative insights into microbial_community qiime to map onto their image for example it is often useful to plot the diversity the number of species present in each sample taxonomy summaries the abundance of particular kinds of species in the sample and or diversity the overall similarities and differences among samples region divided_into smaller areas that were then sampled using cotton swabs dipped in saline_solution using sitepainter we were able to rapidly deduce which bacteria were in different regions of the hand along with a graphical_representation of microbial abundances by processing the sequence_data with qiime and mapping the abundance of each taxon onto the hand image using this display we can immediately see that gammaproteobacteria is present in the palm bacilli are more visible toward the fingertips and actinomycetales is present in only one area of the hand this feature thus allows the user to easily visualize the distribution and abundance of microbes across sites going beyond the abundances of individual microbial_taxa sitepainter also allows the user to view similarities and differences at the whole community level by loading the pcoa axis of the microbial data to reveal patterns that are not obvious in the pcoa plot but are immediately obvious when displayed in the context of the site itself compare left panel to the right two panels in this case we can see a clear gradient from the thumb and index fingers to the left bottom corner of the hand additionally we can see that the distal phalanges are similar maybe due to constant contact in addition to analyses of microbial_taxa as shown here sitepainter can also be used to interpret the abundance of genes or pathways across sites for metabolic studies several further examples can be found in the human_microbiome project_web http hmpdacc org sp these examples analyze the entire human_microbiome dataset at several taxonomic_levels and at several different levels of functional_classification for shotgun metagenomic_reads we expect that this will be a useful community resource for those trying to interpret the complexities of the human_microbiome
