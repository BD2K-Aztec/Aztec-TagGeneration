systems_biology protein driven inference of mirna disease associations motivation micrornas mirnas are a highly abundant class of non coding rna genes involved in cellular_regulation and thus also diseases despite mirnas being important disease factors mirnadisease associations remain_low in number and of variable reliability furthermore existing databases and prediction_methods do not explicitly facilitate forming hypotheses about the possible molecular causes of the association thereby making the path to experimental follow_up longer results here we present mirpd in which mirnaproteindisease associations are explicitly inferred besides linking mirnas to diseases it directly suggests the underlying proteins involved which can be used to form hypotheses that can be experimentally tested the inference of mirnas and diseases is made by coupling known and predicted mirnaprotein associations with proteindisease associations text mined from the literature we present scoring_schemes that allow us to rank mirnadisease associations inferred from both curated and predicted mirna_targets by reliability and thereby to create high and medium confidence sets of associations analyzing these we find statistically significant_enrichment for proteins involved in pathways related to cancer and type i diabetes_mellitus suggesting either a literature bias or a genuine biological trend we show by example how the associations can be used to extract proteins for disease hypothesis availability_and all datasets software and a search able web_site are available at http mirpd predictions from two state of the art mirna_target methods namely miranda version and targetscan version to enable comparison and integration of these sources we mapped all mirnas to mirbase identifiers and all targets to ensembl protein identifiers ensps using the string aliases file each association between a mirna m and a protein p has a quality measure assigned to it referred to as tm p in case of the manually_curated croft dataset we used as score the number of medline_abstracts supporting the association for miranda and targetscan we used the mirsvr and context scores respectively in the small proportion of cases where miranda or targetscan predicts multiple target_sites for the same mirna within a single mrna we sum their scores summarizes the mirna protein association datasets
