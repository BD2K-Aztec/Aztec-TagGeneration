bs snper snp_calling in bisulfite seq data sodium bisulfite_conversion followed by sequencing bs_seq such as whole_genome or reduced_representation has become popular for studying human epigenetic profiles identifying single_nucleotide snps is important for quantification of methylation_levels and for study of allele specific epigenetic events such as imprinting however snp_calling in such data is complex and time consuming here we present an ultrafast and memory_efficient package named bs snper for the exploration of snp sites from bs_seq data compared with bis snp a popular bs_seq specific snp caller bs snper is over times_faster and uses less memory bs snper also offers higher sensitivity_and compared with existing_methods availability_and bs snper is written in c and perl and is freely_available at https github com hellbelly bs snper sodium bisulfite_conversion followed by sequencing bs_seq has become popular for studying human epigenetic profiles whole_genome detects of methylation events and snps in the nuclear_dna however its cost remains too high for most laboratories reduced_representation rrbs is a more efficient and economical way to monitor genome_wide promoter and cpg_island status and it has become a popular method to investigate epigenetic changes in clinical tissue_samples snp identification is important for identification of allelespecific epigenetic events such as gamete specific and genetic imprinting however snp_calling from bs_seq data has been shown to be complicated one problem is that reads from two genomic strands are not complementary at methylated loci two methods were widely used to solve this problem one is to align the reads in a three letter space the other is
