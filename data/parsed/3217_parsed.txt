systems_biology netcad a network_analysis tool for coronary_artery associated ppi_network the systematic and unbiased charting of proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks relevant to health or diseases has become an important and burgeoning challenge in systems_biology further current reports have supported that good correlation exists between the topological_properties and biological_function of protein nodes in networks coronary_artery cad also called coronary_heart is the most common type of heart_disease worldwide traditional approaches of studying individual gene or protein have shown their weakness in such complex disease here we provide netcad a web_based for systematic investigation of cad specific proteins in human ppi_network the features of netcad includes the following proposing a novel method_combining biological principles and graph_theory quantified topological_analysis tools build in ppi_information database consolidated from major public_databases creating cad associated subnetwork and visualizing network graph with good visual effects netcad may provide important biological_information for uncovering the molecular_mechanisms and potential targets for therapies of cad which could not be found merely through molecular_biology methods proteinprotein_interaction ppi is an important layer of connectivity between cell processes the disturbance of ppis may result in the disturbance of the cell process to which they contribute compromising the cell_viability or even leading to cell_death with the development of high_throughput such as yeast_two assays affinity puriecation coupled to mass_spectrometry and synthetic_lethal and synexpression great volume of ppi data has been yielded forming complex ppi_networks ppins of varied species these large_networks provide a global view of cellular function and biological_processes which might bring biological and computational researchers new opportunities and challenges recently many studies indicated that the topology of ppins is intimately_related to biological_functions and has potential applications such as predicting disease_causing annotating genes and proteins jiang et_al
