genome_analysis nbc the na ve bayes classification_tool webserver for taxonomic_classification of metagenomic_reads motivation datasets from high_throughput have yielded a vast amount of data about organisms in environmental_samples yet it is still a challenge to assess the exact organism content in these samples because the task of taxonomic_classification is too computationally complex to annotate all reads in a dataset an easy to use webserver is needed to process these reads while many methods exist only a few are publicly_available on webservers and out of those most do not annotate all reads results we introduce a webserver that implements the nave_bayes classifier nbc to classify all metagenomic_reads to their best taxonomic match results indicate that nbc can assign next_generation reads to their taxonomic_classification and can find significant populations of genera that other classifiers may miss availability publicly_available at http nbc ece after acquiring a sample and using next generation technology to perform shotgun_sequencing the next step in metagenomic_analysis it to assess the taxonomic content of the sample this methodology also known as phylogenetic_analysis gives a simple look at who is in this sample the first tool ever used which is still widely used for taxonomic assessment is basic_local blast in recent_years several specialized webservers have been made available to the public to ease the process of taxonomically classifying reads namely phylopythia camera webcarma mg rast and galaxy unlike blast phylopythia and webcarma return more specific taxonomic information and assign reads to higher_level taxonomic_levels using a consensus of blast top hit taxonomies aka last common_ancestor algorithms in this article we focus our comparison to remote stand alone webservers and not to methods that only have locally installable software ultimately all the metagenomic_analysis webservers aim to ease analysis of complex environmental_samples for users that do not have resources to maintain their own databases and systems to whom correspondence should be addressed phylopythia was the first taxonomic_classification webserver to be implemented phylopythia is based on a support_vector svm classification_method and produces very good accuracy for long kbp reads webcarma is a homology based_approach that matches environmental gene tags to protein_families and reports good results for long and ultrashort bp reads using i blastx to find candidate environmental gene tags egts and ii using pfam protein_family hidden_markov hmms to match the egts against protein_families during an egt candidate selection process mg rast metagenome rapid annotation using subsystem technology camera community cyberinfrastructure for advanced microbial_ecology research and analysis and the galaxy project are high_throughput metagenomic pipelines that aim to be an all in one one stop analysis for metagenomic_samples for taxonomic_classification of shotgun_sequencing mg rast offers a homology based_approach seed camera and galaxy provide highthroughput implementations and custom databases for blastn blastn yields best_hit sequence matches and is known to have reasonable accuracy previously rosen et_al have explored a machine_learning nave_bayes classifier nbc as a possible way to classify fragments that can annotate more sequences than blast we now implement the algorithm on a webserver for public use and benchmark it against other web_sites in we show the percentage of reads out of the whole dataset that ranked in the top eight genera for each algorithm we see that all methods are in unanimous agreement for clostridium and bacillus while most methods except galaxy agree for prominence of methanoculleus camera supports nbcs findings of pseudomonas and burkholderia known to be found in sewage_treatment the biogas reactor contained chicken manure so it can have the traits of sludge waste in pseudomonas and sorangium have been found in sludge wastes streptosporangium and streptomyces are commonly found in vegetable gardens which is quite reasonable since this is an agricultural bioreactor therefore nbc potentially has found significant populations of genera that other classifiers have missed thermosinus is not in nbcs completed microbial training database and therefore it did not find any matches nbc took h to run and classified all of the reads compared with h for webcarma h for camera h for galaxy and a few weeks for mg rast nbc runs on a core intel machine and speed would linearly increase with distributed computing in the future the nave_bayes classification_tool is implemented on a web_site for public use we demonstrate that the tool can handle a complete pyrosequencing dataset and it gives the full taxonomy for each read so that users can easily analyze the taxonomic_composition of their datasets nbc classifies every read unlike other tools and is easy tothe biogas reactor community camera and nbc tend to agree for over of the genera shown while mg rast agrees with camera and nbc near webcarma bins fewers reads and galaxy has high variability for the first reads mb web_site limit phylopythia only classifies eight reads to the phylum level and is not included in the graph due to its inability to make assignments at the genus level use runs an entire dataset in a reasonable amount of time and yields competitive results
