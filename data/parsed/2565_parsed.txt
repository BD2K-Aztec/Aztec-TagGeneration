ipknot fast and accurate prediction of rna_secondary with pseudoknots using integer_programming motivation pseudoknots found in secondary_structures of a number of functional rnas play various roles in biological_processes recent methods for predicting rna_secondary cover certain classes of pseudoknotted structures but only a few of them achieve satisfying predictions in terms of both speed and accuracy results we propose ipknot a novel computational_method for predicting rna_secondary with pseudoknots based on maximizing expected_accuracy of a predicted structure ipknot decomposes a pseudoknotted structure into a set of pseudoknot free substructures and approximates a base_pairing probability_distribution that considers pseudoknots leading to the capability of modeling a wide class of pseudoknots and running quite fast in addition we propose a heuristic_algorithm for refining base paring probabilities to improve_the of ipknot the problem of maximizing expected_accuracy is solved by using integer_programming with threshold cut we also extend ipknot so that it can predict the consensus secondary_structure with pseudoknots when a multiple_sequence is given ipknot is validated through extensive experiments on various datasets showing that ipknot achieves better prediction_accuracy and faster running time as compared with several competitive prediction_methods availability the program of ipknot is available at http www ncrna org software ipknot ipknot is also available as a web_server at http rna naist jp ipknot rnas play various roles in biological_processes ranging from the passive role as a messenger that carries genetic_information to the active roles as a regulator for gene_expression and as a catalyst in cellular_processes considerable attention has been paid to the functions of rnas especially those of regulatory non_coding it is widely believed that there is a strong correlation between the d structure of an rna_molecule and its function a set of base_pairs formed from hydrogen_bonds is called a secondary_structure which shapes the substructure of the d structure since experimental determination of rna d structures is difficult and their structures are hierarchical secondary_structure provides a major key to elucidating the potential functions of rnas a good number of computational studies have so_far been presented on rna_secondary they can be roughly classified into two groups namely comparative_sequence and single sequence_analysis comparative_methods based on alignment folding include rnaalifold and pfold the comparative_analysis has an advantage of a fair possibility of achieving_high prediction_accuracy since it can take evolutionary_information into consideration however this approach is not always applicable since a set of homologous_sequences is required in advance as for single sequence_analysis a popular_approach is to find the structure with the minimum_free mfe of a single rna_sequence we can use programs that implement this strategy based on dynamic_programming dp algorithms such as mfold and rnafold notice that the free_energy of a secondary_structure is calculated by summing energy parameters of respective loop substructures which can be experimentally_determined and computationally estimated furthermore these dp based_methods are applied to the calculation of the partition_function for rna_secondary which enables us to compute posterior base_pairing probabilities recently several sophisticated methods have been proposed for predicting the secondary_structure with the maximum expected_accuracy mea over a space of possible structures contrafold and centroidfold that adopt this idea achieve better prediction_accuracy as compared with the mfe based_methods it is to be noted that all of the above methods aim to predict relatively simple rna_structures with nested base_pairing interactions pseudoknot is one of the important topologies in rna_secondary a pseudoknot is typically formed from the base_pairings between the unpaired bases of a loop and those outside the loop which is often called an h type pseudoknot see in other words a secondary_structure includes a pseudoknot if at least two arcs drawn above the primary sequence that represent base_pairs cross each other see pseudoknotted structures are observed in many rnas such as ribosomal_rnas transfer messenger_rnas and viral_rnas van pseudoknots are knownwe proposed a new computational_method ipknot for predicting rna_secondary with a wide class of pseudoknots which can take either a single_sequence or aligned sequences as input we demonstrated using a variety of structural datasets that ipknot is sufficiently fast and accurate as a computational prediction_tool for both single sequence_analysis and comparative_sequence prediction_accuracy of ipknot depends mainly on its scoring_functions even though the method uses the approximate probability_distribution for pseudoknotted structures in fact experimental_results revealed that ipknot with the base_pairing probabilities computed by heuristic refinement produces much better predictions than that without refinement moreover when we adopted the exact probabilities for pseudoknots a significant_improvement in accuracy was confirmed though much computation time was spent on the predictions considering these results there is room for further investigation into refinement of the scoring_functions that make prediction_accuracy compatible with running time another important fact to stress is that ipknot can run quite fast even on a relatively long sequence less than one thousand bases this is attributed to use of both approximation of a probability_distribution for pseudoknots and integer_programming with threshold cut based on maximizing expected_accuracy as described in section prediction_methods with satisfying speed and accuracy are useful for finding functional non coding rna genes from genome_sequences making skillful use of the speed and accuracy of our method exhaustive_search for genes of non_coding that may form pseudoknots is a worthwhile task as another future
