structural_bioinformatics charge asymmetry in the proteins of the outer_membrane motivation outer_membrane beta barrels ombbs are the proteins found in the outer_membrane of bacteria mitochondria and chloro plasts there are thousands of beta barrels reported in genomic_databases with of the genes in gram_negative encoding these proteins these proteins have a wide_variety of biological_functions including active and passive transport cell_adhesion catalysis and structural anchoring of the non redundant ombb structures in the protein_data half have been solved during the past_years this influx of information provides new opportunities for understanding the chemistry of these proteins the distribution of charges in proteins in the outer_membrane has implications for how the mechanism of outer_membrane insertion is understood understanding the distribution of charges might also assist in organism selection for the heterologous_expression of mitochondrial ombbs results we find a strong asymmetry in the charge_distribution of these proteins for the outward facing residues of the beta_barrel within regions of similar amino_acid density for both membrane leaflets the external side of the outer_membrane contains almost three times the number of charged_residues as the internal side of the outer_membrane moreover the lipid_bilayer of the outer_membrane is asym metric and the overall preference for amino_acid types to be in the external leaflet of the membrane correlates roughly with the hydropho bicity of the membrane_lipids this preference is demonstrably related to the difference in lipid_composition of the external and internal leaflets of the membrane the proteins of the outer_membrane make up of gramnegative bacteria proteome these proteins are responsible for transport cell_surface enzymatic functions and structural anchoring outer_membrane beta barrels ombbs of bacteria are remotely homologous to the ombbs of mitochondria jimenez the structure of outer_membrane are almost exclusively antiparallel beta barrels outer_membrane are more hydrophilic than inner membrane_proteins inner membrane_proteins which are mostly multipass transmembrane helical bundles have lipid facing exteriors that are extremely hydrophobic and protein facing interiors that are similarly hydrophobic to the hydrophobic cores of soluble_proteins the structures of ombbs on the other hand are such that they are more like inside out soluble_proteins the lipid facing exterior is highly_hydrophobic but the interior is often accessible to water and is composed of small hydrophilic residues the study of the lipid facing positions of ombbs is of particular interest as it may lead to a clearer understanding of the folding mechanism of ombbs ombbs have long been known to spontaneously insert into lipid_vesicles in vivo protein insertion cannot occur without the b barrel assembly machinery bam it has been hypothesized that ombbs can insert by themselves in vivo but that the kinetics are too slow to allow for the insertion to occur at the speed and frequency necessary for ombbs to promote cell_viability previous_studies on the folding of ombbs have used symmetric lipid_vesicles or computational_models that make the outer_membrane a symmetric lipid_bilayer reconstitution of mutated outer_membrane phospholipase in lipid_bilayer vesicles demonstrated that substitution of leucine for native residues in lipidfacing positions stabilizes ombbs and substitution of those same positions to arginine destabilizes ombbs the effect of these mutations on stabilization is stronger toward the center of the vesicle bilayer and is less pronounced closer to the aqueous interface previous bioinformatic assessment of lipid facing ombb amino_acid was accomplished by symmetrizing the outer_membrane such that the center of the membrane was defined as z a in either the internal direction or the external direction was defined as z by symmetrizing the membrane the authors could double the counts for their study and provide a statistically_significant picture of the preferences of all amino_acids for each a segment of the membrane aliphatic amino_acids were shown to prefer the interior of the membrane polar and charged amino_acids were shown to prefer the exterior of the membrane and aromatics were shown to prefer the interfacial region these results are similar to earlier_studies of inner membrane amino_acid preferences more recent asymmetric assessment of inner membrane alpha_helical proteins demonstrated the positive inside rule von in the symmetric inner membrane as arginine and lysine have a strong propensity for localizing on the cytoplasmic facing loops of the inner membrane this positive inside rule determines the topology of inner membrane_proteins and is believed to be a result of at least three factors the voltage across the inner membrane the charges in the sec translocon and the presence of negatively_charged of these factors the only one to be relevant to the outer_membrane is that of voltage across the membrane the outer_membrane is known to have an electrical_potential of similar magnitude and direction as the electrical_potential across the inner membrane however of the other two factors one is not present and one is lessened outer_membrane are inserted into the membrane using the unrelated bam machinery rather than the sec translocon moreover although the inner membrane and the outer_membrane are composed of the same phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine pe phosphatidylglycerol pg and cardiolipin there is evidence that the percentage of negatively_charged is one half to one quarter of that in the inner membrane the outer_membrane itself is highly_asymmetric with an inner leaflet of phospholipid and an outer leaflet of lipopolysaccharides lps it has been determined that a group of proteins coordinates the maintenance of this lipid asymmetry moving charges in the loops of ombbs does not change their topology and previous analysis has indicated that there is a preference for positive_charges on the lipid facing external region of ombbs but no difference in the prevalence of negatively_charged amino_acids between the lipid facing internal and external regions of the outer_membrane since then the number of non homologous crystal_structures has more than doubled http blanco biomol uci edu mem brane proteins xtal html in this work we determine that charged and polar amino_acids are disproportionately favored in the external side of the outer_membrane the localization of the charged amino_acids correlates well with the structure of the lipids of the outer_membrane to the extent that differences in lipids between organisms are correlated with a difference in localizations of charges in those organisms the description herein of ombbs asymmetry with respect to all charged amino_acids not just positive_charge demonstrates the importance of the asymmetry of the outer_membrane itself with respect to understanding the stability and insertion of ombbs
