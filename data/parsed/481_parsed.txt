data_and a robust approach to extract biomedical events from literature motivation the abundance of biomedical_literature has attracted significant interest in novel methods to automatically extract biomedical relations from the literature until recently most research was focused on extracting binary relations such as proteinprotein_interactions and drugdisease relations however these binary relations cannot fully represent the original biomedical data therefore there is a need for methods that can extract fine_grained and complex relations known as biomedical events results in this article we propose a novel method to extract biomed ical events from text our method consists of two phases in the first phase training data are mapped into structured representations based on that templates are used to extract rules automatically in the second phase extraction methods are developed to process the obtained rules when evaluated against the genia event_extraction abstract and full text test datasets task we obtain results with f scores of and respectively which are comparable to the state of the art systems furthermore our system achieves_superior in terms_of availability our source_code is available for academic use atautomatic relation extraction is an important and established way to extract information from biomedical_literature many relation extraction approaches have been proposed to extract binary relations between biomedical entities from text such as proteinprotein_interactions drugdrug_interactions and causal_relations on drug_resistance however such binary relations cannot fully represent the biological meaning of the original relations as a consequence there is a need to have a better representation that can exemplify complex relations extracted from text recently this shortcoming has been addressed in the bionlp shared task by introducing the biomedical event_extraction task which aims to extract complex and nested events from text in this shared task an event is defined as follows each event consists of a trigger a type and one or more arguments depending on the event type an argument can either be a protein or another eventfor more details as illustrated in shows examples of three event_types where a simple event e has one protein as the argument a binding event e has two proteins as the arguments and a regulatory event e has two events as the arguments several event_extraction approaches have been proposed to the bionlp and bionlp challenges in general to extract events from a given sentence two steps need to be carried_out identifying event triggers and determining their arguments first the sentence is typically preprocessed and converted into structured representations such as dependency parse tree and candidate event triggers are often pre selected using a dictionary next the candidate event triggers and the parse tree are used as the input for the event extraction_process the proposed approaches to extract events can be divided_into two main groups namely rule_based and machine_learning ml based_approaches rule_based event_extraction systems consist of a set of rules that are manually defined or generated from training data to extract events from text each pre selected candidate trigger is first validated to determine its event type next the defined rules are often applied to the parse tree which contains that trigger to find relations between the trigger and its arguments evaluation results from the bionlp and bionlp show that rule_based systems achieve high_precision but low recall in particular the system proposed byachieves the highest precision on the bionlp event_extraction track ml based systems model event_extraction tasks as a classification_problem in these systems pre selected candidate event triggers and the arguments attached to them are classified as true event triggers or not extraction methods proposed in the bionlp exploit various learning algorithms and feature_sets to leverage the system performance methods proposed after the bionlp can be divided_into two groups based on how event triggers and arguments are determined the first ml based group consists of systems that adopt the pipeline and feature_sets proposed by bjorneand later improved by in which the evaluation of the candidate triggers and the determination of their arguments are carried_out independently for this type of approach errors made in the trigger detectiongood results in terms of f scores on both bionlp and bionlp challenges apart from these two main approaches there are a few systems that use different methods morapropose a hybrid method that combines both rule and ml based_approaches use a system using sub graph_matching use case based reasoning system introduce a system using dependency graphs by extending the function of an existing dependency parser however the performance of these systems is not comparable to the state of the art ml based systems in this article we introduce a novel rule_based method to extract biomedical events from text our method differs in many ways from the existing_methods first we define a new structured representation to express the relations between event triggers and their arguments next we transform the input text into this structured representation using a shallow parser we then map the annotated events from the training data into these structured representations based on that rules are extracted automatically by using predefined templates the obtained rules are unified to make them more flexible finally we develop event_extraction algorithms to apply these unified rules by using the structured representation to decompose the nested and complex structures of events into simple syntactic layers we can use simple methods to learn and apply extraction rules when evaluated on the bionlp test_set our system achieves an impressive performance in terms of precision and computational times to the best of our knowledge this is the first system of its kind to extract biomedical events from text in this article we have proposed a novel rule_based method to extract biomedical events from text our core method to event_extraction is the use of a structured representation to decompose nested and complex events into syntactic layers this representation not only allows us to simplify the learning and extraction phases but also it requires less syntactic analysis of input sentences the evaluation results show that our system performs well on both abstract and full text datasets furthermore it achieves_superior in terms_of it is clearly suited to large_scale experiments our event_extraction method is simpler than the existing ml based_approaches it is also more robust than the previously_proposed rule based_approaches since it learns rules automatically from training data its simplicity and robustness have been proven by the performance on simple and binding_events its structured representation is generic and is capable of representing any relation types the proposed feature_sets based on the structured representation mainly consist of generic features and a few specific features therefore it is suited to extract many types of relations if needed its specific features can be easily adapted to any new domain
