databases_and seeqtl a searchable database for human eqtls seeqtl is a comprehensive and versatile eqtl database including various eqtl studies and a meta_analysis of hapmap eqtl information the database presents eqtl association results in a convenient browser using both segmented local association plots and genome_wide manhattan plots availability_and seeqtl is freely_available use atthe association of rna expression traits with dna variation including from single_nucleotide snps and copynumber variants cnvs has been a subject of active inquiry in recent_years shedding light on fundamental biological_processes underlying transcription here we use the generic term expression_quantitative eqtls to describe these dna_variants and their associated expression traits a large number of studies have been published on hapmap lymphoblastoid_cell and other human tissues covering several continental level populations in addition to the general importance of dissecting transcriptional_regulation eqtl_analysis may also provide a window into the mechanisms_underlying transcription mediated disease several online_databases are available which report eqtl associations based on published datasets scan is a large_scale database of genetic and genomic_data which allows users to search for eqtls by querying multiple genes or snps cnvs but is not designed primarily as an eqtl database the eqtl browser is based on the gbrowse platform and displays results from multiple studies and allows navigation throughout the genome the gtex genotype tissue expression eqtl database will be populated by tissue_specific eqtl information as the gtex project
