systems_biology refining carbon_flux paths using atomic trace data motivation pathway analysis tools are a powerful strategy to analyze omics_data in the field of systems_biology from a metabolic perspective several pathway definitions can be found in the literature each one appropriate for a particular study recently a novel pathway concept termed carbon_flux paths cfps was introduced and bench marked against existing_approaches showing a clear advantage for finding linear pathways from a given source to target_metabolite cfps are simple paths in a metabolitemetabolite graph that satisfy typical constraints in stoichiometric models mass balancing and thermodynamics irreversibility in addition cfps guarantee carbon exchange in each of their intermediate steps but not between the source and the target metabolites and consequently false_positive solutions may arise these pathways often lack biological interest particularly when studying biosynthetic or degradation routes of a me tabolite to overcome this issue we amend the formulation in cfp so as to account for atomic fate information this approach is termed atomic cfp acfp results by means of a side_by comparison in a medium scale metabolic_network in escherichia_coli we show that acfp provides more biologically_relevant pathways than cfp because canonical pathways are more easily recovered which reflects the benefits of removing false_positives in addition we demonstrate that acfp can be successfully_applied to genome_scale as the quality of genome_scale atomic reconstruction is improved methods such as the one presented here will undoubtedly be of value to interpret omics_data systems_biology aims at modeling a wide assortment of biological_phenomena from a holistic molecular perspective analysis of high_throughput omics_data is typically intricate and requires sophisticated techniques assisting their interpretation and understanding for this purpose pathway analysis tools constitute a powerful strategy as there is strong experimental evidence_supporting the view that many cellular_processes are organized into pathways in particular biochemistry textbooks detail a wide list of well known canonical metabolic_pathways which can now be computationally accessed from different databases and analyzed in different scenarios the outbreak of genome_scale has evidenced that it is not possible to represent all the metabolic phenotypes using a small set of canonical pathways intending to increase the number and diversity of pathways a number of mathematical pathway definitions can be found in the literature for each scenario under study selecting the appropriate definition is crucial so as to obtain relevant insights defining a pathway concept representing too many biological_mechanisms may be counterproductive due to the underlying computational demand in this light two sides of the same coin are the pathway definitions based on graph_theory and elementary_flux efms although the former is calculated based on classical graph_theory the latter requires less efficient algebraic techniques however efms fulfill additional biological constraints e g mass_balance leading to more biologically_relevant results it is worth mentioning that in addition to efms we can find in the literature similar pathway definitions such as generating flux modes or extreme pathways furthermore additional examples of metabolic_pathway definitions based on graph_theory can also be found recently carbon_flux paths cfps were introduced so as to account for the advantages of both definitions this approach searches for paths in a graph of metabolites where arcs represent an effective carbon exchange in at least one enzyme catalyzed_reaction in addition as in the case of efms additional biophysical constraints are imposed namely mass_balance and thermodynamic restrictions cfps approach is an effective tool to determine linear pathways from a given source to a target_metabolite as it overcomes combinatorial issues found in efms approach cfps also take advantage of the inherent versatility of integer_linear ilp to integrate gene_expression and protein_abundance data as well as metabolomics_data despite the potential and versatility of cfps there is still room for improvement in particular while the underlying graph of metabolites guarantees carbon exchange in each step of the path this is not always achieved between the source and target metabolites and false_positive solutions may arise as discussed in these solutions lack biological_significance especially when studying biosynthetic or degradation mechanisms to whom correspondence should be addressed in order to overcome this issue the cfp formulation is here extended to ensure that a fixed number of carbon_atoms from the source reach the target_metabolite in line with pitkanen to do so we integrate atomic tracing data for reactions into the model in other words for a biochemical_reaction we require precise information indicating in which position in a product each carbon_atom from a substrate ends this information is growing day by day and is currently available in different reconstructions these reconstructions can be manually_curated or computed by automatic_methods the use of in silico automatically generated databases entails sacrificing accuracy but increases the number of reactions that can be considered based on this information we show that the atomic extension of cfp presented here acfp provides more biologically_relevant pathways than the original cfp definition pathway analysis tools are a powerful strategy to study metabolic_processes in the context of omics_data we recently_introduced a novel pathway concept termed cfps which was benchmarked with existing_approaches finding a clear progress over the state of the art cfps approach has been shown to be particularly effective to determine linear pathways from a given source to a target_metabolite in other works we illustrate the versatility of cfps approach for different applications in the first work we extract key pathways based on gene_and data that underlies the acetate overflow issue in e coli cell_cultures in the second work based on cfps we interpret metabolomics_data in different neurological_disorders despite the potential of cfps improvements are still possible in particular while the underlying graph of metabolites guarantees carbon exchange in each intermediate step of the path this is not always achieved between the source and target metabolites and false_positive solutions may arise these pathways often lack biological interest particularly when studying biosynthetic or degradation routes of a metabolite to overcome this issue we amend the formulation in so as to account for atomic fate information this approach was termed acfp in section by means of a side_by comparison in a medium scale metabolic_network we show that acfp provides more biologically_relevant pathways than cfp because canonical pathways are more easily recovered which reflects the removal of false_positives note here that cfp represents a state of the art approach and it is challenging to obtain a notable improvement over a high_quality approach in particular in our canonical pathway analysis cfp and acfp recovered the solution in cases consequently for these pathways cfp cannot be outperformed by any other approach nevertheless in those six cases in which cfp did not recover the canonical pathway in the first solution acfp improved the results obtained by cfp in four out of the six cases some of them significantly e g arginine biosynthesis pathway the limited size of the metabolic_network considered in section makes_it to obtain large differences between acfp and cfp however in section we used a large_sized genome_scale and found remarkable_differences between acfp and cfp in finding pathways between glucose and pyruvate as observed in results in section also demonstrate that acfp can be successfully_applied to genome_scale however the performance of acfp is intimately tied to the quality of the atomic reconstruction under consideration although there are high_quality manually_curated mediumscale atomic reconstructions genome_scale atomic_models generated by means of in silico methods still require further research so as to provide atomic reconstructions free from errors thiswork will be also valuable for those conducting and modeling isotope labeling experiments the most quantitative technology to infer reaction fluxes there are other biological_mechanisms demanding pathways assuring exchange of different atoms e g reactive_oxygen ros in different applications in health nitrogen_assimilation in bacteria acfp can be easily adapted so as to guarantee any atom exchange simply by introducing the atomic reconstructions into the model presented here overall combining cfp with high_quality atomic reconstructions further improves the accuracy of predicted pathways therefore as high_quality atomic reconstructions become available acfp substitutes the cfp approach as omics experimental information can be integrated in a similar manner and we expect to obtain more reliable results with the increasing amount of omics_data tools such as the one presented here will be essential to obtain relevant insights from them
