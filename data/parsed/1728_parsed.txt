sequence_analysis facil fast and accurate genetic_code inference and logo motivation the intensification of dna_sequencing will increasingly unveil uncharacterized species with potential alternative genetic codes a total of of the dna_sequences currently in genbank encode their proteins with a variant genetic_code and these exceptions occur in many unrelated taxa results we introduce facil fast and accurate genetic_code inference and logo a fast and reliable tool to evaluate nucleic_acid for their genetic_code that detects alternative codes even in species distantly_related to known organisms to illustrate this we apply facil to a set of mitochondrial genomic contigs of globobulimina pseudospinescens this foraminifer does not have any sequenced close_relative in the databases yet we infer its alternative genetic_code with high_confidence values results are intuitively visualized in a genetic_code logo availability_and facil is available as a web_based service at http www cmbi ru nl facil and as a stand alone program the recent increases in read_lengths have established next_generation as a mature technique with the first machines capable of single_molecule sequencing currently being shipped to researchers in most studies the researchers interests lie beyond translation the focus is on proteins that are encoded in the dna and their function most analyses consider the translation between dna and protein a trivial exercise after all the genetic_code or codon table i e the dictionary that translates codons nucleic_acid triplets to whom correspondence should be addressed into amino_acids aas is largely universal and unambiguous however exceptions in the code of bacteria eukaryotic nuclei organelles and their associated viruses have been reported and given the increasing phylogenetic breadth of sequenced taxa many more such findings may be anticipated a quick survey of the dna_sequences currently in genbank shows that a total of is annotated as being alternatively translated if a novel sequence uses a non canonical code open_reading may be different than anticipated due to the reassignment of stop_codons and alternative translations of coding codons this affects both protein_sequence and function prediction so these considerations demand an easy way to assess the genetic_code used on a sequenced fragment or assembled contig non canonical codes are generally identified by inspecting an alignment of the codons on the dna against homologous protein_sequences identified by e g blastx the program gendecoder automates this process but it focuses on metazoan mitochondria and requires an annotated genbank file as input dna_sequencing increasingly yields fragments and assembled_contigs that contain sufficient information for reliable genetic_code prediction but performing blastx searches before knowing the correct translation table is untenable with the rate of dna_sequencing accelerating faster than cpu power moreover the alignment may introduce errors that need to be addressed preferably by an automated and validated approach currently there is no standard available for inference of the genetic_code of an unannotated dna_sequence and a range of ad_hoc methods that lack quality_control and reported reliability scores obscure this research area the notable_exception being gendecoder with facil we present an easy fast and reliable tool to predict the genetic_code for nucleic_acid that does not depend on any a priori gene_annotation facil detects alternative genetic codes even in species distantly_related to known organisms previously genetic_code prediction has explicitly gendecoder or implicitly blastx searches benefited from phylogenetic_relatedness for reliable predictions with facil we chose to rely on general protein_domains for two reasons first this eliminates the requirement to know the taxonomic placement of the organism from which the dna was derived which may in particular be difficult for early branching organisms second this greatly_improves its speed see section nevertheless future genetic_code predictors may benefit from a more phylogenetically balanced selection of reference_sequences a proper model of evolution and a probabilistic phylogenetic method that considers the aas at neighboring nodes of the tree and uses branch_lengths to calculate the probability of aas at an unknown state node
