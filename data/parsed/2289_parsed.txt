identification of differentially_methylated using wavelet_based functional mixed models_motivation dna_methylation is a key epigenetic_modification that can modulate gene_expression over the past_decade a lot of studies have focused on profiling dna_methylation and investigating its alterations in complex_diseases such as cancer while early studies were mostly restricted to cpg islands or promoter_regions recent_findings indicate that many of important dna_methylation changes can occur in other regions and dna_methylation needs to be examined on a genome_wide scale in this article we apply the wavelet_based functional mixed model methodology to analyze the high_throughput methylation data for identifying differentially_methylated across the genome contrary to many commonly used methods that model probes independently this framework accommodates spatial correlations across the genome through basis function model ing as well as correlations between samples through functional random_effects which allows it to be applied to many different settings and potentially leads to more power in detection of differential_methylation dna_methylation is an important epigenetic_mechanism that is involved in the regulation of gene_expression and plays_a in normal biology and diseases there has been much attention in profiling dna_methylation and discovering its alterations over the past_decade to improve our understanding of complex_diseases such as cancer much early methylation research focused on cpg islands introduced by cpg islands are genomic_regions containing high_frequency of cpg_sites which contain cytosine and guanine connected by a phosphodiester_bond they frequently occur in the promoter_region of genes and thus have been thought to be most relevant methylation_sites in suppressing rna expression however recent evidence required us to rethink this belief for example showed that most methylation alterations in colon_cancer occur not in cpg islands but in sequences up to kb distant from cpg islands which they term cpg_island shores this was discovered by examining dna_methylation on a comprehensive genome_wide scale via high_throughput v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com microarray_based methylation data rather than just focusing on cpg islands this suggests that traditional approaches focused on a certain regions of the genome such as cpg islands or promoter_regions are likely to miss important findings and genome_wide studies on dna_methylation are preferred recent advancements in high_throughput assessment of dna_methylation using microarray_based or sequencing based_approaches make genome_wide studies possible for example developed comprehensive high_throughput arrays for relative methylation charm which measure methylation_level at more than million probes for each sample anddeveloped whole_genome wgbs for measuring methylation_level at every cpg_site in the genome reviews and comparisons on several high_throughput methylation technologies can be found in laird and wilhelm however these data are high_dimensional and complex and so there is a need to develop new methods to analyze these genome level methylation data that are flexible enough to capture their complex structure computationally_efficient enough to scale up to their enormous size and yielding rigorous statistical_inference allowing one to identify differentially_methylated in the genome while adjusting for multiple testing e g by controlling the false_discovery fdr or experiment wise error_rate eer in differential_methylation analysis the most commonly used approaches examine the relationship between the phenotype of interest and methylation of a given individual locus independently across the genome zackay and steinhoff and many more however methylation in nearby cpg loci tends to be highly_correlated therefore statistical_analyses based on independence assumptions across loci are likely to be inefficient to deal with this dependence issue some methods have been developed that use the idea of bump hunting to account for correlation of nearby loci in particular first estimate the differential_methylation individually at each genomic location then the estimates are smoothed using loess and candidate_regions of differential_methylation are generated as contiguous regions where the absolute_values of smoothed estimates are greater than a predetermined threshold finally permutation techniques are applied to assess_statistical of these regions this approach has great advantages over approaches modeling loci as independent in that they borrow strength across genome by grouping neighboring probes into a region and focusing on region based detection of differential_methylation and can account for multiple testing they have successfully_applied their approach and identified differentially_methylated dmrs however these methods also have disadvantages as pointed_out in they can have trouble in finding small differentially_methylated involving a small number of loci this is problematic since such small regions may correspond to suppressed gene_expression and thus be functionally_important also care must be taken in specification of the predetermined threshold for defining a region or grouping probes as these tuning parameters can strongly_affect the results the loess smoothing approach is not spatially adaptive when used with global bandwidths so can result in the attenuation of local_features that can reduce power to detect them additionally the current software is limited to paired or independent group level analyses and simple_linear which may not be sufficient to answer some research_questions of interest in methylation studies or handle certain experimental_designs inducing correlation between arrays introduced a method called waveletbased functional mixed models wfmm that can model complex irregular functional data within a functional mixed model framework which generalizes linear_mixed to the setting of functional_responses this framework allows general design matrices that can accommodate group effects linear_regression and various types of interactions plus random effect levels to model correlation between functions induced by experimental_design e g multiple functions from the same subject or cluster multiple factors can be simultaneously modeled e g allowing us to adjust for batch_effects they used wavelet basis_functions to represent functions which allows the method to capture local within function correlations and thus adaptively borrow strength within the function they have standalone executable software to run the general model in this paper we will apply this method to the analysis of genome_wide probe level methylation data and explore its properties modeling is done using a fully bayesian_approach that has significant inferential advantages yielding statistical_inference to flag genomic_loci as differentially_methylated while accounting for multiple testing using experiment wise error_rate and or false_discovery criteria by modeling methylation profiles as functions and considering both spatial_correlation given a function and correlation among samples this approach can borrow strength across neighboring probes as well as across samples the implementation of the method is relatively straightforward by using automated software called wfmm freely_available at https biostatistics mdanderson org softwaredownload although this article focuses on genome_wide studies the framework is more general and can be used for analyzing other high_throughput genomic data_sets observed for many locations spaced through the genome including copy_number and tiling transcriptome arrays the remainder of the article is organized as follows section introduces three methylation data_sets we analyze and the preprocessing procedures we employ section_describes the wavelet_based functional mixed model and bayesian approaches for identifying differentially_methylated we present numerical_results in section and conclude with a discussion of general usefulness of the framework and its potential for many other data_sets in this section we briefly describe three different methylation data_sets we analyze and describe how they were preprocessed examined dna_methylation of colorectal_cancers and matched normal_mucosa on a genome_wide scale using the charm microarrays described into investigate methylation differences between normal and colon tumor_samples this study showed that most dna_methylation alterations in colon_cancer occur in sequences up to kb distant from cpg islands or promoter_regions which they term cpg_island shores rather than in the promoter or cpg_island regions themselves they standardized log ratios from the charm microarrays using suitable control probes from unmethylated regions so that the average log_ratio in the control probes was zero subsequently developed an improved preprocessing procedure which can be implemented using the r package charm version in our analysis the charm microarray_data were normalized and pre processed using the charm package the methylation log ratios were first normalized using the control probes then the normalized log ratios were identification of differentially_methylated locitransformed into percentage methylation estimates which range between zero and one as a result percentage methylation_values were given for a total of probes for each sample for our modeling we applied the logit transform to the percentage methylation_values which made them symmetric and approximately normal tailed we will use the logit transformed_data to compare methylation differences between the normal and tumor_samples
