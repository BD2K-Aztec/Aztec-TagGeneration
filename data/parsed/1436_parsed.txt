distinct profiling of antimicrobial_peptide families motivation the increased prevalence of multi_drug mdr pathogens heightens the need to design new antimicrobial_agents antimicrobial_peptides amps exhibit broad_spectrum potent_activity mdr pathogens and kills rapidly thus giving rise to amps being recognized as a potential substitute for conventional antibiotics designing new amps using current in silico approaches is however challenging due to the absence of suitable models large number of design_parameters testing cycles production time and cost to date amps have merely been categorized into families according to their primary sequences structures and functions the ability to computationally determine the properties that discriminate amp families from each other could help in exploring the key_characteristics of these families and facilitate the in silico design of synthetic amps results here we studied amp families and sub families we selected a specific description of amp amino_acid and identified compositional and physicochemical_properties of amino_acids that accurately distinguish each amp family from all other amps with an average sensitivity specificity and precision of and respectively many of our identified dis criminative properties have been shown to be compositional or functional characteristics of the corresponding amp family in literature we suggest that these properties could serve as guides for in silico methods in design of novel synthetic amps the methodology we developed is generic and has a potential to be applied for characterization of any protein_family escalating deaths due to increased exposure of living_organisms to infectious_diseases and the rapid evolution of multi_drug mdr microbes spurred interest in alternative remedies that can treat the mdr microbes causing these diseases antimicrobial_peptides amps have been pinpointed as one such remedy owing to their broadspectrum potent_activity gram_positive fungi protozoa parasites cancer_cells and different kinds of enveloped_viruses their effective defense action against a broad_spectrum of microbes and their ability to kill rapidly have rendered them highly_effective substitute for conventional antibiotics moreover designed amps have been reported to kill mdr microbes amps interact with target microbes by membrane permeation and penetration subsequently affecting v c the author published_by in this work we developed a novel computational_model for selection of amp characteristics that discern amp families via physicochemical and compositional properties the identified amp properties make them potential design guides for development of synthetic amps also these properties can be used as a starting_point to develop a classification model to determine the category of a new candidate amp in the subsequent text enrichment and depletion are considered related to one target amp family relative to all other amp families here we comment on the properties selected for some of the amp families discussion of properties of other families is in supplementary_materials s alpha defensins we found enrichment of cysteine c in the n and n regions arginine r in the m region and arginine and tyrosine y in the c region whereas glycine g was found depleted in the n region as well as lysine k in the c region numerous studies have demonstrated that bactericidal_activity is independent of highly conserved_features such as invariant disulfide array arg glu salt_bridge or gly residue at cysiii i with exception to the high arginine content relative to lysine which complies with our finding moreover demonstrated that the replacement of arginine with lysine decreases the activity of these peptides also amps disrupt membranes through a combination of electrostatic_interactions between cationic_amino side_chains and electronegative components of the microbial cell_envelope followed by the insertion of hydrophobic patches into the nonpolar interior of the membrane bilayer the mouse alpha defensin cryptdin crp was demonstrated to induce bactericidal_activity via this mechanism nmr_structure of crp demonstrated its cationic amino_acids to be arginine lysine and histidine h and its hydrophobic patches to include isoleucine i leucine l valine v phenylalanine f and tyrosine similar to these findings we found for alpha defensins the enrichment of cysteine in the n region which taking_into their hydropathy index may suggest that it is a key_component of the hydrophobic_patch the enrichment of arginine and tyrosine likely adds to the electrostatic_interaction that contributes to membrane disruption beta_defensins we found arginine valine phenylalanine asparagine n cysteine and glycine enriched in the n n n n n and n regions respectively also for the properties extracted from the n sub region an enrichment for the parameter of charge_transfer donor capacity was found the m region exhibited enrichment of cysteine whereas the c region had enrichment of arginine and cysteine it was proposed that the betadefensin n_terminal helix with many hydrophobic_residues is inserted inside the micelle whereas the c terminal helix with one large positive_charge patch is located outside the micelle and interacts with the charged head_groups of the micelle of the array of amino_acids we identified valine phenylalanine and cysteine as key hydrophobic_residues enriched in the n_terminal that likely facilitate the insertion of the beta_defensins n_terminal helix into the micelles whereas for the c terminal helix arginine is the key amino_acid forming the positive_charge patch finally if we only consider amino_acids that our study identified as enriched we observe cysteine glycine and arginine most enriched our findings are partly corroborated by the results of midorikawa et_al and chandrababu et_al as they demonstrated that the beta_defensins are characterized by the enrichment of cysteine that is the existence of six conserved_cysteine and that the arrangement of cysteine_residues in the three dimensional_space are important to the antimicrobial selectivity and salt_dependent activity by mutating all six cysteine_residues of human_beta hbd cathelicidins we identified the enrichment of arginine in the n and n regions lysine was identified depleted in the c region the properties extracted from the n sub region enrichment for the linker propensity from linker dataset and normalized frequency of beta_sheet with weights was found our findings are supported by cathelicidins being characterized as proline_rich and having a highly_conserved n_terminal preprosequences followed by variable c terminal sequences that are biologically_active effectors moreover the proline was proved to sustain the antimicrobial_activity of mammalian cathelicidins by resisting serine_proteases cleavage of the scissile bond our findings are further supported by cathelicidins from hagfish exhibiting four arginines positioned between the cathelin domain and the antimicrobial sequences the arginine tetrads of these latent zymogens are believed to be specifically processes by prohormone convertases such as furin proteases in specific cells as an activity switch cecropins we identified enrichment of lysine and glutamic_acid e in the n and n regions respectively whereas alanine was enriched in the c region produced synthetic cecropin a that induces comparable antibacterial_activity and is indistinguishable by chemical and physical criteria from the naturally_occurring cecropin a in partial corroboration with our findings it has been demonstrated that cecropin analogs with an impaired n_terminal helix such as cecropin a with removed lysine and tryptophan has reduced membrane disrupting abilities that correlate with their lower antibacterial_activity that was rationalized in terms of reduced binding to bacteria similarly demonstrated via a chemically_synthesized cecropin d analog that no activity is observed without phenylalanine and glutamic_acid in the n_terminal moreover demonstrated that lysine glutamic_acid and arginine are conserved in cecropins and that alanine is enriched cyclotides we only identified a few properties related to composition such as enrichment of glutamic_acid and glycine in the n and c regions respectively for the properties extracted from the c region enrichment for normalized frequency of turn in alpha_beta class was found work bypartially supports these finding as they demonstrated that methylation of charged glutamic_acid residue of cyclotide cycloviolacin o decreased its potency fold they additionally showed conserved_cysteine and demonstrated that acetylation of the two lysine_residues also reduced the potency fold koehbach et_al elucidated the structure of kalata b to determine its associated ligandreceptor interaction they inferred an interaction with the oxytocin receptor owing to loop of kalata b cytqgc being homologous to the six residue ring sequence of oxytocin they further exhibited the crucial_role of the tyrosine and glutamine residues loop by generating mutated variants y replaced by a s or f q was replaced by a or e all of which were inactive or did not bind to the receptor demonstrated that most cyclotides have a glycine positioned before the cysteine_residue to form the f angle required for the type_ii b turn needed for cyclization the increased demand of amps brought attention to in silico methods to design novel amps in this study we identified properties that strongly discriminate amps families from each other using global optimization of unsupervised_clustering by ga our results suggest that the identified features can be used to filter out unlikely synthetic candidate amps during the design process of novel amps the methodology_developed here is generic and with a potential to characterize arbitrary protein_family
