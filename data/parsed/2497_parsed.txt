integrated gene_set for microrna studies motivation functional_interpretation of mirna_expression data is currently done in a three step procedure select differentially_expressed find their target_genes and carry out gene_set overrepresentation analysis nevertheless major limitations of this approach have already been described at the gene level while some newer arise in the mirna scenario here we propose an enhanced methodology that builds on the well established gene_set paradigm evidence for differential_expression at the mirna level is transferred to a gene differential inhibition score which is easily_interpretable in terms of gene_sets or pathways such transferred indexes account for the additive effect of several mirnas targeting the same gene and also incorporate cancellation effects between cases and controls together these two desirable characteristics allow for more accurate modeling of regulatory_processes results we analyze high_throughput sequencing_data from different cancer_types and provide exhaustive reports of gene and gene_ontology term deregulation by mirna action availability_and the proposed methodology was implemented in the bioconductor library mdgsa http bioconductor org_packages mdgsa for the purpose of reprodu cibility all of the scripts are available at https micrornas mirnas are small_non which participate in post_transcriptional they bind to target_mrnas with partial complementarity causing translational_repression or target degradation aberrant mirnas expression has been reported to be linked to disease and so many genomic experiments are now being conducted with the aim of clarifying the relationship between mirna_levels and phenotype these experiments generally use microarrays or high_throughput to record mirna_expression between different biological conditions followed by differential_expression to evaluate the association of each mirna to phenotype it is common in such analyses to first select the significantly different mirnas and then explore their target_genes to infer possible functional consequences of the deregulation of these mirnas gene function databases such as the gene_ontology go kegg or reactome are commonly used in this second step some authors prefer to first annotate mirnas onto the functions of their target_genes and then do the functional_interpretation at the mirna level despite being less instinctive or intuitive this approach has been shown to reduce the effect of biased database information this two step paradigm known as over representation analysis ora has been extensively used in gene_expression experiments and is now the exclusive method used for mirna functional profiling but even in the gene_expression context ora approaches have been legitimately criticized and some major_drawbacks have been described most concerning of these disadvantages is the loss of information caused by using only a few genes and the egalitarian treatment of these selected genes a problem that arises again in the mirna scenario in differential gene_expression for instance ora only considers genes which show large expression differences whereas small changes in functionally_related gene_sets may be more relevant to the underlying biology similar biases occur when analyzing mirna_expression data but in this case the effect is doubled on one hand some genes may be regulated by a big change in a single mirna if this occurs in an experiment the mirna will be identified as differentially_expressed and therefore ora can be used with the above_mentioned limitations on the other hand some other less robust gene deregulations may go unnoticed because the mirnas causing them do not appear among the most differentially_expressed candidates thus in such cases the combined gene_set effect will be missed furthermore genes can also be inhibited by the additive effect of several small mirna changes this scenario is common but is usually neglected in the ora because the causative mirnas are unlikely to be selected in the two stages approach finally a gene may be regulated by several mirnas with opposite expression_patterns this may induce compensatory effects that presumably are not considered by ora approaches as a simple example of this later situation we can think about a gene modulated by two mirnas one of them up regulated in experimental cases and the other up regulated in controls the gene will be down_regulated or inhibited in both conditions and hence is irrelevant for case control comparison despite this ora algorithms are likely to identify such genes as relevant in the comparison because their regulatory mirnas will have been selected in the differential_expression step of the analysis thus the application ora methodology intrinsically implies a relatively naive understanding of biology in the context of gene_expression the limitations of ora have already been surpassed by gene_set gsa methods gsa approaches which can successfully model the importance of weaker but coordinated changes in sets of functionally_related therefore reinforcing genomic_data interpretation but even though gsa methods have been available for a long time for gene based experiments to our knowledge no gsa like methodologies have so_far been proposed for functional profiling of mirna measurements this lack of gsa style applications to mirna data is not really surprising for two reasons first functional_annotation is normally attached to genes thus in order to interpret mirna data for instance in terms of go or kegg scientists must first define how mirna and database information should be linked for this purpose meaningful mirna to gene_transfer of the experimental_evidence is implicitly necessary second most gsa algorithms are such that the gene level analysis and the enrichment steps are strongly interdependent and cannot easily be split up such lack of flexibility of most gsa algorithms hinders their re implementation and usage in the mirna context for instance in the classical gsea algorithm the statistical_significance of the enrichment is evaluated using a phenotype based permutation applied to the geneexpression data matrix thus the differential_expression step is carried_out within the re sampling schema and cannot be changed without rewriting the algorithm in this paper we propose a novel gsa type methodology for functionally interpreting mirna_expression data taking_advantage of the additive inhibitor effect that mirnas may have on genes we first propose a meaningful procedure for transferring mirna differential_expression evidence to the gene level via a differential inhibition score then we use logistic regression_models to interpret this gene inhibition information in terms of gene_sets to exemplify the applicability of our method here we analyze different real_datasets taken from the cancer_genome tumor_samples are compared to normal_tissue in a differential mirna_expression analysis and then functional profiling in terms of go is carried_out for each of them several go terms already known to be cancer related appear as deregulated in the different cancers validating the suitability of our approach we hope our algorithm implemented in the r bioconductor_package mdgsa will be useful to data analysts but also that the extensive supplementary_materials presented in this paper would constitute a valuable asset
