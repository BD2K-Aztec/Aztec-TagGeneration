genome_analysis genblastg using blast_searches to build homologous_gene models_motivation blast users frequently expect to obtain homologous_genes with certain similarity to their query genes but what they get from blast_searches are often collections of local_alignments called high_scoring segment pairs hsps on the other hand most homology_based gene_finders have been built using computation intensive algorithms without taking full advantage of blast_searches that have been perfected over the last decades results here we report an efficient algorithm genblastg that directly uses the hsps reported by blast to define high_quality gene models basic_local blast is one of the most popular and efficient bioinformatics_tools ever developed frequently blast users expect to identify homologous_genes for comparative_analysis for example following the discovery of a previously_unknown gene in a human_genome a biologist will typically perform a blast_search of the publicly_accessible databases such as the mouse genome_database to see if another species carries a similar gene hoping to gain insights into the function and regulatory_signals of the newly found gene blast however presents the user a usually large collection of local_alignments called high_scoring segment pairs hsps such hsps provide no indication how they are structured into the gene model because they are usually only isolated regions of similarity with some being simply noises in the last decade many homology_based gene predictors have been developed including genewise projector twinscan and exonerate these algorithms either are independent of blast or use blast only as a preprocessing to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as tool to narrow down gene search_space our work is motivated by the following question can we construct gene structures directly from the hsps found by blast which represent high_quality local_alignments the rationale is to delegate the expensive local_alignment search to the well developed blast and focus on extracting and defining the best gene structure that such hsps represent here we present a novel homologybased algorithm genblastg which takes local_similarity alignments hsps identified by homologous searches as input and defines gene models by examining alignments and neighboring genomic_regions for start stop_codons and splicing signals compared to previous homology_based gene_finding algorithms genblastg is able to leverage the vast improvement in speed and search quality of blast made in last years since its first publication and benefit from the wide acceptance and availability of the program this hypothesis has been evaluated in nematode plant and human_genomes our tests show that genblastg is extremely fast while providing better performance than previous_algorithms in terms of specificity and sensitivity we first tested the performance of genblastg in predicting genes in the genome of the model_organism caenorhabditis_elegans c elegans sequencing using c elegans proteins as queries for each gene prediction run for genblastg we used genblasta defined genomic_region together all contained hsps as input while for genewise and exonerate we used a protein as query and the corresponding homologous genomic_region returned by genblasta as the genomic search_space thus for all three programs we used genblasta defined genomic_regions as gene search spaces we found that genblastg runs considerably faster than genewise the arguably most widely used homology_based gene prediction program and exonerate especially when it runs in the exhaustive mode genblastg runs faster than exonerate even when it runs at the less accurate heuristic mode this high_speed of genblastg is not achieved by sacrificing its performance in fact when genblastg is used to remap c elegans proteins to the c elegans genomes it outperforms both genewise and exonerate in generating genes with high_sensitivity at full_length transcript_level supplementary_information it performs similarly to genewise and exonerate at the exon and nucleotide levels the better performance comes from the high_quality of hsps returned by blast and genblastgs effort of maximizing similarity to the query gene in defining exons genblastg also performs favorably in predicting genes in different including distantly_related genomes we evaluated its performance against genewise and exonerate in predicting genes in arabidopsis_thaliana genome using rice oryza_sativa l ssp japonica proteins that are fully supported by cdnas as queries these two speciesdiverged from their common_ancestor more than million_years we divided query proteins in eight categories each of which has a certain global percentage identity pid between query rice proteins and their orthologous_proteins in a thaliana we then calculated the percentage of the predicted proteins in a thaliana that are identical thus perfectly predicted to the curated orthologs in a thaliana as shown in for pid of of genblastg predicted a thaliana gene models are base_pair to base_pair identical to curated orthologs in a thaliana in contrast the percentage of correct transcripts predicted by genewise is only this study clearly shows that there is a high correlation between a correct prediction of transcripts and the similarity between query genes and their orthologs blast has been extremely successful as a tool for finding local_alignments with both high_sensitivity and speed however the large number of isolated local_alignments in the form of hsps cannot be readily and effectively interpreted due to the lack of obvious organization that describes the gene structure from which hsps are extracted genblastg which builds on the success of genblasta presents an approach that constructs the gene models directly from the hsps returned by blast with the intention of leveraging the wide success of blast our study shows that genblastg can find gene models much faster than existing homology_based gene_finders including genewise and exonerate while providing better performance than these programs
