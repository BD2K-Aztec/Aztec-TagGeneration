data_and biotextquest a knowledge integration platform for literature mining and concept discovery the iterative process of finding relevant_information in biomedical_literature and performing bioinformatics analyses might result in an endless loop for an inexperienced user considering the exponential_growth of scientific corpora and the plethora of tools designed to mine pubmed v r and related biological_databases herein we describe biotextquest a web based_interactive knowledge exploration platform with significant advances to its predecessor biotextquest aiming to bridge processes such as bioentity recognition functional_annotation document clustering and data_integration towards literature mining and concept discovery biotextquest enables pubmed and omim querying retrieval of abstracts related to a targeted request and optimal detection of genes proteins molecular_functions pathways and biological_processes within the retrieved documents the front end interface facilitates the browsing of document clustering per subject the analysis of term co occurrence the generation of tag clouds containing highly represented terms per cluster and at a glance popup windows with information about relevant_genes and proteins moreover to support experimental research biotextquest addresses integration of its primary functionality with biological repositories and software_tools able to deliver further bio informatics services the google like interface extends beyond simple use by offering a range of advanced parameterization for expert users we demonstrate the functionality of biotextquest through several exemplary research scenarios including author disambiguation functional term enrichment knowledge acquisition and concept discovery linking major human_diseases such as obesity and ageing availability the service is accessible at http bioinformatics med the tremendous growth of biomedical_literature and biological data_repositories has become a true challenge for researchers who wish to follow in detail the developments in rapidly_growing fields currently pubmed contains million publications and information about biological_entities such as genes proteins pathways and sequences which is stored and distributed by several repositories worldwide therefore targeted information_retrieval from literature and other data collections often becomes a complicated and tedious task when searching with available engines as it regularly results to hundreds_or of records typically not sorted by relevance and often changing on parameterization or query rephrasing despite the plethora of proposed tools aiming to make document searching easier more efficient and targeted literature mining is still an open area of research_tools designed to tackle this problem can be classified in five categories i tools for ranking search results ii tools for document clustering in several topics iii tools for semantic annotation and display iv tools for predicting relations between bioentities and or concepts and v tools extending pubmed functionality by improving the search interface notable tools for result ranking include quertle medlineranker caipirini to whom correspondence should be addressed the field of text_mining in life and health_sciences expands rapidly considering the exponential_growth of biomedical_literature while techniques such as ner information_extraction co occurrence analysis have become more mature the field is still in its infancy as most of these approaches have only been used for pubmed based abstract centric searches currently a limited number of tools succeed in automatically bridging literature mining information_extraction integration with external repositories and implementation of workflows for further bioinformatics_analysis herein we present biotextquest a platform principally developed to bridge the gaps between these complementary areas with pubmed and omim repositories as starting points biotextquest currently offers automated literature extraction identification of significant bioentity terms term based document clustering co occurrence analysis as well as integration with a rich collection of biological_databases and automated bioinformatics_analysis while initial versions of this platform focused only on document clustering biotextquest adds a significant set of novel features supplementary a description of the most salient characteristics of established tools in the field are presented in supplementary table s and a thorough comparison of biotextquest with these tools is summarized in supplementary table s we do believe that a gold_standard benchmark_dataset or process is largely missing to objectively measure the performance of any such tool it is worth stressing that this is a significant challenge partly because different text_mining tools are built to address different questions evidently the biocreative challenge or similar community driven initiatives may become the proper forum for designing and implementing such a gold_standard benchmark process biotextquest can thus serve as a powerful_tool in the fields of biomedical_literature mining and data_integration by aiding users in concept discovery and new hypothesis_generation enhancing our arsenal in the efforts to tackle the complexity of biological text
