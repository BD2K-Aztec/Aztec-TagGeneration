structural_bioinformatics trfolder w a web_server for telomerase_rna structure_prediction in yeast genomes trfolder w is a web_server capable of predicting core_structures of telomerase_rna tr in yeast genomes trfolder is a command_line python toolkit for tr specific structure_prediction we developed a web version built on the django web framework lever aging the work done previously to include enhancements to increase flexibility of usage to date there are five core sub structures commonly found in tr of fungal_species which are the template region downstream pseudoknot boundary element core closing stem and triple_helix the aim of trfolder w is to use the five core_structures as fundamental units to predict potential tr genes for yeast and to provide a user_friendly interface moreover the application of trfolder w can be extended to predict the characteristic structure on species other than fungal_species availability the web_server trfolder w is available at http the ability of telomerase to repair telomeres increases the cell_division cycles of a lineage each of which otherwise shortens the telomeres telomerase_rna tr is one fundamental component of telomerase secondary_structure facilitates identifying tr genes which are highly_divergent in their sequences compared to the sequences the secondary_structures of tr are much more conserved there are few existing computational_tools that can accurately_predict tr structures the difficulties are mainly caused by the extensive variance in tr sequences and stem_loop length and structures such as the pseudoknot in our previous work trfolder showed a high_accuracy for known yeast tr structures folding and gave predictions with high_confidence for unknown yeast tr structures the reported limitations of usage of trfolder mainly focus on installation troubleshooting and the template position requirement therefore we developed a web version of trfolder capable of pseudoknot prediction without input of the template position
