message from the iscb iscb accomplishment by a senior scientist award given to s ren brunak message from the iscb downloaded from the international_society for computational_biology iscb recognizes an established scientist each year with the accomplishment by a senior scientist award for the significant_contributions he or she has made to the field this award is bestowed to scientists who have contributed to the advancement of computational_biology and bio informatics through their research service and education work professor sren brunak of the novo nordisk foundation center for protein research in copenhagen denmark has been selected as the winner of the accomplishment by a senior scientist award the iscb awards committee chaired by dr bonnie berger of the massachusetts institute of technology in the usa selected brunak as the winner brunak will receive this award and deliver a keynote address at the intelligent systems for molecular_biology meeting ismb being held in orlando florida on july ismb is iscbs world class annual_meeting that brings together computational_biologists and interdisciplinary scientists from around the globe brunaks early interest in physics began with a childhood friendship with jakob bohr grandson of nobel laureate physicist niels bohr he considers this early informal exposure to physics instrumental in developing his interest in the field but acknowledges that his physics teacher in primary_school also nurtured his interest brunak said i was primed by the fact that one of my childhood friends was jakob bohr i grew up close to this family maybe i was therefore listening a little more to what the physics teacher would come up with he was good at turning deep questions into something that could be understood by kids our age brunak went on to study physics formally as a graduate student but first took a detour in astronomy he recalled first i went into astronomy but i found it increasingly difficult to explain at dinner parties the importance of astronomy he then completed his master of science in physics in at the niels bohr institute university of copenhagen i had been fascinated by computers my masters thesis was titled the physics of computation in danish computerens fysik and i studied what happens in the computer when it computes i was inspired by the work of rolf landauer and charles bennett at ibm they worked on determining if you could compute without dissipating heat in reversible physical_processes where no information would be discarded it was brunaks interest in the work of bennett that stimulated his interest in biology bennett used dna transcription as an example of how a computation a copy operation can be done without dissipating a lot of energy my thesis was also about computation processes in the brain which are related to machine_learning its also about throwing information away so what you are after is distilled out of the data in the big_data context there is a huge information reduction need so my experience with the physics of computation has inspired me when designing machine_learning that use a lot of information and end up with a yes or no for example answering the question of whether a protein_structure is helical or not at a given position in the amino_acid a lot of bioinformatics is about throwing information away in a smart way so what you are really after is retained brunak completed his ph d in computational_biology in in the department of structural_properties of materials at the technical university of denmark he then went on in to become founder and director of the center for biological sequence_analysis at the technical university of denmark a large center that still exists his early work in bioinformatics focused on protein_structure he recalled i worked with protein_structure with machine_learning meetings were small data_sets were small we tried to get a lot out of little we were raised in the data poor era the machine_learning approach is not only good for boiling down but also for extracting even during this era of limited data brunak
