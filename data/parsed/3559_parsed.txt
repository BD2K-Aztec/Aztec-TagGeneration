sequence_analysis picmi mapping point_mutations on genomes motivation several international collaborations and local projects are producing extensive catalogues of genomic_variations that are supplementing existing collections such as the omim catalogue the flood of this type of data will keep increasing and especially it will be relevant to a wider user base including not only molecular_biologists geneticists and bioinformaticians but also clinical_researchers mapping the observed variations sometimes only described at the amino_acid level on a genome identifying whether they affect a gene andif sowhether they also affect different isoforms of the same gene is a time consuming and often frustrating task results the picmi server is an easy to use tool for quickly mapping one or more amino_acid or nucleotide variations on a genome and its products including alternatively_spliced the availability of novel high_throughput for identifying variations both pathological and physiological in sequenced_genomes is producing a wealth of data that is readily available to researchers these data will continue to be produced at an unprecedented speed not only in projects based on large international collaborations but also in individual labs and will add to existing collections such as omim swissprot the uniprot and the related mutation portal swissvar it can be easily foreseen not only that more and more data will be available but also that the scientists who will need to access and analyze them will not be limited to molecular_biologists geneticists and bioinformaticians as it has been mostly the case so_far but will include clinical_researchers and in the future also medical_doctors this implies that tools to easily access and interpret these data should be provided to the community and that they have to be simple reliable and user_friendly given one or more variations of interest one needs to map them back to the corresponding genome verify in which region they fall and if they map to a coding_region understand whether they affect and in which way one or more of the isoforms of the gene this task is not made easier by the fact that the version of the genome might have changed since the time of identification of the mutation
