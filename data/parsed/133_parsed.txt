genetic and population analysis admix'em a flexible framework for forward time simulations of hybrid populations with selection and mate_choice we introduce a new forward time simulator admixem that allows for rapid and realistic simulations of admixed_populations with selection complex selection can be achieved through user_defined fitness and mating preference probability functions users can specify realistic gen_omic landscapes and model neutral snps in addition to sites under selection admixem is designed to simulate selection in admixed_populations but can also be used as a general_population simulator usage and examples are in the supplement availability_and c and openmp supports bit linux unix like platforms https github com melop admixem population simulators are invaluable to empiricists since they can be used to test alternative_hypotheses and estimate population parameters e g approximate_bayesian population simulators can also be used to design experiments and estimate power here we present a new population simulator called admixem though primarily designed to simulate selection during admixture it is also a general_purpose population simulator admixem differs from similar programs e g simupop nemo quantinemo forsim ffpopsim because it allows users to easily simulate complex selection e g epistasis selection on a phenotype controlled by many loci and non random mating e g frequency dependent preferences sexual imprinting for comparison to other simulators see supplementary table s to be useful to researchers population simulators should be fast easy to use and able to simulate scenarios of realistic complexity currently available coalescent simulators are computationally_efficient but have limited implementation of selection for example coalescent simulators such as ms and macs do not implement selection while others such as msms only allow for selection at a single locus in contrast forward time simulators can simulate more biologically_realistic selection scenarios but are inevitably less efficient several previously_developed forward time simulators allow users to incorporate demographic_processes and selection at multiple_loci e g however existing forward time simulators either offer limited choices of selection scenarios or require further programming by the user e g reducing usability in contrast admixem can simulate complex selection without requiring further programming for example admixem can implement sexual_selection as a function of social and genetic_background e g frequency dependent or learned sexual_selection and allows incorporation of indirect genetic effects to simulate such scenarios users need only modify selection functions in a v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com text_file see supplementary_materials though complex selection scenarios require additional computational_resources admixem is easily parallelizable the program is implemented in c with an object oriented structure is easily compiled self contained and includes an interactive interface for simulation setup and scripts to export data recently we used admixem to develop a new model of hybrid speciation
