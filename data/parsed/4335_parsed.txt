sequence_analysis sortaller predicting allergens using substantially optimized algorithm on allergen family featured peptides sortaller is an online allergen classifier based on allergen family featured peptide affp dataset and normalized blast e values which establish the featured vectors for support_vector svm affps are allergen specific peptides panned from irredundant allergens and harbor perfect information with noise fragments eliminated because of their similarity to non allergens sortaller performed significantly better than other existing software and reached a perfect balance with high_specificity and sensitivity for discriminating allergenic proteins from several independent datasets of protein_sequences of diverse sources also highlighting with the matthews correlation_coefficient mcc as high as fast running speed and rapidly predicting a batch of amino_acid with a single click availability_and http sortaller allergy symptoms affect more than of the population in industrialized_countries the allergy mechanism is an immunological reaction against an allergen that is often ige_mediated but non ige_mediated i e cell mediated or mixed ige and non ige_mediated reaction may be more important in food_allergy biotechnology is rapidly developing which involves the introduction of novel proteins into drugs or foods and those proteins can be allergenic it is essential to avoid transferring a gene that encodes a major allergenic protein from any source into a drug food crop that did not previously contain that protein to accurately discriminate candidate_genes from allergens before transferring those into a drug food organism would aid preventive efforts to curb the rising incidence of allergies sequence comparison of novel proteins for similarity to known allergens is a critical part of the weight of evidence approach used to ascertain the safety of the gene s to be transformed over
