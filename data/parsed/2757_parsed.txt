low_homology protein threading motivation the challenge of template_based lies in the recognition of correct templates and generation of accurate sequence template alignments homologous information has proved to be very powerful in detecting remote_homologs as demonstrated by the state of the art profile_based method hhpred however hhpred does not fare well when proteins under consideration are low_homology a protein is low_homology if we cannot obtain sufficient amount of homologous information for it from existing protein sequence_databases results we present a profile entropy dependent scoring_function for low_homology protein threading this method will model correlation among various protein features and determine their relative importance according to the amount of homologous information available when proteins under consideration are low_homology our method will rely more on structure information otherwise homologous information experimental_results indicate that our threading method greatly outperforms the best profile_based method hhpred and all the top casp servers on low_homology proteins tested on the casp hard targets our threading method is also better than all the top casp servers but slightly worse than zhang server this is significant considering that zhang server and other top casp servers use a combination of multiple structure_prediction techniques including consensus method multiple template modeling template free modeling and model refinement while our method is a classical single_template based threading method without any post threading refinement template_based i e homology_modeling and protein threading is becoming more powerful and important for structure_prediction along with the pdb growth and the improvement of prediction protocols current pdb may contain all templates for single_domain according to the seminal studies in this implies that the structures of many new proteins can be predicted using template based_methods the error of a template based model comes from template selection and sequence template alignment in addition to the structure difference between the sequence and template at higher sequence_identity template based models can be accurate enough to be useful in virtual ligand screening designing site_directed experiments small ligand_docking prediction and function prediction when sequence_identity is below it is difficult to recognize the best template and generate accurate sequence template alignments so the resultant models have a wide to whom correspondence should be addressed range of accuracies shown that of all the models in modbase are from alignments in which the sequence and template share_sequence therefore to greatly enlarge the pool of useful models it is essential to improve fold_recognition and alignment_method for the sequence and template with sequence_identity considering that currently there are millions of proteins without experimental_structures even a slight improvement in prediction_accuracy can have a significant impact on large_scale structure_prediction and its applications as reported in melo and even improvement in the accuracy of fold assessment for the million models in modbase can correctly identify more models the alignment_accuracy is determined by a scoring_function used to drive sequence template alignment when the sequence and template are not close homologs their alignment can be significantly_improved by incorporating homologous information i e sequence_profile into the scoring_function hhpred possibly the best profile_based method is such a representative hhpred uses only sequence_profile and predicted_secondary for remote homolog detection it works very well when proteins under consideration have a large amount of homologous information in the public sequence_databases but not as well when proteins under consideration are low_homology a protein is low_homology if there is no sufficient homologous information available for it in the sequence_databases see section for quantitative definition many threading methods such as muster phyre and sparks sp sp aim at going beyond profile based_methods by combining homologous information with a variety of structure information however recent casp evaluations demonstrate that hhpred actually is as good as if not better than these threading methods clearly it is very challenging to outperform hhpred by simply adding structure information into template based_methods in fact claimed that presently the advantage of including the structural_information in the fitness_function cannot be clearly proven in benchmarks this article_describes a new scoring_function for protein threading in this function the relative importance of structure information is determined according to the amount of homologous information available when proteins under consideration are low_homology our method will rely more on structure information otherwise homologous information this method enables us to significantly_advance template_based over profile based_methods such as hhpred especially for low_homology proteins the capability of predicting low_homology proteins without close homologs in the pdb is particularly important because i a large portion of proteins in the pdb which will be used as templates belong to this class and ii a majority number of the pfam families without solved structureshomologous information is very effective in detecting remote_homologs as evidenced by the profile_based method hhpred which performed better than or as well as several top threading methods in recent casp events this paper proposes a new threading method and shows that homologous information is not sufficient for lowhomology protein threading in particular when neff we can improve alignment_accuracy over profile based_methods by using more structure information our experimental result indicates that our method outperforms all the top casp servers on lowhomology targets neff our method also performs well on both the casp hard and easy targets and is slightly worse than the best casp server this result is encouraging considering that the top casp servers use a combination of multiple techniques to do structure_prediction while our method is only a classical single_template based threading method our method is clearly better than several threading based_methods such as muster hhpred and phyre on both low_homology and hard casp_targets the capability of predicting structures for low_homology proteins is very important the pfam_database contains families without solved structures to predict structures for these families we have to rely on templates remotely similar to these families a simple statistics shows that and of the pfam families have neff and respectively in our current template database approximately one third of the templates have neff therefore if we align the pfam families to our templates oneby one around of the threading pairs will contain at least one protein with neff this is surprising given that the ncbi nr sequence database currently contains millions of protein_sequences along with the ncbi nr growth the neff values of the pfam families are also likely to increase it will be interesting to study how fast the neff values will increase the percentage of low_homology proteins in casp is much smaller than that in pfam only and of the casp_targets have neff and respectively that is the casp_targets are biased towards high_homology proteins this is not unexpected since the casp organizers obtain most of the targets from the worldwide structure genomics centers these centers tend to solve structures for the targets in a large pfam family to maximize the number of sequences within homology_modeling distance of the structures in the pdb a large pfam family contains many proteins and thus is more likely to have a large neff our data also show that most casp hard targets are lowhomology this is reasonable since it is very challenging to predict structures for a low_homology target however not all lowhomology targets are hard we can easily predict structures for low_homology targets i e t t t t and t as long as they have good templates the major_challenge we are facing now is to identify the best template for a given target as long as the best template can be identified we can generate a reasonable alignment as shown in since our new threading method demonstrates its superiority over other similar methods such as hhpred muster phyre and sp sp in particular on low_homology targets without close homologs in the pdb a natural extension of this work is to incorporate our new method into zhang server to see how much we can advance the state of the art of protein modeling
