point_estimates in phylogenetic reconstructions motivation the construction of statistics for summarizing posterior samples returned by a bayesian phylogenetic study has so_far been hindered by the poor geometric insights available into the space of phylogenetic_trees and ad_hoc methods such as the derivation of a consensus tree makeup for the ill definition of the usual concepts of posterior mean while bootstrap methods mitigate the absence of a sound concept of variance yielding satisfactory_results with sufficiently concentrated posterior distributions such methods fall short of providing a faithful summary of posterior distributions if the data do not offer compelling_evidence for a single topology results building upon previous work of billera et_al summary_statistics such as sample mean median and variance are defined as the geometric median fr echet mean and variance respectively their computation is enabled by recently_published works and embeds an algorithm for computing shortest_paths in the space of trees studying the phylogeny of a set of plants where several tree topolo gies occur in the posterior sample the posterior mean balances correctly the contributions from the different topologies where a consensus tree would be biased comparisons of the posterior mean median and consensus trees with the ground_truth using simulated_data also reveals the benefits of a sound averaging method when reconstructing phylogenetic_trees availability_and we provide two independent implementations of the algorithm for computing fr echet means geometric medians and variances in the space of phylogenetic_trees phylogenetic_trees are central to the study of evolution so much that the sketch of a tree of species by sir charles darwin has become the icon of this theory nowadays trees relating units of selection be it functional_domains genes or species are structures of primary interest for systematists but also instrumental to a wealth of other studies where evolutionary correlations need to be accounted for various statistical_models pertaining to diverse types of observables can be found in the literature as well as methods for estimating their parameters and reconstructing a phylogenetic_tree some estimation methods proceed by maximizing a posterior_distribution or a likelihood_function and are amenable to an exact reconstruction of the optimal tree but bayesian phylogenetic_analyses generally produce posterior distributions that are best explored by generating posterior samples while a large enough posterior sample offers a faithful representation of the posterior knowledge it is of little scientific interest unless summarized by some statistics a summary can balance contributions from the different tree_topologies occurring in the sample resulting in a legit phylogenetic_tree or combine them within a phylogenetic network here we focus on the former showing how to build a phylogenetic_tree that faithfully represents the sample in its entirety despite competing topologies occur provided a unique topology with n edges occurs in the sample each tree including its edge lengths can be identified by a point in the positive orthant of the euclidean_space r n performing an average of the sample in this linear representation is a straightforward operation which produces a legit posterior mean tree if more than one tree_topology occurs the trees are no longer mapped all to the same linear space and the posterior mean is ill defined selecting the a posteriori most probable tree_topology may seem a sound alternative however with the unpleasant consequence of neglecting all the sampled trees of different topology and therefore would not provide a satisfactory representation of the posterior the construction of a consensus tree using an absolute majority rule to decide which one among competing edges should be retained has been widely_adopted by the interested community as the method of choice to summarize posterior samples of phylogenetic_trees on the theoretical side decision theoretic justifications of this construction have been proposed however they are built upon loss functions that neglect edge lengths focusing only on the tree_topology besides from the authors point_of it is also a rather conservative_approach as the absence of an absolute majority among edges results in the inclusion of none of them thereby producing unresolved branching points the extended majorityrule consensus method also known as greedy consensus method has been introduced to remedy this drawback by adding edges with support despite this improvement the consensus methods neglect much of the available information in a sample by ignoring the context in which an edge occurs i e the remaining topology of the tree as well as all other edge lengths reporting a posterior mean that balances the contributions from each topology including edge lengths rather than isolated edges would therefore be of utmost interest building upon the work published by who deciphered the geometric_structure of the space of phygenetic trees and first proposed a construction of the tree space sometimes also called bhv tree space where bhv is an acronym of billera holmes and vogtmann the purpose of this article is to show how the computation of the posterior mean of a sample of phylogenetic_trees can be achieved by simply reaching out for the appropriate geometry the bhv space is obtained by gluing together the positive orthants of the linear space associated to to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com each topology so that a point in this space identifies both a tree_topology and the lengths of the corresponding edges the adjacency structure between any two orthants reflects the edges shared by the two corresponding topologies and permits the definition of paths visiting several orthants any two trees are connected by at least one path and the one with minimal length is called a geodesic therefore the length of a geodesic qualifies as a distance_function between phylogenetic_trees and offers a theoretically and practically appealing alternative to existing distances e g nni or the robinsonfoulds distance furthermore using implicit characterizations of the posterior mean and median as minimizers of appropriate loss functions algorithms developed by bacak bacak sturm compute an approximation of these statistics by walking along geodesics here the determination of the geodesics is done in polynomial time thanks to an algorithm owing to owen and provan this article gathers and combines technical results scattered across multiple mathematics papers into a general statistical_framework for analyzing posterior distributions over phylogenetic_trees easily_accessible to the target readership namely practitioners in bayesian phylogenetics certainly many other applications exist where computing an average phylogenetic_tree is of great_importance the methods presented here are not restricted to bayesian statistics yet in this context they allow to recover basic statistical concepts such as the posterior mean and median as well as a notion of variance to measure the posterior uncertainty after a gentle introduction to the geometry of the tree space in section the geometric median and fr echet mean over this space are constructed in section the algorithms computing those quantities are outlined in section while section shows the method in action and illustrates how it compares with the majority rule consensus method the content of this section is intended to illustrate the behavior of the posterior mean and median in comparison with the majority rule consensus tree which is for instance computed by mrbayes following a formal argument that relates these two estimates when extremely_large or little information is available the posterior distributions derived from real_and are investigated in a way that best illustrates the different outcomes yielded by the existing and the proposed approaches a prerequisite is the adoption of a specific statistical_model which is outlined first by recognizing the global geometric nature of the space of phylogenetic_trees this article shows that the fundamental statistical notions defined over linear spaces such as sample mean median and variance can be generalized to more complex spaces such as the tree space besides the sheer recovery of well defined fundamental statistical quantities in the particular setting of phylogenetic_studies this study also demonstrates critical differences in the behavior of the posterior mean and the consensus tree the reconstruction of a consensus tree retains splits that occur in at least half of the samples this absolute majority rule prevents the introduction of splits favored by sheer fluctuations but also aims to maximize the information extracted from the sample the length of the retained edges is indeed often simply set to the average length of their occurrences in the sample so that the lengths of the discarded edges never enter the determination of the consensus tree as illustrated on a real_dataset by the neglection of a fraction of the sample results in biased_estimates where edge lengths are systematically overestimated from the perspective of the geometry of the tree space the extent of the bias born by the consensus tree is however tightly related to the concentration of the posterior_distribution which decreases the amount of information dropped in the reconstruction_process and the simulation based study shown above confirms that the consensus tree and the posterior average disagree mostly when there exists no compelling_evidence for a single topology illustrated on small_datasets the consensus tree appears dramatically further of the generating tree than the posterior mean as a result of its neglection of a fraction of the information brought by the sample the proper definition of a variance for a sample of phylogenetic_trees has consequences that should not be overlooked and is believed by the authors to bear even more potential for applications not only is the reporting of the credibility of the bayesian estimate made simple by this quantity but it also opens the way to the generalization of variance based studies of samples of phylogenetic_trees including principal_components a task already tackled by nye measuring the spread of a set of trees is a useful tool not only to quantify the posterior uncertainty for instance in a recent studydeveloped an information_theoretic measure to quantify the incongruence of gene_trees note both statistics were evaluated separately on datasets of length m and
