systems_biology pathvisio faceted search an exploration tool for multi_dimensional navigation of large pathways purpose the pathvisio faceted search plugin helps users explore and understand complex pathways by overlaying experimental_data and data from webservices such as ensembl biomart onto diagrams drawn using formalized notations in pathvisio the plugin then provides a filtering mechanism known as a faceted search to find and highlight diagram nodes e g genes and proteins of interest based on imported data the tool additionally provides a flexible scripting mechanism to handle complex queries availability the pathvisio faceted search plugin is compatible with pathvisio and above pathvisio is compatible with windows mac os x and linux the plugin documentation example diagrams and groovy scripts are available at http pathvisio org wiki pathvisiofacetedsearchhelp the plugin is free open_source and licensed by the apache license contact pathway diagrams are important tools that facilitate understanding biological_systems by aggregating many disparate observations into concise representations there is a growing trend to use formal graphical notations such as the molecular_interaction map mim notation and the systems_biology sbgn and formats such as biopax to relate greater mechanistic detail about pathway interactions than is typical in proteinprotein_interaction the wellknown tool cytoscape possesses powerful annotation and search capabilities but it is focused on network_analysis not diagram rendering this tool lacks the capabilities necessary to render diagrams that are fully compliant with mim or sbgn the cysbgn plugin is the best current attempt but has some rendering problems such as z ordering issues pathvisio http pathvisio org is a free open_source tool built to display and edit diagrams using formalized notations pathvisio is capable of visualizing microarray and metabolomics_data similar to genmapp but lacks other search features including the visualization and search of nominal data which limits analysis especially on the growing number of pathways in the related wikipathways database here we present a robust search plugin for pathvisio using the faceted search method that is found on many e commerce websites for product search using discrete attributes known as facets facet entries can be selected to filter down to content of interest and faceted searching is found in bioinformatics_tools including the protein_data http www rcsb org facets allow users to attach data to pathways using biological identifiers any piece of data that can be looked up in a database based on identifiers such as hgnc tp can be used as a facet for example a user might wish to know which pathway proteins are involved in cell_division are targets of cancer drugs and are overexpressed in an experiment this plugin allows users to easily ask complex queries of biological_pathways and identify biological_entities of interest through the powerful search capability on user data webservice data and data processed using its scripting capability the pathvisio faceted search plugin was designed to help users understand complex pathways by making it easier to crossreference diagrams with data from multiple sources both local experimental_data and via webservices faceted search is a widely used search method that overcomes the limitations of more conventional methods to easily find relevant items in the future we plan to introduce a visual programming interface to simplify the groovy scripting component of the plugin and make the flexibility of this scripting support accessible to more users the faceted search plugin used to identify genes with a select number of variants related to lymphomas and located on specified chromosomes resulting in two highlighted nodes
