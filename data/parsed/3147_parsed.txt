gene_expression multi level mixed_effects for bead arrays motivation bead arrays are becoming a popular platform for high_throughput expression arrays however the number of the beads targeting a transcript and the variation of their intensities differ from sample to sample in these arrays this property results in different accuracy of expression intensities of a transcript across arrays results we provide evidence with publicly_available spike in data that the false_discovery of differential_expression is reduced by modeling bead level variability with a multi level mixed_effects we compare the performance of our proposed model to existing analysis methods for bead arrays the unweighted t test and other weighted methods additionally we provide theoretical insights into when the multi level mixed_effects outperforms other methods finally we provide a software_program for differential_expression using the multi level mixed_effects that analyzes tens_of of genes efficiently availability the software_program is freely_available on web atbead arrays are becoming a popular platform to generate highthroughput expression data one of the advantages of the technology is that all beads targeting a transcript have exactly the same sequence and length this property rids the concerns for averaging intensities from probes with different affinities and a common target transcript however in bead arrays the number of beads targeting a transcript differs from sample to sample usually between and beads moreover variation of the bead level intensities targeting a common transcript differs across samples given these differences in the number of beads and the variation of their intensities the average expression intensity for a given transcript will have varying precision across samples although measures of precision are typically generated along with the computed average gene_expression intensities it is commonplace to simply compare the intensity levels across experimental_groups using analysis_of anova more than two groups or ttest two groups ignoring the bead level variability this approach is problematic for example the standard_error of the average is inversely proportional to square_root of the number of beads and to whom correspondence should be addressed intensities for a transcript averaged over beads will be four times more variable than that over beads recently there are increasing efforts to incorporate bead level technical variability as weights in linear methods for example used variance of bead level intensities as the inverse weight in comparing two sample groups proposed a test_statistic based on unweighted average of bead level intensities but used bead level variability to compute standard_errors any reasonable use of bead variability will likely improve the accuracy of differential_expression however to our knowledge formal consideration of under which model the weighting_scheme is optimal or comparisons between different weighting_schemes have not been reported noticeably in all these weighting methods weights are completely determined by bead level technical variation and are independent of the magnitude of array level biological_variation our work adds to the body of research by modeling bead level variation by a multi level mixed_effects mlm under this model the weights for the bead averages are determined by the relative magnitudes of both beadlevel technical variation and array level biological_variation in addition using publicly_available spike in data we compare the false_discovery fdr sensitivity specificity empirical type_i and empirical power of our proposed model to six other methods in the dataset the number of beads ranged from to for all spikes bead types the largest bead level standard_error among arrays was at least times larger than the smallest standard_error these observations confirmed that the accuracy of mean intensity differs greatly across samples justifying the need to incorporate bead level technical variability in the analysis
