computational probing protein_protein targeting small_molecules downloaded from motivation with the booming of interactome studies a lot of interactions can be measured in a high_throughput way and large_scale datasets are available it is becoming apparent that many different types of interactions can be potential_drug compared with inhibition of a single protein inhibition of proteinprotein_interaction ppi is promising to improve the specificity with fewer adverse_side also it greatly broadens the drug_target search_space which makes the drug_target difficult computational_methods are highly desired to efficiently provide candidates for further experiments and hold the promise to greatly accelerate the discovery of novel drug_targets results here we propose a machine_learning to predict ppi targets in a genomic wide scale specifically we develop a computational_method named as preppitar to predict ppis as drug_targets by uncovering the potential associations between drugs and ppis first we survey the databases and manually construct a gold_standard positive dataset for drug and ppi interactions this effort leads to a dataset with associations among ppis and fda_approved and allows us to build models to learn the association_rules from the data second we characterize drugs by profiling in chemical_structure drug atc_code annotation and side effect space and represent ppi similarity by a symmetrical s kernel_based on protein amino_acid then the drugs and ppis are correlated by kronecker product kernel finally a support_vector svm is trained to predict novel associations between drugs and ppis we validate our preppitar method on the well established gold_standard dataset by cross_validation we find that all chemical_structure drug atc_code and side effect information are predictive for ppi target moreover we can increase the ppi target prediction coverage by integrating_multiple data_sources follow_up database_search and pathway analysis indicate that our new predictions are worthy of future experimental_validation conclusion in conclusion preppitar can serve as a useful tool for ppi target discovery and provides a general heterogeneous data integrative framework systems_biology emphasizes to understand the complex_biological from interactions beyond the single_molecules this paradigm_shift pushes the generations of large sets of interactions called interactome one typical example is to measure proteinprotein_interaction by yeast_two and mass_spectrometry protein_protein ppis are building_blocks for the majority of biological_processes in the living_cell beyond the single protein they are natural to serves as the basic elements to be perturbed by drugs in the treatment cure prevention or diagnosis of disease indeed targeting ppis with small_molecular inhibitors is of increasing interests both in academia as well as in the pharmaceutical_industry many different types of interactions can be inhibited using drug like small_molecules searching potential drug ppi targets can serve both therapeutic purpose and useful chemical tool for basic_science compared with inhibition of a single protein inhibition of ppis is promising to broaden the drug_target search_space moreover drugs targeting such interactions are more specific and likely to act with fewer side_effects than conventional medication influencing whole cell functions however its challenging to find ppi target by wet experiment since it suffers from the dynamics of ppis and the particular problem of more exposed and less defined binding_sites computational_methods are then highly desired to provide candidates for further experimental_verification and then accelerate the mapping of ppi targets on a large_scale the initial challenge is the discovery of specific ppis and in turn identification of those molecules that are druggable to address_this computational_techniques were developed to identify small_molecules as ppi inhibitors through a rationalization of the ppi inhibitor chemical_space and the design of ppi focused compound libraries which deposited the structures of ppis as protein_complexes and their ligands following the identification of a suitable ppi the next step involves study of the binding_interface and ligand_design within a binding_interface only a small number of highly_conserved amino_acid hot_spots are crucial for the interaction thus the key problem in ppi inhibitors discovery becomes looking for the location of hot_spots from large_surface of the ppi interface previous work mainly focused on fragment based_methods which attempted to discover the compounds that are druggable and ligandable by matching three_dimensional structure of molecules with the surface_area of ppi interface structure information is required in fragment based_methods however only a small fraction of proteins have well established structures thus this class of methods is restricted in small_scale with the rapid development of high_throughput experimental methodologies genome_wide ppis in some model_organisms including escherichia_coli helicobacter_pylori saccharomyces_cerevisiae caenorhabditis_elegans drosophila_melanogaster and homo_sapiens have been established meanwhile some curated databases deposit high_quality drug_targets data including kyoto_encyclopedia kegg biomolecular relations in information_transmission and expression brite brenda supertarget and drugbank these valuable information_sources together provide a great opportunity to understand the mechanism of ppi targets from the viewpoint of interactome that is drug ppi associations could be constructed based on genome_wide ppis and high_quality drug_targets data most importantly the understandable rules for drug ppi associations can be learned by a statistical predictor based on these associations here we develop a machine_learning framework to predict ppis targets preppitar by dissecting the drug ppi associations in a largescale manner we observed that the current available data_sources describe drugs biological_function in living_cell from different levels and different aspects for example drugs chemical_structure provides information by the structure determines function paradigm atc_code annotation provides the therapeutic_effect at molecular level and side effect hints the unwanted effect at phenotype level one straightforward assumption is that drugs similar in one or more data source metrics will interact with similar ppis we demonstrate that drugs with similar chemical_structures atc_codes or sideeffects indeed associate with similar ppis then we propose the idea to integrate heterogeneous chemical_structure atc_code and sideeffect information_sources specifically drug and ppi are first characterized by their similarity based profiles and a kernel_function is then defined to correlate them finally the potential drug ppi associations are inferred by training a machine_learning model i e support_vector svm which is motivated by statistical_learning theory and has been successful on many different classification_problems in bioinformatics preppitar overcomes the main difficulty to integrate these data_sources from structure atc classification and side effect level which are highly heterogenous to make the learning feasible and validate preppitar by cross_validation we construct a well established dataset from scratch in total associations among ppis and fda_approved are collected from hprd and drugbank we find that all chemical_structure atc_code annotation and side effect information are predictive in different ways moreover drug ppi associations can be uncovered by combination of these three properties in addition database_search and pathway analysis indicate that our new predictions are worthy of future experimental_validation compared with single protein target prediction ppi target prediction can discover some dissimilar targets that is it is promising to broaden the drug_target search_space
