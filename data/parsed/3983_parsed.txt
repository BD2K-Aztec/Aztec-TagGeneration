resicon a method for the identification of dynamic domains hinges and interfacial regions in proteins motivation structure of most proteins is flexible identification and analysis of intramolecular motions is a complex problem breaking a structure into relatively rigid parts the so_called dynamic domains may help comprehend the complexity of proteins mobility we propose a new approach_called resicon residue_contacts analysis which performs this task by applying a data_mining analysis of an ensemble of protein configurations and recognizes dynamic domains hinges and interfacial regions by considering contacts between residues results dynamic domains found by resicon are more compact than those identified by two other popular_methods pisqrd and geostas the current analysis was carried_out using a known reference_set of nmr protein_structures as well as molecular_dynamics simulation_data of flap opening events in hiv_protease the more detailed analysis of hiv_protease dataset shows that resicon identified dynamic domains involved in structural changes of functional_importance availability_and the resicon server is available at url http dworkowa imdik pan pl ep resicon proteins are not static nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy and the spin_echo spectroscopy experiments show that in several cases it was proven that flexibility may be crucial to protein functionality although experimental methods provide only general clues about intramolecular motions molecular_dynamics md_simulations extend their reach by giving a higher_resolution pictureboth in space and timeof protein mobility by studying an nmr ensemble or md trajectory one may notice that it is composed of relatively rigid structural parts often referred to as dynamic domains domains in traditional sense are regarded as parts of the protein which are conserved in terms of evolution autonomous in terms of folding and or compact in terms of tertiary_structure such static domains are identified through sequence_homology structural analysis of a single configuration or both for conventional methods of identifying protein_domains based on multiple_sequences or a single structure see e g conversely dynamic domains depend on structural transitions performed by the protein a number of methods for identification of dynamic domains have been developed the simplest procedures are based on normal_mode which assumes a harmonic approximation of the potential_energy more advanced approaches v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com use the gaussian network model and analyze correlations in motions between the residues of the protein many other approaches have also been developed but all of them anticipate dynamic domains by analyzing a single structure of a protein another class of methods for dynamic domains assignment requires exactly two configurations see however the assumption that two representative structures encompass all relevant motions is rather speculative experimental and in silico methods reach beyond single structure representation and are capable of producing numerous configurations of a given protein rather than inferring dynamic domains from one or two structures a more natural approach would be to determine them based on an ensemble of configurations geostas is the only method known to us that analyzes a whole ensemble of configurations and assigns each residue to a dynamic domain although geostas can analyze not only proteins but also nucleic_acids it fails to discover dynamic domains whenever they rotate with respect to each other alternative_methods of analyzing ensembles of configurations assign residues to a static core or unstructured bundle see the purpose of this study was to develop a novel methodology named resicon capable of extracting dynamic domains from an ensemble of proteins configurations resicon analyzes strengths of contacts between residues based exclusively on geometrical changes occurring in the provided set of structures the set may be an nmr ensemble of configurations or snapshots produced in the course of an md_simulation resicons main functionality is to identify dynamic domains but it can also find hinges and interfacial interdomain regions
