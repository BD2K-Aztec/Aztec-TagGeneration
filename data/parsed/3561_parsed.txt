databases_and pido the primary_immunodeficiency ontology motivation primary_immunodeficiency pids are mendelian conditions of high phenotypic complexity and low incidence they usually manifest in toddlers and infants although they can also occur much later in life information about pids is often widely scattered throughout the clinical as well as the research literature and hard to find for both generalists as well as experienced clinicians semantic_web technologies coupled to clinical_information can go some way toward addressing this problem ontologies are a central component of such a system containing and centralizing knowledge about primary_immunodeficiencies in both a human and computer comprehensible form the development of an ontology of pids is therefore a central step toward developing informatics tools which can support the clinician in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases results we present pido the primary_immunodeficiency ontology pido characterizes pids in terms of the phenotypes commonly observed by clinicians during a diagnosis process phenotype terms in pido are formally defined using complex definitions based on qualities functions processes and structures we provide mappings to biomedical reference ontologies to ensure interoperability with ontologies in other domains based on pido we developed the pidfinder an ontology driven software prototype that can facilitate clinical_decision pido connects immunological knowledge across resources within a common framework and thereby enables translational_research and the development of medical_applications for the domain of immunology and primary_immunodeficiency availability the primary_immunodeficiency ontology is available under a creative commons attribution cc by licence at http code google com p pido the most recent public release of the ontology can always be found at
