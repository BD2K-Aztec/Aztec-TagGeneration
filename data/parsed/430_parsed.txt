a powerful approach for association analysis incorporating imprinting effects motivation for a diallelic marker locus the transmission_disequilibrium tdt is a simple and powerful design for genetic_studies the tdt was originally proposed for use in families with both parents available complete nuclear families and has further been extended to tdt for use in families with only one of the parents available incomplete nuclear families currently the increasing interest of the influence of parental imprinting on heritability indicates the importance of incorporating imprinting effects into the mapping of association variants results in this article we extend the tdt type statistics to incorporate imprinting effects and develop a series of new test_statistics in a general two stage framework for association studies our test_statistics enjoy the nature of family based designs that need no assumption of hardyweinberg equilibrium also the proposed methods accommodate complete and incomplete nuclear families with one or more affected children in the simulation_study we verify the validity of the proposed test_statistics under various scenarios and compare the powers of the proposed statistics with some existing test_statistics it is shown that our methods greatly improve the power for detecting association in the presence of imprinting effects we further demonstrate the advantage of our methods by the application of the proposed test_statistics to a rheumatoid_arthritis dataset genetic imprinting as an example of epigenetic_factors occurs when certain genes increase levels of expression through inheritance from one of the parental chromosomes have constructed an imprinted_gene database and of all mammalian genes are believed to show imprinting effects http igc otago ac nz abnormal expressions of imprinted_genes result in numerous human genetic_disorders including praderwilli beckwithwiedemann and angleman syndromes when the candidate to whom correspondence should be addressed gene of a disease under study is a marker allele per se or is in linkage_disequilibrium ld with a marker allele the parental asymmetric test pat was proposed and extended to examine imprinting effects in the absence of maternal effects using complete nuclear families nuclear families with both parents with one or multiple affected children in the case of missing genotypes among parents pat was proposed for incomplete nuclear families nuclear families with a single_parent with an arbitrary number of affected children based on a mixture of complete and incomplete nuclear families c pat a combination of pat and pat was suggested to increase the test power other methods for the detection of imprinting effects were generally derived in the framework of loglinear model leading to the likelihood_ratio when the genes are imprinted the performance of gene_mapping would be affected as a result studies on incorporating imprinting effects into genetic_linkage or association analysis have arisen the interest of researchers among the approaches a test_statistic termed tdti was constructed based on the extensions of the transmission_disequilibrium tdt and was shown to be more powerful than the conventional tdt in the presence of imprinting effects the tdti first employs a parent oforigin effects test_statistic poet to test for imprinting effects and then chooses the most appropriate statistic from a set of tdt type statistics which are tdt suitable for no imprinting effects tdt p the paternal version of tdt for maternal imprinting and tdt m the maternal version of tdt for paternal imprinting to test for association note that the tdti only accommodates complete nuclear families and thus is not suitable for incomplete families tdti which is essentially the t of the tdt tests is a valid linkage association test in the presence of imprinting effects for incomplete nuclear families on the other hand genetic_association works over short_distance in genome and provides fine_mapping of genetic_loci detected by linkage in this article we aim to develop a class of test_statistics to test for association incorporating imprinting effects in the presence of linkage first we propose a test_statistic termed tdti for use in complete nuclear families like tdti tdti is also derived under a twostage process where we employ a more powerful test pat instead of poet in the first stage to test if there is paternal maternal orpage
