autosite an automated approach for pseudo ligands prediction from ligand_binding identification to predicting key ligand atoms motivation the identification of ligand_binding from a protein_structure facilitates computational drug_design and optimization and protein_function assignment we introduce autosite an efficient software_tool for identifying ligand_binding and predicting pseudo ligand corresponding to each binding_site identified binding_sites are reported as clusters of d points called fills in which every point is labelled as hydrophobic or as hydrogen_bond or acceptor from these fills autosite derives feature points a set of putative positions of hydrophobic and hydrogen_bond forming ligand atoms results we show that autosite identifies ligand_binding with higher accuracy than other leading methods and produces fills that better matches the ligand shape and properties than the fills obtained with a software_program with similar capabilities autoligand in addition we demonstrate that for the astex diverse set the feature points identify of hydrophobic ligand atoms and and of the hydrogen acceptor and donor hydrogen ligand atoms interacting with the receptor and predict of water_molecules mediating interactions between ligand and receptor finally we illustrate potential uses of the predicted feature points in the context of lead_optimization in drug_discovery projects proteins are involved in a wide_variety such as signalling_pathways and enzymatic_reactions while structural_genomics have revealed structures of a large number of proteins most of them lack reliable information about their biochemical_functions the identification and characterization of protein binding_sites can help decipher the function of proteins of unknown function the interactions made by protein with ligands are often exploited in the design of small_molecules to inhibit pathogenic or overexpressed proteins involved in a biological_process binding_site characterization has various potential applications including filtering databases of ligands lead compound optimization template definition for ligand search and automated docking methods for identifying the locations where ligand_molecules are likely to bind a receptor molecule of known d structure can be classified into three broad categories i methods analyzing evolutionary_information which exploit the idea that important binding_site residues are conserved for functional reasons ii geometry based_methods which identify the clefts cavities on the protein surface according to the size and depth of the pockets and iii energy based_methods which rely on the potential generated by probe atoms or chemical moieties to determine ligand_binding surfnet identifies pocket regions in proteins by fitting spheres in the spaces between protein atoms resulting in groups of interpenetrating spheres that correspond to the protein binding_sites ligsite places the protein in a cartesian grid and scans along the x y and z axes and the cubes diagonals for solvent accessible areas that are enclosed by protein atoms on both sides pocketfinder uses van_der affinity map computed with a carbon probe of radius the regions with larger cumulative values are identified and contoured with a threshold to identify binding_sites concavity provides its own implementation of the ligsite surfnet and pocketfinder algorithms and combines them with evolutionary sequence_conservation data to improve the accuracy of binding_site concavitys implementations of these algorithms when evolutionary_information is not included are named ligsite surfnet and pocketfinder these programs report the binding_sites as a collection of d points selected from a regular d grid binding_site characterization methods analyze an identified binding_site to provide more detailed information about the physicochemical_properties of potential ligands several review_papers provide a detailed analysis of computational_approaches for identifying and characterizing protein binding_sites these methods often characterize binding_sites based on the amino_acid of the receptor around the cavity and properties computed at the binding_site such as solvation hydrophobicity and electrostatics a common approach to characterize the binding_site is by generating affinity grids using different probe atoms at the binding sitea concept exploited by energy based_approaches in identifying binding_sites and analysing the binding_site by docking fragments condensing the interactions into discrete pharmacophore points or applying geometric rules the characterization heavily relies on the binding_site information and hence these techniques are often combined with custom or existing binding_site identification algorithms with or without emphasis on the shape of the ligand_binding region the obtained pharmacophore points are used to compare and annotate the function of proteins or used in virtual_screening experiments for drug_design autoligand is a software_program that places emphasis on chemically detailed ligand shape prediction when identifying the ligand_binding it works on the hypothesis that protein binding_sites have evolved to create a region of maximal affinity for the given size_and of a binding ligand it identifies a contiguous region of maximal binding_affinity by growing a cluster of contiguous high_energy points from on a grid of potential values obtained by combining affinity maps from multiple atom types the resulting cluster of grid points yields a prediction of ligand shape and each fill point of the predicted binding_sites is associated with an autodock atom_type although the above described approaches attempts to characterize the binding_site to provide information about governing interactions between protein and ligand at the binding_site there is no available study to the best of our knowledge that assess their quality of prediction with existing ligand s that binds to the respective binding_site here we present autosite a new energy based method for identifying ligand_binding and predicting potential pseudo ligand in each of the predicted binding_site of a protein_structure contrary to autoligand autosite filters out low_affinity points from affinity maps computed with hydrophobic carbon and hydrophilic oxygen hydrogen atomtypes to select high_affinity points merges the selected points and predicts feature points corresponding to potential ligand atoms by applying knowledge based and geometric rules we show that autosite performs equally to or slightly better than the state_ofthe energy and geometry based binding_site identification methods we further demonstrate that autosite outperforms autoligand in the accuracy of labeling fill points as hydrophobic hydrogen_bond donor_acceptor atoms and in the coverage of ligand atoms finally we introduce putative ligand atomic centres called feature points derived from the autosite fill points we show that for the astex diverse set these feature points correctly identify of hydrophobic ligand atoms as well as and of the ligand hydrogen acceptor and donor hydrogen_atoms that interact with the receptor and predict of water_molecules that interact both with ligand and receptor in addition we illustrate potential uses of the predicted feature points in the context of drug_discovery projects the binding_site identification results summarized inshow that autosite performs comparably or better than the other four programs with fill overlap ratio jaccard coefficient as the cutoff autosite identified binding_sites in the top prediction correctly out of compared to for ligsite for surfnet for pocketfinder and for sitehound considering the top three binding_site predictions for each system autosite identified binding_sites compared to for ligsite for surfnet for pocketfinder and for sitehound the programs were tested using different jaccard coefficient thresholds and autosite showed to generate more fills with jaccard coefficients greater than and than other programs indicating better coverage of the ligand both in top prediction as well as when consideringthe entire binding_pocket hence the predicted fills tend to extend beyond the ligand as discussed below in the discussion where the predicted fill cover regions corresponding to different known ligands small jaccard coefficients can arise when the overlap between the fill and the ligand is small or when the fill extends far beyond the ligand or both to investigate the results further we analyzed the fill sizes and the overlap with the ligands separately it should be noted that while the jaccard coefficient is computed using a ligand discretized on a grid identical to the affinity maps the percentage of ligand overlap is computed with the ligand atom coordinates shows the volume of the fills sorted by decreasing size of the autosite fills for out of ligands autosite fills are fill points are segregated into hydrophobic points c green and hydrogen_bond oa red and donor hydrogen points hd yellow kmeans clustering is performed on the c points and the resulting cluster centroids are kept as the hydrophobic feature points feature point extraction for o and h is performed using the receptor surface hydrogen_bonding atomslarger than the autoligand fills with an average of more points per fill as indicated by the distribution of fill size differences in the inset to analyze the overlap of the fill with the ligand we computed the distance between every ligand atom and the closest fill point shows that of ligand atoms are within a of a fill point compared to for autoligand we further segregated ligand atoms into hydrophobic c a n s p hydrogen acceptors oa na sa and hydrogen donor hd atoms and computed the distance of each ligand atom to the closest fill point of the appropriate type the ligands have hydrophobic hydrogen acceptors and for hydrogen donor_atoms within a of an autosite fill point of the proper type compared to the and for autoligand fills respectively these results indicate that autosite fills while larger have a better overlap with the ligand and as such offer a more accurate depiction of the ligand as predicted from the receptor structure beyond the labeling of fill points in the predicted binding_sites autosite predicts the number and positions of potential ligand atoms interacting with the receptor in this binding_site examples of such predicted feature points from fill points are shown infor pdb ids stp and hps shows the starting fill points for streptavidin and hiv_protease shows that the predicted hydrogen_bond feature points red spheres overlap with the oxygen and sulphur atoms hydrogen_bond feature points yellow spheres are in close_proximity to nitrogen_atoms that are known to be protonated in the bound form and the hydrophobic feature points overlay well with the carbon_atoms our method performs particularly well on this ligand as it is highly_potent with a binding_affinity of fm shows another example of feature points for the site predicted for the binding_site of an hiv_protease pdb id hps the cross shaped peptide geometry found in many hiv_protease and most hydrogen_bonding ligand atoms are identified by the feature points in particular the strong hydrogen_bond preference identified at the centre of the fill is a common interaction observed in hiv proteases this position is known to accommodate a water_molecule which is displaced in cyclic urea inhibitors by an oxygen_atom the phenyl group in the ligand that is not covered by the feature points doesnt show any strong interaction with the receptor in the crystal_structure the feature points predicted for other protease structures yielded the cross shaped geometry as described above and tends to identify the key interactions supplementary_information sfig shows ligands that have excellent overlap with the predicted fills hence we see remarkably good agreement between the number of atoms in ligands and the predicted number of feature points in we report the correlation between number of ligand atoms and the number of predicted feature points for the astex diverse dataset at increasing cutoff_values of the jaccard coefficient the correlation increases with the increase in the overlap ratio and with the cutoff of the average jaccard coefficient obtained by autosite we get a correlation_coefficient of the analysis includes ligand hydrogen_atoms and it is noteworthy that the astex diverse set contains manually_curated ligands for corresponding proteins in order to quantify the ability of autosites predicted feature points to match with actual ligand atoms we computed the distance from each ligand atom to the closest matching feature point shows that over of all hydrophobic ligand atoms have a corresponding hydrophobic feature point within the percentages for all ligand hydrogen_bond forming atoms are for acceptor atoms and for donor hydrogen_atoms respectively given thatautosite automated binding_sites identification and pseudo ligands predictionthe feature points are derived from fill points which are high_affinity points for the receptor the method is expected to only predict the subset of ligand hydrogen_bond forming atoms that actually interact with the receptor performing the analysis considering only the ligand atoms involved in a hydrogen_bond with a receptor atom i e distance the percentages of ligand atoms with a fill point within of a feature point increase to for acceptor atoms and to for donor hydrogen_atoms although a decrease in the percentage ligand overlap is expected when extracting representative feature points from fill points the result provides scope for further optimization to the extraction procedure in this analysis we considered the autodock atom types c a n s p as hydrophobic oa na sa as acceptor atoms and hd as donor_atoms in the astex diverse set of ligands atoms are hydrophobic acceptor atoms and hydrogen_bond donor_atoms hd another of ligand atoms are halogen atoms cl br f and were ignored for this analysis predicted hydrogen_bonding feature points should also identify crystallographic water positions to verify this hypothesis we protonated the receptors of the astex diverse set that included water_molecules using what if web_server and selected water_molecules within of the ligand we found that of the oxygen_atoms of the hydrogen_atoms of these selected water_molecules found corresponding feature point within when including only water_molecules within of both the receptors and ligand autosite predicts of the oxygen and of the hydrogen_atoms of these water_molecules since the prediction gets only hydrogen_bond between the receptor and atoms that are at a distance of we further analyzed the percentage of oxygen_atoms in water_molecules that finds either a hydrogen or an oxygen feature point within maximum interaction distance between hydrogen_bonding heavy_atoms the result showed that percentage of the oxygen_atoms from the water_molecules mediating interaction between a receptor and ligand have a feature point within examples in supplementary_information sfig timing on a intel_xeon e ghz processor starting from a spacing carbon oxygen and hydrogen maps covering the entire receptor autosite takes on average seconds to compute all fills with or more points extract the feature points for all fills rank the fills and write them out to file along with feature points in the pdb file_format using autogrid for computing the carbon oxygen and hydrogen maps takes seconds on average for the astex diverse set receptors a custom version of autogrid that allows the exclusion of electrostatics and desolvation maps computes these maps in seconds on an average thus autosite takes on average less than seconds to compute the maps identify the binding_sites with or more fill points and obtain the pseudo ligand for each of the predicted sites autosite identifies binding_sites with higher accuracy than other leading methods while it only performs marginally better than ligsite for binding_site identification it produces labelled points which can further be used to characterize the binding_site in addition the astex diverse set is a collection of diverse receptors with geometrically well defined binding_sites often buried cavities which overall favours geometry based_methods like ligsite similar to autoligand autosite fill points are annotated as hydrophobic hydrogen_bond or donor hydrogen_atoms the comparison of labelled fills produced by these two programs was performed using autoligand fills seeded at the ligand geometric centre to ensure an overlap between the fill and the ligand and the autosite fill with the point closest to the ligand geometric centre it is noteworthy that out of the autosite fills selected for this analysis also are the top ranking fills obtained for a grid spanning the entire receptor moreover of the autosite fills selected for this analysis are the top ranking fills obtained for the smaller x x boxes autosite was shown to outperform autoligand by covering more ligand atoms the fills identified by autosite tend to be larger than the ligand bound to the receptor this is because ligands exploit a subset of the possible interactions with the receptor as exemplified by chitinase which binds the cyclic gly_pro fragment pdb id w p as well as a natural_product cyclopentapeptide argadin pdb id h g and the ci inhibitor pdb id o i the cyclic glypro fragment bound structure was part of the study to understand the mechanism of inhibition by cyclic dipeptide inhibitors of chitinase which is involved in chitin degradation and only occupies a small portion of the fill argidin binds to the sub sites of the enzymes and the ci inhibitora the first column reports the percentage of oxygen and hydrogen_atoms from water_molecules within and of a predicted feature point of the appropriate type the second column shows the percentages when water_molecules mediate interaction between the receptor and the ligand b percentage of water_molecules oxygen finding a hydrogen_bond or donor within cutoffs ranging from to the first column reports the percentage of ligand atoms within and of a predicted feature point of the appropriate type the second column shows the percentages when only ligand atoms interacting with the receptor are considered prefers the sub sites of the enzyme thus each inhibitor occupying one half of the fill supplementary informa tion sfig this illustrates the reason for the fills identified by autosite to be larger than certain ligands on the other hand the fill predicted by autoligand only identifies the sub sites of chitinase for another class of receptors we observe that autosite generates multiple smaller adjacent clusters for example in pdb id hwihmg coa reductase with fluvastatin the five membered_ring in the ligand acts as a scaffold which positions three hydrophobic functional_groups that are increasing this ligands potency while fills covering the hmg like moiety and the hydrophobic_groups are identified they are disconnected because the five membered_ring does not interact strongly with the receptor creating a gap in high_affinity points preventing the clustering_algorithm from connecting these fills supplementary_information sfig the feature points predicted by autosite for a given binding_site have several potential applications relevant to medicinal_chemistry some of which we discuss and illustrate below feature points predict crystallographic water_molecules suggesting that they can potentially be used for designing and optimizing drugs that make use of the water interactions or that replace the water positions for binding the receptor a recent study by on lead_optimization of inhibitors for melk maternal embryonic leucine_zipper kinase using fragment based discovery illustrates the potential use of feature points for lead_optimization the authors optimized a fragment with micromolar affinity using structure_based into a nanomolar inhibitor we obtained feature points using autosite on the fragment bound crystal_structure of the receptor pdb id d w the predicted putative ligand atoms identified the crystallographic water w location as well as additional hydrogen_bond forming positions the optimized nanomolar inhibitor when superimposed over the autosite feature points occupies two of the predicted hydrogen_bond spots near nitrogen_atoms leaving one more hydrogen_bond spot and a few donor spots available it is interesting to notice that the crystal_structure of the nanomolar inhibitor bound protein pdb id d v has a water_molecule w interacting with the ligand nitrogen_atom a as well as a second crystallographic water_molecule w a our method predicts a hydrogen acceptor atom at the first water_molecule w location and a donor hydrogen_atom close by the second water_molecule w indicating that predicted feature points could be used to further optimize the ligand feature points could also potentially be used for protein_function this could be achieved by keeping track of the receptor amino_acids interacting with feature points and comparing them with the binding_site databases automated docking is another area that could benefit from the feature points produced by autosite some docking programs such as slide dock and surflex place the ligand into the receptor using templates of interactions these programs could benefit from using feature points generated by autosite programs such as autodockfr allow for the explicit representation of receptor side_chains as flexible during docking but require the a priori identification of these side_chains feature points could be used to select receptor side_chains the ones interacting with the feature points to be made flexible finally feature points could be used to filter large_databases of ligands for compounds matching the feature points autosite like any energy based_methods will be sensitive to the translation and orientation of coarse grids this limitation is attenuated when using smaller grid spacing pseudo ligands derived by autosite for proteins in astex diverse set using a grid spacing of on cubic boxes of on a side and centred on the respective ligands shows improvement in the ligand atoms coverage by feature points sfig autosite takes on an average seconds on astex diverse set when maps are provided hence we recommend smaller grid spacing only when studying pockets of interest
