canvas versatile and scalable detection of copy_number motivation versatile and efficient variant_calling tools are needed to analyze large_scale sequenc ing datasets in particular identification of copy_number changes remains_a due to their complexity susceptibility to sequencing biases variation in coverage data and dependence on genome_wide sample properties such as tumor polyploidy or polyclonality in cancer samples results we have developed a new tool canvas for identification of copy_number changes from diverse sequencing_experiments including whole_genome matched tumor normal and single sample normal re sequencing as well as whole exome matched and unmatched tumor normal studies in addition to variant_calling canvas infers genome_wide parameters such as cancer ploidy purity and heterogeneity it provides fast and easy to run workflows that can scale to thousands of samples and can be easily incorporated into variant_calling pipelines availability_and canvas is distributed under an open_source and can be downloaded from https github com illumina canvas the increased throughput of sequencing studies has created high_demand for versatile and scalable tools to detect somatic and germline copy_number changes increasingly_complex experimental_designs require accurate characterization not only of individual copy_number cnvs but also of global_genome and sample properties such as ploidy normal contamination and polyclonality frequently present in cancer samples the interaction of these factors creates an array of different somatic genome architectures that confounds optimization of cnv_calling algorithms given an often limited availability of training data while a number of methods for cnv identification have been introduced most of them harbor shortcomings when it comes to scalability and throughput first many tools rely on external segmentation software that complicates workflow management and version control second model_parameters to infer global_genome and sample properties are often hard coded and difficult to optimize for individual projects finally many tools require the user to provide pre specified sample specific parameter_values that might not be known prior to cnv_detection for example titan and freec while inferring heterogeneity and normal contamination respectively require genome_wide ploidy values as an input which incorporates a manual step in the variant_calling workflow and complicates automation we have developed a new tool for cnv_calling canvas to address the aforementioned limitations of existing solutions it fully implements all steps of the variant_calling workflow and requires only aligned sequence_data and related reference_genome files as input canvas offers inference of global tumor genome and sample characteristics including ploidy contamination and heterogeneity both simulated_and was used to assess canvas performance in each workflow category and to enable comparison with alternative cnv_calling tools the selection of third_party methods was based on the principle that they either showed superior_performance in the previous benchmarks as in the case of freec or that they offered inference of a number of different genome_wide parameters like theta we did not aim to perform a comprehensive evaluation of cnv callers as this was covered elsewhere what follows is an overview of the test data generation strategies and performance results supplementary results provide full details of simulation and evaluation strategies
