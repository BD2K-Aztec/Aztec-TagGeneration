extending knime for next_generation data analysis knime konstanz information miner is a user_friendly and comprehensive open_source data_integration processing analysis and exploration platform we present here new functionality and workflows that open the door to performing next_generation analysis using the knime framework availability all sources and compiled code are available via the knime update mechanism example workflows and descriptions are available through http tech knime org community next_generation knime konstanz information miner distinguishes itself from other workflow management systems like mobyle galaxy taverna kepler geworkbench conveyor and many others by not being a domain specific solution but an integration backbone with strong data preprocessing and data analytics capabilities it is mainly used in the customer relationship management and financial sector and through a list of commercial and non commercial vendors in the cheminformatics area see participation of recent knime conferences the focus has been on providing functionality for building professional reports statistical_analysis cheminformatics and very recently high_throughput highcontent hcs hca image_analysis and scripting using languages such as perl python matlab r and java here we introduce new nodes that allow next_generation ngs_data analysis to be performed using knime these nodes take advantage of some of knimes general_features including memory management allowing the handling of billions of rows on a standard desktop computer with only about gb of ram the workflows can be executed from the command_line where all variables can be manipulated if desired this enables the administrator to easily incorporate workflows in web_based tools such as mobyle or galaxy knime is based on eclipse and java the workflows are stored in plain_text xml files and can be executed on basically any modern operating system and also easily exchanged with or without data to whom correspondence should be addressed
