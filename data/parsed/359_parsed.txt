an integrative approach to predicting the functional effects of non coding and coding sequence_variation motivation technological_advances have enabled the identification of an increasingly_large spectrum of single_nucleotide within the human_genome many of which may be associated with monogenic disease or complex_traits here we propose an integrative approach named fathmm mkl to predict the functional consequences of both coding and non coding sequence_variants our method_utilizes various genomic_annotations which have recently become available and learns to weight the significance of each component annotation source results we show that our method outperforms current state of the art algorithms cadd and gwava when predicting the functional consequences of non coding variants in addition fathmm mkl is comparable to the best of these algorithms when predicting the impact of coding variants the method includes a confidence measure to rank_order predictions availability_and the fathmm mkl webserver is available at http fathmm rapid technological_advances and the falling costs of next_generation have accelerated the identification of single_nucleotide snvs in the human_genome ascertaining which of these are functional against a background of neutral snvs promises to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms_underpinning disease and complex_traits there is a plethora of computational algorithms capable of predicting whether snvs are deleterious however these algorithms are typically restricted to snvs falling within protein_coding of the genome with a particular focus on non synonymous snvs nssnvs they are therefore incapable of assessing the consequences of a significant proportion of snvs given that the vast_majority of snv trait associations fall within intergenic or intronic_regions of the genome in this article we propose a method for predicting the functional impact of both coding and non coding snvs existing protein based prediction_algorithms tend to exploit evolutionary_conservation when determining whether or not variants are functional however other potential sources for functional_annotation v c the author published_by the method we have outlined outperformed both gwava and cadd when predicting the functional consequences of non coding sequence_variants and supplementary in this case better performance was achieved using a smaller number of feature groups in as opposed to a broader range of feature groups in supplementary we also achieved good performance when predicting the functional impact of nssnvs for coding sequence_variants better performance was achieved using all the feature groups in instead of a smaller subset of feature groups e g in supplementary this out performance was achieved despite the fact that the feature group model used only of the training examples available to the four feature group model this suggests that a broad range of data_sources are informative for classifying variants in coding_regions for predicting the functional impact of variants in non coding_regions the opposite is suggested with fewer types of data being truly informative in both cases the most informative indicator is whether or not the variant falls within regions which are highly_conserved across species one advantage of our method is that it highlights the relative informative ness of the different sources of data e g supplementary furthermore the addition of a confidence measure also allows for the isolation of a smaller set of variants that have a higher confidence of correct functional impact assignment this provides an intuitive way to rank predictions for subsequent analysis when discovering novel deleterious variants as one may be able to survey only a small set of the most compelling variants however as noted in section incomplete_data may restrict the feature groups we can use to make a prediction currently we rescale kernel weights to accommodate these cases but as our experiments with coding examples reveal rescaling may not adequately compensate for missing features we anticipate that rapidly_growing data resources will mitigate this issue eventually but immediate improvements in test accuracy are possible for example provided the number of feature groups remains small we could learn sets of kernel weights specific to all possible combinations of feature groups feature groups had between and component features with the strongestperforming group having the fewest features way and way conservation it may be possible to improve performance using feature_selection within these groups in addition rather than integrating component feature groups at the level of the data via a composite kernel it would be possible to integrate classifiers each handling one feature group via ensemble learning additional improvements are possible for example for non coding_regions we could further exploit the sequence_context of a variant to identify a possible functional element e g a non coding rna site and use this information to improve predictive_accuracy in future projects we shall investigate these potential_improvements in addition to devising bespoke predictors for labelling variants in specific disease contexts such as cancer for prediction using coding variants there are further sources of data that could be relevant to enhancing prediction_performance we will also experiment with these to establish if the proposed mkl method could be improved further leading to out performance over cadd an integrative approach to predicting functional effects
