genome_analysis figmop a profile hmm to identify genes and bypass troublesome gene models in draft_genomes motivation gene models from draft genome_assemblies of metazoan species are often incorrect missing exons or entire genes particularly for large gene_families consequently labour_intensive manual cur ation is often necessary we present figmop finding genes using motif patterns to help with the manual_curation of gene_families in draft genome_assemblies the program uses a pattern of short_sequence to identify putative genes directly from the genome_sequence using a large gene_family as a test case figmop was found to be more sensitive and specific than a blast based_approach the visualization used allows the validation of potential genes to be carried_out quickly and easily saving hours if not days from an analysis availability_and source_code of figmop is freely_available for download at https github com dave the scientist implemented in c and python and is supported on linux unix andthe majority of published metazoan genome_assemblies are in draft form representing an in silico prediction of the in vivo genome errors include sequence_reads that are not clustered into contigs and contigs that are misplaced on scaffolds either in the wrong location or orientation this can have a significant impact on finding the genes in the genome an already complex process in eukaryotes that may have tiny exons and introns of variable_length the best algorithms get many of the gene models mostly correct but this may not be enough to make and test evolutionary and functional hypotheses in many cases particularly for large and complex gene_families here we present figmop finding genes using motif patterns which will guide the user to identify the correct gene models or provide a measure of the accuracy of the current gene models of their gene_family the software extends the use of meme and mast to identify regions of the genome containing genes of interest it uses amino_acid to capture conservation within short stretches of sequence in the users gene_family giving an architecture for that family as a specific pattern of those motifs for highly variable_regions alternative or optional motifs can be included figmop implements a profile hidden_markov phmm that conducts a fuzzy match of this motif architecture against the given genome_sequence accounting for variation and introns as random or unmatched motifs figmop has proved invaluable in our efforts to manually curate cytochrome_p cyp gene family_members which have high sequence_variability and differing intron exon structure within a draft genome_assembly of the parasitic_nematode haemonchus_contortus figmop is a general tool and besides cyps it has also proven useful in identifying other diverse gene_families including glutathione_s udp glucuronosyl transferase and abc_transporters
