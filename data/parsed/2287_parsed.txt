identification of coupling_dna on long_range in human k cells motivation the proteindna_interactions between transcription_factors tfs and transcription_factor tfbss also known as dna motifs are critical activities in gene_transcription the identification of the dna motifs is a vital task for downstream_analysis unfortunately the long_range coupling information between different dna motifs is still lacking to fill the void as the first of its kind study we have identified the coupling_dna on long_range in human results the coupling_dna exhibit substantially_higher dnase accessibility than the background sequences half of the dna motifs involved are matched to the existing motif databases although nearly all of them are enriched with at least one gene_ontology term their motif instances are also found statistically enriched on the promoter and enhancer regions especially we introduce a novel measurement called motif pairing multiplicity which is defined as the number of motifs that are paired with a given motif on chromatin_interactions interestingly we observe that motif pairing multiplicity is linked to several characteristics such as regulatory_region type motif sequence degeneracy dnase accessibility and pairing genomic_distance taken into account together we believe the coupling_dna identified in this study can shed lights on the gene_transcription mechanism under long_range as one of the major gene_regulation mechanisms transcription_factors tf can bind onto regulatory_dna in human and other eukaryotes different binding combinations of tfs may result in a gene being expressed in different tissues or at different developmental_stages to fully understand gene_regulation it is essential to identify the transcription_factor tfbss tfbs are relatively short bp and highly degenerate sequence_motifs which makes their effective identification a computationally challenging_task a number of high_throughput experimental and computational technologies were developed to determine tfbss databases have been developed to store the tfbs also known as dna_motif data additional introduction can be found in supplementary_materials in recent_years thanks to its relatively low costs next_generation is applied to thousands of genomes abecasis it creates unprecedented_opportunities for understanding dna motifs for instance the chip_seq from the encode consortium has enabled a systematic discovery and characterization of dna motifs in human cell_lines combining chip_seq and selex data jolma et_al have also characterized the dna binding_specificity landscape of human tfs on the other hand the hi c technology has been developed and applied to reveal the three_dimensional shapes of different cell_lines by the chromosome_conformation method in particular there is increasing evidence that long_range are related to gene co expression as well as proteindna_interactions therefore it is essential to comprehensively identify the coupling_dna on those long_range for understanding gene_transcription the dna motifs on gene regulatory_regions are believed to play_central in gene_transcription in particular their spatial_organization can determine their functional_roles in gene_transcription therefore we have identified thousands of coupling_dna on the human gene regulatory_regions under long_range those motif pairs have been characterized at different levels region type enrichment existing motif annotation matching gene_ontology and consistency motif pairing multiplicity and transitivity sequence pattern degeneracy dnase accessibility and pairing genomic_distance different relationships have been found between those attributes in particular we observe that motif pairing multiplicity is an important attribute which is correlated to some of the aforementioned attributes in summary this study provides a valuable resource for coupling dna_motif pairing information in human in the future similar coupling_dna in other cell_lines from different species can be identified for comparative_studies if the genome segmentation and hi c data availability issues can be alleviated the data_integration with chia_pet data is another promising direction although each chia_pet run is limited to the dna motifs of a single dna_binding the dna_motif pairing information in this study could be adopted for integrative_analysis with the existing chip_seq studies improving our understandings on proteindna binding finding the coupling sets of or more dna motifs is another interesting future direction
