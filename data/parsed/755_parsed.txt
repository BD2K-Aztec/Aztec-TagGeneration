structural_bioinformatics biojava an open_source framework for bioinformatics in motivation biojava is an open_source project for processing of biological data in the java programming_language we have recently released a new version which is a major update to the code base that greatly extends its functionality biojava is an established open_source project driven by an active developer community it provides a framework for processing commonly used biological data and has seen contributions from developers in the years since its creation the supported data range in scope from dna and protein_sequence up to the level of d protein_structures biojava provides various file parsers data models and algorithms to facilitate working with the standard data_formats and enables rapid application development and analysis the project is hosted by the open bioinformatics foundation obf http www open bio org which provides the source_code repository bug tracking database and email mailing lists it also supports projects such as bioperl biopython bioruby emboss and others the biojava library provides a powerful api for analyzing dna rna and proteins it contains state of the art algorithms to perform various calculations and provides a flexible framework for rapid application development in bioinformatics the library also provides lightweight interfaces to other projects that specialize in visualization_tools the transition to maven made managing external dependencies much easier allowing the use of external libraries without overly complicating the installation procedure for users the biojava project site provides an online cookbook which demonstrates the use of all modules through short recipes of common tasks we are looking forward to extending the biojava library with more functionality over the coming_years and welcome contributions of novel components by the community
