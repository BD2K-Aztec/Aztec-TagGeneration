accessfold predicting rna_rna with consideration for competing self structure motivation there are numerous examples of rnarna complexes including micrornamrna and small rnamrna duplexes for regulation of translation guide rna interactions with target_rna for post_transcriptional modification and small_nuclear rna_duplexes for splicing predicting the base_pairs formed between two interacting sequences remains difficult at least in part because of the competition between unimolecular and bimolecular structure results two algorithms were developed for improved_prediction of bimolecular rna_structure that consider the competition between self structure and bimolecular structure these algorithms utilize two novel approaches to evaluate accessibility free energy_density minimization and pseudo energy_minimization free energy_density minimization minimizes the folding_free change per nucleotide involved in an intermolecular secondary_structure pseudo energy_minimization called accessfold minimizes the sum of free_energy change and a pseudo free_energy penalty for bimolecu lar pairing of nucleotides that are unlikely to be accessible for bimolecular structure the pseudo free_energy derived from unimolecular pairing probabilities is applied per nucleotide in bimolecular pairs and this approach is able to predict binding_sites that are split by unimolecular structures a benchmark set of bimolecular rna_structures was assembled to assess structure_prediction pseudo energy_minimization provides a statistically significant_improvement in sensitivity over the method that was found in a benchmark to be the most accurate previously available method with an improvement from to in mean sensitivity for base_pair prediction availability_and pseudo energy_minimization is available for download as accessfold under an open_source and as part of the rnastructure package at http rna has been increasingly_recognized as an active player in cellular_biology rna_molecules catalyze many reactions are involved in transcript splicing and editing and serve as signals for protein_localization the function of an rna_molecule is intimately_related to its structure and therefore the prediction of rna_structure is an important tool for understanding mechanism there are a number of computational_methods for predicting rna_secondary for a single_sequence grnas bind mrna_targets to direct post_transcriptional and many spliceosomal rnas form functional duplexes for splicing of introns from mrna predicting rna binding_sites especially for longer rnas such as mrna_transcripts is an important step in understanding the function of existing and newly_discovered non_coding it is also a tool for designing sirnas used to study gene function or as therapeutics computational_prediction of rnarna binding_sites is a difficult problem because intermolecular structure competes with the formation of self structure in a concentration dependent_manner algorithms for prediction of intermolecular structure generally build upon singlestranded folding algorithms and come in two main types free_energy and partition_function calculations these utilize dynamic_programming to compute the thermodynamics of folding using parameters fit to experiments most popularly the turner nearest_neighbor parameters free_energy schemes compute the structure with the lowest folding_free and are guaranteed to output the optimal structure given the input_parameters and energy_model partition_function calculations consider the entire ensemble of possible structures and are used to determine probabilities for formation of each structure in this way a partition_function calculation gives the probability that each possible base_pair occurs given its prevalence within the ensemble these algorithms are successful at single_stranded structure_prediction but perform with lower accuracy on bimolecular structures to get around these challenges there has been a focus on the development of algorithms that predict only specific types of rna_rna an example of a well characterized biological_phenomenon for which there are multiple algorithms that perform with relative success is the hybridization of mirnas and their mrna_targets these are endogenous nt strands of rna that base_pair with a target_mrna most often at its utr and most often to repress translation via the recruitment of rnainduced silencing complex risc computational_methods for the prediction of mirnamrna targets rely on the well characterized binding structures that have been previously determined the mirna must be complementary to the utr of its target_mrna must have a strong seed binding_site at the end of the interaction but not the end must form a thermodynamically_stable duplex the sequence of the target_mrna must be conserved in the genomes of related species and cannot be impeded by strong secondary_structure in the target_mrna it is clear from this example that these algorithms are designed to test mirna_target structure specifically the principles of targeting the utr and having a more thermodynamically_stable end of the duplex do not apply to general prediction of bimolecular structure and would lead to false positives_and when applied to other types of binding problems it is necessary to develop a generalized algorithm for the reliable prediction of intermolecular binding_sites of unknown structure class this article introduces three algorithms for predicting rnarna_interactions each of these methods predicts only bimolecular helices i e base_pairs composed of one nucleotide from each of the two input_sequences where the helices are interrupted by unpaired nucleotides in internal or bulge loops the first algorithm densitymin computes the minimum_free density structure or the structure with the lowest ratio of folding_free change to number of nucleotides in the bimolecular structure it was hypothesized that minimizing density would lead to shorter more stable helices between strands that would be able to outcompete the potential intramolecular pairing partners the second algorithm accessfold uses a heuristic to utilize information from unimolecular partition_function calculations to consider accessibility of nucleotides for pairing in this approach an energy which is the sum of folding_free change and a pseudo energy that accounts for accessibility is minimized the pseudo energy scales with the probability that a single nucleotide is involved in an intramolecular base_pair as determined by the single_stranded partition_function calculation the pseudo energy term serves to account for the propensity to form self structure excluding inaccessible nucleotides from base_pairing in the bimolecular structure this pseudo energy penalty model for accounting for accessibility was also incorporated into the free energy_density minimization algorithm described above to test any synergistic improvement this algorithm is referred to as e densitymin i e extended densitymin a set of systems with known bimolecular structures was assembled for benchmarking and the performance of pseudo energy_minimization was compared to multiple variations of free_energy partition_function calculation and combination algorithms designed to predict rnarna_interactions bifold duplexfold bipartition and maxexpect from rnastructure rnaplex and rnaup from the vienna package and bindigo from the aalberts lab bifold duplexfold and rnaplex are variations of free_energy algorithms bifold predicts the minimum_free including self structure and treats unimolecular and bimolecular pairs equally duplexfold rnaplex and bindigo do not allow self pairing to occur rnaplex and bindigo are faster because they use modified functions for computing loop energies bipartition and maxexpect are full bimolecular partition_function calculations that do not consider intramolecular base_pairs bipartition assembles structures by selecting only those base_pairs that meet a minimum pairing probability threshold as determined by the user maxexpect computes the identical partition_function but the predicted structure is the structure with maximum expected_accuracy rnaup uses a partition_function calculation to determine the accessibility of an interval of nucleotides in each strand and then computes the minimum_free involving those intervals that are accessible and is used as the current gold_standard for using accessibility information in all cases except bifold these are programs that predict the structures of interacting rna_sequences but only predict the bimolecular pairs i e those pairs that involve one nucleotide from each strand for bifold both unimolecular and bimolecular pairs can be predicted but the class of structures is restricted to those that are not equivalent to pseudoknots e g kissing loop interactions are not considered a major barrier to the development of general algorithms addressing the rnarna_interaction prediction_problem is a limited number of experimentally_determined bimolecular structures in many experimental applications it is only important to know that the interfering rna binds the target as determined by expression_profiles in developing a general algorithm for prediction of bimolecular structure however it is important to use only those structures whose exact base_pairs are determined as a test_set to measure success in this work a general algorithm for bimolecular structure_prediction was developed and benchmarked using a small set of known structures accuracy could be improved when a larger set of known structures is available for testing another issue is that the small set of types of rnarna_interactions provides limited_power to show that differences in program performances are statistically_significant a larger set of known structures would additionally improve this although algorithms addressing specific biological_problems have been successful particularly in predicting mirna_binding it is necessary to develop a general algorithm for newly_discovered ncrnas an algorithm for predicting rnarna_interactions that the base_pairs colored in red were correctly_predicted by accessfold while the base_pairs colored in blue were correctly_predicted for both accessfold and rnaup the base_pairs in gray were not correctly_identified by either algorithm note that the hairpin stem_loop in the top strand is not able to be predicted by either program because it involves pairs from one strand only this hairpin stem_loop interrupts the accessible region resulting in two regions in the top strand that are accessible to binding uses information from bimolecular free_energy as well as unimolecular partition_function calculations was developed here and called accessfold in this approach a pseudo energy term is incorporated into the free_energy algorithm this term scales with the probability that a single nucleotide is involved in an intramolecular base_pair as determined by the single_stranded partition_function calculation the pseudo energy term serves to penalize the propensity to form self structure excluding inaccessible nucleotides from base_pairing in the bimolecular structure a set of known bimolecular structures was compiled for testing and the performance of pseudo energy_minimization was compared to multiple variations of free_energy partition_function calculation and combination algorithms designed to predict rnarna_interactions pseudoenergy minimization provides a statistically_significant increase in sensitivity when compared to the prior best available algorithm for considering self structure rnaup this result is interesting because rnaup rigorously calculates target structure accessibility whereas accessfold uses a heuristic that assumes the probability of forming a pair is independent of the probability the neighboring nucleotide is unpaired shows that this heuristic can be advantageous in situations where a binding_site is discontinuous one aspect of bimolecular structure_prediction that is inadequately addressed is the concentration_dependence of interaction the equilibrium for formation of bimolecular pairs is concentration dependent but the equilibrium for unimolecular pairs is independent of concentration it is possible that the scaling_factor c is contributing to the improved_performance by accessfold by independently weighting the unimolecular and bimolecular components of structure other programs treat intra_and molecular pairs equally which does not model interactions appropriately on the other hand the scaling_factor in accessfold is also not rigorously accounting for concentration because a biophysical_model would penalize the interaction once per bimolecular complex not per base_pair and also because the concentrations of strands vary for rna types one possible avenue for further improving the accuracy of bimolecular structure_prediction would be to explicitly account for effect of concentration on the interaction between strands the scaling_factor c also accounts for the fact that the pseudo free_energy is treating the unpairing probabilities of each nucleotide as independent this means that the pseudo free_energy would tend to over penalize the opening of regions for binding the poorer_performance of densitymin and e densitymin programs that minimize the density of folding_free change as compared to accessfold indicates that predicting compact bimolecular structures is not sufficient to model the competition provided by unimolecular structure the results are provided here as an alternative method for comparison interestingly for mirnamrna interactions all of the free_energy approaches failed to identify the experimentally_verified target locations with the exception of one interaction identified by bifold this suggests that when there is specific knowledge about interactions such as the requirement for complementarity in the seed_region that is often used in mirna_target tailored applications should to be used these results also support the prevailing consensus that mirna target_selection is kinetically controlled
