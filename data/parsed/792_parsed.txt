bitrina multiscale binarization and trinarization with quality analysis motivation when processing gene_expression or other biological data it is often required to assign measurements to distinct categories e g high and low and possibly intermediate subsequent analyses strongly depend on the results of this quantization poor quantization will have potentially misleading effects on further investigations we propose the bitrina package that integrates different multiscale algorithms for binarization and for trinarization of one dimensional data with methods for quality_assessment and visualization of the results by identifying measurements that show large variations over different time points or conditions this quality_assessment can determine candidates that are related to the specific experimental_setting availability_and bitrina is freely_available on cran in the context of analyzing biological data such as gene_expression it is often necessary to identify those genes transcripts or proteins that display prominent variations over time or across different experimental_conditions this can be required to preselect more interesting candidates for subsequent analyses or to reveal data applicable for further approaches such as boolean_network modeling this can be achieved by categorizing the data to a small number of distinct groups and assigning validities to this categorization for simplicity we will focus in the following on binarization schemes and mention trinarization as their extension in the next section binarization is the process of partitioning data into two groups and assigning a single value to each it can be seen as a special_case of discretizing a continuous signal into a k valued signal with x x k for k and k for trinarization the most common approach is to binarize measurements according to a threshold such as the mean value a quantile or more elaborate estimation_techniques as described byor hopfensitz et_al a threshold can also be learned from external_information one commonly assigns the value to the data_points below the threshold low and to those above high the aim of any such binarization method is to find the most appropriate threshold binarization is often part of data preprocessing on which further analyses strongly depend for example gene_expression data from time series must be binarized for the reconstruction and simulation of boolean_networks see e g only then can these networks model gene_regulation by representing each gene as a binary variable illustrating the two states active and inactive in addition to being an important prerequisite to various analyses binarization and trinarization can also be used independently to extract information it can for example serve as an unsupervised method to reveal patternsshowed that binarized signals can be utilized for prototype based classification tuna and niranjan demonstrated that the generalization ability of support_vector is not declined by binarized gene_expression however knowledge about data which cannot be reasonably represented by two groups i e data that is not well binarizeable can give valuable hints about the processes that lead to it like noise or gradients nevertheless current implementations of available binarization algorithms e g regardlessly impose an inappropriate separation into two groups and are not able to identify this additional dont know group we propose the r package bitrina which is the first to provide multiscale approaches for binarization trinarization and reliability_assessment the following illustrates the application of the bitrina package and its statistical_tests on gene_expression data we binarized and trinarized a dataset containing gene_expression genes time points of the developmental_stages embryonic larval pupal and adult of drosophila_melanogaster we utilized the basc b algorithm after correction_for fdr of the genes are statistically_significant according to bascs test for binarizeability a heatmap of the binarized signals can be found in as an example illustrates the binarization of the rhodopsin gene which is a photoreceptor of the eye it can be observed that expression remains_low throughout the first three developmental_stages but then peaks in the adult stage this is properly reflected by the binarization which achieves a highly_significant p value of p for this gene an interesting question with respect to this illustration might be whether the statistical assessment of binarizeability can provide an indication which of the measured genes are involved in the developmental_process that is can the statistical_test identify genes whose binarized measurements somehow reflect the known developmental phases statistical_evidence indeed suggests that there is a significant association between the concordance of measurements with the developmental_stages and their binarizeability see_supplementary this shows the practical relevance of the proposed quality_assessment for the identification of potentially interesting candidate_genes for further investigation we also performed crossvalidation classification experiments on the binarizeable and trinarizable signals that indicate that indeed the quantized information is sufficient for the categorization of the developmental_stages the mean accuracy of a linear support_vector only declined by about for basc a and the tasc algorithms and for basc b while utilizing only basc a basc b and tasc a tasc b of all features in terms of accuracy they outperformed the k means algorithm restarts that achieved a maximum mean accuracy of with utilizing only of all available features many analyses require a quantization of data and thus depend heavily on this procedures results however not all data are well binarizeable or trinarizable and current implementations do not include methods to assess the applicability of the original data for such a method our r package bitrina integrates statistical_testing procedures that are capable of assessing the binarizeability and trinarizability and consequently the quality of discretizing of biological data as such the approaches can be used to identify candidate measurements that may be relevant for further analyses note the mean accuracy of a linear support_vector one versus one majority vote and the mean percentage of binarizeable features together with their absolute_numbers are shown fdr best values in bold
