integrative network_alignment reveals large regions of global network similarity in yeast and human motivation high_throughput methods for detecting molecular_interactions have produced large sets of biological_network data with much more yet to come analogous to sequence_alignment efficient and reliable network alignment_methods are expected to improve our understanding of biological_systems unlike sequence_alignment network_alignment is computationally_intractable hence devising efficient network_alignment heuristics is currently a foremost challenge in computational_biology results we introduce a novel network_alignment algorithm called matching based integrative graph aligner mi_graal which can integrate any number and type of similarity_measures between network nodes e g proteins including but not limited to any topological network similarity measure sequence_similarity functional_similarity and structural_similarity hence we resolve the ties in similarity_measures and find a combination of similarity_measures yielding the largest contiguous i e connected and biologically sound alignments mi_graal exposes the largest functional connected regions of proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network similarity to date surprisingly it reveals that of proteins in the bakers yeast high_confidence ppi_network participate in such a subnetwork that is fully contained in the human high_confidence ppi_network this is the first demonstration that species as diverse as yeast and human contain so large continuous regions of global network similarity we apply mi graals alignments to predict functions of un annotated proteins in yeast human and bacteria validating our predictions in the literature furthermore using network_alignment scores for ppi_networks of different herpes_viruses we reconstruct their phylogenetic_relationship this is the first time that phylogeny is exactly reconstructed from purely topological alignments of ppi_networks availability supplementary files and mi_graal executables
