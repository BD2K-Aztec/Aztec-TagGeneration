genetics_and greater_power and computational_efficiency for kernel_based association testing of sets of genetic_variants motivation set based variance_component tests have been identified as a way to increase power in association studies by aggregating weak individual effects however the choice of test_statistic has been largely ignored even though it may play_an in obtaining optimal power we compared a standard statistical_test a score testwith a recently_developed likelihood_ratio lr test further when correction for hidden structure is needed or gene_gene are sought state of the art algorithms for both the score and lr tests can be computationally impractical thus we develop new computationally_efficient methods results after reviewing theoretical differences in performance between the score and lr tests we find empirically on real_data that the lr test generally has more power in particular on of real_datasets the lr test yielded at least as many associations as the score testup to more associationswhereas the score test yielded at most one more association than the lr test in the two remaining datasets on synthetic data we find that the lr test yielded up to more associations consistent with our results on real_data but also observe a regime of extremely_small signal where the score test yielded up to more associations than the lr test consistent with theory finally our computational speedups now enable i efficient lr testing when the background kernel is full rank and ii efficient score testing when the background kernel changes with each test as for genegene_interaction tests the latter yielded a factor of speedup on a cohort of size availability software available atwith next_generation data from larger and larger cohorts now being collected the possibility of detecting even weaker genetic_associations with disease is increasing such weak signal could provide invaluable insights into biological and disease mechanisms as well as yield biomarkers for diagnosis and personalized treatment however even with large_datasets becoming available studies to detect important genetic signal remain underpowered especially those rare variantsthe most underpowered type of association whose signal lies in tests one approach to help alleviate this power problem is to group together genetic_markers and then to test them jointly in a single test such an approach_helps increase power in two ways first it can reduce the number of tests performed and hence the multiple testing penalty incurred second the test aggregates weak signal within a set and can also tag unmarked variants although a variety of competing_methods for set tests have been proposed some of the most influential and widely used methods are those that use a sequence_based kernel in a variance_component model improving power in these kernel_based models is the focus of this article in particular the main contribution of this article is improving power in two ways the statistical_test used showing that the non standard likelihood_ratio lr test in this setting can yield substantially more associations and several exact algebraic reformulations that yield dramatic_improvements in runtime for certain classes of set tests enabling far larger datasets to be analyzed for example on data from the wellcome_trust wtccc a genegene_interaction scoretest speedup achieved running time times_faster than na ve computation of the test in the statistical genetics literature to date practically no consideration has been given to the choice of statistical_test for kernel_based set association tests in particular the choice of frequentist statistical_test in this setting has uniformly been the score test with the one exception being our recent work on how to conduct set tests in the presence of confounders where an lr approach was used also used an to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work approximate bayes_factor as a complement to the use of a score test from a purely computational perspective use of the score test would seem more convenient and efficient as it requires parameter_estimation only for the null_model whereas the lr test requires parameter_estimation for both the null and the alternative model in terms of power various theoretical results claim the superiority of either the lr test or the score test under different conditions however because these conditions are rarely met for real_data and because it is unclear how robust the theoretical results are to deviations from the required conditions there is no clear theoretical guidance on which test to choose in practice therefore here we conducted a systematic_comparison between the two tests using synthetic data rare and common_variants with both case control and continuousvalued phenotypes and under various types of model_misspecification in so doing we were able to assess the relative performance of the score and lr tests across a wide_variety of settings when the ground_truth was known finally we applied the two tests to real_data for phenotypes to determine which of our synthetic settings were most likely applicable finding that overall the lr test performed substantially better than the score test in addition to our systematic_comparison of the score and lr tests in the standard_setting we also consider richer scenarios in which for example one may want to correct for confounding_factors arising from family relatedness or population_structure or testing for genegene_interactions between variants from pairs of sets e g genes in such settings there are two variance components one consisting of a background kernel e g to correct for confounding_factors or for main effects in a test for genegene_interactions and an additional component in the alternative model built from the set of interest when the null_model includes a background kernel the time to run tests can be prohibitive in particular for the case where i the background kernel has full rank as has been done traditionally when correcting for confounding_factors and ii where the background kernel is low_rank but changing with each test as in testing for gene_gene runtimes of state of the art lr and score tests can be dramatically_decreased thus we developed computational improvements and demonstrate their effectiveness through timing experiments
