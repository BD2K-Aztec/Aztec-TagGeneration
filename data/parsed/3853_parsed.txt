structural_bioinformatics r c improving ab_initio residue contact_map using dynamic fusion strategy and gaussian_noise filter motivation inter residue_contacts in proteins dictate the topology of protein_structures they are crucial for protein_folding and structural_stability accurate prediction of residue_contacts especially for long_range is important to the quality of ab inito structure modeling since they can enforce strong restraints to structure assembly results in this paper we present a new residue residue contact predictor called r c that combines machine_learning and correlated mutation analysis based_methods together with a two_dimensional gaussian_noise filter to enhance the long_range residue_contact our results show that the outputs from the machine_learning method are concentrated with better performance on short range contacts while for correlated mutation analysis based_approach the predictions are widespread with higher accuracy on long_range an effective query driven dynamic fusion strategy proposed here takes full advantages of the two different methods resulting in an impressive overall accuracy improvement we also show that the contact_map directly from the prediction model contains the interesting gaussian_noise which has not been discovered before different from recent_studies that tried to further enhance the quality of contact_map by removing its transitive noise we designed a new two_dimensional gaussian_noise filter which was especially helpful for reinforcing the long_range residue_contact tested on recent casp datasets the overall top l accuracy of our final r c predictor is higher than the pure machine_learning method and higher than the correlated mutation analysis based_approach for the long_range residue_contact residue contact_map is a two_dimensional d representation of a proteins three_dimensional d structure it constrains the conformation of protein_structures as a result accurate prediction of contact_map can facilitate ab_initio structure modeling the contact_map can be viewed as a symmetrical matrix where each element indicates whether the two residues are close enough in its d space to form an interaction or not it has been shown that even very sparse true contact_information can also help to generate correct modeling at the fold level furthermore contact_maps have been widely used for model assessment and structure alignment improving residue_contact has been of interest for many years due to its critical importance in structure bioinformatics with either sequence or structure template information the existing ab_initio sequence_based prediction_methods can be generally classified into two categories supervised_learning and unsupervised_learning from the perspective of supervised_learning contact_prediction is typically treated as a class classification_problem contact versus non contact this type of contact predictors like profcon svmcon svmseq dncon and phycmap which were constructed with supervised machine_learning ml algorithms such as neural_network nn support_vector svm and random_forest rf etc for the unsupervised_learning group co evolution information from multiple_sequence msa is analyzed to identify residue pairs that are in contact spatially to the best of our knowledge g bel et_al firstly utilized correlated_mutations to infer residue_contacts in proteins by calculating the pearson_correlation between every two columns in msa following this work several mutual_information based local algorithms were proposed to improve_the such as mi mip and mic etc one recent methodology development effort in this regard is to construct a consensus prediction model with ml based and correlation mutation analysis cma based_methods which has been shown to be capable of achieving better performance than any single type of prediction model the inferred co evolution information indicates the potential of each residue pair to form a contact and it can be used either as input feature to ml algorithms or as another prediction score at the decision level the reason for the better performance of fusing ml based and cmabased methods is that they are highly complementary to each other generally for the ml based_predictions the performance is the best on short range contacts because the population of short range training samples is much larger than that of the long_range therefore leading to more learned rules hence the corresponding top outputs are concentrated together on the predicted contact_map but the cma based engines do not need the training step and are not affected by the training distributions their top outputs are widespread on the whole contact_map making long_range contact predictions more accurate the prediction coverages of the two methods strongly complement each other resulting in an overall performance improvement of the final consensus system another method is to construct multi_layer or deep_learning predictors based on the observation that residue_contacts are densely_distributed in native structures deep_learning framework was applied to mine implicit contact patterns which takes the neighboring contact_information as temporal_features in this iterative way a contact predictor can usually give better results than the one layer model the third track of efforts for improving residue_contact is adding an additional noise filtering post_processing step to optimize the raw contact_map from the prediction_models for the cmabased approaches indirect coupling effect is a widely observed factor that restricts the prediction_performance it is caused by two direct coupling pairs that share a common residue which results in the so_called transitive dependencies residues ab and bc are in contact which induces a contact_prediction pair of ac sometimes the interaction_strength of the indirect coupling pair is larger even than the direct coupling pairs this transitive noise can be removed through recently_proposed global algorithms via maximum_entropy sparse inverse covariance estimation pseudo likelihood_maximization or matrix eigenvalue transformation methods some typical transitivenoise filtering algorithms include mfdca psicov plmdca gremlin nd network deconvolution and bnd balanced network deconvolution in this study we aim to derive better contact_map predictions in two aspects i when we try to combine ml based and cma based_methods how do we derive a better fusion strategy making the consensus system more efficient despite different conditions for each query_protein ii besides the well known transitive noise is there another non discovered noise mode in the raw contact_map for the first aspect we have designed a problem feature driven fusion strategy in the proposed r c residueresidue_contact predictor system first the prediction_performance of the cma based_approaches highly depends on the number of effective sequences in msa i e the more effective homologous_sequences it has the better the performance that will be achieved in light of this conclusion a reliable weight will be calculated to associate with the cma based_predictions according to the number of effective sequences in the query_sequences msa second we consider the different types of contacts with different fusion strategies since the ml based and cma based predictors perform differently on short range and long_range for shortrange contacts we will assign a small weight to the cma based engine in other words a large weight will be assigned to the ml based part similarly when we make predictions for long_range we will assign a large weight to the cma based engine this will ensure that each engines output will carry more weight for sequences in which they historically perform better for the second aspect besides the transitive noise we found that the gaussian_noise also commonly exists in the contact_map from the cma based_predictions a two_dimensional noise filter is designed to remove the gaussian_noise which can effectively improve the prediction of long_range residue_contacts as far as we know this is the first time a different noise mode was found in the residue contact_map and its elimination will enhance the predicted contact_map for inter residue_contact the commonly used performance measure is the accuracy for top l predicted contacts here l is the length of the test sequence top and l predicted contacts are also evaluated accuracy is defined as the fraction of correctly_predicted contacts with respect to all the predicted contacts
