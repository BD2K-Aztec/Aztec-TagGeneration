databases_and an application of a relational_database system for high_throughput prediction of elemental_compositions from accurate_mass values high_accuracy mass values detected by high_resolution analysis enable prediction of elemental_compositions and thus are used for metabolite annotations in metabolomic_studies here we report an application of a relational_database to significantly improve the rate of elemental_composition predictions by searching a database of pre_calculated elemental_compositions with fixed kinds and numbers of atoms the approach eliminates redundant evaluations of the same formula that occur in repeated calculations with other tools when our approach is compared with hr which is one of the fastest tools available our database_search times were at least times shorter than those of hr when a solid_state drive ssd was applied the search time was times shorter at ppm mass tolerance and times at ppm even if the search by hr was performed with threads in a high spec windows pc the database_search times were at least and times shorter without and with the ssd these improvements were enhanced in a low spec windows xp pc we constructed a web_service mfsearcher to query the database in a restful manner availability_and available for free at http webs kazusa or jp mfsearcher the web_service is implemented_in mysql apache and tomcat with all_major identification or annotation of metabolite peaks detected by mass_spectrometers mss is one of the crucial steps in ms based metabolomic_studies accurate_mass values measured by high_resolution ms instruments such as orbitrap ms and time of flight ms are used in calculations of elemental_compositions for the peaks and or the product_ions generated in multistage ms_ms n analyses by which comprehensive identifications annotations of metabolites have been reported several software_tools are available for calculation of elemental_compositions hr automfcalculator masstoformula function of the chemistry development kit and molecular_weight calculator http www alchemistmatt com these tools generate all possible formulae under the condition of user_defined kinds and numbers of atoms hereafter described as atom condition and return elemental_compositions that match the given mass value with the mass tolerance an advantage of these tools is that users can change the atom conditions for each calculation a disadvantage is that generations and evaluations of the same formulae cannot be avoided when similar mass values are repeatedly examined this latent redundancy causes a limitation of the calculation rate when the tools are applied for the large number of mass data detected in metabolomic_studies to raise the throughput of metabolite annotations and then metabolomic_data productions acceleration of the calculation rate of elemental_compositions is required we report here a database approach that remarkably improves the prediction of elemental_compositions because the atom condition can be fixed for high_throughput surveys all possible elemental_compositions under the atom conditions are calculated and stored in a relational_database system the elemental_compositions that match the given mass values with the mass tolerances are searched from the database therefore the latent redundancy occurring in other tools is eliminated
