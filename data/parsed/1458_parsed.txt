dogma domain based transcriptome and proteome quality_assessment motivation genome studies have become cheaper and easier than ever before due to the decreased costs of high_throughput and the free availability of analysis software however the quality of genome or transcriptome_assemblies can vary a lot therefore quality_assessment of assemblies and annotations are crucial aspects of genome analysis_pipelines results we developed dogma a program for fast and easy quality_assessment of transcriptome and proteome data based on conserved protein_domains dogma measures the completeness of a given transcriptome or proteome and provides information about domain content for further analysis dogma provides a very fast way to do quality_assessment within seconds availability_and dogma is implemented in python and published under gnu gpl v license the source_code is available on https ebbgit uni muenster de domainworld dogma contacts genomics and transcriptomics have become key technologies in all branches of life_sciences over the last years and the huge amount of resulting data calls for proper computational_analysis methods though many improvements were made in automatized sequence_assembly and genome_annotation both processes remain an extremely challenging_task and there are enormous differences in the quality of the resulting data these differences result mainly from problems that can occur during the various steps of an assembly and annotation_pipeline reads can be of low quality they may not be precisely mapped and or many small scaffolds might exist making subsequent steps in the pipeline such as gene_annotation more complicated even with high_quality assemblies gene_annotation is a complex process and also with transcriptome_data as supporting_information gene models can be wrong incomplete or missing altogether from the annotation therefore quality_assessment of the results is important and accordingly several methods to determine quality of reads assemblies transcriptome and proteome data have been developed read quality can be assessed using perbase error_rates or k_mer distributions for resulting genome or transcriptome_assemblies programs like cegma or busco have been developed both cegma and busco use a similar approach a predefined set of genes that are conserved over a specific clade is compared to genes_annotated in the genome or transcriptome to be analyzed the measured gene completeness the percentage of core genes found in the sample is assumed to be representative for the whole gene_set of the genome and is therefore used as a quality_indicator the cegma scores of ensembl genomes for example are in the range of vicugna pacos to saccharomyces_cerevisiae the core_set of cegma is based on eukaryotic clusters_of kogs resulting in a set of core eukaryotic_genes cegs buscos core gene_set is based on orthologous_genes from orthodb cegma and busco can be used for genome quality_assessment while for transcriptomes and proteomes only busco can be used the protein quality index pqi provides a list of quality_scores for publicly_available proteomes the quality_score consists of different components such as sequence_length domain content percentage of undefined amino_acids and others protein_domains are independently evolving structural and functional building_blocks of proteins known to be well conserved across taxa usually domains are represented as hidden_markov hmms as hmms are more sensitive than other sequence search_methods protein_domains can be identified in very diverged sequences with hmms because of the better detection of protein_domains they are a good candidate for quality_assessment protein_domains can occur together in the same protein and form in combination a domain arrangement specified by their order in the amino_acid the domain content is considered in two different measures of the pqi the first one is that the sample proteome is searched for superfamily domain arrangements that occur in the cegs of cegma the second measure is a simple comparison of the number of different domains that occur in the sample proteome compared to the number of domains in the same clade however no program is provided and new proteomes can only be evaluated by sending a request to the providers of the pqi the domain content is incorporated in the program introduced here as well domain arrangements have been successfully used in different contexts such as homology_search or orthology construction the advent of analyses using protein_domains and their arrangements to study functional_roles and evolutionary_relationships of proteins and complete families demonstrates the utility of information about absence or presence of specific protein_domains and their arrangements e g in this work we introduce dogma domain based general measure for transcriptome and proteome quality_assessment a program that facilitates the quick assessment of transcriptome and proteome quality dogma scores a sample transcriptome or proteome regarding its completeness of conserved protein_domains provided as percentage of a defined core_set combined with a tool for fast domain annotation uproc dogma is able to rapidly perform quality_assessments and provide information about missing domains and domain arrangements the results presented here show that dogma achieves similar completeness scores as existing programs but is able to run much faster when it is used in combination with a fast domain annotation tool such as uproc furthermore the use of protein_domains represents a less biased approach because hmms are more sensitive therefore hmms are still able to detect domains even if the primary sequence has gained a lot of mutations when running dogma with uproc the order of domains cannot be taken into account opposing to using pfamscan for the annotation however the completeness scores produced with both methods do not differ much and due to the huge running time advantage and the possibility to apply uproc directly to transcriptomes the usage of uproc is generally recommended another advantage compared to other quality_assessment methods is that dogma offers straightforward additional information about missing protein_domains in the dataset that could be used for functional_analyses in conclusion dogma combined with pfamscan annotations should be preferred for functional_analyses because of the additional information about the order of domains in domain arrangements uproc is recommended for quality_assessments due to the extreme running time advantage at nearly the same quality finally the results presented above show that the choice of an appropriate core_set is important for the analysis both dogma and busco provide different core sets however with the exception of an eukaryotic core_set the core sets are based on different clades the test on the eukaryotic core_set shows that the score is robust to slight changes in the core_set as well as changes in the cda size note that the tools compared here cannot compete in every type of analysis because they are partly designed for different tasks dogma does not allow to analyze whole genomes like cegma and busco on the other hand cegma cannot be used to analyze transcriptome or proteome assemblies which is possible with dogma or busco we did not compare our program to the pqi because a stand alone program is not available however we believe that our approach has several advantages over the domain metrics that are part of pqi presumably a simple comparison of the number of domains is not useful because domain types selected arrangements for specific clades and variation in frequency for particular domains are important since the comparison of domain arrangements for the pqi is based on cegs it is limited to eukaryotes and thus to a relatively low number of domains moreover there is no option to choose a more specific core_set for the pqi and therefore differences regarding the domain content that might be of interest are lost to conclude dogma introduces a new efficient quality_assessment which is based on conserved protein_domains and domain arrangements that is qualitatively comparable to other methods while dogma outperforms other programs on a great scale if combined with a fast annotation tool
