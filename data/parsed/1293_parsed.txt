de correlating expression in gene_set motivation group wise pattern analysis of genes known as gene_set gsa addresses the differential_expression pattern of biologically pre defined gene_sets gsa exhibits_high statistical_power and has revealed many novel biological_processes associated with specific phenotypes in most cases however gsa relies on the invalid assumption that the members of each gene_set are sampled independently which increases false predictions results we propose an algorithm termed deco to remove or alleviate the bias caused by the correlation of the expression data in gsas this is accomplished through the eigenvalue decomposition of covariance matrixes and a series of linear transformations of data in particular moderate de correlation methods that truncate or re scale eigenvalues were proposed for a more reliable analysis tests of simulated and real experimental_data show that deco effectively corrects the correlation_structure of gene_expression and improves the prediction_accuracy specificity and sensitivity for both gene and sample randomizing gsa methods the basic goal of high_throughput gene_expression is to identify genes or groups of genes that are responsible for a phenotype of interest and elucidate their functional_networks typical individual gene analyses employ a cutoff threshold to define differentially_expressed degs and then search for the biologically predefined gene_sets that are enriched with the degs however the use of a threshold value causes a significant loss of information and is far from sufficient for describing the functionality of genes and their modular expression_patterns on the other hand the gene_set gsa methods assess the group wise pattern of each pre defined gene_set by integrating the signals of all of its members either strong or weak without applying a cutoff threshold to genes such a group wise approach of gsa covers a much larger spectrum of expression_patterns and hence exhibits higher statistical_power than an individual gene analysis many genes with relatively weak signals as well as small number of genes with strong signals in a gene_set could be significant moreover predictions by gsa are highly_reproducible among data_sets from independent experiments due to such advantages gsa is becoming a powerful alternative to individual gene analysis according to gsa methods can be classified into two categories depending on the null_hypothesis tested as follows q the genes in a gene_set have the same level of association with the phenotype compared with the rest of the gene_set q none of the genes in a gene_set is associated with the phenotype of interestthese two categories can be characterized by how the significance of each gene_set is assessed after summarizing the signals in a gene_set gene_set score the significance of the summary_statistic is assessed by randomizing gene labels q or sample labels q respectively as the methods in the q category hypothesize that no gene in a gene_set is associated with the phenotype they test the existence of association_signal in a gene_set for this reason they can be termed association_analyses on the other hand q methods test the relative enrichment of such association_signal compared with the background genes hence they can be termed enrichment_analyses there are also hybrid type methods that take into account both the gene and sample randomization of the gene_set scores the main_problem with most of the q based gsa methods is that each gene_set is assumed to be a collection of independent samples from the entire list of genes because most biologically defined gene_sets have some correlation structures in their expression_profiles this assumption mostly boosts some of the gene_set scores and increases false_positive the recently_developed restandardization method is basically built on sample randomization but induces the independence of gene statistics by incorporating the gene randomized gene_set scores suggested a simple method that adjusts for the different gene_set sizes which still maintains the independence of genes in the random set model in this article an algorithm dubbed deco is proposed that removes the correlation bias in the expression of each gene_set in gsa the method is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance_matrix of each gene_set and a series of linear transformations of data this approach adjusts for the gene_set specific correlation structures to improve the power of many geneor sample randomizing gsa methods eigenvalue decomposition of covariance_matrix has been widely_applied to gene_expression data analyses through principal_component pca and its generalization singular_value svd pca and svd are standard dimension_reduction techniques and are mostly used for capturing global expression_patterns of genes or arrays recently pca was combined with l penalty to reduce noise effectively in identifying_differentially we present how to remove the correlation bias in gsa by rescaling the principal_components of each gene_set along the eigen axes because the accurate estimation of the covariance_matrix of each gene_set is critical in this method we suggested using the shrinkage covariance estimator instead of the unstable sample covariance we might also consider de correlation process for gene_set expression data y and covariance_matrix c let c udu be the eigen decomposition of c each step then represents a normalized correlated data b rotating the data to the eigen axes c shrinking the data to a unit ball and d returning the data to the original axes that there may still be errors in estimating covariance matrixes especially for large gene_sets and that de correlating itself does not transform data into independent samples except for multivariate normal_distributions for these reasons we suggest applying some moderate de correlations for analyzing real experimental_data to avoid_overfitting deco is tested for two simulated_data with different null_hypotheses as well as two real expression data_sets the findings demonstrate that deco overall improves the prediction of key pathways for both the gene and sample randomizing gsa methods in this article we devised an algorithm to remove or reduce the correlations in a gene_set which perturb the inference of gsa considerably by removing the correlations we can transform the data into nearly independent samples as uncorrelatedness does not necessarily imply the independence of samples and the estimation of covariance_matrices can be inaccurate we recommended using a conservative de correlation deco sqrt for real expression data to avoid_overfitting indeed in the real_data decosqrt showed favorable performances over deco t as well as the uncorrected method when we applied the original deco to real expression data_sets it showed a rather unstable performance its roc for the prostate data was a little better than the curve for decot but was even worse than the uncorrected method for the p data this instability may be caused by the inaccurate estimation of small eigenvalues ideally it would be desirable to remove correlations of the full list of genes at once rather than de correlating individual gene_sets because correlations exist not only within pre defined gene_sets but among genes across different gene_sets however it is mostly inaccurate and infeasible to estimate and decompose such a high_dimensional covariance_matrix in this regard deco serves as a practical solution for the correlation issue by locally de correlating each gene_set in deco reducing the estimation error for the covariance_matrix of a gene_set was crucial the use of the well known sample covariance yielded poor predictions in the analyses of real_data therefore the use of a shrinkage covariance estimator is essential when applying deco to gsa for the same reason deco may perform better for over dozens of data samples note that in simulation tests all the gene_sets had relatively strong correlations between and however in real expression data only a portion of gene_sets have such strong correlations this may be a reason why the de correlation effect was clearer in simulation tests a possible weakness with de correlation_analysis is that the members of de correlated gene_sets are the linearly transformed genes which makes it hard to interpret the individual genes behavior however gene_sets the basic analysis units of gsa remain the same and interpretation of gene_sets is not interrupted by decorrelation one may also apply the individual gene analysis on top of the gsa results to complement the analysis the correlation bias is a commonly recognized problem in gene_set correlation in a gene_set is known to increase the number of false_positive for the gene randomizing gsa methods but we also found in this study that correlations can reduce the power of a sample randomizing gsa method deco provides an intuitive and effective solution to these problems
