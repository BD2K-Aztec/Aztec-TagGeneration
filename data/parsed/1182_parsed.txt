correlated_evolution of transcription_factors and their binding_sites motivation the interaction between transcription_factor tf and transcription_factor tfbs is essential for gene_regulation mutation in either the tf or the tfbs may weaken their interaction and thus result in abnormalities to maintain such vital interaction a mutation in one of the interacting_partners might be compensated by a corresponding mutation in its binding_partner during the course of evolution confirming this co evolutionary_relationship will guide us in designing protein_sequences to target a specific dna_sequence or in predicting tfbs for poorly_studied proteins or even correcting and rescuing disease mutations in clinical_applications results based on six publicly_available experimentally_validated tftfbs binding datasets for the basic helixloophelix bhlh family homeo family high_mobility hmg family and transient_receptor channels trp family we showed that the evolutions of the tfs and their tfbss are significantly correlated across eukaryotes we further developed a mutual_information based method to identify co evolved protein residues and dna bases this research sheds light on the dynamic relationship between tf and tfbs during their evolution the same principle and strategy can be applied to co evolutionary_studies on proteindna_interactions in other protein_families availability all the datasets scripts and other related files have been made freely_available at http jjwanglab org co evo the term co evolution was first conceptualized by charles darwin in his study on the two species pollinators and orchids at the molecular level co evolution has been studied in the context of proteinprotein_interaction a change in one of the binding_proteins interaction surface is compensated by an appropriate change in the interface of the partner_protein studies have shown the co evolution of interacting_proteins as well as of interacting_protein and ligand these studies have had great impact in this area of research such as in proteinprotein_interaction and drug_design a protein can bind to more than one dna_sequence and these corresponding binding_sites are usually represented by a binding profile called position_weight pwm methods have been developed to compare the similarity of different pwms by comparing the pairwise similarities of all pwms from a protein_family we can study the evolution of dna_binding for this protein_family thus far the co evolutionary_relationship between a transcription_factor tf and transcription_factor dna binding_site tfbs has not been systematically studied the interaction between tfs and their tfbss is essential for many biological_processes for instance the interaction at the core promoter_regions determines the assembly of the pre initiation complex and the initiation of transcription whereas interactions in the distal promoter_enhancer region determine the rate of transcription in cell_type tissue and developmental_stage specific_manner therefore study of tftfbs interaction is critical to our understanding of the transcriptional_regulatory of gene_expression in this study we hypothesize that the evolutions of tfs and their tfbss are correlated we used the basic helixloop helix bhlh homeo high_mobility hmg and transisent receptor potential channels trp protein_families to illustrate this principle of co evolutionary_relationship we first performed the analysis based on the bhlh family the bhlh family is an ancient component of transcriptional_regulation with more than members found in humans this protein_family has a strong_selection force and plays critical roles in diverse_biological from cell_proliferation to carcinogenesis e g the oncogene and ipsc reprogramming factor cmyc it has evolved into members in humans and of them are conserved in micewe used the bhlh homeo hmg and trp family tfs and their tfbss to test the hypothesis that the evolutions of tfs and their binding_sites are correlated for bhlh family we used three datasets the mammalian dataset and eukaryote dataset from the jaspar database and the caeel dataset from thein the bhlh_proteins basic region is significantly co evolved with the central two positions of e box binding_sites a on the left is one segment containing the basic region of bhlh_proteins from the pfam multiple_sequence of the eukaryote bhlh dataset interacting residues annotated by the bipa database are highlighted and the critical position is marked on the left is the schematic alignment of dna binding_profiles corresponding to the bhlh tfs on the right the central two positions of the e box binding_motif canntg which vary from different bhlh subgroups are also marked b the position of the bhlh_proteins basic region and central two positions of e box binding_sites can be closely compared with each other here the positions on dna binding_profiles are presented as our novel clustered sequences derived from the base_composition in pwms significant co varying patterns are shown with the corresponding calculated high mi scores uniprobe database in all families and datasets that we tested the coevolutionary relationship between tf and tfbs can be seen clearly showing that the observations were not dependent on the platform used to obtain the tfbss moreover irrespective of whether the tfs are among different species bhlh family mammalian and eukaryotes or within one species bhlh family c elegans we have observed similar co evolution relationship this observation strengthens our hypothesis that such an co evolutionary_relationship exists between tfs and their tfbss we applied multiple statistical_tests to quantify the statistical_significance of any co evolutionary_relationship and all tests were page
