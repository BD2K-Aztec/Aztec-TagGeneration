structural_bioinformatics gossip a method for fast and accurate global_alignment of protein_structures motivation the database of known protein_structures pdb is increasing rapidly this results in a growing need for methods that can cope with the vast amount of structural data to analyze the accumulating_data it is important to have a fast tool for identifying similar structures and clustering them by structural resemblance several excellent tools have been developed for the comparison of protein_structures these usually address the task of local structure alignment an important yet computationally_intensive problem due to its complexity it is difficult to use such tools for comparing a large number of structures to each other at a reasonable time results here we present gossip a novel method for a global all against all alignment of any set of protein_structures the method detects similarities between structures down to a certain cutoff a parameter of the program hence allowing it to detect similar structures at a much higher speed than local structure alignment_methods gossip compares many structures in times which are several orders_of than well known available structure alignment servers and it is also faster than a database scanning method we evaluate gossip both on a dataset of short structural_fragments and on two large sequence diverse structural benchmarks our conclusions are that for a threshold of and above the speed of gossip is obtained with no compromise of the accuracy of the alignments or of the number of detected global similarities availability a server as well as an executable for download are available atthe space of solved_protein is increasing rapidly new protein_structures are being solved on a daily basis allowing for a more complete understanding of the protein universe the number of possible protein conformations is thought to be limited which suggests the existence of a large structural redundancy in the protein_structures to whom correspondence should be addressed submitted to the pdb the two gold_standards for the structural_classification of the pdb scop and cath provide an answer for this redundancy yet they cannot keep up with the rate of addition of new structures to the pdb one of the reasons is the relatively high computational time required by protein_structure comparisons many excellent protein_structure comparison methods have been devised over the years for example holm and zhang and skolnick b often they employ heuristics that allow them to be relatively efficient yet still accurate in order to diminish computational costs most methods use a c representation of the protein some methods use an even more compact_representation of secondary_structural sses to reduce running_times the purpose of most of these methods is to find evolutionary_relationships between different proteins in many cases this does not require the entire protein_structures to be similar and hence typical structure alignment_methods aim at detecting equivalent substructures in different proteins while this in itself is extremely_important it slows down the speed of the computation tremendously because the number of potentially similar substructures is exponential in the length of the protein the method we describe here named gossip global structure superposition of proteins is aimed at performing an allagainst all global_alignment of any given set of protein_structures it does not search for partial structural matches between regions of two aligned_proteins and hence does not aim to provide an alternative for existing local structural alignment_methods rather we propose a method that provides fast accurate large_scale comparisons of protein_structures a significant_advantage of our method is that it can be applied to any set of protein_structures represented by c coordinates regardless of protein size no preprocessing stage is necessary as in many other methods that are intended for fast one against all comparisons moreover no knowledge of secondary_structure or other features of the protein is required this allows the method to be applicable for structural_fragments where the secondary_structure content is limited or non existent e g loops and coils the motivation for our work comes from a problem we encountered during our research that required the creation of sequence_profiles based on structural_information we needed to cluster several hundred thousand structural_fragments with varying lengths these fragments were roughly divided_into groups according to secondary_structure which still left severalpage
