genome_analysis treephyler fast taxonomic_profiling of metagenomes assessment of phylogenetic diversity is a key element to the analysis of microbial_communities tools are needed to handle next_generation data and to cope with the computational_complexity of large_scale studies here we present treephyler a tool for fast taxonomic_profiling of metagenomes treephyler was evaluated on real metagenome to assess its performance in comparison to previous_approaches for taxonomic_profiling results indicate that treephyler is in terms of speed and accuracy prepared for next_generation techniques and large_scale analysis beyond the analysis of single species genomes of culturable organisms metagenomics currently opens a new view on the exploration of microbial_communities progress in sequencing_technology enables broader and deeper genomic sampling of the biosphere which in turn puts new challenges for sequence_analysis methods problems arise from the sheer mass and the short_length of sequencing_reads usually only a small fraction of reads can be assembled due to the phylogenetic diversity in the samples in the first instance large_scale analysis of short metagenomic sequencing_reads has to provide an estimate of the phylogenetic distribution of the sample taxonomic_profiling achieves this task by assigning sequencing_reads to phylogenetic categories the most common methods are based on homology to known genes the classical gold_standard approach to taxonomic_profiling in metagenomics is focused on the s rrna gene and relies on a sufficient number of sequences of that gene in metagenomic sequence_data usually the number of reads containing sufficiently_long stretches of s rrna is small therefore several researchers perform deep_sequencing of that particular gene see e g although this approach efficiently overcomes the sparseness of s rrna in metagenomic_samples the sequence_data support taxonomic_profiling only page the relative amount of assigned sequences is shown for each method as well as for each bacterial phylum for the glacial ice metagenome screen matching sequencing_reads for significant hits reads are classified using a phylogenetic_tree for each pfam family with a sufficient number of newly assigned sequences approximate maximum_likelihood trees of the pfam_database sequences and the matching reads are computed using fasttree which combines the speed of minimum evolution methods with the accuracy of maximum_likelihood methods once trees are computed treephyler uses the algorithm of to classify reads according to the phylogenetic placement in the tree see also treephyler web_site treephyler offers an efficient way to balance the computation load on multi core computers or computer clusters by this the runtime only depends on the computation of the largest trees similar to carma treephyler only computes trees for pfam families with less than assigned reference_sequences the glacial ice dataset was taken as a reference because of its relatively short_read length_bp the availability of results from a s analysis and the moderate sample_size gbp we analysed the glacial ice dataset to assess the performance of treephyler in comparison with the tree based tool carma and the signature based tool phymm and the s rna reference analysis the analysis was conducted on a single ghz dual core cpu amd opteron with gb ram for runtime comparison we randomly_selected of the glacial ice dataset to allow the comparison with carma both treephyler and phymm analysed the reduced dataset in min while it took carma h to complete the analysis on the full dataset treephyler needed only h while phymm needed h the estimated runtime for carma is h the runtime of ufo for the reduced and the full dataset was s and m respectively results on the full dataset of treephyler and carma taken from are in good agreement with the s analysis expect for the phyla bacteroidetes phymm carma treephyler s and betaproteobacteria p c t s where all three methods differ from the s analysis see this may be the consequence of an uneven taxon sampling of pfam remarkably phymm also disagreed on the phyla firmicutes p s and gammaproteobacteria p s test data and additional results for the class level are available at the treephyler web_site we introduced treephyler a new tool for fast taxonomic_profiling of metagenomes we evaluated our method on real metagenomic_data by comparison with previous_approaches for taxonomic_profiling we could show a close correspondence between the predicted profiles of treephyler and carma while computational speed was increased by orders_of while speed is not necessarily an essential requirement in genome_analysis the increase of metagenomic sequence_data urges for particularly efficient techniques which also work with limited computational_resources therefore the approach we propose here is well prepared for nextgeneration_sequencing and large_scale studies like the exploration of the human_microbiome funding dfg german research foundation priority program spp deep metazoan phylogeny project wo
