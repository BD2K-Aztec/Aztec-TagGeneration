highly_accurate sequence_based prediction of half sphere exposures of amino_acid in proteins downloaded from motivation solvent_exposure of amino_acid of proteins plays an important role in understanding and predicting protein_structure function and interactions solvent_exposure can be characterized by several measures including solvent_accessible asa residue depth rd and contact numbers cn more recently an orientation dependent contact number called half sphere exposure hse was introduced by separating the contacts within upper and down half spheres defined according to the ca cb hseb vector or neighboring ca ca vectors hsea hsea calculated from protein_structures was found to better describe the solvent_exposure over asa cn and rd in many applications thus a sequence_based prediction is desirable as most proteins do not have experimentally_determined structures to our best knowledge there is no method to predict hsea and only one method to predict hseb results this study developed a novel method for predicting both hsea and hseb spider hse that achieved a consistent performance for fold_cross and two independent_tests the correlation_coefficients between predicted and measured hseb for upper sphere for down sphere and for contact numbers for the independent test_set of proteins are significantly_higher than existing_methods moreover predicted hsea has a higher correlation_coefficient to the stability change by residue mutants than predicted hseb and asa the results together with its easy ca atom based calculation highlight the potential usefulness of predicted hsea for protein_structure and refinement as well as function prediction availability_and the method is available at http sparksmeasuring exposure of amino_acid of proteins to solvent is important for understanding and predicting protein_structure function and interactions the most common measure is solvent_accessible asa with applications ranging from protein_structure to protein_function the inability of asa to discriminate deeply buried residues from those buried just beneath the surface leads to development of residue depth by averaging the distance to the nearest atom on the protein surface both asa and residue depth however require precise evaluation of the protein surface in full atomic details that is time consuming having a timeconsuming calculation and requiring an all atomic model limited the usefulness of asa and residue depth in the ab_initio prediction of protein_structure where protein conformation is often represented by main_chain atoms or only ca atoms in initial conformational_sampling another measure of residue exposure to solvent is contact number cn which counts the number of residues within specific distance cut_offs the distances are based on the positions of ca or cb atoms thus unlike asa and residue depth only a coarse_grained model is needed for evaluating cns different distance cut_offs have been used in earlier_studies it was shown that cn with a distance cut_off between and a is the best for protein fold_recognition all above_mentioned solvent_exposure measures however do not contain explicit_information regarding the orientation of side_chains that are important for functional and structural studies hamelryck designed a new measure by splitting the sphere around the ca atom into two half spheres along the vector of ca cb atoms the half sphere containing the cb atom was defined as upper and the other as down half spheres the numbers of ca atoms enclosed in these two half spheres were named as half sphere exposure hse up and hse down respectively in addition he has substituted the vector ca cb with a pseudo vector generated from the sum of vectors ca i ca i and ca i ca i this hse is denoted as hsea up and down to distinguish from the hse calculated based on the ca cb vector here and hereafter it will be annotated as hseb hsea does not require the positions of cb atoms one advantage of hse is that its value is independent of amino_acid type because it describes a residues coordination environment rather than a quantity related to its size such as asa and rd interestingly hsea up outperforms other solvent_exposure measures including cn asa relative asa residue depth and the other three hse definitions hseb up hseb down and hsea down in correlation to changes in protein_stability due to mutations and to conservation of amino_acid more recently hse was found to be better than asa for prediction of b cell epitopes of proteins from their three_dimensional structures hse has also been found useful in many other applications most of these applications obtained hse based on known protein_structures because the structures for most proteins are not known experimentally a sequence_based prediction is desirable many sequence_based were developed for predicting asa and cn however there is no method available for prediction of hsea and only one hsepred for the prediction of hseb we found that the correlation_coefficients between actual hseb and those predicted by hsepred up and down respectively are less than for our dataset of proteins one possible factor is that hsepred was trained on a small dataset of proteins and was not tested on independent datasets therefore a more accurate method is clearly needed recently we developed a method called spider that utilized predicted secondary_structures backbone torsion_angles and asa iteratively in order to improve their accuracies the method achieved_accuracy for secondary_structure for the correlation_coefficient between predicted and actual solvent_accessible and for mean absolute errors of backbone u and w angles respectively and and for mean absolute errors of ca based h and s angles respectively for an independent test_dataset of proteins here we expand the iterative technique to the prediction of hsea up anddown hseb up and down and cn by employing a large dataset containing protein_chains the method was independently tested in a dataset of proteins and a dataset of proteins from the critical assessment of structure_prediction technique casp as a result highly_accurate and robust prediction was obtained e g a correlation_coefficient of for hseb up for hseb down and for contact number on the independent test_set comparison to two previous methods for contact_prediction and hseb confirmed the superior_performance of the method obtained the hsea and hseb predictors are incorporated as a package in spider available at http sparks lab org or downloadable as a standalone package
