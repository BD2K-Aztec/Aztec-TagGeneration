gene_expression ebseq an empirical_bayes hierarchical_model for inference in rna_seq experiments motivation messenger_rna expression is important in normal development and differentiation as well as in manifestation of disease rna_seq experiments allow for the identification of differentially_expressed de genes and their corresponding isoforms on a genome_wide scale however statistical_methods are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made a number of methods exist for identifying de genes but far fewer are available for identifying de isoforms when isoform de is of interest investigators often apply gene level count based_methods directly to estimates of isoform counts doing so is not recommended in short estimating isoform_expression is relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms but more challenging for others this results in estimation uncertainty that varies across isoform groups count based_methods were not designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty and consequently application of them for isoform inference results in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased false_discoveries for others results taking_advantage of the merits of empirical bayesian_methods we have developed ebseq for identifying de isoforms in an rna_seq experiment comparing two or more biological conditions results demonstrate substantially improved power and performance of ebseq for identifying de isoforms ebseq also proves to be a robust approach for identifying de genes availability_and an r package containing examples and sample datasets is available atappropriate expression of a genes isoforms via alternative_splicing is fundamental to normal development and maintenance in eukaryotes and aberrations in alternative_splicing are common in disease consequently there is much interest in identifying isoforms with expression that varies on average across biological conditions high_throughput cdna sequencing rna_seq experiments provide the potential to identify such differentially_expressed de isoforms on a genome_wide scale but statistical_methods are required to ensure that accurate identifications are made the statistical_methods available for identifying differences in isoforms in an rna_seq experiment e g miso fdm chi_square in have focused on changes in the proportion of gene specific reads assigned to an isoform so_called differential transcription dt or differential splicing ds these methods do not consider changes in overall expression levels and are therefore not appropriate for identifying de isoforms for example consider a gene with two isoforms the first with average counts and in conditions and respectively the second with average counts and in the two conditions respectively these isoforms would not be dt or ds given that the proportion of total reads assigned to each isoform is unchanged across conditions for isoform and for isoform but the isoforms would likely be called de given there is a fold increase in expression in the second condition when isoform level de calls are required count based_methods developed for identifying de genes are often applied directly to estimates of isoform_expression doing so is not optimal the main_problem is that count based_methods expect counts or more specifically an integer summary of reads mapping to a genes constituent exons and they were not designed to accommodate the differential uncertainty induced by isoform_expression estimation in short prior to isoform de inference each isoforms expression must be estimated from aligned_reads for genes with a single isoform this problem is rather straightforward in that all reads mapping to that gene are used to estimate that isoforms expression for genes with multiple_isoforms isoform_expression estimation is more difficult as reads mapping to exons common to multiple_isoforms must be allocated in a way consistent with each isoforms expression_level which is the very quantity being estimated there are a number of methods available for estimating isoform_expression rsem rseq isoem to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this

constitutive exons there are varying levels of uncertainty in isoform_expression estimates see most approaches for identifying de in an rna_seq experiment focus on genes deseq edger bayseq bbseq and do not accommodate this differential uncertainty consequently they are not appropriate for identifying de isoforms another recently_developed approach may be used for identifying de exons but does not provide information on which associated isoforms are de when isoform de is of interest some count based_methods e g edger suggest choosing a single isoform such as the isoform with the most counts within a gene or the longest isoform and estimating expression using reads mapping to the isoforms constituent exons in either case information on other isoforms is lost and reads mapping to multiple genes are ignored a more serious consideration is that erroneous_conclusions may be made due to differences in other isoforms seefor an example other methods such as easyrnaseq suggest that one assign all reads mapping to overlapping exons to each isoform separately i e count reads mapping to exon intwice once for each isoform and then proceed with a count based_approach as with the prior suggestion this can lead to erroneous_conclusions specifically an isoform may appear to be equally expressed ee say isoform in even if it is not a potentially more robust way to proceed is to estimate each isoforms mrna counts using a method designed specifically to do so and then apply a count based_approach directly to expected counts after rounding the expected counts to the nearest integer this too is not advised count based_methods require gene level counts and consequently do not account for uncertainty inherent in estimated counts furthermore given that uncertainty varies systematically for different groups of isoforms applications of count based_approaches for isoform level inference result in reduced power for some classes of isoforms and increased false_discoveries for others in short the test_statistics used by most methods for de gene identification calibrate a difference in expression levels between conditions by a variance which is commonly estimated using the meanvariance relationship observed in data shows that this relationship varies dramatically for different groups of isoforms where groups are defined by the number of constituent isoforms of the parent gene other definitions are possible as discussed below specifically an isoform of gene g is assigned to the i g k group for example where k or if the total number of isoforms from gene g is k the i g group contains all isoforms from genes having or more isoforms shows two hypothetical genes g and g gene g has one isoform denoted by i g gene g has two i g the problem of estimating expression for isoforms of g is complicated by the fact that reads mapping to exon must be unambiguously assigned to each isoform this results in increased uncertainty on average in expression estimates for isoforms sharing a parent shows hypothetical expression of the isoforms from gene g in each of two conditions assuming differences in library size have been accommodated if one focuses on the longest isoform isoform and uses all reads mapping to its constituent isoforms to estimate its expression the isoform is called equivalently expressed as there are reads_mapped in condition and mapped in condition however if the expression of other isoforms is considered it becomes clear that isoform contains almost twice as many reads in condition as in condition versus respectively panel c demonstrates how estimation uncertainty changes as isoform complexity increases we quantified isoform complexity here by i g where the i g k group represents isoforms from genes with k isoforms here isoforms from genes with more than three isoforms are included in the i g group alternative definitions of complexity are discussed in the text shown top right are splines fit to the empirical variance as a function of the mean for all isoforms as well as isoforms within groups defined by i g for the two group human_embryonic rna_seq experiment described in section bottom right considers isoforms with average expression expected count in the range was chosen as it approximates the th and th percentiles of expression across all isoforms shown are box plots of the variances of these isoforms collectively and within i g group median variance within each group is shown rightas shown in there is decreased variability in the i g group but increased variability in the others due to the relative increase in uncertainty inherent in estimating isoform_expression when multiple_isoforms of a given gene are present this observation is not specific to the dataset and or the method used for isoform_expression estimation it is also not specific to the particular method used for quantifying isoform complexity see supplementary figs s s for additional examples if isoforms are analysed collectively there is reduced power for identifying isoforms in the i g group since the true variances in that group are lower on average than those derived from the full collection of isoforms and increased false_discoveries in the i g and i g groups since the true variances are higher on average than those derived from the full collection these effects are demonstrated in a simulation_study in section of the supplementary_material cuffdiff and bitseq account for differential uncertainty in isoform_expression estimates and thus appropriately accommodate de inference at the isoform level however cuffdiff often finds fewer genes than comparable approaches and the simulations here suggest this is a result of lack of power as opposed to an increased false_discovery fdr of other methods bitseq is a good alternative when ranking isoforms is of interest but it does not provide a way to control a list of identifications at a desired_level of fdr finally both approaches couple expression estimation with de inference and are not applicable to expression estimates_obtained separately e g via rsem or one of the other methods mentioned above as other expression estimation methods have demonstrated higher_precision and continue to be improved methods for de inference that accept expression estimates directly are desirable taking_advantage of the merits of empirical_bayesian eb methods we developed an approach_called ebseq for inference in an rna_seq experiment although its main advantage over other approaches is in its ability to identify de isoforms results from simulations and case studies demonstrate good performance for identification of de genes as well simulation_studies were conducted to investigate the operating characteristics of ebseq and to assess how ebseq compares with competing approaches as detailed in section each simulated dataset derives counts from a negative_binomial the negative_binomial assumption is common to each method considered here and should therefore not provide advantage or lack thereof to any one method in particular furthermore the form of the variance is not one we assumed in ebseq rather it was prescribed in the simulation set up of robinson and smyth three sets of simulations are considered here additional simulations are evaluated in section of the supplementary_material for evaluation of isoform level inference ebseq is compared with cuffdiff and bitseq it is important to note that cuffdiff and bitseq are not stand alone packages that accept counts directly rather cuffdiff requires as input aligned_reads that are subsequently processed through cufflinks to estimate counts bitseq is similar requiring that reads are processed through bitseq stage this is important as in the isoform simulation_studies sims i and ii simulated counts were transformed back to reads as was done in rsem the reads were then processed via cufflinks or bitseq stage prior to analysis the transformation is not possible with simulated gene counts as multiple read_count configurations can give rise to the same overall gene count and as a result cuffdiff is not evaluated in the gene simulations it is evaluated at the gene level on both maqc project and case study data bitseq is not evaluated in any gene level analysis as the pplr provided for each isoform is derived from isoform specific markov_chain mcmc samples and no information is provided on combining the chains to derive a gene level pplr shows the power and fdr for ebseq and cuffdiff averaged across sim i simulations for a target fdr of cuffdiff deems some isoforms unacceptable prior to analysis acceptable isoforms are called ok in cuffdiff and so results are reported for all genes as well as those deemed ok by cuffdiff because bitseq provides pplr for rank ordering isoforms but does not specify how to use pplr to construct a list of de isoforms with a target fdr it is not shown in bitseq is evaluated in the roc_curves shown in as shown in cuffdiff has well controlled fdr but reduced power compared with ebseq versus the fdr of ebseq is slightly_elevated panel a ofshows qualitatively_similar results for lists of varying_size not determined by targeting a specific fdr in particular the roc_curves empirical true_positive tpr versus empirical false_positive fpr for lists of increasing size show that the tpr is higher than cuffdiff for lists provided by ebseq for all fprs considered bitseq also provided higher tpr than cuffdiff across all fprs and showed comparable_performance with ebseq a closer look into the de calls from the sim i simulations reveals that operating characteristics are sensitive to which determines within isoform variability to demonstrate the effects panel b ofshows power and fdr for six other sets of simulations where is fixed at a specific value detailed in sim ii the solid lines show that the power of both methods decreases as variability increases with a greater loss in power for cuffdiff the dashed lines show that fdr increases slightly but remains well controlled for both methods shows the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of in four empirical datasets as well as the average cdf from sim i simulations to demonstrate that the values of considered in panel b are typical of those observed in data panel c also demonstrates systematic_differences between the three datasets with biological_replicates and the maqc data given that the maqc data is made up of technical_replicates it is not surprising to observe relatively smaller values of compared with
