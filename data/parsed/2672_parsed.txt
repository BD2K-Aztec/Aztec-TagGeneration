gene_expression large_scale learning of combinatorial transcriptional dynamics from gene_expression motivation knowledge of the activation patterns of transcription_factors tfs is fundamental to elucidate the dynamics of gene_regulation in response to environmental_conditions direct experimental measurement of tfs activities is however challenging resulting in a need to develop statistical_tools to infer tf activities from mrna_expression levels of target_genes current models however neglect important features of transcriptional_regulation in particular the combinatorial nature of regulation which is fundamental for signal integration is not accounted for results we present a novel method to infer combinatorial regulation of gene_expression by multiple transcription_factors in large_scale transcriptional_regulatory the method implements a factorial hidden_markov with a non linear likelihood to represent the interactions between the hidden transcription_factors we explore our models performance on artificial datasets and demonstrate the applicability of our method on genome_wide scale for three expression datasets the results obtained using our model are biologically coherent and provide a tool to explore the concealed nature of combinatorial transcriptional_regulation understanding the control of gene_expression is one of the major_goals of systems_biology while gene_expression is a complex process with multiple control points perhaps the most fundamental is the control of mrna_transcription by dna_binding transcription_factors tfs a fundamental difficulty in elucidating this process from the experimental point_of is measuring active tf concentrations tfs are often expressed_at and their activity state is frequently determined by fast post_translational which are difficult to measure directly a possible solution to this impasse has arisen due to the availability of experimental_tools to determine the connectivity of the transcriptional_regulatory i e which tfs bind specific target_genes in particular the large_scale take up of chromatin to whom correspondence should be addressed immunoprecipitation techniques chip on chip has meant that for model_organisms such as yeast and escherichia_coli this connectivity is now available on a high_throughput scale as a result several authors have recently_proposed to integrate connectivity and gene_expression data in an inferencebased approach to modelling transcription whereby tf_activity is treated as a latent_variable to be reconstructed from observations of target_genes expression broadly speaking inferential approaches to tf_activity reconstruction have used one of two strategies one approach is to use a very simplistic typically log linear_model of transcription to infer the activity of a very large number of tfs this approach is relatively well established and has already led to several novel insights in biological studies in a range of situations however the simplicity of the models imposed by the computational constraints of working with large_datasets has meant that important features of transcriptional_regulation have been neglected more recently other authors have focused on inferring tf activities in small subnetworks but employing more realistic models of transcription based on differential_equations these approaches are computationally more expensive but allow to model biologically more plausible effects such as saturation rapid transitions and non linear interactions between tfs in this article we aim at retaining some of the desirable features of small_scale inference approaches in a model capable of learning tf_activity on a genome_wide scale we focus on the problem of modelling interactions between multiple_tfs this is a crucial mechanism that allows cells to integrate signals we present what to our knowledge is the first statistical_method for reconstructing combinatorial interactions between tfs from target_genes expression levels we achieve this by modelling tf_activity as binary switches which naturally allow for saturation within a factorial hidden_markov fhmm with a non linear emission model which models combinatorial interactions between multiple_tfs at a promoter we propose a fast structured variational approximation for inference in large_scale systems as our model includes non linear interaction it is relatively more highly parametrized than simpler models we therefore extensively tested our model on simulated_data to check its identifiability we then applied it to three real_time course datasets in saccharomyces_cerevisiae and e coli using network architectures derived from chip on chip experiments or curated databases of biological_interactions the key purpose ofpage while our model is still relatively simple the addition of non linear interaction_terms means that more parameters need to be estimated on top of that asymptotically exact inference is computationally unfeasible in large_scale examples therefore as a first analysis we perform a thorough test of the proposed model using artificial data to verify its identifiability in a realistic simulated situation we then use three real_datasets in all cases the main purpose is to probe the extent to which combinatorial regulations can be learned from the expression data these datasets are the classic and much studied yeast_cell dataset the yeast metabolic cycle dataset and the e coli micro aerobic shift dataset finally we compare our results with those obtained with two different methods a simplified_version of the method byand the tfinfer method bywe present a novel method to infer combinatorial interactions between transcriptional_regulators from expression data and network
