fast alignment_free using spaced word frequencies motivation alignment_free for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome_analysis and phylogeny reconstruction they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment based_approaches in particular alignment_free are much faster than pairwise or multiple_alignments they are however less accurate than methods based on sequence_alignment most alignment_free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences a well known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word_matches are far from independent results to reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word_matches we propose to use spaced words defined by patterns of match and dont care positions for alignment_free we describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns to evaluate our approach we use spaced word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction using real_world and simulated sequence_data we demonstrate that our multiple pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words availability_and our program is freely_available attraditional methods for comparative_sequence and phylogeny reconstruction rely on pairwise and multiple_sequence a major_problem with these methods is that they are relatively slow because aligning two sequences takes time proportional to the product of their lengths with the huge amount of sequence_data that are produced by new sequencing_technologies faster methods for sequence comparison are required alignment_free became popular in recent_years as their runtime is usually proportional to the total sequence_length see vinga and almeida for a review alignment_free are increasingly used for genome comparison in particular for genome based phylogeny reconstruction but also for fast protein clustering these approaches are not only much faster than conventional alignment_based but they also overcome some notorious difficulties in phylogenomics such as finding ortholog genes or aligning large genomic_sequences other advantages of alignment_free genome comparison are that they can work with unassembled reads and are not affected by genome_rearrangements alignment_free are also used to construct guide trees for progressive multiple_alignment this could crucially improve the runtime of multiple alignment_algorithms as calculating guide trees becomes the most timeconsuming step in progressive alignment if the number of sequences grows most alignment_free are based on word frequencies for a fixed word length k they calculate a relative wordfrequency vector for each of the input_sequences various distance measures on vector spaces can be used to calculate a pairwise distance_matrix from these word frequency vectors phylogenetic_trees can then be calculated from these distance_matrices with standard methods such as upgma or neighbourjoining other alignment_free approaches define the local_context of sequence_positions in terms of overlapping words containing a position some methods do not rely on a fixed word length k but allow for matches of variable_length a common_feature of all these methods is however that they are based on exact word_matches between the input_sequences database_searching is another traditional application of word matching in sequence_analysis fast local_alignment programs such as blast originally relied on identifying word_matches of a fixed_length so_called seeds rapid indexing methods can be used to identify such seeds to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this

in a second phase of the algorithm seeds are extended into both directions to find statistically_relevant high_scoring segment pairs in a pioneering paper proposed to use spaced seeds instead of contiguous word_matches as a first step in homology searching here a fixed pattern or mask of match and dont care positions is defined and two words of the corresponding length are considered to match if they coincide at the specified match positions while mismatches are allowed at the dont care positions an obvious advantage of this approach is that word_matches at nearby positions are statistically less dependent on each other than contiguous word_matches are also spaced seeds are better able to identify homologue sequence_regions in the presence of mismatches ma et_al showed that spaced seeds are superior to contiguous word_matches in terms of sensitivity and speed see also brown for an overview recently we proposed to use spaced words defined by patterns of match and dont care positions as a basis for alignment_free instead of using spaced word_matches to trigger local_alignments we compare the spaced word composition of sequences to define a measure of global similarity between them in the present article we describe an efficient algorithm based on recursive hashing and bit operations to calculate and compare spaced word frequencies and we extend our approach to distance measures defined by multiple patterns we use these distance measures to construct phylogenetic_trees for real_world and simulated dna and protein_sequence families and we compare our method to established alignment_free using contiguous word frequencies as well as to a traditional alignment based_approach our results show that for phylogeny reconstruction spaced words based on multiple patterns are superior to existing alignment_free that rely on contiguous words a_user for our program is described by alignment_free are regularly used to estimate evolutionary_distances between dna and protein_sequences and to construct phylogenetic_trees most of these methods are based on word frequencies such approaches are usually less accurate than traditional phylogeny approaches that are based on multiple_sequence but they are much faster while aligning two sequences takes time proportional to the product of their lengths word frequencies can be calculated in linear time a certain disadvantage of word based_methods is the fact that word occurrences at neighbouring sequence_positions are far from independent for this reason some authors proposed to correct word statistics by taking overlapping word_matches into account goke in database_searching word_matches have been replaced by so_called spaced seeds where string matches according to a nonperiodic pattern p of match and dont care positions are used motivated by this approach we proposed to use spaced words instead of the traditionally used contiguous words to estimate distances between sequences and to construct phylogenetic_trees while under an i i d sequence model the expected number of occurrences of a spaced word is approximately the same as for the corresponding contiguous word obtained by removing the dont care positions spaced word test results on simulated protein_sequences the spaced word approach was used with a pattern weight of k notation as infig influence of the number of patterns on the results of spaced words applied to a set of simulated protein_sequences of length aa generated with rose sets p of patterns generated as in note that for short pattern lengths the set of all possible patterns is limited so for and only small values of m could be tested influence of the number of patterns on the results of our multiplepattern approach the program was run on a set of simulated dna_sequences of length nt each generated with rose for k different values of and m we generated sets p of patterns each every set p containing m patterns the quality of the produced trees measured as the average rf distance of the trees to the respective reference trees is plotted against m
