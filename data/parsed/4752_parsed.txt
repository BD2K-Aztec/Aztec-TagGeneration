truncated branch and bound achieves efficient constraint based genetic design motivation computer_aided genetic design is a promising approach to a core problem of metabolic engineeringthat of identifying genetic_manipulation strategies that result in engineered strains with favorable product accumulation this approach has proved to be effective for organisms including escherichia_coli and saccharomyces_cerevisiae allowing for rapid rational_design of engineered strains finding optimal genetic_manipulation strategies however is a complex computational_problem in which running time grows exponentially with the number of manipulations i e knockouts knock ins or regulation changes in the strategy thus computer_aided gene identification has to date been limited in the complexity or optimality of the strategies it finds or in the size and level of detail of the metabolic_networks under consideration results here we present an efficient computational solution to the gene identification problem our approach significantly_outperforms previous approachesin seconds or minutes we find strategies that previously required running_times of days or more availability_and gdbb is implemented using matlab and is freely_available for non profit use atcomputational methods have been developed that allow the genomes of organisms to be designed for metabolic_engineering purposes these methods which include optknock optreg optstrain optflux and genetic design through local_search gdls have proved to be effective for the metabolic_engineering of escherichia_coli and saccharomyces_cerevisiae and the same approach can be applied to other organisms such a computerbased approach to metabolic_engineering facilitates rapid effective engineering and consequently efficient computational_design to whom correspondence should be addressed techniques have significant implications for many applications including biofuel and drug production the computational_methods we describe are based on constraintbased models of metabolism that predict the production of desired compounds under genetic_manipulations constraint_based can achieve a high_level of accuracy in their predictions and over organism specific genome_scale models have been developed and used in various applications to date a comprehensive_review of the applications of constraint_based including a table listing existing organism specific genome_scale models has been conducted by constraint_based is based on the stoichiometric matrix or s matrix which represents the metabolic_network within a cell more accurately the s matrix is comprised of the stoichiometric coefficients of all metabolic_reactions within a cell given the s matrix methods such as flux_balance fba minimization of metabolic adjustment and regulatory on off minimization allow the effect of genetic_manipulations such as gene_deletions or knockouts to be predicted computer design of genomes for metabolic_engineering uses in silico predictions to identify genetic_manipulations that result in favorable metabolic phenotypes although obtaining in silico predictions is much faster than performing genetic_manipulations on the actual organism the space of all possible genetic_manipulations is nevertheless vast even if we only consider gene_knockouts the number of possible gene_knockout configurations i e specific sets of gene_knockouts increases exponentially with the total number of genes we allow to be knocked out thus computational_methods seeking to find an optimal set of knockouts generally have running_times that increase exponentially with the number of allowed knockouts which limits optimal genomic designs found in silico to a small number of knockouts moreover with ever more biological_knowledge being created and curated the size and accuracy of constraint_based is increasing which causes an associated increase in the computational_complexity of modeling and genomic design as an example of the pace of improvement the model we use in this study the iaf model of e coli is nearly twice of the size of the previous ijr model published only years prior in those years the number of metabolic_reactions modeled increased from to a near doubling given the pace at which model size has grown for e coli over and the application of constraint_based to organisms beyond e coli many with larger genomesit seems evident that models of the size of iaf and larger will become standard in future it has therefore become imperative that efficient computational_methods for finding genetic_manipulation strategies that overcome the exponential scaling of manipulation configurations are developed and a significant body of work has been devoted to this goal here we present a simple elegant solution to the problem our approach which we call genetic design through branch and bound gdbb uses a truncated branch and branch algorithm to tackle the bilevel optimization framework used in optknock optreg gdls and elsewhere truncated branch and bound is an adaption of the branch and bound algorithm branch and bound is a general algorithm for finding optimal solutions to various optimization_problems truncated branch and bound stops processing before the algorithm determines that a solution is optimal and stops at a feasible near optimal_solution considered sufficient for practical purposes truncated branch and bound can be applied to any combinatorial_optimization and it has been previously shown to perform well on difficult optimization_problems such as the asymmetric traveling salesman problem and project scheduling problems we show that gdbb using this heuristic approach vastly outperforms previous_approaches finding near optimal solutions in seconds to minutes that otherwise would require days or more thus representing a significant enabling advance in computer design for metabolic_engineering gdbb can be applied to find near optimal gene_knockout strategies using the bilevel optimization framework used in optknock or near optimal up and downregulation strategies using the bilevel optimization framework used in optreg more generally it can be applied to find near optimal genetic_manipulations strategies for any setup for which there exists a bilevel optimization framework that can be converted in a single level mixed integer_linear milp linear_programming lp is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective_function subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints an milp problem is a lp problem where some of the unknown variables are required to be integers in general milp problems are np_hard transforming bilevel optimization of fba models to single level milp problems has resulted in computational_methods that efficiently search the space of genetic_manipulations this approach is much more efficient than exhaustive brute_force search but it is nevertheless very computationally_intensive to tackle the milp gdbb uses a truncated branch and branch algorithm in this article we show that truncated branch and bound performs extraordinarily well on bilevel optimization_problems associated with genomic design for simplicity we focus exclusively on knockouts in this article i e on finding knockout strategies that lead to favorable metabolic phenotypes to illustrate the utility of gdbb we consider the metabolic_engineering of e coli for acetate and succinate production these cases serve as useful cases for comparison they were previously used to compare the performance of gdls with other approaches in which gdls compared favorably and there is experimental experience with the metabolic_engineering of e coli for these purposes as gdls compares_favorably with other approaches such as the evolutionary algorithm and simulated_annealing meta heuristics implemented in the optflux software platform we primarily show the performance of gdbb in comparison with gdls for reference we have also included the performance of the global search method optknock for a given number of allowed knockouts global search is guaranteed to find an optimal_solution i e a knockout strategy that achieves the maximum synthetic production flux but as such its running time increases exponentially with the number of allowed knockouts in we show the performance of gdbb compared with that of gdls and global search for acetate production in e coli using the most recent genome_scale constraint based model of e coli iaf using the different approaches we search for knockout strategies with a maximum running time of s h we chose h to be the time period for evaluating performance as a reasonable but arbitrary choice we expect that performance gains found within h can be extended to any given time period we see that gdbb finds comparable solutions to those found by gdls and global search with vastly improved running timeoften one or two or more orders_of as such gdbb is able to find solutions within h that are not found by the other two approaches indeed gdbb finds a knockout strategy achieving an acetate production flux of mmol h gdw which is an increase of mmol h gdw or over the best solution found by gdls in h and it does so in a mere s
