looping a template based tool for predicting the structure of protein loops motivation predicting the structure of protein loops is very challenging mainly because they are not necessarily subject to strong evolutionary_pressure this implies that unlike the rest of the protein standard homology_modeling techniques are not very effective in modeling their structure however loops are often involved in protein_function hence inferring their structure is important for predicting protein_structure as well as function results we describe a method looping based on the random_forest automated learning technique which given a target loop selects a structural template for it from a database of loop candidates compared to the most recently available methods looping is able to achieve_similar accuracy for short loops residues and significant enhancements for long loops residues the quality of the predictions is robust to errors that unavoidably affect the stem regions when these are modeled the method returns a confidence_score for the predicted template loops and has the advantage of being very fast on average min loop the functional characterization of proteins is an important and at the same time challenging_problem in biology the annotation task can be facilitated by the knowledge of the three_dimensional d structure of the protein of interest and of its complexes however determining a protein d structure experimentally is an expensive_and task as a result the number of experimentally solved_protein is very small compared to the number of available protein_sequences however this situation is changing and homology_modeling is currently making structural_information available for a large number of proteins structurally speaking proteins consist of elements of secondary_structure alpha_helices and beta_strands connected by loops these often play important functional_roles and frequently interact with other biomolecules although they might adopt different conformations and or be flexible especially when located on the surface it is still the case that they often adopt a specific conformation and are well defined in x_ray in terms of sequence_composition loops are the most variable parts of proteins and tend to be more frequently subject to insertions deletions and substitutions than secondary_structure regions consequently the accuracy of loop structure_prediction by template based_methods is generally lower than that of other regions on the other hand the most variable_regions within a family of evolutionary related proteins are often those determining the protein specificity similarly to the prediction of the whole protein_structure loop modeling_methods can be categorized into two main groups ab_initio loop structure_prediction is generally based on the exploration of different loop conformations in a given environment guided by minimization of a selected energy function bruccoleri v c the author published_by
