gene_expression spotxplore a cytoscape_plugin for visual_exploration of hotspot expression in gene_regulatory spotxplore is a plugin for cytoscape for extraction and visualization of differentially_expressed subnetworks hotspots from gene_networks the hotspot based visualization approach_enables interactive_exploration of regulatory_interactions in differentially_expressed gene_sets and it allows a researcher to explore gene_expression in direct_relation to the affected cellular gene network the hotspots provide a view beyond the commonly used metabolic_pathways and gene ontologies interpretation of gene_expression from time series experiments or multiple perturbation studies is a challenging_task insight can be obtained by analyzing the data in the context of molecular_interaction such as gene_regulatory or metabolic_pathways which requires visualization in addition to statistical_analysis tools many tools for visualizing the various types of biological_networks have been developed nevertheless there is a need for tools that incorporate dynamics of gene_expression in the networks by offering both data analysis and visualization only then a researcher does not have to switch between various applications to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biological_processes affected in the experiments the generic biological_network visualization_tool cytoscape provides an excellent environment to implement combined analysis and visualization methods in this article we present spotxplore a plugin for analysis and visual_exploration of differentially_expressed subnetworks hotspots spotxplore provides two methods to detect such hotspots and allows the user to visualize the hotspots in the context of the whole network to explore regulatory_interactions between differentially
