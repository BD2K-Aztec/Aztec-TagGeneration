genome_analysis a genomic random interval model for statistical_analysis of genomic lesion data motivation tumors_exhibit numerous genomic lesions such as copy_number structural_variations and sequence_variations it is difficult to determine_whether a specific constellation of lesions observed across a cohort of multiple_tumors provides statistically_significant evidence that the lesions target a set of genes that may be located across different chromosomes but yet are all involved in a single specific biological_process or function results we introduce the genomic random interval grin statistical_model and analysis method that evaluates the statistical_significance of the abundance of genomic lesions that overlap a specific locus or a pre defined set of biologically related loci the grin model retains certain biologically_important properties of genomic lesions that are ignored by other methods in a simulation_study and two example analyses of leukemia genomic lesion data grin more effectively identified important loci as significant than did three methods based on a permutation of markers model grin also identified biologically_relevant pathways with a significant abundance of lesions in both examples microarray and next_generation have enabled biomedical_researchers to characterize the genome of individual tissue_samples at a high_resolution in cancer_genomics these technologies have been used to identify genomic lesions in which the dna of the tumor has been altered relative to that of normal_tissue from the same subject genomic lesions include copy_number changes sequence mutations and structural_rearrangements genomic lesions may impact oncogenesis and clinical prognosis in this way the development of the data_collection technologies and associated data analysis methods has contributed profoundly to our understanding of the genomic basis of cancer development and prognosis several analysis methods have been developed to identify and assign a statistical_significance e g p value to hot_spot loci that are affected by copy_number at a high_frequency the genomic identification of significant targets in cancer gistic algorithm and its extensions jistic and gistic significant aberration in cancer saic and tagcna gistic is one of the most widely used methods it computes a statistic that summarizes the frequency and amplitude of copy_number at each marker of a specific microarray_platform it then uses within tumor permutation of the assignment of copy_number to marker locus as a null statistical_model to evaluate statistical_significance in this way gistic obtains a p value for each microarray marker locus and significant peaks are subsequently identified from this profile of p values the jistic method uses a modified algorithm for identifying peaks in the p value profile the gistic algorithm modifies several components of the original gistic algorithm but gistic still relies on permutation of markers poms or bins of markers to compute p values saic and tagcna compute statistics that describe the extent to which specific marker loci are affected by copy_number and use poms as a null statistical_model to determine statistical_significance each of these methods has been successfully used for several applications and thus represent important_contributions in computational cancer_biology nevertheless each of these methods have some limitations that should be addressed first of all these methods use a biologically implausible statistical_model of the null probability that a lesion affects a locus gistic jistic gistic saic and tagcna each use a poms model for this purpose pom permutes the assignment of copy_number to marker locus within each tumor in this way pom shatters single contigous lesions into numerous probabilistically independent entities consequently many biologically_important lesions are not identified as statistically_significant secondly these methods are not readily_applicable to genomic lesion data collected by whole_genome wgs these methods each require that the data be represented in the form of a marker by subject matrix with wgs every mappable base_pair in the genome is a marker so the matrix will be large additionally these methods were developed solely for copy_number and do not provide a way to incorporate other lesions such as point_mutations or structural_rearrangements that may be detected with wgs finally these methods only evaluate the statistical_significance of the frequency that individual_markers are affected by a lesion but do not directly determine_whether a given set of biologically related genes scattered across the genome such as a particular pathway have a statistically_significant abundance of genomic lesions therefore we have developed the genomic random interval grin statistical_model for statistical_analysis of genomic lesion data the grin model explicitly represents each genomic lesion as an entity that affects one point locus a set of point loci or an interval locus along a chromosome in this way the grin model retains the continuity of the genomic lesions and naturally avoids the difficulties introduced by statistical_models that do not retain lesion continuity additionally the grin model can accommodate any genomic lesion that can be represented as a locus on the reference_genome copy_number are represented by intervals with distinct start and end loci point_mutations are represented by their respective loci and structural_rearrangements are represented by the loci of the associated breakpoints finally the grin model provides a computationally_feasible approach to evaluate the statistical_significance of the frequency that lesions affect a set of genes involved in a particular biological_process furthermore like other methods grin also provides a mechanism to evaluate the significance of the frequency that lesions affect each point locus in the genome and the locus of each individual gene in the genome the remainder of this work is organized as follows in section we describe the grin model in detail section evaluates the performance of grin and other methods in a simulation_study and two example analyses from leukemia studies section provides discussion and concluding_remarks
