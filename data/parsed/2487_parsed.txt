structural_bioinformatics in silico analysis of phytoene synthase and its promoter reveals hints for regulation mechanisms of carotenogenesis in duanliella bardawil motivation previous researches showed that phytoene synthase psy from dunaliella bardawil is the first regulatory point in carotenogenesis we hypothesize certain interactions between the environmental stress_factors and the regulatory_sequences of psy in d bardawil dbpsy consequently la pcr based genomic walking approach was performed for isolation of psy promoter and terminator respectively the obtained nucleic_acid and the corresponding protein_structure of dbpsy were analyzed and predicted using various bioinformatics_tools finally we presented some hints for the regulation mechanisms of dbpsy at the molecular level according to the computed results results la pcr based genomic walking results showed that the isolated sequences are the promoter and terminator of psy correspondingly computational_analysis demonstrated several candidate motifs of the promoter exhibiting hypothetic uv b norglurzon and salt_induced characteristics as well as some typical domains universally discovered in promoter_sequences such as tata_box ccaat box and gata box etc furthermore the structure of psy was also predicted and aligned along with many counterparts at the protein level low_homology of n terminus was found in d bardawil while a relatively conserved c terminus was predicted to be involved in the catalytic_activity and substrate recognization binding phylogenic analysis classified the dbpsy into a cluster with other algae these results implied that psy may share similar regulation mechanisms among algae with respect to their c termini while the diversity in n terminus among psys along with the predicted inducible motifs in psy promoter from d bardawil may confer the fine_tuning differences between d bardawil and other algae conclusion by means of computer techniques we found in d barawali that two interesting conserved_motifs of psy promoter may involve in uv b norglurzon and salt regulation correspondingly and that the diversity of psy protein mainly lies in the n termini among algae these results indicate some hints for regulation mechanisms of carotenogenesis in d bradawil carotenoids are a wide family of polyene pigments synthesized by all plants various algae and certain species of bacteria fungi and archaea in photosynthetic_organisms carotenoids carry out several essential functions i e participating in photosynthesis to protect the photosynthetic_apparatus from potential oxidative_damage besides light_harvesting demmig animals cannot synthesize carotenoids but may obtain them through derivative pigmentation from diet some carotenoids have vitamin a activity in humans therefore they are classified as essential nutrients many researches show the prevention and treatment properties of carotenoids against several kinds of diseases such as certain chronic_disease cardiovascular_disease as well as certain cancers these promoting properties of carotenoid have attracted intensive interesting in carotenoid_biosynthesis and its commercial exploitation so_far at least carotenoids have been characterized from nature carotenoid biosynthetic_pathways involving in c and c isoprenoids in recent_years dunaliella bardawil has received intensive attention as a natural rich source of carotene owing to its capability to accumulate massive amount of carotene under stress_conditions such as high light density high_salt and nutrient_starvation many studies on accumulation of carotene and phytoene have been conducted to date for large production of carotene the optimal conditions should be high uv a intensity slightly alkaline_ph low nacl_concentration and moderate nano concentration while uv b and other photobleaching compounds could elevate phytoene production instead of carotene nevertheless these investigations were primarily focused on culture_condition optimization at physiologic and biochemical level none of them probed into the molecular_mechanisms for carotenogenic regulation in d bardawil the hypothetic biosynthetic_pathway of carotenoid in dunaliella is disproportional to synthesize various carotenoids such as carotene neoxanthin lutein and so on the most universal carotenoid biosynthetic_pathway is the successional
