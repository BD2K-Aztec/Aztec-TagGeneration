genome_analysis pinbpa cytoscape app for network_analysis of gwas data protein_interaction based pathway analysis pinbpa for genome_wide gwas has been developed as a cytoscape app to enable analysis of gwas data in a network fashion users can easily import gwas summary level data draw manhattan plots define blocks prioritize genes with random_walk with restart detect enriched subnetworks and test the significance of subnetworks via a user_friendly interface genome_wide gwas continue to be a widely used approach to detect genetic_associations with a phenotype of interest in well defined populations as ofpublications have reported associations of single_nucleotide snps with close to phenotypes in the gwas catalog the successful record of this genomic mapping strategy includes the identification of dozens or even hundreds of susceptibility alleles in common diseases such as multiple_sclerosis ms type and type_diabetes lymphomas leukemias and metabolic_disorders despite the unquestionable utility of this method most of the data generated by gwas are neglected because of the heavy emphasis devoted to eliminate false_discoveries type_i typically a stringent threshold p value is applied to minimize type_i thus inevitably increasing the proportion of false_negative type_ii error although this is a necessary tactic to effectively evaluate studies testing up to millions of markers individually a number of methods that analyze groups of markers simultaneously thus potentially increasing statistical_power have recently_emerged these approaches collectively known as pathway analysis aim at identifying functional_relationships among associated signals given that susceptibility to complex human_diseases is likely a result of genes operating as part of functional_modules rather than individual effects pathway analysis methods hold_promise in discovering additional associations from existing gwas data the most recent class of pathway analysis methods is network based and they largely overcome the assumptions of independence and preselection of reference_database that limited its predecessors network based analyses commonly use a scaffold of protein interactions to build connections between gene_products where nodes represent proteins and edges represent physical or functional interactions between pairs of proteins rather than focusing on individual_markers network based analysis methods take into account multiple_loci in the context of molecular_pathways owing to this critical feature these methods can afford to use sub genome_wide statistical_significance and yet increase the power to detect new associations and functional_relationships between genes in complex_traits several network based_methods have been proposed to identify active modules subnetworks in a given network such as dapple dmgwas and nimmi the original protein_interaction based pathway analysis pinbpa method was first developed in the context of ms research and most recently used to successfully_identify novel associations by the international ms genetics_consortium international multiple_sclerosis genetics in this article we introduce the pinbpa app for cytoscape pinbpa is the first cytoscape app designed for network_analysis of gwas data through a user_friendly interface the pinbpa app enables genomic researchers and biologists with no computational expertise to run a powerful and otherwise complex analytical pipeline pinbpa is flexible in many ways first it enables the use of any network as scaffold for subsequent analysis for example a user may choose to run pinbpa using a smaller but high_confidence pin or a larger network including computationally predicted interactions additionally other networks such as metabolic gene co expression or text_mining can be used second while direct import from vegas is available any method can be used to convert snp level and gene level pvalues third the user can select the significance threshold to define association blocks although some experimentation may be needed this significance threshold is typically related to the power of the gwas in question the larger the gwas the more relaxed the p value for block definition fourth significant first order networks can be generated at any user selected statistical threshold fifth an optional network smoothing step allows the user to weight the most significant associations differently finally the size and the significance of enriched networks generated by the greedy_algorithm can also be selected thus providing maximal control over the final output in summary the cytoscape pinbpa app offers a simple interface to perform a complex set of analyses and can be used under a wide_variety of scenarios thus empowering genomic scientists to conduct post gwas analysis in a streamlined rigorous and reproducible fashion
