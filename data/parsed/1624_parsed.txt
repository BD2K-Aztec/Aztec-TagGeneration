estimating beta diversity for under sampled communities using the variably weighted odum dissimilarity index and otushuff motivation in profiling the composition and structure of complex microbial_communities via high_throughput amplicon_sequencing a very low proportion of community_members are typically sampled as a result of this incomplete sampling estimates of dissimilarity between communities are often inflated an issue we term pseudo b diversity results we present a set of tools to identify and correct for the presence of pseudo b diversity in contrasts between microbial_communities the variably weighted odum dissimilarity d wodum allows for down weighting the influence of either abundant or rare taxa in calculating a measure of similarity between two communities we show that down weighting the influence of rare taxa can be used to minimize pseudo b diversity arising from incomplete sampling down weighting the influence of abundant taxa can increase the sensitivity of hypothesis_testing otushuff is an associated test for identifying the presence of pseudo b diversity in pairwise community contrasts availability_and a perl script for calculating the d wodum score from a taxon abundance table and performing pairwise contrasts with otushuff can be obtained atthe size and diversity of microbial_populations pose_challenges to characterizing and contrasting communities for instance sequencebased analyses of bacterial_populations in soil frequently suggest the presence of more than individuals distributed across thousands of distinct taxa per gram of soil although the advent_of sequencing_technologies has increased the depth at which we are able to survey microbial_community in many cases sampling still detects only a fraction of the diversity present at a given site for instance working with rhizosphere soil_samples from a grass host plant_species obtained sequence_reads per sample yet estimated that they were able to detect only of the otus that could have been observed at greater sampling depth taxa that are present at low_abundance may nevertheless be important to understanding community_dynamics for instance have demonstrated from analyses of time series in several different environments that many taxa are only conditionally rare and may be present at dramatically higher abundances at other time points while there is debate over the relative_benefits of increasing sampling depth versus increasing the number of samples analyzed it is becoming increasingly common to trade sample depth for more extensive replication for instance in a recent characterization of the arabidopsis associated microbiome researchers analyzed samples at sequence_reads per sample these developments highlight the need for analytical_approaches that are specifically_designed to account for effects attributable to shallow sampling it should be noted that incomplete sampling will be a more pressing issue for environments that harbor the most diverse microbial_communities such as soil beyond simply creating a census of which bacterial_taxa are present in a given environment researchers frequently desire to compare two or more species assemblages for differences in species_composition and structure a large number of indices are available for such purposes summarized in but many of these were developed in systems for which it is possible to be nearly comprehensive in detecting species that are present in a given location i e plant and animal communities in contrast the majority of species are likely to go undetected in shallow sequence_based surveys of complex microbial_communities indices for describing the resemblance between communities are often based either on species_composition i e presence absence measures or on community_structure i e taking_into the relative_abundance of species within each community both index types are sensitive to incomplete sampling when dealing with complex microbial_communities the inflation of dissimilarity due to incomplete sampling is a concern differential detection of low_abundance taxa may be simply due to insufficient sampling and not to true absence from the community furthermore rare sequence_variants may not always reflect true taxon presence or abundance rather they may be introduced through errors in dna_replication or sequencing thus the ability to adjust the influence of low_abundance taxa on a measure of community resemblance is desirable indices that give less weight to low_abundance community_members exist within the current suite of community resemblance metrics for instance compared different measures of b diversity and concluded that measures with high_dependency on the distribution of abundant taxa were the least sensitive to under sampling e g morisita horn however differences among microbial_communities or microbial_community response to experimental_manipulation may lie in changes in taxon abundance anywhere across the distribution from dominant to rare community_members thus a measure of dissimilarity should ideally be tunable in its sensitivity toward rare or dominant members among non phylogenetic measures of community resemblance the only method that we are aware of that is tunable in sensitivity to rare taxa is the normalized expected species shared method of grassle and smith however this method adjusts the influence of rare taxa by re sampling an observed taxon abundance table at varying depths thus this method relies upon the very problem we are trying to address incomplete sampling and leaves room for improvement a variably weighted version of the phylogenetic distance measure unifrac has been proposed and will be discussed below recent parallel developments in the field of community diversity assessment have come to similar conclusions regarding the utility of calculating diversity indices across a range of sensitivities toward low_abundance community_members a number of statistical_tests are available to assess the significance of differences in microbial_community including unifrac parsimony amova and homova schloss has provided a comparison of these methods and suggests that each carries distinct benefits however the effects of incomplete sampling have not been well explored for statistical_tests that contrast microbial_community here we present a new analytical_method to contrast two samples which indicates the likelihood that the observed samples were drawn from a common community we illustrate the method using simulated_data as well as bacterial sequence_data partial s rrna gene_fragments derived from soil_samples collected across a range of geographic_locations plant_communities and land uses
