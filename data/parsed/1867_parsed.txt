structural_bioinformatics folding rna_dna duplexes motivation while there are numerous programs that can predict rna or dna secondary_structures a program that predicts rna dna hetero dimers is still missing the lack of easy to use tools for predicting their structure may be in part responsible for the small number of reports of biologically_relevant rna dna hetero dimers results we present here an extension to the widely used viennarna package lorenz et_al for the prediction of the structure of rna dna hetero dimers nucleic_acids have many important functions in biological_systems such as information carriers catalysts and regulators both variants dna and rna can form complex structures by base_pair interactions the pattern of watsoncrick or wobble base_pairs a molecule forms is called the secondary_structure a main difference between rna and dna is due to their usage in biological_systems while dna builds a dimer with its reverse complement almost all the time rna being mostly single_stranded is more prone to fold back onto itself however if dna is single_stranded e g during replication transcription repair or recombination it will also form intramolecular base_pairs there are several examples where rna and dna interact via base_pairing generating a structure called r loop they protect cpg cg dinucleotide regions in the genome islands from being methylated the stability of dna mrna hybrids is reported to have an influence on the copy_number of repeats and can impair transcription_elongation promoting transcription associated recombination moreover during the intensive search for new functional transcripts rendered possible by next_generation at least novel lincrnas were identified that may act as regulators of transcription and one possibility to do this is via base_pairing between rna and dna see guttman and rinn for a recent review as a final biological example dna rna hybrids play a role within the crispr pathway in bacteria and archaea on a technical side rna dna dimers are often used in micro array or pcr experiments the ability to computationally investigate the properties of the structures of interacting rna and dna_molecules would help in the analysis of these dimers while a number of programs exist that can predict rna or dna secondary_structures for a review see e g or even their dimers there is to our knowledge no program that also includes the possibility to predict the full secondary_structure of rna dna hetero dimers this may be due to the lack of compiled energy parameters as there are only stacking energies available today we introduce here a possibility to predict the secondary_structure of such hetero dimers within the widely used viennarna package in the absence of programs that can deal with rna dna dimers researchers have resorted to simply treating both parts of the dimer as rna to test the effect of applying the right dna or rna parameters to the single_molecules and using explicit rna dna interactions we chose anril a long_non that is suspected to have a dna target_sequence and one of its putative targets in order to simulate the size of the transcription bubble we chose a sliding_window approach with dna pieces of length step_size for our computations even though anril nt is much longer than the pieces of dna bound to it we sometimes observe a dramatic effect on the structure of the hybrid molecule the tree edit_distance of the hybrid structures predicted with rna parameters and with our hybrid_approach rises up to and the structure of the binding_site can vary_greatly another example for the usefulness of the mixed parameters is the strand dependency of r loop_formation a r gaa n trinucleotid repeat can form r loops while its reverse complement r uuc n cannot the non symmetric mixed parameters can explain that addition of another trinucleotid will give kcal_mol for r gaa but only kcal_mol for r uuc in contrast to rna or dna parameters the mixed parameters can also explain the changes in r loop_formation of other trinucleotides investigated see supplementary
