a trimming and retrieving alignment scheme for reduced_representation currently available bisulfite_sequencing tools frequently suffer from low mapping rates and low methylation calls especially for data generated from the illumina sequencer nextseq here we introduce a sequential trimming and retrieving alignment approach for investigating dna_methylation which significantly_improves the number of mapped_reads and covered cpg_sites the method is implemented in an automated analysis toolkit for processing bisulfite sequencing_reads availability_and the advancement of next_generation offers the opportunity to investigate the epigenetic_modification on genome_wide scale and at single_base reduced_representation rrbs has emerged as a popular tool for profiling dna_methylation at cpg rich regions a major advantage of the rrbs method is its reproducibility over time and sample_types compared with traditional enrichment based_methods rrbs is more applicable to formalin_fixed and paraffinembedded clinical samples due to its low dna input requirement however there are considerable challenges when analyzing the reads from rrbs due to the complexity induced by the bisulfite_conversion highly_specialized analysis_pipelines are neededto target different data types and different platforms all samples sequenced by the illumina nextseq platform an important feature of reads from an rrbs library is that most sequences have gs at the second and third bases consequently low read quality will thus be observed at positions and on nextseq because g bases do not have a dye attached the easiest remedy appears to be trimming the first few lowquality bases from each read to improve the subsequent alignment process the first base of every sequence however is particularly informative in indicating methylation status at one cpg sitewhich should predominantly be a c if it was methylated and a t if not methylated another possible solution is to mask the low quality bases by replacing their reads with ns we tested this solution but did not observe any improvement compared with the mapping based on raw_reads this is understandable because the ambiguity of base calls still exists such issues can be largely alleviated when libraries are sequenced on a hiseq platform the downside is that one would obtain even fewer reads per library per sequencing run although this may be compensated by decreasing multiplexing the number of individual libraries sequenced at the same time the sequencing_costs per library increase accordingly furthermore many smaller laboratories do not have easy access to hiseqs while a desktop nextseq is both cheaper and easier to operate nextseq is also widely used in large sequencing facilities due to its fast turnaround time therefore it is critical to adapt the current rrbs processing pipeline to incorporate this issue
