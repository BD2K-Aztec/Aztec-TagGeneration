data_and ispyb an information management system for synchrotron macromolecular crystallography motivation individual research groups now analyze thousands of samples per year at synchrotron macromolecular crystallography mx resources the efficient management of experimental_data is thus essential if the best possible experiments are to be performed and the best possible data used in downstream_processes in structure_determination pipelines information system for protein_crystallography beamlines ispyb a laboratory_information lims with an underlying data model allowing for the integration of analyses downstream of the data_collection experiment was developed to facilitate such data management results ispyb is now a multisite generic lims for synchrotron_based mx experiments its initial functionality has been enhanced to include improved sample tracking and reporting of experimental_protocols the direct ranking of the diffraction characteristics of individual samples and the archiving of raw_data and results from ancillary experiments and post experiment data_processing protocols this latter feature paves the way for ispyb to play_a in future macromolecular structure solution pipelines and validates the application of the approach used in ispyb to other experimental_techniques such as biological solution small_angle and spectroscopy which have similar sample tracking and data_handling requirements the advances made in bioinformatics protein production purification and crystallization techniques when the era of structural_genomics was at its height led to a greatly_increased demand for the collection of x_ray data at synchrotron_based macromolecular crystallography mx beamlines this coupled to whom correspondence should be addressed with the advent of user_friendly synchrotron beamline control interfaces the increased use of robotic sample changers and the ability to automatically screen and rank the diffraction properties of crystals using software such as dna and web ice ushered in the age of high_throughput crystallography htx the most evident effect of htx is that in the period there was a fold increase in the annual rate of deposition of macromolecular crystal_structures in the protein_data pdb http www pdb org the overwhelming_majority of these depositions are based on diffraction data collected at synchrotron facilities see http biosync sbkb org for details however the increase in pdb depositions tells us only half of the story during the same time period the number of individual samples being analyzed per year at the mx facilities of the european synchrotron_radiation facility esrf rose by more than an order of magnitude currently year at the esrf an increase significantly boosted by the emergence of fragment_based as a tool for drug_discovery in the pharmaceutical_industry see murray and blundell for a review increased automation has also meant that many more samples are being tested for diffraction quality before any full data collections are carried_out given the huge increase in the numbers of samples analyzed and the increased importance of the pre screening of the samples the need for a laboratory_information lims combining sample tracking and experiment reporting during synchrotron_based mx experiments was clear in a prototype lims pxweb was developed and deployed at the esrf the scope of pxweb was rather limited and functionality was confined mainly to basic experiment recording and reporting in particular no exchange of information between pxweb and other lims i e for protein production crystallization x rayispyb was designed to optimize information_transfer between home laboratories and synchrotron_based mx beamlines before during and after experimental_sessions the particular strength of ispyb relates to sample management and the recording of information during an experiment however when properly used the functionality of ispyb should also allow for more successful page of the ispyb web_interface provides a top level summary for each data_collection as well as access to raw_data and results for absorption edge scans top panel and xfe spectra bottom left clicking on the relevant image prefix directs the user to a full reporting of the experimental_protocols used the results of sample evaluations by edna and the results of automatic data_processing bottom right mouse over tool tips are integrated into the html interface in the examples above the tool tip in the data_collection tab shows a summary of the data_collection parameters for a selected experiment while that for the data_processing results gives information concerning both the format and data content of downloadable files containing the reduced data and efficient experimental_sessions the possibility to rank the diffraction characteristics of samples means that in principle full data collections should only be carried_out on the samples best suited to the experiment in hand moreover the accessibility of results and output_files from the automatic on line data_processing protocols means that experimenters can also monitor the success of data_collection experiments in real_time i e while still at the beamline and decide whether or not more data need to be collected for a specific project ispyb is a useful tool for those who operate synchrotronbased mx facilities it allows the generation of statistics on what type of experiments are being carried_out and thus the elucidation of new trends that may drive improvements in beamline functionality a specific example of this is the trend that many more samples are tested for diffraction quality before any full data collections are carried_out this observation has lead to the design of new beamlines and workflows for mx that will be implemented as part of the esrf upgrade page showing a summary of both the experimental_protocol to be used and the results that the execution of the protocol should produce sample ranking in ispyb samples can be selected and ranked either on individual criteria or using a combination of criteria that can be given different weights results can be visualized either as a table top or as a radar chart tool tips provide guides for ease of use program see http www esrf eu usersandscience experiments mx beamline portfolio cdr upbl futureid bm pdf at dls this observation has helped drive the deployment of faster sample changers while ispyb is currently exclusively exploited during mx experiments its data model hierarchy can also be applied to other techniques with analogous workflows examples of such techniques_include small_angle saxs particularly when applied to solutions of biological_macromolecules biosaxs small_molecule x_ray and powder diffraction in each of these cases the development of ispyb like resources for use at synchrotron facilities is under serious consideration
