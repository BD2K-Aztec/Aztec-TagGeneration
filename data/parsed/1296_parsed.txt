deep and wide digging for binding_motifs in chip_seq chip_seq are a new challenge for motif_discovery such a data typically consists of thousands of dna_segments with base specific coverage values we present a new version of our dna motif_discovery software chipmunk adapted for chip_seq chipmunk is an iterative algorithm that combines greedy optimization with bootstrapping and uses coverage profiles as motif positional preferences chipmunk does not require truncation of long dna_segments and it is practical for processing up to tens_of of data sequences comparison with traditional meme or chip_seq oriented hms motif_discovery tools shows that chipmunk identifies the correct motifs with the same or better quality but works dramatically faster chip_seq is an efficient technology for the identification of dna sites of a specific protein binding being coupled with peak finding algorithms it yields a set of dna_segments with each sequence position having a weight reflecting how often dna nearby was cross_linked with the protein of interest during chip stage the so_called peaks there can be tens_of of dna_segment some longer than bp classic tools like weeder gibbs_sampler or meme were tested for motif_discovery in chip_seq segments but proved to be inefficient for the whole amount of data therefore a fraction of top dna_segments was usually taken or and the segments were truncated around the peak maxima tools like cermit and hms have been developed for motif_discovery from chip_seq in this note we present a motif_discovery algorithm that can extract the single optimal motif from large_datasets like chip_seq without any preprocessing while taking_into the peak shape to whom correspondence should be addressed we took three chip_seq nrsf gabp and ews_fli we used findpeaks to obtain enriched regions the peaks segments with strict ggaa type repeats were excluded from the ews_fli dataset motif lengths were fixed at and for nrsf gabp and ews_fli respectively top nrsf gabp and top ews_fli peaks were taken to test several motif_discovery tools including meme sesimcmc and hms the novel chip_seq oriented gibbs_sampler we used sets of segments that were truncated from to of the peak lengths and were centered at the peak maxima the fraction of peaks truncated to of initial length centered at the peak maximum with motif hits having scores greater than the mean sd of score distribution over all w mers was used as the measure of motif quality we assessed the time efficiency of motif_discovery and the resulting quality of motifs identified from ews_fli peaks for short segments covering only of the peaks all the tested tools performed equally well when the segment length was increased meme and sesimcmc that did not take the peak shape into account identified incorrect motifs in contrast chipmunk in peak mode always identified the correct motif in the mode that did not take peak shapes into account chipmunk failed to identify the correct motif in longer segments nevertheless in both modes chipmunk clearly outperformed hms that took into account peak shapes both in speed and quality for nrsf and gabp the correct motifs were extracted by the all tools in a wider_range of sequence_lengths which probably indicates better data_quality see the sts all in all here we presented an extended version of our motif_discovery tool chipmunk that allows using information from strong but also from weaker sites see sts chipmunk is reasonably fast and practically can process datasets of thousands of sequences see the sts even on a personal computer taking_advantage of the modern multi core processors
