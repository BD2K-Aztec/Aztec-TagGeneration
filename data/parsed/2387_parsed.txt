improving disease_gene using the semantic_similarity of gene_ontology motivation many hereditary human_diseases are polygenic resulting from sequence alterations in multiple genes genomic linkage and association studies are commonly performed for identifying disease related genes such studies often yield lists of up to several hundred candidate_genes which have to be prioritized and validated further recent_studies discovered that genes involved in phenotypically similar diseases are often functionally_related on the molecular level results here we introduce medsim a novel approach for ranking candidate_genes for a particular disease based on functional comparisons involving the gene_ontology medsim uses functional_annotations of known disease genes for assessing the similarity of diseases as well as the disease relevance of candidate_genes we benchmarked our approach with genes known to be involved in diseases taken from the omim database using artificial quantitative_trait medsim achieved excellent_performance with an area_under of up to and a sensitivity of over at specificity when classifying gene_products according to their disease relatedness this performance is comparable or even superior to related methods in the field albeit using less and thus more easily_accessible information availability medsim is offered as part of our funsimmat web_service http www funsimmat de
