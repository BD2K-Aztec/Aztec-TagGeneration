reconstructing gene regulatory dynamics from high_dimensional single_cell snapshot data motivation high_dimensional single_cell snapshot data are becoming widespread in the systems_biology community as a mean to understand biological_processes at the cellular_level however as temporal_information is lost with such data mathematical_models have been limited to capture only static features of the underlying cellular_mechanisms results here we present a modular framework which allows to recover the temporal behaviour from single_cell snapshot data and reverse_engineer the dynamics of gene_expression the framework combines a dimensionality_reduction method with a cell time ordering algorithm to generate pseudo time series observations these are in turn used to learn transcriptional ode_models and do model_selection on structural network_features we apply it on synthetic data and then on real hematopoietic_stem data to reconstruct gene_expression dynamics during differentiation_pathways and infer the structure of a key gene_regulatory availability_and c and matlab_code available at https www helmholtz muenchen de fileadmin icb software inferencesnapshot zip unraveling the dynamics of gene regulatory programs is a challenging_problem due to multitude of variables and mechanisms_involved in the gene control machinery as genes represent fundamental units in regulatory_networks the problem is commonly restricted to understand how they interact and express themselves to generate specific_biological this gave rise to a variety of mathematical_methods which combined with experimental_measurements provided a way to reconstruct gene regulatory_processes and estimate unknown kinetic_parameters different classes of approaches have been proposed from ode based models to stochastic models and a number of optimization techniques have been developed for inference and parameter_estimation in gene regulatory models to learn network_dynamics all these models require temporal data_sources such as mrna or protein time courses however as recent_advances in single_cell technologies offer the possibility to analyse gene_expression simultaneously in hundreds of individual cells time course data are not always available for massive single_cell dataset this prevents from using elaborated methods developed in the last decades on data coming from newest technologies such as single_cell or high_throughput quantitative_polymerase typically data from such technologies are given in form of single_cell snapshot data broadly single_cell snapshot data consist of gene_expression collected from multiple single cells at a single time point so defined they represent static data which reflect single_cell states at a single time point however as cells may have different stochastic behaviours during the same process a sort of temporal_information is still retained in snapshot data here we present a framework which allows to extract gene regulatory dynamics directly from single_cell snapshot data the framework allows reconstruction of individual network nodes dynamics estimation of kinetic_parameters and computation of bayes_factors to determine how network nodes functionally interact the combination of dimensionality_reduction with a clustering method and an efficient algorithm to order single cells by time provides a way to reconstruct gene_expression pseudo time courses from different cellular_processes these are used to compare different ode based transcriptional models and select the one which bestas mathematical_modelling is becoming more and more crucial in supporting experimental research in systems_biology computational frameworks need to constantly evolve and adapt to new technologies in this context recent_advances in high_dimensional single_cell technologies are providing massive amount of data in form of single_cell snapshot data although a number of statistical_tools have been developed to model gene_expression in snapshot data they were only able to provide limited insights into biological_mechanisms in particular as snapshot data do not directly represent how concentration of molecular_species changes over time present methods are only able to extract static information from data here we have presented a framework which allows to reconstruct dynamics of gene network nodes from single_cell gene_expression snapshot data by combining a dimensionality_reduction method with an algorithm to time order single cells we are able to reconstruct pseudo time series which provide a good approximation to time series simulated from the real system through an efficient optimization strategy pseudo time series are then used to calibrate nonlinear ode_models which explain complex transcriptional dynamics furthermore by computing bayes_factors we are also able to refine grns structures by selecting among transcriptional models with different structural_information i e different logic_gates in activation functions the framework is modular and requires a number of sequential steps which are independent on each other this has the advantage that each step can be independently improved without reducing the efficiency of the entire workflow many of these steps especially dimensionality_reduction techniques and parameter_estimation methods have already been studied in great detail however to the best of our knowledge similar comprehensive frameworks have not been yet developed our idea represents the first example of quantitative modelling grns dynamics without using protein or gene_expression time courses but only high_dimensional single_cell snapshot data only recently some approaches have been developed to analyse high_dimensional biological data and their underlying dynamics but purely for a visualization purpose or qualitative_analyses analysis on multiple simulated_data demonstrates that we are able to infer kinetic_parameters describing the underlying dynamics and recover logic_gates in activation functions results on single_cell snapshot data obtained during blood stem_cell show that we can reconstruct gene_expression dynamics along differentiation_pathways compared with competing strategies we can not only determine correlations among genes in the grn but also predict edge directions in particular gata was predicted to be inhibited by gfi and to activate gfi b thus possibly working as a modulator of the known toggle switch between gfi and gfi b gene gata has been found to be involved in myeloid leukaemia a better understanding of its role will not only help to get more insights into cell decision_making but also to gain more knowledge about cancer pathologies from the computational point_of our work opens possibilities to several further developments although diffusion maps have been proved to resolve nonlinear differences in single_cell expression data an improvement in the timeordering algorithm would substantially reduce the error in pseudo time series in addition at the statistical modelling level we have considered ode based transcriptional models without taking_into of intrinsic stochasticity of gene_expression single cells provide more information with respect to cell_populations but such information could be retrieved only by using stochastic models of gene_expression on the other hand parameter_estimation and model_selection with stochastic models are challenging and will require more advanced methods compared with those used in this work despite we restricted the analysis to small medium_size grns we believe that our work may evolve to the analysis of larger network and with more complex dynamics e g including feedback_loops a greedy type strategy could be adopted in model_selection to cope with a larger number of dynamical_models however an integration of structure inference and dynamics modelling would remain challenging in the case of larger_networks
