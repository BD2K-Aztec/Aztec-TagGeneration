evpedia a community web_portal for extracellular_vesicles research motivation extracellular_vesicles evs are spherical bilayered proteolipids harboring various bio active_molecules due to the complexity of the vesicular nomenclatures and components online searches for ev related publications and vesicular components are currently challenging results we present an improved version of evpedia a public database for evs research this community web_portal contains a database of publications and vesicular components identification of orthologous vesicular components bioinformatic_tools and a personalized function evpedia includes publications vesicular components from high_throughput datasets and has been accessed more than times from more than cities in addition about members from international_research groups have participated in developing evpedia this free web_based database might serve as a useful resource to stimulate the emerging field of ev research almost all living_organisms on earth shed extracellular_vesicles evs into their microenvironment evs are spherical bilayered proteolipids with an average diameter of nm cells release evs either constitutively or in a regulated manner and these vesicles harbor a specific subset of proteins mrnas mirnas lipids and metabolites reflecting their originating cell_types and conditions evs are also found in various biological_fluids such as amniotic_fluid ascites breast_milk plasma saliva semen serum and urine recent_advances in this fast_growing field have facilitated several insights evs play multifaceted functions in intercellular_communication ev mediated intercellular_communication is an evolutionarily_conserved phenomenon evs are rich sources of biomarkers for non_invasive diagnosis and prognosis of various human_diseases and diverse therapeutic_approaches have been pursued to utilize evs and their mimetics for vaccine chemotherapeutic_drug and sirna_delivery publications on evs have grown rapidly during the last several years indicating that the field of evs is expanding intensively the identification of vesicle specific cargos could help us to unravel the molecular_mechanisms the cargo sorting and biogenesis of evs in addition this will lead to better comprehension of the pathophysiological functions of evs and discovery of evbased potential biomarkers of human_diseases therefore many evpedia a portal for extracellular_vesicles researchinvestigators have focused on categorizing these complex vesicular components by various high_throughput such as mass_spectrometry and lipidomics as well as microarray and next_generation based transcriptomics together with conventional biological approaches these multiomics based analyses of evs derived from various cell_types and body_fluids have identified several thousands of different vesicular components ev secretion and ev mediated intercellular_communication are evolutionarily_conserved researchers in this field have coined dozens of different names for evs especially for more complex eukaryotic_cell derived evs as listed in box extracellular_vesicles diverse nomenclature nevertheless there is progress toward a single nomenclature since the different names in use make it difficult to follow the progress in the field in addition most vesicular components identified by multiomics based high_throughput analyses are presented in the supplementary_information of published_articles taken together online searches for ev related publications and vesicular components are currently challenging especially for start up researchers in this field therefore a comprehensive public repository of ev related publications and vesicular components will help the community of ev research to understand various aspects of these complex extracellular organelles
