gene_expression opossom r package for high_dimensional portraying of genome_wide expression landscapes on bioconductor motivation comprehensive analysis of genome_wide molecular data challenges bioinformatics methodology in terms of intuitive visualization with single sample resolution biomarker selection functional information mining and highly granular stratification of sample classes opossom combines those functionalities making use of a comprehensive analysis and visualization strategy based on self_organizing som machine_learning which we call high_dimensional por traying the method was successfully_applied in a series of studies using mostly transcriptome_data but also data of other omics realms availability_and opossom is now publicly_available as bioconductor r package bioinformatics_tools are needed which allow to statistically functionally and visually summarise high_dimensional such as transcriptome_studies at different levels of resolution ranging from individual samples and genes to sample classes and expression modules of co regulated_genes for this purpose we developed a bioinformatics analysis_pipeline based on self organizing map som machine_learning which facilitates a holistic_view on this data we termed this technique high_dimensional portraying it subsumes the visualization of the data landscape of each individual a series of downstream bioinformatics and statistics analysis options and the detailed and comprehensive reporting of the results we have chosen som machine_learning as backbone because it combines strong clustering dimension_reduction multidimensional_scaling and visualization capabilities which have been shown to be advantageous compared to alternative_methods such as clustering heatmaps and negative matrix_factorization when applied to molecular high_throughput data seeand references_cited therein we complemented the basal som algorithm with a sophisticated data analysis workflow including visualization of the individual feature landscapes statistical_testing for differential features and biomarker selection mining of biological_function and also sample diversity analysis to assess classes of samples opossom continues and largely extends the scope of a previous som based expression analysis tool the gene_expression dynamic inspector gedi opossom is under steady development provides a multitude of sample diversity analyses and most importantly provides comprehensive functional_annotations our portraying method has been developed in first instance for gene_expression data comprising from tens up to thousands of samples e g tumour specimen in patient_cohorts experimental_conditions in cell_line experiments the portraying functionality is unique and suited especially for scientists who attach importance to visual control and intuitive perception of complex data the software was applied in a series of previous_studies aiming at discovering the gene_expression landscapes of healthy human tissues of cancer_subtypes and of stem_cell development further applications addressed the integrative_analysis of mrna and mirna_expression data the proteome of algae whole_genome histone and the genomic_diversity of human ethnicities opossom stores the results in a defined folder structure these results comprise a variety of pdf documents which provide_extensive information about the systems studied for example plots and images of the input_data supplementary descriptions of the som generated and associated metadata the sample diversity landscape and also functional_annotations the pdf reports are complemented by csv spreadsheets which render the complete information accessible detailed_descriptions of the algorithms and visualizations were given in our previous publications html files are generated to provide easy access to the analysis results via an intuitive and descriptive interface a summary html can be found in the results folder created by opossom we recommend new users to browse the results using this interface
