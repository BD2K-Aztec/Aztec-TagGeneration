systems_biology robustness and accuracy of functional_modules in integrated network_analysis motivation high_throughput molecular data provide a wealth of information that can be integrated into network_analysis several approaches exist that identify functional_modules in the context of integrated biological_networks the objective of this study is fold first to assess the accuracy and variability of identified modules and second to develop an algorithm for deriving highly_robust and accurate solutions results in a comparative simulation_study accuracy and robustness of the proposed and established methodologies are validated considering various sources of variation in the data to assess this variation we propose a jackknife resampling procedure resulting in an ensemble of optimal modules a consensus approach summarizes the ensemble into one final module containing maximally robust nodes and edges the resulting consensus module identifies and visualizes robust and variable_regions by assigning support values to nodes and edges finally the proposed approach is exemplified on two large gene_expression studies diffuse_large and acute lymphoblasticmultiple genome_scale datasets nowadays allow to model the cell as an intricate network of molecular_interactions research in systems_biology has changed accordingly now focusing on network_analysis of high_throughput genome transcriptome and proteome data reaching beyond the analysis of mere topological questions integrated network_analysis incorporates additional molecular data into a network for gene_expression data integrated approaches are used to search for pathways functional_modules or gene_signatures containing differentially_expressed in the context of gene_networks or proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks given the integrated gene_expression data the to whom correspondence should be addressed objective is to find the maximal significantly_deregulated i e differentially_expressed set of interconnected genes in the cellular network we refer to the resulting connected subnetwork as a functional module which is also denoted as active or perturbed module please note that this is in contrast to other fields in biology e g proteomics where functional_modules denote protein_complexes various methods have been proposed to identify functional_modules in an integrated_network in this study we focus on the popular approaches proposed by ulitsky and shamir and although these algorithms differ in many important aspects conceptually they all aim at identifying connected subnetworks that contain significantly_deregulated genes introduced the problem and proposed a simulated_annealing approach to identify subnetworks due to the heuristic nature of such sampling approaches the resulting modules are not optimal in general in an alternative approachpropose the algorithm degas dysregulated gene_set via subnetworks based on a greedy approximation to identify subnetworks of dysregulated genes in contrast to the above_mentioned approaches the algorithm ofidentifies optimally scoring subnetworks using an exact algorithm based on integer_linear ilp besides the accuracy of a module identification method the robustness of obtained solutions is of particular importance a natural question is how variable are the provided solutions given the method a highly_variable method_produces largely differing solutions in different runs or on slightly perturbed input_data and is thus less reliable clearly well designed algorithms should ideally show both high_accuracy as well as high robustness here we investigate the accuracy and robustness of the three prominent module detection_algorithms regarding i the integrated gene_expression data and ii the network_structure of the ppi_network itself as a consequence of the investigation we propose a novel method to calculate accurate as well as robust modules in which robust parts are indicated by support values introducing the new concept of consensus modules in phylogeny felsenstein introduced resampling approaches e g bootstrap and jackknife to define a confidence measure for splits in a phylogenetic_tree and to calculate consensus trees similarly resampling procedures can be used to assess the robustness of functional_modules in integrated network_analysis we use the delete half jackknife here we have presented a novel method for the identification of highly_robust and accurate modules we suggest a consensus approach based on jackknifing to calculate a resulting functional module whose inner structure is characterized and highlighted by support values on nodes and edges in an extensive simulation_study we compare our approach to well established heuristic module identification methods in terms of accuracy and robustness particularly we distinguish between different sources of noise that affect the obtained solutions i the variability of the integrated data e g gene_expression data ii the variability of the underlying_network e g ppi_network and iii the intrinsic methodological variability for heuristic module identification methods in general the exact algorithm clearly outperforms the other validated heuristics not only in terms of accuracy but also in terms of robustness in particular the simulation of perturbed networks reveals that the performance of heuristic module detection methods declines faster and more pronounced with increasing level of perturbations in contrast to the exact approach interestingly our simulation_results indicate that even the inclusion of a large number of false_positive edges has only a limited influence on the accuracy of functional module identification whereas the deletion of edges has a much stronger_effect this holds true for all algorithms examined in this study these simulation_results have also implications for the analysis of real ppi data in the context of integrated network_analysis low_confidence interaction networks e g in the string database could perform similarly good or better than high_confidence ppi_networks based on a highquality threshold which may lack a large number of true_positive edges analyses on the pina and hprd network comprising large differences in the number of interactions show that on biological_networks the results are almost identical on the algorithmic side we have extended an existing exact approach in two directions i by the incorporation of edge scores and ii by the calculation of optimal modules of a given size on the biological side we have applied both algorithms the original exact method as well as the new proposed consensus method to two well known microarray_datasets all dlbcl these datasets differ in their signal content which is directly reflected by the support values of the consensus module in the case of a high signal content the results for the original module and the consensus module agree in most parts whereas the most robust central_nodes in the yellow shaded submodule are the genes abl and bcr which are directly_affected by the translocation t these central genes are not present in both modules found by the heuristic methods jactivemodules and matisse see supplementary
