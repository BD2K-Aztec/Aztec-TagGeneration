data_and filtus a desktop gui for fast and efficient detection of disease_causing including a novel autozygosity detector filtus is a stand alone tool for working with annotated variant files e g when searching for variants causing mendelian disease very flexible in terms of input file_formats filtus offers efficient filtering and a range of downstream utilities including statistical_analysis of gene sharing patterns detection of de_novo mutations in trios quality_control plots and autozygosity mapping the autozygosity mapping is based on a hidden_markov and enables accurate detection of autozygous regions directly from exome scale variant files availability_and filtus is written in python and runs on windows mac and linux binaries and source_code are freely_available atrecent years have seen a revolution in mendelian disease_gene thanks to high_throughput hts methods in particular whole_exome wes most of the released software for downstream_analysis is aimed at bioinformatically trained users thus posing a challenge for many medical researchers wanting to do hands on analysis of hts_data to accommodate this we introduce a program filtus offering advanced tools for identifying disease_causing in an easy to use graphical environment several programs for manipulating variant files have been published including varsifter and the web_based eva in addition to efficient browsing and filtering filtus offers several specialized analysis tools aimed at mendelian disease projects these include statistical_evaluation of variant sharing among patients de_novo detection in trios and autozygosity mapping filtus accepts virtually any variant files in contrast to most existing programs which are limited to variant_call vcf or other specific input_formats typical examples of non standard formats are vcf files with additional columns and files produced by annovar although filtus is primarily intended for wes scale data whole_genome data can be analyzed by using the built in prefiltering functionality some countries have strict regulations requiring offline handling of all human sequencing_data thus making it impossible to use webbased tools or to download information during analysis filtus is ideal for such working_conditions requiring no installation being completely self contained and offline in summary the main features of filtus include
