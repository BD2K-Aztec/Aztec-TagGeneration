trajectory oriented bayesian experiment_design versus fisher a optimal_design an in depth comparison study motivation experiment_design strategies for biomedical models with the purpose of parameter_estimation or model discrimination are in the focus_of experimental limitations such as sparse and noisy_data result in unidentifiable parameters and render related design tasks challenging problems often the temporal_resolution of data is a limiting_factor and the amount of possible experimental interventions is finite to address_this we propose a bayesian experiment_design algorithm to minimize the prediction uncertainty for a given set of experiments and compare it to traditional a optimal_design results in an in depth numerical study involving an ordinary_differential of the trans_golgi with partly non identifiable parameters we minimized the prediction uncertainty efficiently for predefined scenarios the introduced method results in twice the prediction precision as the same amount of a optimal designed experiments while introducing a useful stopping criterion the simulation intensity of the algorithms major design step is thereby reasonably affordable besides smaller variances in the predicted trajectories compared with fisher design we could also achieve smaller parameter posterior_distribution entropies rendering this method superior to a optimal fisher design also in the parameter_space availability necessary software toolbox information are available in the supplementary_material the project script including example data can be downloaded fromregulation models are preferably used to describe intra_and cellular_interactions of biomolecules the biomodel database of the european_bioinformatics comprises over published and curated models in its repository most of them being ordinary_differential ode_models the usefulness of a biomedical ode model is often assessed through its capability to predict possible scenarios of interest in order to calibrate a biological ode model expensive_and experiments are performed to gain the needed experimental training data despite continuously improving measurement_methods the data for most models remain scarce resulting in practically nonidentifiable parameters to support the to whom correspondence should be addressed learning_process several experiment_design methods have been successfully developed including classical fisher_information fim design bayesian_methods and optimization based_methods claiming that ode model_predictions improve when reducing parameter_uncertainty intervals these methods design optimal experiments for parameter_estimation oed pe however models can be used to make precise predictions despite sloppy parameters with large confidence_intervals this is rendering oed pe an indirect method to improve predictions methods have been developed to directly address experiment_design for better model_predictions which we here refer to as oed mp in this work we also propose to go this direct way by predefining sets of experimentally feasible prediction scenarios of interest we use a bayesian posterior inference_method and predict experimentally feasible scenarios to purposively reduce uncertainty in the model trajectories in addition we define a reasonable stopping criterion to avoid further experimentation when the desired predictions meet a certain precision compared with the expected data_quality the method is successfully_applied to reduce prediction uncertainty of an ode model of secretory_pathway control at the trans_golgi in an intense comparison study we were able to outperform aoptimal designed experiments in both prediction uncertainty and posterior_distribution entropy with affordable computational effort
