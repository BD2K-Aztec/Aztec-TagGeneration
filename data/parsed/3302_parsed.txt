nthash recursive nucleotide hashing motivation hashing has been widely used for indexing querying and rapid similarity_search in many bioinformatics applications including sequence_alignment genome and transcriptome_assembly k_mer and error_correction hence expediting hashing operations would have a substantial impact in the field making bioinformatics applications faster and more efficient results we present nthash a hashing algorithm tuned for processing dna rna_sequences it performs the best when calculating hash values for adjacent k_mers in an input_sequence operating an order of magnitude faster than the best performing alternatives in typical use cases availability_and nthash is available online at http www bcgsc ca platform bio info software nthash and is free for academic use hashing is a common function across many informatics applications and refers to mapping an input key value of arbitrary size to an allocated memory of predetermined size among other uses it is an enabling concept for rapid search operations and forms the backbone of internet search_engines in bioinformatics it has many applications including sequence_alignment genome and transcriptome_assembly rna_seq expression quantification k_mer and error_correction large_scale sequence_analysis often relies on cataloguing or counting consecutive k_mers in dna rna_sequences for indexing querying and similarity searching an efficient way of implementing such operations is through the use of hash based data_structures such as hash tables or bloom filters therefore improving the performance of hashing algorithms would have a great impact in a wide_range of bioinformatics_tools here we present nthash a fast function for recursively computing hash values for consecutive k_mers
