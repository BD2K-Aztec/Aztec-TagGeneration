gene_expression cosine condition specific sub network identification using a global optimization method motivation the identification of condition specific sub networks from gene_expression has important biological_applications ranging from the selection of disease related_biomarkers to the discovery of pathway alterations across different phenotypes although many methods exist for extracting these sub networks very few existing_approaches simultaneously consider both the differential_expression of individual genes and the differential correlation of gene_pairs losing potentially valuable information in the data results in this article we propose a new method cosine condition specific sub network which employs a scoring_function that jointly measures the condition specific changes of both nodes individual genes and edges genegene co expression it uses the genetic_algorithm to search for the single optimal sub network which maximizes the scoring_function we applied cosine to both simulated_datasets with various differential expression_patterns and three real_datasets one prostate_cancer dataset a second one from the across tissue comparison of morbidly_obese patients and the other from the across population comparison of the hapmap samples compared with previous methods cosine is more powerful in identifying truly significant sub networks of appropriate size and meaningful biological_relevance availability the r code is available as the cosine package on cran http cran r project org_web cosine index html various statistical_methods exist for comparative_analysis of two or more sets of microarray_data based on how prior_knowledge is utilized these methods can be generally classified into four categories a similar classification_scheme was presented in i single gene based differential_expression these methods start by quantifying the level of differential to whom correspondence should be addressed expression of individual genes using various statistics for a comprehensive_review see genes with significant p values are then checked for enrichment in predefined biological_processes or pathways using annotation tools such as david this approach is simple and intuitive however the choice of a significance_level for the p values can be arbitrary and this approach ignores the dependency between genes ii gene_set based differential analysis among which the gene_set is a well known example for a good review and method comparison see this class of approaches has the advantage of clear biological_interpretation however it relies on the prior_knowledge of gene_sets genes in the same pathway or related to the same disease which is still far from being complete and accurate moreover under many circumstances only a subset of genes in a pathway exhibit expression alterations and testing on the whole set may give rise to false_negatives iii topology based gene_co analysis horvath and colleagues developed the weighted gene_co analysis wgcna which is a clustering method taking_into topological_similarity between genes however for high_dimensional e g genes clustering_methods may lead to very large modules making interpretation based on gene_ontology go annotation less informative iv responsive sub network identification using graph search_methods here the goal is to identify a subset of genes showing condition specific changes this class of methods has two main components a scoring_function quantifying the alternation of a given sub network between different conditions and a search algorithm to extract the highest scoring sub networks the seminal work ofused sum of z_score which is the standard normal inverse of a single genes p value adjusted for the size of the sub network as the scoring_function and employed simulated_annealing to search for the best sub networks used an edge based scoring_function rather than node score to account for genegene correlation due to the non deterministic polynomial time hard np_hard nature of the problem of finding the maximal scoring connected subgraph it can only be approached by heuristic or approximate_methods apart from simulated_annealing previous_studies have also employed local greedy search algorithms page the advantages of cosine include i the scoring_function is a weighted combination of both the node score and the edge score in this way cosine takes_into not only the alteration in the expression_level of individual genes but also the variation of genegene correlation which is the building_block of other higher_order topological metrics so that it can better reflect thefold enrichment is calculated as follows number of genes recovered size of selected sub network integrative changes of a sub network ii cosine uses the genetic_algorithm which is efficient for global optimization involving binary variables for practical use we recommend using the default parameter setting in the cosine package iii cosine can be easily applied to gene_prioritization within the extracted subnetwork iv cosine naturally eases the issue of scoring over more than two conditions since both the f statistic and the ecf statistic are defined for multiple groups in contrast previous methods use either p value or signal_to to measure the differential_gene which requires_additional transformation when scoring over multiple conditions and thus may lead to misinterpretation of the original information v distinct from various clustering_methods the goal of cosine is not to assign each gene to a specific module it aims at extracting the most variable sub networks which are of real_biological interest vi cosine uses a simple empirical procedure to select weight parameter making it adaptive to the specific datasets being analyzed an issue of note is the effect of gene positions in the binary vector on the genetic_algorithm it has been reported that the ordering of genes on the chromosome can affect the convergence of the genetic_algorithm in future_studies we would like to compare genetic_algorithm with other global optimization algorithms to perform more efficient sub graph search we also note that appropriate scoring_function is essential for sub network identification apart from our proposed procedure to select there have been numerous studies in the field of network_alignment as well as structural_alignment in biophysics on parameter_optimization for an objective_function therefore it would be interesting to test other more sophisticated parameter learning algorithms in cosine last but not the least cosine can be easily applied to other types of networks such as ppi_network and gene_regulatory to search for altered gene interaction_patterns in casecontrol groups in this article we have proposed a new method cosine to identify condition specific sub network across two or more gene_expression different from previous methods cosine coordinately considers single genes expression variation and genepairs differential correlation in order to extract a globally optimal sub network which can maximize the across group difference we have shown using both simulated_and that cosine can successfully_identify biologically_meaningful sub networks that exhibit significant alterations across a set of phenotypes
