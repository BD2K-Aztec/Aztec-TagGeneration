performance assessment of copy_number microarray_platforms using a spike in experiment motivation changes in the copy_number of chromosomal dna_segments copy_number cnvs have been implicated in human variation heritable diseases and cancers microarray_based platforms are the current established technology of choice for studies_reporting these discoveries and constitute the benchmark against which emergent sequence based_approaches will be evaluated research that depends on cnv analysis is rapidly increasing and systematic platform assessments that distinguish strengths_and are needed to guide informed choice results we evaluated the sensitivity_and of six platforms provided by four leading vendors using a spike in experiment nimblegen and agilent platforms outperformed illumina and affymetrix in accuracy and precision of copy_number dosage estimates however illumina and affymetrix algorithms that leverage single_nucleotide snp information make up for this disadvantage and perform well at variant detection overall the nimblegen m platform outperformed others but only with the use of an alternative data analysis_pipeline to the one offered by the manufacturer copy_number variant cnv loci are a major source of variation observed among human_genomes hurles to whom correspondence should be addressed while some cnvs have no known functional_consequence some are associated with inherited microdeletion or microduplication syndromes high_density microarrays permit the measurement of dna copy_number across the genome with broad coverage of all chromosomes and high_resolution approaches based on high_throughput have been tried and are very promising however at this time genome sequence_based detection of cnvs is not yet a competitive strategy in terms of costs availability of established analysis tools for general use and wealth of published performance appraisal from experience the several microarray_based platforms for cnv_detection that have been developed are currently subject to active price and performance competition research and clinical_laboratories are seeking to determine the technology platform s that perform best for detection of cnvs accurately and precisely reporting their length their copy_number and other features such as homozygosity here we provide an assessment of the major vendors in the current marketplace based on direct comparison of the performance of samples containing intentional copy_number these are evaluated using company recommended software_tools as well as independent methods cnvs spanning one megabase mb are detectable by cytogenetic techniques such as spectral_karyotyping and fluorescence_in however the level of resolution attained by these methods does not permit detection of copy_number change in smaller segments microarray comparative_genomic array_cgh was the first technique developed to achieve a higher_resolution in this technology dna from a test sample and a reference_sample are labeled using different fluorophores cy and cy and hybridized to probes printed on a glass_slide the log_ratio of the fluorescence_intensity of the test to that of the reference dna is calculated and used as a measure of b for illumina m duo the bac spike in is not detected by the sum of snp intensities c however the baf for illumina m duo shows a pattern of values distributed away from heterozygosity reflecting the presence of the spike in relative dosage however the level of random variation in these log ratios does not permit copy_number calls at the individual feature level therefore analysts use smoothing a statistical_procedure that averages neighboring measurements to improve precision with smoothing techniques precision and therefore specificity can be improved by increasing the size of the averaging window but at a cost of averaging over and therefore missing smaller cnvs competing statistical_techniques provide different solutions to this sensitivityspecificity tradeoff examples are hidden_markov and segmentation_algorithms such as circular_binary cbs note that specificity can be improved without detrimentally affecting sensitivity by increasing the resolution of the array because the number of averaged points increases when keeping the neighborhood sizes the same averaging window sizes recently agilent and nimblegen have developed high_resolution microarrays with roughly million or million features respectively in which the oligonucleotide features are chosen to represent a tiling path through the human_genome in parallel development genotyping_arrays from illumina and affymetrix originally designed for genome_wide genotyping of snps were adapted to provide cnv_calls providing both polymorphic and non polymorphic elements the most recent platforms contain features for million snps and translate to a resolution of one feature per bps for each snp these platforms provide an intensity based measurement for each allele denoted generally as a and b while the ratio of these intensities a b is used for genotyping the sum a b provides a quantitative measure of copy_number dosage if a reference_sample is available then we can form a ratio as in array_cgh and use the same smoothing techniques the affymetrix platform includes snp probes as well as nonpolymorphic probes used strictly for cnv_detection to roughly double the resolution in their latest product the affymetrix m array includes many more cnv features compared to snp features algorithms developed by illumina and affymetrix make clever use of the bi_allelic information from snp probes to detect copy_number change for example illumina defines the b allele_frequency baf as the estimated number of b alleles divided by the sum of both alleles at a given snp location this estimate is based upon interpolation from plotted canonical clusters of the aa ab and bb genotypes at a given snp with the x axis representing b to a allelic intensity ratios and the y axis representing b a intensity sums the expectation when copy_number dosage is is to see three clouds of points when plotting baf across the genome one cloud for each genotype aa ab and bb cnvs can be detected by looking for regions with an unexpected number of clusters in the baf measure even in cases where the dosage measure does not show strong_signal shows intensity a b shows baf in this work we compare performance on the six platforms listed in this set consists of one snp_genotyping three arraycgh and two hybrid array platforms i e platforms in which a substantial number of probes are non polymorphic to guide the comparison we developed a spike in experiment in which known genomic fragments were added in varying quantities to diploid lymphoblastoid genomic_dna from two individuals with known large_deletions real_time qpcr was used to estimate the concentration of bacterial artificial clones bacs containing between and kb of human_genomic four spike in cocktails were prepared according to a modified latin square design actual relative representation of bac insert in each cocktail was determined as read number per base in singleend sequence output from a solexa genome_analyzer the four spike in reagents were added to lymphoblastoid genomic_dna and each dna_sample was hybridized in replicate to each of the six platforms methods in supplementary_material sample labeling hybridization and scanning were performed at publicly_accessible laboratory service sites with recognized expertise and all protocols conformed to company specified recommendations data were analyzed in two modes one based on company recommended software for detection of cnv_calls and one independent of company recommended software to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of cnv and dosage measurements we also evaluated the fidelity of the start and end estimates of cnv regions detected in each platform we have performed a thorough comparison of six cnv_detection platforms agilent m nimblegen m nimblegen x k illumina m duo affymetrix and affymetrix m we used a carefully_designed spike in experiment to facilitate the data analysis we found that removal of strong wave artifacts greatly_improved analysis in particular for agilent m nimblegen m and affymetrix m arrays precision from replicates was similar across all platforms greater probe density does result in higher breakpoint resolution among platforms tested here even though diverse technologies are used for sample labeling and signal_detection our analysis demonstrated that when using companyrecommended software the illumina m duo and affymetrix platforms performed well at detecting cnvs while not performing well in dosage sensitivity this presented an apparent_paradox it is explained by the use of the baf measure which is quite sensitive to copy_number changes in cases where the dosage related measures perform poorly e g we found various examples where dosage measures do not detect_cnvs but baf measures do supplementaryincludes four examples however the use of snp allele_frequency to detect copy_number introduces two obstacles to cnv analysis first the accuracy of dosage estimates is below that of the cgh arrays from nimblegen and agilent secondly the density of naturally_occurring snps limits genotyping array density this in turn hinders the detection ability of illumina m duo and affymetrix for small cnvs less than kb which arrays of high_density and nimblegen m in particular are able to detect after consideration of dosage sensitivity precision specificity sensitivity and cnv border definition the nimblegen m platform demonstrated the best overall performance however careful removal of the wave artifact is a necessity for researchers who depend on current company recommended analysis algorithms the illumina m duo platform performed best as it is able to detect_cnvs with high_sensitivity if they are kb however in addition to its insensitivity to small cnvs this platform underperforms at estimation of dosage and cnv start end location we expect new high_throughput cnv_detection platforms to emerge and new technologies such as analysis of second generation sequence_data to become practical in the near future our study_design and statistical_analysis strategies are not specific to the platforms addressed here and this approach can be readily applied to incorporate comparisons of newer_technologies as they enter the research and clinical marketplace technical assessments comparing extant and emergent methods can support informed platform choice for a given research or clinical purpose provide context for crossplatform results comparison where needed and sharpen focus on the relative technical_limitations and strengths that drive improvements in competing technologies
