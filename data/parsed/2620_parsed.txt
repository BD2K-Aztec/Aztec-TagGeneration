joint stage recognition and anatomical annotation of drosophila gene_expression motivation staining the mrna of a gene via in situ_hybridization ish during the development of a drosophila_melanogaster embryo delivers the detailed spatio temporal_patterns of the gene_expression many related biological_problems such as the detection of co expressed genes co regulated_genes and transcription_factor rely heavily on the analysis of these image patterns to provide the text_based pattern searching for facilitating related biological studies the images in the berkeley drosophila genome_project bdgp study are annotated with developmental_stage term and anatomical ontology_terms manually by domain_experts due to the rapid increase in the number of such images and the inevitable bias annotations by human curators it is necessary to develop an automatic method to recognize the developmental_stage and annotate anatomical terms results in this article we propose a novel computational_model for jointly stage_classification and anatomical terms annotation of drosophila gene_expression we propose a novel tri relational graph tg model that comprises the data graph anatomical term graph developmental_stage term graph and connect them by two additional graphs induced from stage or annotation label assignments upon the tg model we introduce a preferential random_walk prw method to jointly recognize developmental_stage and annotate anatomical terms by utilizing the interrelations between two tasks the experimental_results on two refined bdgp datasets demonstrate that our joint learning method can achieve superior prediction results on both tasks than the state of the art methods the mrna in situ_hybridization ish provides an effective way to visualize gene_expression the ish technique can precisely document the localization of gene_expression at the cellular_level via visualizing the probe by colorimetric or fluorescent_microscopy to allow the production of high_quality images recording the spatial_location and intensity of the gene_expression such spatial and temporal characterizations of expressions paved the way for inferring regulatory_networks based on spatio temporal_dynamics the raw_data produced from such experiments includes digital_images of the drosophila embryo examples are visualized in showing a particular gene_expression pattern revealed by a gene specific probe to whom correspondence should be addressed the_fruit is one of the most used model_organisms in developmental_biology traditionally such ish images are analyzed directly by the inspection of microscope images and available from well known databases such as the berkeley drosophila genome_project bdgp gene_expression pattern database and fly fish l to facilitate spatio_temporal drosophila gene_expression pattern studies researchers needed to solve two challenging tasks first drosophila gene_expression pattern stage recognition temporal descriptions and anatomical annotation spatial descriptions as shown in drosophila embryogenesis has been subdivided into embryonic stages these stages are defined by prominent features that are distinguishable in living drosophila_embryos to recognize the stages of the drosophila embryos provide their time course patterns on the other hand the drosophila gene_expression are often recorded by controlled_vocabularies from the biologists perspective such anatomical ontology_terms describe the spatial biological patterns and often cross stages what is more because the ish images are attached to each other collectively becoming bags of images the corresponding stage label as well as anatomical controlled terms are the descriptions of the whole group of images instead of each individual image inside the bag a drosophila embryo ish image bag belongs to only one stage but has multiple related anatomical terms previously those two tasks are tackled by domain_experts however due to the rapid increase in the number of such images and the inevitable bias annotation by human curators it is necessary to develop an automatic method to classify the developmental_stage and annotate anatomical_structure using controlled_vocabulary recently a lot of research_works have been proposed to solve the above two problems they considered the stage recognition as a single label multi class classification_problem while the anatomical annotation was treated as a multi_label multi class classification_problem first developed an embryo enclosing algorithm to find the embryo outline and extract the binary expression_patterns via adaptive thresholding and developed new ways to represent ish images based on gaussian_mixture principal_component and wavelet functions besides that they utilized min redundancy max relevance to do the feature_selection and automatically classify gene_expression pattern developmental_stages recently constructed a system called spex and concluded that the local regression lr method taking_advantage of the controlled termterm interactions can get the best enhanced anatomical controlled term annotation results the lr method was proposed by ji et_al and developed based on their previous worksin this article we proposed a novel tg model to learn the task interrelations between stage recognition and anatomical terms annotation of drosophila gene_expression the standard bag of word features and three major views lateral dorsal and ventral were used to describe the d drosophila images a new prw method was introduced to simultaneously propagate the stage labels and anatomical controlled terms via tg model both stage_classification and anatomical controlled term annotation tasks are jointly completed we evaluated the proposed method using one refined bdgp dataset the experimental_results demonstrated in the real application when the number of training data is scarce our joint learning method can achieve superior prediction results on both tasks than the state of the art methods what is more we can discovery more accurate asymmetric termterm correlation which can potentially improve the results of both tasks even more in order to see the asymmetric entries more clearly we plotafter prw the entries marked as brighter square have higher conditional_probability positive correlation than its counterpart which is marked as darker color this asymmetric reflects more accurate termterm correlation than the original symmetric assumption
