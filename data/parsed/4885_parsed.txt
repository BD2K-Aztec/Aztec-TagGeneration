waggawagga comparative visualization of coiled_coil predictions and detection of stable single a helices sah domains waggawagga is a web_based for the comparative visualization of coiled_coil predictions and the detection of stable single a helices sah domains overview schemes show the predicted coiled_coil regions found in the query_sequence and provide sliders which can be used to select segments for detailed helical wheel and helical net views a window based score has been developed to predict sah domains export to several bitmap and vector_graphics formats is supported availability_and http waggawagga coiled_coils are a helical structural_domains common to all domains of life and present in of the proteins of a proteome the classical coiled_coils comprise dimerising long a helices that wind around each other forming superhelices as found in structural proteins such as a keratins muscle myosins and tropomyosin kmts in the last years this view has shifted to defining coiled_coil segments based on the presence of knobs into holes packing of side_chains between a helices resulting in many different architectures and topologies the basis for a coiled_coil is an amino_acid heptad abcdefg in which the a and d positions are occupied by hydrophobic_residues coiled_coils were among the first structural_domains to be predicted by algorithms in this method a query_sequence is compared with a database of known coiled_coil sequences which were the kmts available at that time subsequently a similarity_score is computed and a probability to form a coiled_coil calculated in principle this is an implementation of the basic ideas already presented nine years before that residues show an asymmetric distribution within the heptad repeats and that this statistical data can be used to predict coiled_coils in other proteins this position_specific pssm approach has been improved both on the database site and on the feature site trying to disfavor the assignment of high coiled_coil probabilities to hydrophilic sequences another approach to predict coiled_coils is based on the pairwise residue probabilities as implemented in paircoil and paircoil here pairwise frequencies of heptad residues are calculated from known coiled_coil sequences and the probability of a pair of amino_acids in a given sequence for a certain combination in the heptad is scored with this approach better predictions for long coiled_coil regions could be obtained compared to pssm predictions improvement of the prediction of short coiled_coils has been reached by using a hidden_markov as in marcoil and recently markov_random as used in multicoil these general coiled_coil prediction_approaches have been extended by software to predict different oligomerization states as scorer procoil and logicoil however all these approaches provide different results and fail to distinguish between coiled_coils and stable single a helices sah domains a special_case of sah waggawagga is designed to provide a direct schematic comparison of many coiled_coil prediction_tools users can inspect the predictions in classical helical wheel and helical net representations visualization of the coiled_coil predictions in helical wheel schemes provides the possibility to fast and easily_identify potential hydrophobic seams in a and d and oppositely charged_residues in e and g positions respectively in contrast sah domains have patterns of highly charged_residues only occasionally interrupted by hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino_acids therefore charged_residues are highly_enriched in the a and d positions the hydrogen_bonded and charged interaction_network in sah domains is best seen in helical net representations showing the potential interactions along the helix waggawagga provides layouts that can easily be used in presentations and manuscripts
