synchronized navigation and comparative_analyses across ensembl complete bacterial_genomes with insyght motivation high_throughput technologies_provide access to an increasing number of bacterial_genomes today many analyses involve the comparison of biological_properties among many strains of a given species or among species of a particular genus tools that can help the microbiologist with these tasks become increasingly important faced with an ever increasing number of sequenced_genomes biologists need efficient and user_friendly tools to assist them in their analyses in this context tools that facilitate comparative_genomics analyses i e conservation of gene neighborhood presence absence of orthologous_genes phylogenetic profiling etc of large_amounts of data are needed we have recently_developed insyght a comparative_genomic visualization_tool that tightly integrates three complementary views i a table for browsing among homologs ii a comparator of orthologs functional_annotations and iii a genomic_organization view that improve the legibility of genomic_rearrangements and distinctive loci insyght benefits from an easy and smooth navigation between these three views and provides users with a powerful search mechanism in we focused mainly on insyght visualization capabilities and functionalities but the underlying database contained at that time only complete bacterial_genomes here we have processed the complete bacterial_genomes available in ensembl bacteria when we started this work june to provide a more comprehensive coverage of the microbial_diversity we have also developed a virtual_machine that allows users to easily set up their own local insyght server to analyze their genomic_data privately in this note we report the successful integration and availability of a non trivial amount of complete_genomes in insyght nevertheless it will be increasingly difficult for us to process the huge number of newly_sequenced in particular with the advent of rd generation sequencing_technologies that are capable of providing completely assembled_genomes to tackle this issue we provide a customizable version of insyght via the virtual_machine described above that will allow the user to import part of our public database and to add a set of private genomes either complete or in draft in practice we plan to restrict the public dataset to a single best representative for each group of closely_related genomes and to allow users to extract only species in a particular taxonomic node of course limiting this possibility to manageable amounts of transferred data
