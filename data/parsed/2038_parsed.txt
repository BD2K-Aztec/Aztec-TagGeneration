genome_analysis genoplotr comparative gene and genome visualization in r the amount of gene and genome data obtained by next_generation generates a need for comparative visualization_tools complementing existing software for comparison and exploration of genomics data genoplotr automatically creates publication grade linear maps of gene and genomes in a highly automatic flexible and reproducible way availability genoplotr is a platform independent r package available with full source_code under a gpl license at r forge http genoplotr r forge r project org contact comparison of genes and genomes has increasingly been used to infer patterns and processes in evolution and to relate phenotypic_differences to genomic changes with the recent advent of modern high_throughput the need for methods and visualization_tools in comparative_genomics has vastly increased as of more than bacterial and archaeal genomes are available in public_databases making the number of possible comparisons almost infinite several programs such as the artemis comparison tool act ucsc_genome mauve mgcat and murasaki have extensive visualization functions however these tools lack the ability i to directly add annotations to the publication quality graphics they produce or ii to fully automate the production of comparative figures genomegraphs is a r package which allows the visualization of one genomic_region with related datasets such as microarray_data it can display several annotations for the same region but it cannot show several regions in a single plot the r package genoplotr is an attempt to fill in those gaps by providing a flexible automatable tool it allows the user to graphically represent the comparison between several segments or subsegments of genomes in a linear fashion it reads data stored in commonly used formats embl genbank blast and mauve outputs or in user created tabular files and allows comparisons of one or several subsegments of a genome a tree can be added to show the phylogenetic_relationships between the segments as can also scales and annotations to each subsegment the use of r r development and its grid package enables the use of its graphical power and flexibility to manipulate data and to
