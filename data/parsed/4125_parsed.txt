systems_biology sbml pet mpi a parallel parameter_estimation tool for systems_biology based models parameter_estimation is crucial for the modeling and dynamic analysis of biological_systems however implementing parameter_estimation is time consuming and computationally_demanding here we introduced a parallel parameter_estimation tool for systems_biology sbml based models sbml pet mpi sbml pet mpi allows the user to perform parameter_estimation and parameter_uncertainty analysis by collectively fitting multiple experimental_datasets the tool is developed and parallelized using the message_passing mpi protocol which provides good scalability with the number of processors availability sbml pet mpi is freely_available use atmathematical models paired with experimental analysis have been widely used for the studies on cellular_signaling gene_regulatory and metabolic_networks in order to perform simulation and kinetic analysis of the models one must know the parameter_values for the modeled biological system however some parameter_values cannot be experimentally_measured in practice and their values are unknown therefore parameter_estimation is a common issue and very important for the mathematical_modeling of biological_systems to address the parameter_estimation problem we previously_developed a parameter_estimation tool called systems_biology sbml pet to automatically estimate the unknown_parameters of sbml based models by fitting a variety of experimental_datasets the availability of many parameter_estimation tools has facilitated the development of models in systems_biology community however implementing parameter_estimation is still time consuming and computationally_demanding a parallel implementation of a global optimization_algorithm was developed by but it did not address the issue of parameter_estimation for sbml models a fast and convenient parameter_estimation tool is yet to be developed here we introduce a new parallel parameter_estimation tool for sbml based models which is named as sbml pet mpi this tool allows the user to perform parameter_estimation and parameter_uncertainty analysis by collectively fitting multiple experimental_datasets sbml pet mpi is parallelized using the message_passing mpi protocol it is fast and efficient as it provides a good speed up scalability for parameter_estimation and analysis depending on the number of processors and the complexity of the model
