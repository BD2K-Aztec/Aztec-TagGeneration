systems_biology functional module identification in protein_interaction by interaction_patterns motivation identifying functional_modules in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks may shed light on cellular functional_organization and thereafter underlying cellular_mechanisms many existing module identification algorithms aim to detect densely_connected groups of proteins as potential modules however based on this simple topo logical criterion of higher than expected connectivity those algorithms may miss biologically_meaningful modules of functional significance in which proteins have similar interaction_patterns to other proteins in networks but may not be densely_connected to each other a few blockmodel module identification algorithms have been proposed to address the problem but the lack of global optimum guarantee and the prohibitive computational_complexity have been the bottleneck of their applications in real_world large_scale ppi_networks results in this article we propose a novel optimization formulation lcp low two hop conductance sets using the concept of markov random_walk on graphs which enables simultaneous identification of both dense and sparse modules based on protein interaction_patterns in given networks through searching for lcp by random_walk a spectral approximate algorithm slcp is derived to identify non overlapping functional_modules based on a bottom up greedy strategy we further extend lcp to a new algorithm greedy_algorithm for lcp glcp to identify overlapping functional_modules we compare slcp and glcp with a range of state of the art algorithms on synthetic networks and real_world ppi_networks the performance evaluation based on several criteria with respect to protein complex prediction high_level gene_ontology term prediction and especially sparse module detection has demonstrated that our algorithms based on searching for lcp outperform all other compared algorithms availability_and all data and code are available atadvances in high_throughput profiling techniques have enabled researchers to produce large_scale proteinprotein_interaction ppi datasets systematic analysis of these large_scale interactomic datasets based on their graph representations in which nodes stand for proteins in species of interest and edges represent interactions between proteins has the potential to yield a better understanding of protein functions computationally one way to chart out the underlying_cellular functional_organization is to identify functional_modules in these networks by grouping the proteins_sharing similar biological_functions into the same modules intuitively based on interactomic data if two proteins interact with each other they are more likely to share the same cellular functionalities than proteins that do not interact thus densely_connected groups or subnetworks of proteins in a given network can be viewed as potential functional_modules based on this idea many modularity based_algorithms have been successfully_applied to identify functional_modules in ppi_networks by detecting higher than expected connectivity subnetworks several algorithms based on markov random_walk on graphs also have been proposed recently for example markov_clustering mcl algorithm is one of such module identification algorithms for biological network_analysis by iteratively implementing expand and inflation operations on the transition_matrix of the underlying markov_chain of random_walk on the given network van regularized mcl rmcl further extends the original mcl algorithm to penalize the large module size at each iteration to obtain more balanced modules with a similar number of nodes within them other formulations based on markov random_walk including finding low conductance lc sets also can be applied in module identification which is similar to normalized cut problems in graph partitioning to minimize the normalized cut size across modules recently several overlapping module identification methods have been developed to detect densely_connected modules that may overlap with each other in networks for example cluster one clusterone can be viewed as the overlapping version of normalized cut link community linkcomm formulates the overlapping module identification in an innovative framework to implement the hierarchical_clustering on edge graph representations which reveals hierarchical and overlapping organization of networks in addition to densely_connected modules in ppi_networks such as protein_complexes there are other topological structures to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com in ppi_networks that may possess important cellular functionalities again based on interactomic data the proteins that interact with similar sets of other proteins in a given network also intuitively have a higher probability of sharing the similar functionalities compared with the proteins that do not share any interacting_partners or neighbors these proteins may not directly interact with each other but they still work toward similar cellular functionalities and hence should belong to the same modules take transmembrane_proteins for example it is well known that transmembrane_proteins such as receptors in signal_transduction tend to interact with cytoplasmic proteins as well as with extracellular ligands but rarely interact with themselves to identify such types of functional_modules many state of the art blockmodel module identification algorithms have been proposed recently for example power graph pg greedily collects topologically similar nodes into the same module based on jaccard_index similarity graph summarization gs uses the minimum description length principle to group nodes with similar interaction_patterns however both pg and gs are solved by greedy algorithms which can not guarantee the global optimality additionally they tend to over segment the network to get relatively small modules based on our empirical experience a bayesian_framework based on a stochastic blockmodel formulation has been developed to identify modules as well as the optimal number of modules however the algorithm only guarantees to converge to local_optima has proposed to solve blockmodel module identification by optimally mapping the given network to an image graph using simulated_annealing and several optimization strategies also have been proposed to accelerate the original simulated_annealing algorithm but those algorithms suffer from prohibitive computational_complexity due to the inherent combinatorial complexity of the blockmodel problem in this article we propose a novel formulation to solve the functional module identification problem which simultaneously identifies the previously described dense and sparse modules with similar interaction_patterns the article is organized as follows in section we first introduce the new optimization formulation by searching for the low two hop conductance sets lcp based on the two hop transition_matrix of the underlying markov_chain of the random_walk on a given network then we derive the corresponding mathematical programing problem and propose an algorithm slcp spectral algorithm for lcp which solves lcp to search for non overlapping modules by a spectral approximate method with a close to optimal_solution we also present an extended algorithm greedy_algorithm for lcp glcp which solves lcp to search for overlapping modules by a bottom up greedy strategy in section we evaluate and compare our methods with other state of the art algorithms for functional module identification on four large_scale ppi_networks the saccharomyces_cerevisiae ppi_network extracted from the database of interacting_proteins dip scedip the corresponding network from the biogrid database scebiogrid the homo_sapiens hsahprd ppi_network collected from the human protein reference_database hprd version and the human ppi_network hsabiogrid obtained from biogrid the experimental_results of protein complex prediction show that nonoverlapping slcp outperforms most of the non overlapping state of the art algorithms and performs competitively with the more recent rmcl algorithm when we compare glcp with the other algorithms for overlapping modules our experiments show that glcp outperforms clusterone and linkcomm high_level go gene_ontology term prediction results further demonstrate that slcp is superior to other non overlapping algorithms whereas glcp and linkcomm perform equally well furthermore we present a few identified functional sparse modules to illustrate that slcp and glcp have the advantage in detecting functional sparse modules compared with the other state of the art algorithms in the last part of section in section we draw our conclusions by briefly summarizing the differences between our new slcp and glcp algorithms and other existing module identification algorithms
