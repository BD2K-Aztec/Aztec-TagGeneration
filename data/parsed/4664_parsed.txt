tiba a tool for phylogeny inference from rearrangement data with bootstrap analysis tiba is a tool to reconstruct phylogenetic_trees from rearrangement data that consist of ordered lists of synteny_blocks or genes where each synteny block is shared with all of its homologues in the input genomes the evolution of these synteny_blocks through rearrangement operations is modelled by the uniform double cut and join model using a true distance estimate under this model and simple distance based_methods tiba reconstructs a phylogeny of the input genomes unlike any previous tool for inferring phyloge nies from rearrangement data tiba uses novel methods of robust ness estimation to provide support values for the edges in the inferred tree rare genomic changes such as rearrangements cause large_scale structural changes in the genome clarify distant or problematic relationships among organisms and have been used in many phylogenetic_studies the first algorithm for phylogeny inference from rearrangement data was bpanalysis the algorithm seeks to reconstruct the tree and ancestral_genomes with the minimum breakpoint distance along each edge of the tree this approach was extended in grappa by using inversion distances these methods were restricted to unichromosomal genomes the tool mgr was the first to handle multichromosomal genomes all these parsimony based_approaches must produce good approximations to the np_hard of computing the rearrangement median of three genomes summarized in which limits their scalability despite using clever heuristics mgr does not scale well particularly for high_resolution data yet to date mgr and its more recent derivative mgra had remained the only tool available for the analysis of multichromosomal genomic_rearrangements distance based_methods like neighbour_joining nj in contrast with parsimony based_methods run in time polynomial in the number and size of genomesand fast and accurate heuristics exist for those where the scoring_function cannot be computed in polynomial time such as fastme pairwise_distances given as input to a distance based method are usually the edit distances that is the minimum cost distances under the assumed model of evolution however an edit_distance typically underestimates the true distance causing poor accuracy of trees inferred from distance based_methods when given true evolutionary_distances nj provably returns the true tree the true evolutionary distancethe actual number of evolutionary_events between the two genomesis impossible to measure but it can be estimated using statistical_techniques such distance corrections have long been used for sequence_data and more recently for rearrangement data for multichromosomal genomes we have designed such an estimator and have demonstrated the accuracy and scalability of a reconstruction method that uses nj with this distance estimator a major shortcoming of phylogeny reconstruction from rearrangement data has been the lack of any way to assess the robustness of the inferred edges in phylogenetic_analysis from sequence_data such an assessment is de rigueur and is carried_out by an adaptation of the standard non parametric teststhe bootstrap and the jackknife first proposed by felsenstein recently we have designed several new methods for statistically assessing the robustness of trees reconstructed from rearrangement data through careful and extensive experiments we have shown that our bootstrapping approach for rearrangement data is on par with the classic phylogenetic bootstrap used in sequence_based reconstruction combining these methods with our distance based reconstruction method we provide the first tool for phylogeny inference from rearrangement data that is accurate scalable and provides bootstrap support values for the edges of the tree tiba is fast scalable accurate and provides support values for the edges in the inferred tree fast and scalable distance based_methods precise estimates of true pairwise_distances and finally for the first time in any rearrangement based phylogeny inference_method the use of bootstrap scorestogether make tiba unique conflict of interest none declared
