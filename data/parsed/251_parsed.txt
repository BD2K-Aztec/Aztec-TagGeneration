sequence_analysis a min cut algorithm for the consistency problem in multiple_sequence motivation multiple_sequence can be constructed on the basis of pairwise local sequence_similarities this approach is rather flexible and can combine the advantages of global and local alignment_methods the restriction to pairwise_alignments as building_blocks however can lead to misalignments since weak homologies may be missed if only pairs of sequences are compared results herein we propose a graph theoretical_approach to find local multiple sequence_similarities starting with pairwise_alignments produced by dialign we use a min cut algorithm to find potential partial alignment columns that we use to construct a final multiple_alignment on real and simulated benchmark data our approach consistently outperforms the standard version of dialign where local pairwise_alignments are greedily incorporated into a multiple_alignment multiple_sequence msa is a requisite for almost all aspects of computational sequence_analysis but it is a notoriously difficult_task seeor kemena and notredame for recent_reviews traditionally alignment_methods have been characterized as either local or global the idea of including local_alignment information into global_alignment tools was first implemented in dialign and is also used in more recent tools such as t coffee or mafft most approaches for msa are based on well defined objective_functions and try to find optimal or near optimal msas according to these functions traditional objective_functions for pairwise_alignment are defined by summing up individual substitution scores and gap penalties this can be extended to multiple_alignment using a weighted_sum ofpairs sps or tree alignment approach these objective_functions to whom correspondence should be addressed have a probabilistic interpretation and can be formulated in a hidden_markov hmm framework more recently segment based objective_functions and objective_functions based on probabilistic consistency have been proposed a promising new approach is the use of conditional_random for msa as proposed by since the optimal multiple_alignment problem is np_hard under any reasonable objective_function virtually all msa programs are based on heuristic optimization algorithms most of these heuristics work by integrating rather simple partial alignments into a final multiple_alignment for global_alignment paradigmatically represented by clustalw this is usually done by progressive alignment here single sequences and profiles of related sequences are aligned until all input_sequences are included in a multiple_alignment in contrast in the segment based_approach implemented in dialign local similarities are integrated sequentially under the constraints imposed by a certain consistency criterion more recently the progressive approach has also been applied to the segment based alignment though consistency is an order theoretic condition that ensures the compatibility of the local similarities with the linear structure of a global_alignment shortly spoken a set of partial alignments a a k is called consistent if an alignment a of the input_sequences exists such that each of the alignments a i is represented in a in the dialign program the raw_material from which a multiple_alignment is built is a set of pairwise gap free local_alignments such partial alignments are called fragment alignments or shorter fragments thus a fragment is represented as a pair of segments of the same length from two of the input_sequences each fragment is given a weight score based on the probability of its random occurrence and the optimization task is to find a consistent set of fragments with maximum total weight for pairwise_alignment a consistent set of fragments is a chain of fragments i e a set of fragments where for any two fragments one of them is strictly to the left of the other one an optimal alignment in this approach is therefore a chain of fragments with maximum total weight and can be found by dynamic_programming either using standard fragment chaining algorithms or by a more space efficient algorithm that is implemented in dialign for multiple_alignment fragments from the respective optimal pairwise_alignments are greedily included or discarded according to their consistency with each other page in this article we introduced a new way of composing msas from local pairwise_alignments we first use dialign to construct all optimal pairwise_alignments in the sense of i e for each sequence pair we search for a chain of fragments with total maximum_weight unlike dialign however we do not include these fragments directly into a multiple_alignment instead we use a graph theoretical_approach to obtain potential partial alignment columns based on the dialign fragments to alignthese databases consist of simulated sequences with local homologies in otherwise unrelated sequences notation as in the remainder of the sequences we use these partial columns as anchor points in dialign thus the major difference between our approach and the original_version of dialign is the fact that we use local multiple sequence_similarities rather than pairwise similarities as a basis for msa the restriction to local pairwise similarities as building_blocks for multiple_alignment is a major_drawback of dialign dialign is one of the best methods for local multiple_alignment it also produces good global alignments if sequences are related over their entire length for sequences with weak global sequence_similarity however dialign is often outperformed by global alignment_methods with the new approach that we proposed we focus on local similarities that span more than two sequences this seems to be a promising way to overcome the current_limitations of dialign approaches to multiple_alignment have two basic components an objective_function assigning quality_scores to possible alignments and an optimization procedure for finding high_scoring alignments in the sense of the chosen objective_function thus the failure of an alignment program to produce reasonable alignments can have two reasons the objective_function may assign optimal scores to biologically wrong alignments or the optimization_algorithm may fail to find a near optimal alignment in we compared the numerical scores of the improved alignments calculated with our new method to the scores of the standard dialign alignments in four out of six reference sets in balibase the dialign alignments have on average higher numerical scores than the biologically superior alignments produced by our new approach this clearly demonstrates that the objective_function currently used in dialign is flawed possible reasons for the shortcomings of this objective_function are discussed in thus it is unlikely that dialign can be further improved by applying more efficient optimization algorithms on the basis of the current objective_function instead it seems worthwhile to investigate novel objective_functions for the segment based alignment problem probabilistic approaches may provide a way of optimising the weight parameters used by dialign for example by using conditional_random also it seems worthwhile to use partial multiple local_alignments instead of pairwise fragments as building_blocks for msa and to develop improved objective_functions based on such partial multiple_alignments
