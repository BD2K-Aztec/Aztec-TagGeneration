finding recurrent copy_number preserving within sample homogeneity motivation copy_number cnas represent an important component of genetic_variation and play_a in many human_diseases development of array_comparative acgh technology has made it possible to identify cnas identification of recurrent_cnas represents the first fundamental step to provide a list of genomic_regions which form the basis for further biological_investigations the main_problem in recurrent_cnas discovery is related to the need to distinguish between functional changes and random events without pathological relevance within sample homogeneity represents a common_feature of copy_number profile in cancer so it can be used as additional source of information to increase the accuracy of the results although several algorithms aimed at the identification of recurrent_cnas have been proposed no attempt of a comprehensive comparison of different approaches has yet been published results we propose a new approach called genomic analysis of important alterations gaia to find recurrent_cnas where a statistical hypothesis framework is extended to take into account within sample homogeneity statistical_significance and within sample homogeneity are combined into an iterative procedure to extract the regions that likely are involved in functional changes results show that gaia represents a valid alternative to other proposed approaches in addition we perform an accurate comparison by using two real acgh datasets and a carefully_planned simulation_study availability gaia has been implemented as r bioconductor_package it can be downloaded from the following pagerecently the impact of copy_number cnas in human_diseases is increasingly being recognized cnas are genomic_regions kb in which copy_number differences are observed between two or more genomes acgh technology to whom correspondence should be addressed allows the measurement of copy_number for hundreds of thousands locations probes in the genome where copy_number is expressed by the logr ratio lrr which gives an indirect measure of copy_number of each probe computed as the ratio of observed to expected hybridization intensity the potential of acgh has been exploited in a large number of publications aimed at the identification of functional genetic_mutations involved in cancer for example in the genomes of a cohort of patients are analyzed to extract the cnas that are common to a significant number of subjects these analyses are based on the fact that cnas functionally_related to the disease under study driver alterations will be present in many of the analyzed genomes recurrent_cnas in contrast random somatic_mutations passenger alterations are subject specific and they will be present only in a small number of subjects we can define a cna as a set of continuous probes that show a high enough evidence to being altered in at least some samples of course rare cnas also hold a very important role in cancer development but most studies based on acgh are designed to find recurrent_cnas for this reason discovery of recurrent_cnas represents a current challenge in bioinformatics several algorithms aimed at the discovery of recurrent_cnas have been proposed in this work we refer to this class of algorithm as rcna algorithms rcna algorithms differ in many aspects input_data model preprocessing_step output and execution time an overview of rcna algorithms is reported in section indeed there is no comprehensive comparison of the different approaches and very few of the published_papers report a comparison with other methods in addition both rueda and diaz uriarte and shah point out the importance of carefully_planned simulation_studies in performance assessment of rcna algorithms this work has two goals the description of a novel rcna algorithm gaia and the evaluation of rcna algorithm performance gaia uses a discrete representation of the data to perform a permutation_test a novel iterative procedure taking_into both significance and within sample homogeneity homogeneous peel off is used to identify the most significant peaks in section we present a careful comparison of rcnaalgorithms both on synthetic data and on real acgh dataset synthetic data are generated in agreement to three typical_patterns of recurrent_cnas so that quantitative_comparison can be performed in a variety of well defined simulated_datasets we also use two recently_published real_datasets to evaluate the results of compared algorithms the first dataset is on colorectal_cancer current knowledge can be used to compare and validate the considered in a an example of matrix d denotes no alteration denotes gain and denotes loss in d there are two homogeneous regions from probes p to p for samples s s and s and from probes p to p for samples s s and s blue and green squares respectively in b and c the matrices d l and d g of the matrix in a are shown in d the q value configuration for d l before the first iteration of peel off in e the q value configuration for d l after that the peak p p has been removed by standard peel off in f the h values for the matrix d in a in d and e red line represents the q value significance threshold q thr and in f red line represents the h value threshold h thr algorithms the second dataset refers to gastrointestinal_stromal for which well known aberrant cytobands are used to perform the comparison in this dataset for each sample million of probes are measured so it can also be used to validate the performance of the algorithms in terms of execution time for real_data the ground_truth of cna is not available so in order to perform a qualitative_evaluation of rcna algorithms we need to extract from biological studies a list of verified cnas although this list can contain cnas that are not present within the analyzed dataset it can be efficiently used to have an idea about the results obtained by the rcna algorithms to overcome the limitations occurring on the evaluation performed on real_data we generated synthetic data for which the ground_truth is available in order to perform a quantitative assessment in order to run the rcna algorithms on the considered data the respective input_parameters must be chosen gaia has just two main parameters the significance threshold q thr and the homogeneity threshold h thr for which we used values and respectively this parameter setting has been used both on synthetic and real_data these parameters can be considered as algorithm driven and do not need to be selected on the basis of the dataset in jistic six parameters must be specified and the default setting suggested by authors has been used to perform all comparisons on real_data both gada and cghmcr were used with the suggested parameter configuration in contrast on synthetic data we perform a parameter_tuning in order to obtain the best performance for these algorithms in the supplementary_material more details about the parameter_settings are provided gaia uses within sample homogeneity to obtain results consistent with the biological nature of copy_number profiles and the reported results suggested that this heuristic can improve the accuracy extensive comparison on simulated_data allowed the observation of the behavior of the considered algorithms gada seemed to be particularly robust with respect to noise gaia and jistic had comparable_performance with a slight advantage for gaia and finally less accurate performance were obtained by cghmcr analysis of two real acgh datasets suggested an important observation approaches directly working on lrr were strongly affected by the chip resolution in particular both for jistic and gada the number of identified regions increased with increasing resolution in contrast gaia which uses a discrete representation of the data resulted in a stable estimate of the number of computed regions with respect to the chip resolution results on synthetic and real acgh data showed that cghmcr produced several spurious peaks as also observed in rueda and diaz uriarte another important aspect pointed_out by our analysis is on the execution time cghmcr was very fast but it simply performs a counting of the number of alteration for each probe execution time of gada is related to the convergence of the em_algorithm used to estimate the parameters of the model convergence is slower in high_resolution scenarios but its execution time seemed to be good finally both gaia and jistic use a conservative permutation model to compute the distribution of the null_hypothesis in its approximated version gaia seems to be faster than jistic but gaia had also an acceptable computational time h in the largest dataset when it explicitly performs the permutations we also highlighted the fact that the list of computed cnas must be integrated with information measuring the strength of evidence of aberrations i e q value indeed this information can be used to resolve ambiguous results this is the case of jistic and gada on gist dataset where regions were found both in loss and in gain and to choose cnas representing the target of further biological_investigations although our methodology can be subject to further improvements our opinion is that gaia is a valid alternative to other rcna algorithms especially for the analysis of highresolution acgh data indeed the performed analysis showed that gaia can be particularly useful for high_resolution data which have been already segmented as for example tcga cna data indeed we report a better stability with respect to the number of detected regions in different resolution scenarios in other words the amount of false_positives produced is not related to the resolution and this contrasts noticeably with the rcna algorithms considered for comparison in addition when gaia used an approximated approach to compute the null_distribution the processing of large amount of data is faster than other approaches based on significance analysis we also pointed_out the fact that of course accurate tuning of the input_parameters can significantly improve the results of the rcna algorithms but often this tuning involves many parameters and their perfect combination is very hard to reach therefore another very important advantage of gaia is that in contrast to other considered rcna algorithms it requires just two input_parameters finally although in literature discretization page recurrent_cnas represent a very important source of information about genetic_diseases like cancer and rcna algorithms can be used to find significant associated aberrations in this work a new rcna algorithm has been presented and a performance analysis of rcna algorithms was performed results showed that joint analysis of all available samples without a preprocessing segmentation step as in gada can improve robustness respect to noise and that within sample homogeneity can be used to increase the accuracy of the results in addition we point out two interesting strong points of gaia its ability in working on high_resolution data and its parameter setting that is very straightforward
