uniprot daac domain_architecture alignment and classification a new method for automatic functional_annotation in uniprotkb motivation similarity based_methods have been widely used in order to infer the properties of genes and gene_products containing little or no experimental annotation new approaches that overcome the limitations of methods that rely solely upon sequence_similarity are attracting increased attention one of these novel approaches is to use the organization of the structural_domains in proteins results we propose a method for the automatic_annotation of protein_sequences in the uniprot knowledgebase uniprotkb by comparing their domain_architectures classifying proteins based on the similarities and propagating functional_annotation the performance of this method was measured through a cross_validation analysis using the gene_ontology go annotation of a subset of uniprotkb_swiss the results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in detecting functional_similarity with an average f score we applied the method on nearly million uncharacterized_proteins in uniprotkb trembl resulted in go term predictions for proteins of these predictions were for previously non annotated protein entries indicating the significance of the value added by this approach the reduction in the cost of sequencing has led to the accumulation of a vast amount of data in biological_databases these data are stored in public_repositories such as the uniprot knowledgebase for protein_sequences and ncbi genbank and the embl nucleotide archive for gene sequences in order to make sense of these data the stored sequences need to be annotated with respect to their functional and evolutionary properties defining the functions of genes and gene_products is a difficult_task due to the biological_complexity of organisms there are various projects aiming to standardize the description of the functional_attributes of biological_sequences by introducing controlled_vocabularies the gene_ontology go project provides the most comprehensive functional standardization system for proteins go uses a directed_acyclic dag structure to define the functions from generic to specific in three main categories namely molecular_function biological_process and cellular_component discovery of functional properties for proteins is a key_step in biomedical_research yet experimental identification of proteins is still a quite laborious and expensive task this has led to many similarity based computational_methods being developed to infer the unknown properties of proteins based on their similarity to experimentally annotated proteins the most widely used approach is sequence_alignment a significant proportion of the unknown functional space has been covered thanks to this procedure where similarity is inferred in terms of the shared evolutionary_history of the sequences nevertheless different approaches have been tried lately for the prediction of protein properties to augment the performance of sequence methods one approach is to exploit information on the physicochemical_properties of the amino_acids in the protein_sequence to infer subcellular_localization a different approach is the prediction of the structure of the proteins using their sequences yet another one is to identify evolutionary conserved_regions in the sequences such as motifs and domains and to relate these sequence_segments to specific functions the idea is that genes with mutations in these regions are selected against because changes in these functionally_active segments may cause a decrease in efficiency or even the loss of function decreasing the fitness of the gene combinatorial approaches are gaining_popularity where different methods are combined to increase the coverage and the quality of predictions either by gathering together different features under one classifier or by using multiple classifiers at the same time critical assessment of protein_function was initiated in in order to evaluate various methods in terms of their performance in the prediction of go terms on a standard dataset many of the methods using evolutionary_conserved sub sequences focus on protein_domains these are the structural building_blocks in proteins that are able to function and fold independently from the rest of the protein there are many wellestablished biological_databases dedicated to the identification and search of functional_domains and the grouping of similar protein_sequences into families these databases attempt to assign functional_annotations to the domains and families and approach a protein_sequence as a functional combination of its domains some of the widely used sequence_based domain_family databases are pfam prosite hamap superfamily and interpro interpro incorporates all of the above databases and more to provide a comprehensive classification of proteins one view in the field of protein_function inference states that the function of a protein is not simply the sum of the functions of the independent domains it contains but rather is a unique property emerging from the contribution of all of the structural blocks synergistically this has led to the concept of domain_architectures arrangements da defined as the organizational properties of a protein regarding the domains it contains these properties may include the domain content linear order of the domains in the protein_sequence and recurrence of the domains in the protein in da based_methods statistically_significant similarities between test proteins are identified using the above_mentioned properties examples of da information being employed in biological data analysis methods include although the methodology used varies_greatly between the different studies most of them try to predict the pairwise similarities homologies between proteins earlier_studies mostly focused on similarities in the domain content of proteins whereas information regarding domain order position recurrence and promiscuity is more frequently used in later studies the study bywas the first to incorporate information about the sequential_order of domains into the similarity_search in most of these studies the authors set out to quantify the similarities between proteins using domain information mostly with the aim of identifying pairwise homologies here we present the uniprot domain_architecture alignment and classification daac procedure for the automatic_annotation of uncharacterized_proteins in uniprotkb based upon domain architectural similarity to manually reviewed sequences in the uniprotkb_swiss four attributes are incorporated into the measurement of domain architectural similarity domain content order position and recurrence the proposed method incorporates domain annotation from interpro in order to obtain comprehensive domain information coverage for the proteins this study is the first that we are aware of to use da comparison and classification in the automatic functional_annotation of large protein_sets the proposed method also brings new approaches to the field by i employing interpro as the domain annotation source ii the use of multi_label technique to annotate proteins with multiple functions in one run and to be able to optimize the parameters for each functional term independently and iii application of domain weights during the alignment step to direct the procedure to the optimal_solution multi_label is a technique used to classify each sample into one or more classes this method is frequently employed to analyze examples with multiple attributes as opposed to the traditional single label or binary_classification in the latter each of the objects under consideration can be assigned to only one class among a set of mutually_exclusive classes however in the real_world objects can belong to multiple_classes that are not necessarily disjoint e g a protein may interact with atp attribute in the plasma_membrane attribute there are two ways to address these cases the first is to perform several separate processes of binary_classification each for one class and then to aggregate the results the second option is to perform a multi_label which allows assigning an object to more than one class and in one single process the proposed method has been validated using protein_sequences from uniprotkb_swiss together with their experimentally_validated go annotations by doing so we hope to demonstrate that the results of the analysis have biological_relevance for protein_function finally we applied the method to uniprotkb trembl to obtain functional_predictions for the protein entries in the database it is important to emphasize that the proposed method is not designed to replace conventional sequence_based but to complement them the case for using da comparison methods to complement sequence based_approaches has been reported in previous_studies displays the representation of daac the method first generates the das for both training and test proteins as explained in section training of the system takes_place as the second step where das of reference proteins are aligned pairwise in an allagainst all manner using the interpro domain hits as the strings instead of amino_acids then training proteins are grouped under classes representing unique go terms class specific similarity thresholds are determined at the end of the training as discussed in section the third step is the application das of the query proteins are aligned to the training samples and classified into the annotation term classes considering their similarity measure from the alignment query proteins receive the go term of the corresponding classes as predictions
