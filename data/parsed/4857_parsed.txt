vipr variant identification in pooled_dna using r motivation high_throughput hts technologies are the method of choice for screening the human_genome for rare sequence_variants causing susceptibility to complex_diseases unfortunately preparation of samples for a large number of individuals is still very cost and labor_intensive thus recently screens for rare sequence_variants were carried_out in samples of pooled_dna in which equimolar_amounts of dna from multiple_individuals are mixed prior to sequencing with hts the resulting sequence_data however poses a bioinformatics challenge the discrimination of sequencing_errors from real sequence_variants present at a low_frequency in the dna pool results our method vipr uses data from multiple dna pools in order to compensate for differences in sequencing_error along the sequenced region more precisely instead of aiming at discriminating sequence_variants from sequencing_errors vipr identifies sequence_positions that exhibit significantly different minor_allele in at least two dna pools using the skellam distribution the performance of vipr was compared with three other models on data from a targeted_resequencing study of the tmem d locus in individuals distributed over four dna pools performance of the methods was computed on snps that were also genotyped individually using a maldi_tof technique on a set of sequence_variants vipr achieved an average sensitivity of at an average specificity of thus outperforming the reference_methods by at least in specificity at comparable sensitivity availability the code of vipr is freely_available via http sourceforge net_projects htsvipr contact altmann mpipsykl mpg degenome wide association studies gwass have been extremely successful in identifying relevant loci under the common diseasecommon variant cdcv hypothesis studies conducted in recent_years identified hundreds of loci associated with complex_traits for many of those traits however the associated variants explain only a small fraction of the heritability of common traits human height for instance can be explained very well by the average height of the individuals parents and thus its genetic heritability is estimated with around gwass for human height indeed identified a large number of associated loci that however explain only about of this heritability a reason for this discrepancyor the case of the missing_heritability is the inherent to whom correspondence should be addressed drawback of gwas the genome_wide chips focus on common variations i e rare alleles are not tested for at all thus in recent_years the efforts for finding clinically_relevant genetic_markers for many common diseases began also to include the common diseaserare variant cdrv hypothesis here multiple rare_mutations ideally in the same genetic region underly susceptibility to the disease clearly in this quest for the missing_heritability high throughputsequencing hts technologies play_a these technologies led to a dramatic drop in costs per sequenced base_pair compared to capillary based sequencing and thereby provide the necessary sequencing power required for finding rare_variants the major_obstacle with hts is that sequencing the genomes of thousands of people as it was carried_out in gwass is currently beyond the scopefinancially and bioinformatically of single research institutes however although initially designed to be a tool for sequencing whole genomes hts also provides the sequencing power required for investigating all exonic_regions or more clearly defined genetic regions in a large number of individuals these targeted_resequencing studies are well within the scope of single laboratories hts platforms support multiplexing for facilitating the sequencing of multiple isolates in one physical compartment all multiplexing strategies are based on small dna_fragments termed barcodes that are attached to the fragments to be sequenced and thereby enables the allocation of every single_read to each sample for instance the abi solid supports multiplexing furthermore the platform allows to partition its slide into eight equally sized compartments hence theoretically allowing to sequence a short defined genetic region of individuals at a time a downside of this strategy is that sample_preparation i e amplification of the target_region and attaching of the barcodes has to be carried_out separately for every sample thus generating non negligible costs and work load a more labor and cost_effective strategy is the sequencing of dna pools here equimolar_amounts of dna are mixed into one sample prior to the amplification and sequencing steps the major disadvantage of sequencing dna pooling is the loss of the information about which read originates from which individual however once rare_variants are detected using the pooling approach individual genotyping can be used to assign these variants to the respective individuals the major_obstacle when sequencing dna pools is the sequencing_error of the hts platform the sequencing_error is the major factor that limits the size of dna pools i e the number of individuals in one pool in which a single heterozygous allele remains detectable for instance in a pool of individuals and a sequencing_error of one cannot decide whether an observed minor_allele maf of is due to a true variant in the pool or simply due to sequencing_errors at that position in the following section we review related work in the domain of variant detection in hts_data from dna pools in section we introduce our method vipr that makes use of data from multiple dna pools for achieving a higher sensitivity in detecting variants in large dna pools furthermore we introduce the data used for validating vipr in section we present the results of a power study and the performance of vipr and three reference_methods on a validation dataset section and discuss the results and conclude the article respectively we presented vipr a tool for variant detection in dna pools that uses sequence_information from multiple sequenced dna pools in parallel for improving the sensitivity of variant detection in our evaluation vipr performed with the highest specificity and precision at a sensitivity superior to a poisson based model and comparable to two more methods moreover vipr was the fastest tool among the evaluated methods just requiring min for all four dna pools opposed to days required by crisp the slowest tool the source_code of vipr can be obtained via http sourceforge
