data_and chip ped enhances the analysis of chip_seq and chip_chip data motivation although chromatin_immunoprecipitation coupled with high_throughput chip_seq or tiling_array hybridization chip_chip is increasingly used to map genome widebinding sites of transcription_factors tfs it still remains difficult to generate a quality chipx i e chip_seq or chip_chip dataset because of the tremendous amount of effort required to develop effective antibodies and efficient protocols moreover most laboratories are unable to easily obtain chipx data for one or more tf s in more than a handful of biological_contexts thus standard chipx analyses primarily focus on analyzing data from one experiment and the discoveries are restricted to a specific biological_context results we propose to enrich this existing data analysis paradigm by developing a novel approach chipped which superimposes chipx data on large_amounts of publicly_available human and mouse gene_expression data containing a diverse collection of cell_types tissues and disease conditions to discover new biological_contexts with potential tf regulatory_activities we demonstrate chipped using a number of examples including a novel discovery that myc a human tf plays an important functional role in pediatric ewing sar coma cell_lines these examples show that chipped increases the value of chipx data by allowing one to expand the scope of possible discoveries made from a chipx experiment chipx experiments including chip_seq and chip_chip have become a powerful_tool used by individual investigators as well as consortium projects such as the encode to study transcription_factor each individual chipx experiment is non trivial to performextensive time and effort must be spent to acquire effective antibodies and design efficient protocols to generate high_quality chipx datathus it is important to develop methodology to help investigators to maximize the value of each individual chipx experiment one of the primary limitations of chipx is it may be difficult for individual laboratories to study tf regulation in a wide_variety of biological_contexts which we define as the cell or tissue_types and associated treatments or disease conditions see definition details in supplementary method this is largely because of the prohibitively high labor and time costs to perform each experiment to resolve this limitation we investigate whether publicly_available gene_expression data ped in the gene_expression geo can be used as a tool to increase the value of chipx experiments currently gene_expression samples from a broad_spectrum of biological_contexts and species are deposited in the geo and arrayexpress these data are freely_available and contain rich_information complementary to chipx which may be extremely useful to help study tf regulation in this article we demonstrate that this is indeed the case by proposing and evaluating a new approach chip ped given a tf regulatory_pathway i e a tf and the corresponding set of target_genes defined using chipx and gene_expression data in one or more biological_contexts chip ped scans through a large collection of human and mouse gene_expression samples generated by hundreds of different laboratories by quickly surveying the tf and target_gene activities across biological_contexts to identify potentially new connections between the tf regulatory_pathway and various cell_types tissues or diseases we will illustrate that the predictions from chip ped are useful and can greatly expand the scope of discoveries one can make from chipx experiments we also provide an r package for users to perform chip ped analyses on their own chipx and tf perturbation data chip ped represents a novel conceptual approach to building computational_tools for chipx data analysis most existing_tools for analyzing chipx data including those for detecting protein dnabinding sites discovering dna_binding correlating chipx with gene_expression data and so forth focus on to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the author

original_work addressing analysis issues concerning a single or a few related chipx datasets their discoveries are also typically restricted to the biological_context in which the chipx experiments are performed and none of them systematically integrates_information from ped ped has been shown to be invaluable in other applications but the possibility of using ped as a tool to boost the analysis of chipx data still remains_largely a number of methods do integrate large_amounts of chipx and gene_expression data to construct gene_regulatory but most are primarily used to study lower organisms e g yeast the present study is different from those described works as chip ped focuses specifically on integrating chipx with large_amounts of heterogeneous data in human and mouse to improve chipx analyses instead of attempting to construct a comprehensive gene_regulatory the primary goal of chip ped is to produce simple testable_hypotheses such as tf a is functionally_active in biological_contexts x y and z through target gene_set s we have shown that chip ped can improve the analysis of chipx data by integrating publicly_available gene_expression data given a tf and its target_genes chip ped examines the expression of the tf and the activity of its target_genes across an assortment of diverse biological_contexts to search for contexts with enriched regulatory activity of the tf this process may lead to the discovery of novel functional_connections between tf regulatory_pathways and diseases thus providing a cost_effective way to expand knowledge from one chipx study to other research_areas we view chip ped as an exploratory tool for fast and costeffective hypothesis_generation and screening in this respect the default cut_offs that define high or low tf expression or tg activity should be primarily used for initial exploration or firstpass automatic hypothesis screening rather than as strict optimal cut_offs that apply to all tfs based on our real_data analysis experience we found it difficult to set a single consistent cut_off that was optimal across all tfs as tfs can vary_greatly in terms of regulatory behavior we therefore provide users with the flexibility to choose their own cut_offs which can be adjusted to decrease or increase the number of predicted contexts supplementary method chip ped acts primarily as a guide to highlight biological_contexts that would be good leads for experimental_investigation as such we do not expect all chip ped predictions to be correct nor for chip ped to recover all tf active biological_contexts this however does not prevent chip ped from being a useful and unique tool our analyses have shown that it can predict many known and new tf active contexts with reasonable accuracy and there currently exists no other computational_method for analyzing chipx data that performs a similar task although we have shown that chip ped is able to capture pertinent biological_information in ped better statistical_models are still needed to address technical biases and variations because of laboratory and batch_effects a natural extension of chipped would be to analyze multiple_tfs and their tgs together to better connect cooperative tf regulatory_pathways to cell_types and diseases similarly more work is also needed to understand how homologous tfs or other tfs with similar regulatory_functions impact the regulatory activity of the tf of interest in different contexts our study is not necessarily the best or only way to integrate chipx and ped however to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic study of using ped to enhance chipx analyses in human and mouse we hope that chip ped will inspire new computational_approaches that continue to maximize the value of chip_seq and chip_chip experiments
