sequence_analysis prism pair read informed split read_mapping for base_pair level detection of insertion deletion and structural_variants motivation the development_of has enabled novel methods for detecting structural_variants svs current methods are typically based on depth of coverage or pair end mapping clusters however most of these only report an approximate location for each sv rather than exact breakpoints results we have developed pair read informed split mapping prism a method that identifies svs and their precise breakpoints from whole_genome resequencing data prism uses a split alignment approach informed by the mapping of paired_end hence enabling breakpoint identification of multiple sv types including arbitrary sized inversions deletions and tandem_duplications comparisons to previous datasets and simulation_experiments illustrate prisms high_sensitivity while pcr validations of prism results including previously_uncharacterized variants indicate an overall precision of availability prism is freely_available atthe development of high_throughput hts technologies has enabled novel methods for detecting structural_variants svs current methods which are usually based on depth of coverage pair end mapping clusters or a combination of these have been successful in quantifying structural_variation in individual_genomes and populations however most of these only report an approximate location for each sv rather than exact breakpoints accurate mapping of split_reads reads that span across a breakpoint of an sv is evidence for the linking relationship of the segments that are adjacent in the sequenced_genome donor but not in the reference human_genome split_read based_methods such as pindel splitread and svseq while able to identify these breakpoints have been limited in their ability to identify large_scale structural_variants these tools take the approach of aligning the split_read only in the immediate vicinity of the reads pair and thus limit the maximum discoverable variant size pindel and splitread take a user specified maximum indel size as a parameter while svseq uses a fixed constant typically the running_times and accuracies of the programs heavily depend on this parameter as alignment of a small portion of the read to a large segment of the human_genome is computationally_intensive and error_prone several recent_approaches combine the split mapping signature with additional information the depth of coverage and discordant paired ends respectively however the nord et_al method can only be used with capture data rather than whole genomes and the zhang et_al method svseq only handles indels and not other svs the recent crest method_takes an alternative approach for assembling the unaligned clipped ends of reads and mapping these to the genome we have developed pair read informed split mapping prism a method that makes use of discordant pair end clusters to direct split read_mapping the use of discordant clusters allows us to substantially reduce_the for split mapping leading to faster run times and significantly_higher accuracy at identifying large_deletions and other structural_variants prism also uses a modification of the needleman wunsch nw algorithm for the base level alignment of the split_read to enable high_accuracy in the presence of snps small_indels and sequencing_errors proximal to the sv to evaluate our method we conducted simulation_experiments and analyzed two recently sequenced_genomes prism has several advantages over previous methods for detection of svs from hts_data including combining paired_read analysis and split mapping for detection of the exact breakpoints for variants of arbitrary size the sensitive alignment algorithm used in prism accurately identifies breakpoints even proximal to other variants or sequencing_errors one such example is shown in where a large_deletion predicted by prism and validated by pcr is immediately followed by a small deletion making the alignment of reads that span the deletion especially challenging the pcr validations confirm not only the overall high_accuracy of prism results but also its ability to identify novel variants inaccessible to previous methods
