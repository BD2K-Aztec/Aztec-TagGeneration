a conditional neural fields model for protein threading motivation alignment errors are still the main bottleneck for current template based protein modeling tm methods including protein threading and homology_modeling especially when the sequence_identity between two proteins under consideration is low results we present a novel protein threading method cnfpred which achieves much more accurate sequencetemplate alignment by employing a probabilistic_graphical called a conditional neural field cnf which aligns one protein_sequence to its remote template using a non linear scoring_function this scoring_function accounts for correlation among a variety of protein_sequence and structure features makes use of information in the neighborhood of two residues to be aligned and is thus much more sensitive than the widely used linear or profile_based scoring_function to train this cnf threading model we employ a novel quality sensitive method instead of the standard maximum_likelihood method to maximize directly the expected quality of the training_set experimental_results show that cnfpred generates significantly better alignments than the best profile_based and threading methods on several public but small benchmarks as well as our own large dataset cnfpred outperforms others regardless of the lengths or classes of proteins and works particularly well for proteins with sparse sequence_profiles due to the effective utilization of structure information our methodology can also be adapted to protein sequence_alignment template_based tm methods including homology_modeling and protein threading have been extensively_studied for protein d structure modeling the quality of a tm model depends on the accuracy of sequencetemplate alignment this alignment usually contains errors when only distantly_related templates are available for a protein_sequence under prediction current tm methods for protein alignment suffer from two limitations the first limitation is that these methods use linear scoring_functions to guide the sequencetemplate alignment the choice of a scoring_function impacts alignment_accuracy a linear function cannot deal well with correlation among protein features although many features are indeed correlated such as secondary_structure and solvent_accessibility the second limitation is that these methods heavily depend on sequence_profiles the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be addressed although sequence_profiles are very powerful as demonstrated by hhpred and many others they fail when a protein has a very sparse sequence_profile the sparseness of a sequence_profile can be quantified using the number of effective sequence homologs neff neff can also be interpreted as the average shannon sequence entropy for the profile or the average number of amino_acid across all residues of a protein the neff at one residue is calculated by exp k p k ln p k where p k is the probability for the k th amino_acid type and the neff for the whole protein is the average across all residues therefore neff ranges from to i e the number of amino_acid types a smaller neff corresponds to a sparser sequence_profile and less homologous information content to go beyond the limitations of current alignment_methods this article_presents a novel conditional neural field cnf method for protein threading called cnfpred which can align a sequence to a distantly_related template much more accurately cnfpred combines sequence_information a sequence_profile and structure information using a probabilistic non linear scoring_function and is superior to current methods in several respects first it explicitly accounts for correlations among protein features reducing both overcounting and undercounting second it can align different regions of proteins using different criteria in particular for disordered_regions only sequence_information is used as structure information is unreliable while for other regions structure information is also used third cnfpred dynamically determines the relative importance of homologous and structural_information when a protein under consideration has a sparse sequence_profile cnfpred relies more heavily on structural_information otherwise it relies more heavily on sequence_information such as sequence_profile similarity finally cnfpred varies gap probability based on both context specific and positionspecific features if the protein sequence_profile is sparse it will rely more on context specific information including structure information otherwise it relies more heavily on the position specific information derived from the alignment of sequence homologs cnfpred integrates as much information as possible in order to estimate the alignment probability of two residues in particular to estimate more accurately the probability that two residues should be aligned it uses neighborhood informationboth sequence and structure neighborhood information is also helpful in determining gap opening positions neighborhood sequence_information has been used by many programs such as psipred for protein local structure_prediction and by a few for protein sequence_alignment and homology_search but such information has not been applied to protein threading especially to determine gap opening it is much more challenging to make use of neighborhood information inwe have presented cnfpred a novel cnf model for threading of proteins with sparse sequence_profiles cnfpred takes_advantage of as many correlated sequence and structure features as possible to improve alignment_accuracy we have also presented a qualitysensitive training method to improve alignment_accuracy as opposed to the standard ml method despite using many features and a i
