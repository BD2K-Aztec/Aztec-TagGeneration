systems_biology estimating biological elementary_flux that decompose a flux distribution by the minimal branching property motivation elementary_flux efm is a useful tool in constraint_based of metabolic_networks the property that every flux distribution can be decomposed as a weighted_sum of efms allows certain applications of efms to studying flux_distributions the existence of biologically infeasible efms and the non uniqueness of the decomposition however undermine the applicability of such methods efforts have been made to find biologically feasible efms by incorporating information from transcriptional_regulation and thermo dynamics yet no attempt has been made to distinguish biologically feasible efms by considering their graphical properties a previous study on the transcriptional_regulation of metabolic genes found that distinct branches at a branch point metabolite usually belong to distinct metabolic_pathways this suggests an intuitive property of biologically feasible efms i e minimal branching results we developed the concept of minimal branching efm and derived the minimal branching decomposition mbd to decompose flux_distributions testing in the core escherichia_coli metabolic_network indicated that mbd can distinguish branches at branch points and greatly_reduced the solution_space in which the decomposition is often unique an experimental flux distribution from a previous study on mouse cardiomyocyte was decomposed using mbd comparison with decomposition by a minimum number of efms showed that mbd found efms more consistent with established biological_knowledge which facilitates interpretation comparison of the methods applied to a complex flux distribution in lactococcus_lactis similarly showed the advantages of mbd the minimal branching efm concept underlying mbd should be useful in other applications metabolic_networks consisting of biochemical_reactions and compounds in a cell have proven to be an extremely useful in silico tool to study cellular_metabolism the structure of a metabolic_network is reflected in the stoichiometric matrix s and the state of the network is embodied in the flux distribution fd v which is a vector containing all reaction_rates in the network based on the well established quasi_steady assumption v can be constrained in a polyhedral cone sv v ub v v lb and studied using a series of so_called constraint based reconstruction and analysis cobra methods one of the approaches of theoretical importance and application value is the elementary_flux efm analysis an efm is a fd with a minimal number of active reactions that together satisfy the steady_state condition it is thus a minimal metabolic_pathway in a metabolic_network efms have been successfully_applied to examine network_structures explore new metabolic_pathways suggest rational strain design etc reviewed in another property of efms useful for studying fds is that every fd v is a non negative sum of efms where e e k are all efms of the network and k is the corresponding weight coefficient this decomposition of fds from efms or extreme pathways another type of pathways with a similar definition has been investigated and applied to certain biological studies by choosing particular decompositions reviewed in chan and the usefulness of these methods however is limited for two main reasons first the practical computation of the decomposition requires the set of all efms a priori which is usually not available in large_scale networks owing to combinatorial explosion this computational issue can be overcome in two ways either by sampling efms or by finding efms with particular properties to solve for the decomposition without requiring the entire set of efms the second limitation is the non uniqueness of decomposition and its dependence on the choice of algorithms or optimization objective the ambiguity severely weakens the biological_significance of decomposition has proposed a method to obtain unique decompositions by combining efms with variable weights into compound modes with unique weights another method for unique decompositions is the minimization of the sum of squares of weights but the resulting decomposition can be dependent on how efms are scaled the usefulness of efms can be enhanced by finding biologically feasible efms attempts have been made to incorporate transcriptional_regulatory information to enumerate biologically feasible efms and to rule out thermodynamically infeasible efms these approaches integrating information other than stoichiometry did give promising results the information for instance metabolomics_data and transcriptomics_data however is not always available surprisingly all the proposed methods to find efms or to choose decomposition have not made full use of their graphical properties which should be intuitively important for interpreting efms an earlier study on the co regulation of metabolic_pathways found that transcriptional_regulation tends to favor linear metabolic flow by co expressing only distinct branches at metabolic branch points this means inwhere a is a hypothetical branch point metabolite the genes for the linear pair of reactions r and r or the pair r and r are more likely to be co expressed than r r and r which are distinct branches when decomposing a fd containing r to r two efms containing pair r and r and pair r and r are thus a more preferable choice than one efm containing all r to r as there are probably two distinct_pathways this suggests the rationale of minimizing branching pathways to choose efms that are more likely to be biologically feasible this rationale is also expected to allow clearer interpretation of the roles of the chosen efms because they are expected to contain fewer distinct_pathways we believed that such efms can have wide applicability as the first attempt based on this rationale in this article a new optimization objective called minimal branching decomposition mbd is proposed to identify more biologically_relevant efms to decompose fds using stoichiometric information alone mbd to decompose a fd into a set of efms was derived the efms contain as few branching pathways as possible mbd advances the analysis of fd by decomposition into efms in three aspects first it originates from the consideration of the branching structure in metabolic_network based on experimental_evidence which is a novel attempt second mbd results in more biologically_relevant efms leading to clearer interpretation third mbd showed good performance regarding uniqueness it diminishes the ambiguity of decomposition the minimal branching efm concept underlying mbd can be useful in further applications e g identifying metabolic_pathways for engineering by acting as an estimate for biologically feasible efms scaling up the method to genome_scale networks is necessary for practical applicability in conclusion mbd is able to bring useful insights when analyzing fds combining information from e g transcriptional_regulation and thermodynamics wider application of efms can be anticipated
