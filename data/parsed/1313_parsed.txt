gene_expression demix deconvolution for mixed cancer transcriptomes using raw measured data motivation tissue_samples of tumor_cells mixed with stromal_cells cause underdetection of gene_expression associated with cancer_prognosis or response to treatment in silico dissection of mixed cell samples is essential for analyzing expression data generated in cancer studies currently a systematic approach is lacking to address three challenges in computational deconvolution i violation of linear addition of expression levels from multiple tissues when log_transformed microarray_data are used ii estimation of both tumor proportion and tumor specific expression when neither is known a priori and iii estimation of expression_profiles for individual patients results we have developed a statistical_method for deconvolving mixed cancer transcriptomes demix which addresses the aforemen tioned issues in array based expression data we demonstrate the performance of our model in synthetic and real publicly_available datasets demix can be applied to ongoing biomarker based clinical studies and to the vast expression datasets previously generated from mixed_tumor and stromal_cell samples availability all codes are written in c and integrated into an r function which is available at http odin mdacc tmc edu wwang demix html solid tissue_samples frequently consist of two distinct_components glandular_epithelium and its surrounding stroma traditional analytic approaches that ignore the presence of tissue_heterogeneity may suffer from inaccurate transcriptional_profiling and are likely to miss important genes that are related to shaping cancers to remove heterogeneity in tumor_samples researchers can use laser_capture to physically isolate the different tissue_components however this technique is time consuming costly and requires special equipment that is not available at all institutes thus it is of substantial interest to isolate expression data from mixed_samples in silico in biomarker based clinical_trials microarray_gene are actively studied to profile transcriptions of hundreds of cancer patients current methods for dissecting array based expression data are limited in their application to actual data for the three following reasons first existing_methods assume a linear mixture of expression levels as presented by log transformed_data this assumption recently shown to be invalid can distort the estimation of tissuespecific expressions we describe this linear assumption by ax b where a is a matrix of individual tissue_specific expression x is a vector of mixture proportions and b is a vector of observed expressions showed that raw measured data should be used for input b when log_transformed fluorescent intensity data are used instead the output a is underestimated the convention of using log_transformed expression data started because such data were shown empirically to follow a normal distribution which is straightforward for model_building and parameter_estimation no available model based_methods are designed to analyze data from heterogeneous tumor_samples before the data are log_transformed second the available methods do not provide a practical way to jointly estimate both tissue proportions x and tissue_specific expressions a most methods require good knowledge of one of these measures the tissue_specific expressions a can be derived from a set of genes with known expression_profiles in all constituting tissue_types or from a set of genes that show significant_enrichment in one of the tissue_types other methods focus on deconvolution of gene_expressions based on known tissue proportions implemented a bayesian_model to assess the tissue proportions as well as gene_expression levels using strong previous information on the proportions took reference profiles from all tissue_components and allowed for adjustments in tissue_specific expression levels from the reference profiles to whom correspondence should be addressed developed a geometry based method to estimate mixture proportions without knowledge of all tissue_specific expressions which directly improved the method of but did not deconvolve individual gene_expressions third previous methods have focused on estimating the mean tissue_specific expressions for each gene and thus are not applicable to estimating individual expression levels in each sample and each gene methods for in silico dissection of individual gene_expression are urgently_needed it is straightforward to compute these individual profiles in a matched design where the mixed sample and one pure tissue_sample are obtained from the same individual in a more commonly observed unmatched design where tissue_samples are derived from mixed and pure tissues from different individuals no methods are available to deconvolve these individual profiles yet downstream biomarker analyses depend on the accuracy of these profiles to bridge the gap from current methods to actual applications we propose a statistical_approach for deconvolving mixed cancer transcriptomes demix our method supports the analysis of mixed tissue_samples under four data scenarios with or without reference genes and with a matched or unmatched design here reference genes are a set of genes for which expression_profiles have been accurately estimated based on external data in all constituting tissue_types we anticipate that demix can broaden the investigation of mixed_samples and increase the accuracy of downstream transcriptome_analysis the rest of this article is organized as follows in section we briefly explain the general framework of demix and describe four strategies in detail in section we conduct a simulation_study and a validation study using publicly_available data we provide concluding_remarks and potential extensions of our method in section we have presented a novel statistical_method demix for computational dissection of gene_expression levels from mixed tissue_samples and in particular for microarray_data generated from cancer patient samples our method addresses three existing problems for in silico dissection i model based analysis of raw measured data that follow a log normal instead of a normal distribution ii estimation of both tissue proportions and tissue_specific expression levels and iii reconstitution of patient specific gene_expressions we also provide uncertainty measures on estimated tissue proportions demix provides practical solutions by requiring knowledge of gene_expression of one tissue type which does not have to be matched i e derived from the same sample our solutions vary according to data scenarios to take advantage of all the available information both simulation_studies and analysis of actual data highlight the importance of following a linear mixture of gene_expression levels on data before they are log_transformed for which demix is the first method to do so our validation study showed that demix performs accurately on expression data generated from both affymetrix and illumina platforms our method can be applied to analyzing newly_generated expression data from biomarker_studies as well as to re analyzing data generated from previous_studies our method is useful when there is little information on gene_expression levels in one of the mixing components and at the same time the mixing proportions which could be obtained from other sources such as pathologist estimates or from dna_copy data are not available we do not require knowledge of reference genes however when such knowledge is available we have provided an alternative_solution to take advantage of the information even though our algorithm requires a minimum of one gene as a reference gene we recommend using at least genes to alleviate the potential influence from outliers and to identify an optimal set of s demix uses expression levels from thousands of genes to estimate each and is therefore robust to perturbations in the expression of a minority of genes arising from interaction with surrounding tumor_cells demix can also use a list of selected genes that are not affected by the tumor when available for the estimation of proportions if cell proportions are estimated reliably they can also be used to estimate mean expression levels in both normal and tumor_tissues for potentially perturbed genes based on the linear relationship ax b on raw measured data when reference genes are considered demix performed_similarly or better than pert in estimating tissue proportions with our validation_data supplementary figs s and s our estimation procedure under matched or unmatched samples with reference genes is computationally_efficient on a pc with a ghz intel core i processor the computation of our simulation_data consisting of matched_samples and genes in each sample takes s in contrast it takes min to complete the computation of the same data without knowledge of any reference genes we used the neldermead optimization procedure that includes a numerical integration of the joint density which may explain this substantial increase in computation time demix takes a two stage approach by first estimating thetially expressed genes at varying p value cut_offs bonferroni_corrected using different models the third curve from the top corresponds to comparison between the three pure brain and the three pure liver tissue_samples i s and then estimating the means and variances of gene_expressions based on the i s a joint model that estimates all parameters simultaneously will be able to further incorporate the uncertainty measure of the tissue proportions however the estimation step from such a model can be computationally_intensive and may not be suitable for the analysis of high_throughput data we identified a few considerations for the deconvolution of microarray_data first the assumed linear mixture of data before they are log_transformed may not perfectly hold for some samples e g samples to from the affymetrix data and for some genes e g those with extreme expression values such as or second our estimation method is based specifically on log normal_distributions of the raw measured data for each mixture component when this assumption is violated a deterioration of accuracy is to be expected third microarray_technology has inherent_limitations such as high background_noise and inconsistent gene_expressions across experiments screening out genes with low_expression and accounting for batch_effects must be tackled before deconvolution we found scale normalization using mas can obscure the actual linear mixture of expression levels on which the downstream deconvolution is based summarization using rma together with quantile normalization seemed to retain our linearity assumption of the raw measured data most of the time our model assumes that a mixed sample_consists of at most two cellular_compartments normal and tumor and that the distributional parameters of normal cells can be estimated from other available data these assumptions seem to us to be a logical place to begin but there remain_important situations where more complex modeling may be needed first we assume pure normal samples to be representative of the normal_tissues in the mixture samples allowing for estimation of sample specific expression values this assumption can be violated as there are sometimes perturbations of gene_expression levels in tumorstromal interactions as previously discussed second both normal and tumor_tissues may in turn consist of different cell_types with different transcriptional_activity and represented in proportions that can be variable across samples this has been studied in which used reference profiles from all cell_types extensions of our model to deconvolution of more than two mixture components can address_this without requiring reference profiles from all mixing components and can be done with a more computationally_efficient density integration and optimization procedure currently to identify i s we assume a roughly stable composition of one or multiple cell_types within each tissue component with data from real tissue_samples it is necessary to evaluate the extent to which this assumption is valid the variation in the composition of multiple cell_types from sample to sample will be captured by the variance of the distribution of expression levels within each tissue which is estimated based on the data when there exist multiple tumor_subtypes our method should be applied separately to samples that belong to the same subtype
