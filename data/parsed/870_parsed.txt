cas offinder a fast and versatile algorithm that searches for potential_off of cas rna_guided endonucleases the type_ii clustered regularly interspaced short palin dromic repeats crispr_cas system is an adaptive_immune in prokaryotes protecting host_cells against invading phages or plasmids by cleaving these foreign_dna species in a targeted manner crispr_cas derived rna_guided engineered nucleases rgens enable genome_editing in cultured_cells animals and plants but are limited by off target mutations here we present a novel algorithm termed cas offinder that searches for potential_off in a given genome or user_defined sequences unlike other algorithms currently available for identification of rgen off target_sites cas offinder is not limited by the number of mismatches and allows variations in protospacer adjacent motif sequences recognized by cas the essential protein component in rgens cas offinder is available as a command_line program or accessible via our website availability_and cas offinder free access atgenome editing with engineered nucleases is broadly useful for biomedical_research biotechnology and medicine engineered nucleases cleave chromosomal_dna in a targeted manner and the repair of the resulting double_strand by endogenous systems gives rise to targeted_genome modifications in cultured_cells animals and plants we and others have developed three different types of engineered nucleases zinc_finger nucleases zfns transcription_activator talens and rna_guided engineered nucleases rgens derived from the type_ii clustered_regularly crispr crisprassociated cas system an adaptive_immune in bacteria and archaea unlike zfns and talens whose dna specificities are determined by dna_binding rgens use complementary base_pairing to recognize target_sites rgens consist of i dual rna components comprising sequence invariant tracrrna and sequence variable guide rna termed crrna or single_chain guide rna sgrna constructed by linking essential portions of tracrrna and crrna and ii a fixed protein component cas that recognizes the protospacer adjacent motif pam downstream of target_dna corresponding to guide rna custom_designed rgens are produced simply by replacing guide rnas making this system easy to access unfortunately rgens cleave not only on target_sites but also off target_sites that differ by up to several nucleotides from the on target_sites causing unwanted off target mutations and chromosomal_rearrangements these undesired off target effects raise significant concerns for using rgens as genome_editing tools in diverse applications to address_this researchers must be able to search for potential_off in the genome sequence_alignment tools such as tagscan bowtie or gpgpu enabled cushaw can be used to find potential offtarget sites but are limited by the number of mismatched bases allowed and a requirement for a fixed pam sequence here we introduce a fast and highly versatile off target searching tool cas offinder importantly cas offinder is written in opencl an open standard language for parallel programming in heterogeneous environments enabling operation in diverse platforms such as central_processing units cpus graphics_processing gpus and digital signal processors dsps
