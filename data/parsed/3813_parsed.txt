phylogenetics pyrad assembly of de_novo radseq loci for phylogenetic_analyses motivation restriction siteassociated genomic markers are a powerful_tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the population level but are limited in their utility at deeper phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically recovered across disparate taxa while this limitation stems in part from mutations to restriction recognition_sites that disrupt data generation an additional source of data loss comes from the failure to identify homology during bioinformatic_analyses clustering_methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at assembling radseq loci at the phylogenetic scale results pyrad is a pipeline to assemble de_novo radseq loci with the aim of optimizing coverage across phylogenetic datasets it uses a wrapper around an alignment clustering_algorithm which allows for indel variation within and between samples as well as for incomplete overlap among reads e g paired_end here i compare pyrad with the program stacks in their performance analyzing a simulated radseq dataset that includes indel variation indels disrupt clustering of homologous loci in stacks but not in pyrad such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate taxa i show through re analysis of an empirical radseq dataset that indels are a common_feature of such data even at shallow phylogenetic scales pyrad uses parallel processing as well as an optional hierarchical_clustering method which allows it to rapidly assemble phylogenetic datasets with hundreds of sampled individuals availability software is written in python and freely_available atrestriction siteassociated dna libraries and related genotyping by sequencing_approaches e g gbs take advantage of next_generation to generate short_reads from thousands of potentially homologous loci across multiple_individuals by targeting genomic_regions adjacent to restriction_enzyme cut sites in contrast to whole_genome shotgun data this provides a more efficient and economical source for performing comparisons across many sampled individuals making it a popular tool for population_genetic reviewed in the problem of efficiently obtaining sequence_data across many individuals is also relevant to studies at deeper evolutionary time scales such as genus or family level phylogenetics and it is at this scale that radseq is now receiving increased attention rad sequences generated in silico from multi species genome alignments have been shown to retain accurate phylogenetic_information over evolutionary divergences as deep as million years however to date all empirical radseq studies conducted above the species level were done at much shallower scales still these studies confirm theoretical expectations by demonstrating that concatenated genome aligned or even individual radseq loci are capable of recovering well supported gene_trees and species_trees yet these studies also demonstrate that large_amounts of missing_data are a common_feature of radseq which may limit its applications theoretically the ultimate scale over which radseq data will be recovered and thus phylogenetically useful is inherently limited by mutations that disrupt restriction recognition_sites causing locus dropoutmanifest as more missing_data between more distantly_related samples however empirically such limits are approached much sooner owing to the loss of data to other technical_factors related to data generation and analysis for example the choice of restriction_enzyme the size of selected fragments and variation in sequencing_coverage across samples all affect the number of loci recovered moreover bioinformatic_analyses used to assemble radseq datasets recover different amounts of data depending on the parameters used to identify and cluster orthologs as well as filter for paralogs or repetitive_dna regions in this article i focus mainly on the latter aspect of locus dropout factors_limiting the identification recovery of orthologous loci when they are present in a dataset few programs are currently available to assemble radseq data which currently includes stacks rainbow and rtd here i describe a new software pipeline called pyrad which assembles de_novo aligned radseq loci for populationlevel or phylogenetic_analyses with a particular focus on the analysis of highly_divergent samples pyrad differs from both stacks and rainbow through its use of a global_alignment clustering algorithmperformed with a wrapper around the program usearch which allows for incorporation of indel variation while identifying homology in this way pyrad is more similar to rtd which uses a graph clustering_algorithm that also allows for indels pyrad stands apart from these programs in its speed flexibility for analyzing multiple radseq data types its scalability to extremely_large and divergent datasets and its ease of use below i describe the pyrad pipeline in detail i then demonstrate its performance on simulated and empirical datasets and compare the results with those of stacks which is currently the most commonly used alternative software pyrad performs de_novo of radseq datasets including rad gbs ddradseq and paired_end options it is designed to perform equally well from population to phylogenetic scales and is currently being implemented across this range from linkage analyses among siblings to clade level phylogenies with hundreds of tips a major_goal of this software was ease of use and for this reason it uses common file_formats familiar to those working in phylogenetics and offers a variety of output_formats for downstream_analyses from snp and allelic data to individualor concatenated loci because the software does not need to be compiled pyrad is easy to install on any desktop or computing cluster it does not require large memory_usage and an analysis can be easily split into multiple shorter length jobs through its step_wise execution
