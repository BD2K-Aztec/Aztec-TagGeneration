data_and a new data_mining approach for profiling and categorizing kinetic patterns of metabolic biomarkers after myocardial_injury motivation the discovery of new and unexpected biomarkers in cardiovascular_disease is a highly data_driven process that requires the complementary power of modern metabolite_profiling technologies bioinformatics and biostatistics clinical biomarkers of early myocardial_injury are lacking a prospective biomarker cohort_study was carried_out to identify categorize and profile kinetic patterns of early metabolic biomarkers of planned myocardial_infarction pmi and spontaneous smi myocardial_infarction we applied a targeted mass_spectrometry ms based metabolite_profiling platform to serial blood_samples from carefully phenotyped patients_undergoing alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic_obstructive serving as a human model of pmi patients with smi and patients_undergoing catheterization without induction of myocardial_infarction served as positive_and controls to assess generalizability of markers identified in pmi results to identify metabolites of high predictive value in tandem_mass data we introduced a new feature_selection method for the categorization of metabolic signatures into three classes of weak moderate and strong predictors which can be easily applied to both paired and unpaired samples our paradigm outperformed standard null_hypothesis significance testing and other popular_methods for feature_selection in terms of the area_under and the product of sensitivity_and our results emphasize that this new method was able to identify classify and validate alterations of levels in multiple metabolites participating in pathways associated with myocardial_injury as early as min after pmi due to the rapid progress in mass_spectrometry ms and in the development of related bioinformatics_methods in recent_years novel biomarker_discovery efforts for cardiovascular_diseases are increasingly incorporating ms based profiling of complex biological mixtures such as blood urine or tissue biomarkers have a substantial impact on the care of patients with cardiovascular_disease for example troponin is an accepted diagnostic_marker for myocardial_infarction and b type naturetic peptide aids in diagnosis and prognostication in myocardial_infarction and heart_failure however there are no sensitive and specific early biomarkers of myocardial_injury and therefore the complementary power of modern profiling techniques and emerging bioinformatics_tools are being utilized for the discovery of new biomarkers modern metabolite_profiling to analyze low_molecular analytes such as nucleotides amino_acids organic_acids sugars or peptides is typically performed by nuclear_magnetic or tandem_mass ms_ms technologies in particular targeted ms based platforms using ms_ms coupled with liquid_chromatography lc allow analysis of metabolites with high_sensitivity and structural specificity and thus minimize potentially confounding clinical_variables however such platforms still preclude the analysis of large number of samples from the clinical perspective comparisons of metabolite profiles from quantitative targeted assays in disease versus non disease_states may bring forth novel biomarkers that have the potential to substantially_improve cardiovascular diagnostics and support risk prediction of future life_threatening events
