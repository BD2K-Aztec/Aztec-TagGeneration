seq pathway an r bioconductor_package for pathway analysis of next_generation data seq pathway is an r python wrapper for pathway or functional gene_set of genomic_loci adapted for advances in genome research seq pathway associates the biological_significance of genomic_loci with their target_transcripts and then summarizes the quantified values on the gene level into pathway scores it is designed to isolate systematic disturbances and common biological underpinnings from next_generation ngs_data seq pathway offers bioconductor users enhanced capability in discovering collective pathway effects caused by both coding_genes and cis regulation of non coding elements availability_and the package is freely_available atfunctional gene_set fgsa improves biological interpretability of genomic_features with respect to prior_knowledge and has led to important biological discoveries its power lies in the fact that it detects statistical_significance over an entire dataset of gene_sets and yields biologically_meaningful interpretations recently researchers revealed driver pathways that predispose individuals to disease and shed light on the development of targeted_therapy by performing fgsa on genes proximal to significantly disease associated loci however with the increasing growth of genomic_sequencing measurements noncoding regulatory loci pose a critical challenge to fgsa as nearly of the nucleotides in the human_genome do not code for proteins but instead richly harbor functional regulators of genes gene based fgsa methods neglect non coding regulatory information because they have no readily annotated gene function and cannot be assigned to a specific biological_pathway for example homer hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment a popular tool for discovering cis regulatory_regions before any subsequent fgsa links genomic_loci to only the nearest genes other fgsa algorithms take into account singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps only located in or near coding_genes or exonic mutations sequence derived fgsa regarding the functional impact of not only coding_genes but also non coding regulators is necessary a growing_body supports the strategy of connecting genomic_loci and coding_genes using a many to many mapping and considering long_distance cis regulation first non coding_regions richly harbor functional regulatory_elements in humans second nearly half of the diseaseassociated snps are located in gene deserts third our recent study suggests that a disease associated snp located in an intron could be the enhancer of a neighboring gene rather than of its host gene van den the first sequence derived fgsa method is great the genomic_regions enrichment of annotations tool great quantifies an fgsa score by determining if the total
