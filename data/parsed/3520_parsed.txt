phamdb a web_based application for building phamerator databases phamdb is a web_application which creates databases of bacteriophage genes grouped by gene similarity it is backwards compatible with the existing phamerator desktop software while providing an improved database creation workflow key features include a graphical_user validation of uploaded genbank files and abilities to import phages from existing databases modify existing databases and queue multiple jobs availability_and source_code and installation_instructions for linux windows and mac osx are freely_available at https github com jglamine phage phamdb is also distributed as a docker image which can be managed via kitematic this docker image contains the application and all third_party software dependencies as a pre configured system and is freely_available via the installation_instructions provided phamerator is a tool developed for the purpose of comparing and analyzing bacteriophage phage_genomes allowing the visualization of the genomic mosaicism that characterize phage_genomes phamerator has been an important instrument of analysis for thousands of undergraduate_students participating in sea phages science education alliance phage hunters advancing genomic and evolutionary sciences http seaphages org students and faculty have used phamerator in several publications including a recent comparison of a large number of phages greatly expanding knowledge of bacteriophage diversity and evolution phamerator has largely been used with a single shared database however it does have the ability to connect to other databases as the sea phages program has grown and diversified its approaches for isolating new bacteriophages including using new bacterial hosts there has been an increasing need for faculty and student researchers to create and manage custom phamerator databases tailored to their bacterial host and unique research_questions here we describe phamdb a web_based application which provides an improved workflow for the creation and management ofphamerator databases a phamerator database contains genome information as well as computed information about gene similarity pairwise_comparisons of the predicted amino_acid of genes are used to assign them to families termed phams whole_genome pairwise_comparisons are also made at the nucleotide level computed phams and nucleotide comparisons are stored in a database and phamerator allows researchers to view data and visualizations from this database previously databases for phamerator were created using a series of scripts posing significant barriers to entry to non technical users creating databases this way required comfort with the unix command_line the completion of a number of sequential steps and responding to error messages this required a significant investment of time and troubleshooting sometimes required communication with the researchers who develop and maintain phamerator phamdb eliminates this learning_curve by providing an improved database creation workflow including a web_interface powered by a completely re written database creation engine with a focus on input validation early error_detection graceful error recovery and actionable human_readable error reporting when creating a database the user can upload genbank files or select phages from existing databases genbank files are then checked for the necessary elements and format to be used with phamerator anderror messages for invalid files include a description of the problem and the line number where it occurs the user can deselect uploaded phages or add additional phages before creating a database database creation operations are queued as jobs with one job running at a time this allows researchers to explore different research_questions by queuing several new databases at once rather than having to wait for the first database to be processed before creating another after database construction users can remove or add phages and reconstruct the database instructions for connecting phamerator to the correct server and databases are displayed for the user to copy and paste into phamerator preferences existing databases can be imported as sql files and databases can be exported as sql files for backup purposes
