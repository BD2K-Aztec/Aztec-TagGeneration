data_and ess a c objected oriented algorithm for bayesian stochastic_search model exploration ess is a c implementation of a fully bayesian_variable approach for single and multiple response linear_regression ess works well both when the number of observations is larger than the number of predictors and in the large p small n case in the current version ess can handle several hundred observations thousands of predictors and a few responses simultaneously the core engine of ess for the selection of relevant predictors is based on evolutionary monte_carlo our implementation is open_source allowing community_based alterations and improvements availability c source_code including compilation instructions are available under gnu licence atin recent_years biological_sciences have taken full advantage of rather inexpensive high_throughput new experiments at a systemic level have been conceived to dissect the role of genetic_and in the development of common diseases or the identification of risk_factors for complex phenotypes the dimensions and diversity of available genetic genomics and other omics data_sets pose new theoretical and computational problems requiring multi level data_integration and efficient statistical_analysis tools when the aim is to predict the variation of pathophysiological or complex phenotypes regression_models are widely used in this set up bayesian_variable bvs allows the construction of parsimonious regression_models for high_dimensional adopting prior specifications that translate expected sparsity of the underlying biology and facilitate the interpretation of the results moreover in problems where no single model stands out model uncertainty is taken into account reporting competing_models with their posterior evidence to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as ess is a c implementation of a fully bvs approach for linear_regression that can analyse single and multiple responses in an integrated way whereas other approaches consider one predictor at the time ess performs an efficient_search for combinations of covariates that predict the variation of single and multiple responses like shotgun stochastic_search ess is also designed to work under the large p small n paradigm i e when the number of predictors p is large with respect to the number of observations n thus making fully bayesian_analysis feasible in genetics genomics experiments when the number of predictors is large the multimodality of the model space is a known issue in variable_selection ess explores the p dimensional model space using an extension of parallel tempering called evolutionary monte_carlo that combines markov_chain mcmc and genetic_algorithms specifically ess relies on running multiple tempered chains in parallel which exchange information about set of covariates that are selected in the regression_models since chains with higher temperatures flatten the posterior density global moves between chains allow the algorithm to jump from one local mode to another local moves withinchains permit the fine exploration of alternative_models resulting in a combined algorithm that ensures that the chains mix efficiently and do not become trapped in local modes
