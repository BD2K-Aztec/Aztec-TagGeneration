data_and varsifter visualizing and analyzing exome scale sequence_variation data on a desktop computer varsifter is a graphical software_tool for desktop computers that allows investigators of varying computational skills to easily and quickly sort filter and sift through sequence_variation data a variety of filters and a custom query framework allow filtering based on any combination of sample and annotation_information by simplifying visualization and analyses of exome scale sequence_variation data this program will help bring the power and promise of massively_parallel dna_sequencing to a broader group of researchers availability_and varsifter is written in java and is freely_available in source and binary versions along with a user guide at http research nhgri nih gov software varsifter massively_parallel dna_sequencing are rapidly maturing and are now being applied to a wide_variety of projects of different scales and aims a frequent goal among these projects is to examine inter individual genomic_variation and to correlate this variation with phenotype this approach has proven useful in medical sequencing by identifying causative variants in disease for further examples see although genome_sequencing studies are becoming increasingly practical the use of dna capture technologies e g exome_capture extends the number of samples that can be investigated the large number of sequence_variants that are typically identified in such projects can be daunting for example a single exome sequencing_experiment can lead to the detection of variants while these variant lists can be reduced using custom filtering scripts or command_line filtering programs like gatk this requires significant bioinformatics knowledge these large_datasets therefore present a challenge for those with limited bioinformatics expertise and resources various programs have been written to visualize massivelyparallel dna_sequence and their alignments for review see but are not designed to view or analyze the identified_variants some options for viewing annotated sequence to whom correspondence should be addressed variants are available sva or galaxy but are designed more as analysis packages with limited viewing options and require dedicated high performance workstations or servers recently a probabilistic search tool designed to identify causative variants and genes vaast was described although powerful this analysis tool is designed to identify the genes most likely to be involved in disease not to browse variant data there is a current need for analysis systems that allow investigators to view and manipulate variants identified using nextgeneration_sequencing but that do not require high end computational infrastructure or end_user bioinformatics expertise such systems would be designed with genetic_variation data in mind and would allow the user to apply expert_knowledge in many different ways when deciding how to filter or prioritize the variants allowing for further data_mining possibilities beyond those offered by other tools with static filtering strategies towards that end we have developed a program varsifter that allows researchers to view exome scale sequence_variation and to perform the sorting filtering and searching required to analyze these data for biological_relevance
