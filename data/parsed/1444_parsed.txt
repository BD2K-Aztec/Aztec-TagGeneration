genetics_and diyabc v a software to make approximate_bayesian inferences about population history using single_nucleotide dna_sequence and microsatellite data motivation diyabc is a software_package for a comprehensive analysis of population history using approximate_bayesian on dna polymorphism data version implements a number of new features and analytical_methods it allows i the analysis of single_nucleotide data at large number of loci apart from micro satellite and dna sequence_data ii efficient bayesian_model choice using linear_discriminant on summary_statistics and iii the serial launching of multiple post_processing analyses diyabc v also includes a user_friendly graphical_interface with various new options it can be run on three operating_systems gnu linux microsoft windows and apple os x availability freely_available with a detailed notice document and example projects to academic users atone prospect of current biology is that molecular data will help us to reveal the complex demographic_processes that have acted on natural_populations the extensive availability of various molecular_markers and increased computer power has promoted the development of inferential methods among these novel methods approximate_bayesian abc method is increasingly used to make inferences from large_datasets for complex models in various research_fields including population and evolutionary_biology general statistical_features practical aspects and applications of abc in evolutionary_biology have been reviewed in three recent papers briefly abc constitutes a recent approach to carrying out model based_inference in a bayesian setting in which model likelihoods are difficult to calculate due to the complexity of the models considered and must be estimated by massive simulations in abc the posterior_probabilities of different models and or the posterior distributions of the demographic_parameters under a given model are determined by measuring the similarity between the observed dataset i e the target and a large number of simulated_datasets all raw datasets i e multilocus genotypes or individual sequences are summarized by statistics such as mean number of alleles or f st several abc programs have been proposed to provide solutions to non specialist biologists see also supplementary appendix s developed the coalescent_based software diyabc in which a user_friendly interface helps non expert users to perform historical inferences using abc diyabc allows considering complex population histories including any combination of population divergence events admixture events and changes in past population_size with population samples potentially collected at different times diyabc can be used to compare competing evolutionary_scenarios and quantify their relative support and estimate_parameters for one or more scenarios eventually it provides a way to evaluate the amount of confidence that can be put into the various estimations and to achieve model checking computation in this article we present diyabc v a completely rewritten version of the software diyabc version implements a number of new features and analytical_methods allowing extensive analyses of large molecular datasets including single_nucleotide snp data
