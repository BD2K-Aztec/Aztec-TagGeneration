itagplot an accurate computation and interactive drawing tool for tag density plot motivation tag density plots are very important to intuitively reveal biological_phenomena from capture based sequencing_data by visualizing the normalized read_depth in a region results we have developed itagplot to compute tag density across functional features in parallel using multicores and a grid engine and to interactively explore it in a graphical_user it allows us to stratify features by defining groups based on biological_function and measurement summary_statistics and unsupervised_clustering availability_and http sourceforge net_projects itagplot chip_seq mbd seq and medip_seq are powerful and standard sequencing_technologies to identify transcription_factor binding histone_modification and dna_methylation by counting the number of reads in base resolution i e tag density one of the fundamental analyses is to visualize tag density of sequencing samples on genome_browsers e g the ucsc_genome and igv because tag density reflects the degree of enrichment of biological aspects although such visualizations can clearly show the distribution of tag density in a local region they cannot show the overall distribution of tags around genomic_features to this end several programs and libraries in perl python r and java have been developed cistrome provides correlation_analyses to downstream genome feature association gene_expression and motif_discovery based on galaxy workflow system spark clusters tag density of regions of interest and visualizes a heatmap of clusters or regions very recently ngs plot has been developed for quick mining and visualization of tag density in the command_line however some of them require programming_skills or experience in the command_line some have simple functions to generate plots and do not support various graphical displays and editing flexible grouping fine_tuning of graphical parameters feature identifier conversion or multiple samples as shown in in this article we present itagplot to accurately compute and interactively visualize tag density in a graphical_user like ngs plot itagplot computes and draws the average tag density of all features for each sample in addition itagplot visualizes the tag density of individual_features of interest and groups of features based on quantitative values such as gene_expression dna_methylation cpg density and even quantiles of quantitative values it supports parallel computation using multithreading or a grid engine and allows customizing drawing properties easily in a user_friendly interface given that tag density plots are the mainstay of manuscripts describing epigenomics data based on next gensequencing it is essential for biologists to have access to software that can generate these plots easily
