pred improved methods to predict binding phosphopeptides motivation the family of phosphoprotein binding_proteins regulates many cellular_processes by docking onto pairs of phosphorylated ser and thr residues in a constellation of intracellu lar targets therefore there is a pressing need to develop new prediction_methods that use an updated set of binding_motifs for the identification of new targets and to prioritize the downstream_analysis of potential interactors identified in high_throughput experiments the phosphoprotein binding_proteins interact with many intracellular targets changes in the engagement of s with different sets of target phosphoproteins cause coordinated shifts in cellular behaviour in response to growth_factors and other stimuli s are boat shaped dimers that dock onto specific pairs of phosphorylated ser and thr residues the phosphosite pairs are often located in tandem on the same target protein and are typically amino_acid apart to allow engagement with both docking sites in the central groove of the dimer the s also have strong preferences with respect v c the author published_by
