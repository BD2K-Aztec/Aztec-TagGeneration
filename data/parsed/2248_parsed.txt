phylogenetics hybridnet a tool for constructing hybridization networks motivations when reticulation events occur the evolutionary_history of a set of existing species can be represented by a hybridization network instead of an evolutionary tree when studying the evolutionary_history of a set of existing species one can obtain a phylogenetic_tree of the set of species with high_confidence by looking at a segment of sequences or a set of genes when looking at another segment of sequences a different phylogenetic_tree can be obtained with high_confidence too this indicates that reticulation events may occur thus we have the following problem given two rooted phylogenetic_trees on a set of species that correctly represent the tree like evolution of different parts of their genomes what is the hybridization network with the smallest_number of reticulation events to explain the evolution of the set of species under consideration results we develop a program named hybridnet for constructing a hybridization network with the minimum number of reticulate vertices from two input trees we first implement the o d n time algorithm by whidden et_al for computing a maximum acyclic agreement forest our program can output all the maximum acyclic agreement forests we then augment the program so that it can construct an optimal hybridization network for each given maximum acyclic agreement forest to our knowledge this is the first time that optimal hybridization networks can be rapidly constructed availability the program is available for non commercial use atwhen studying the evolutionary_history of a set of existing species one can obtain different phylogenetic_trees of the set of species by looking at different segments of sequences so given two rooted phylogenetic_trees on a set of species that correctly represent the tree like evolution of different parts of their genomes we want to construct a hybridization network with the smallest_number of reticulation events to explain the evolution of the set of species this problem was proved to be np_hard thus it is challenging to develop programs that can give exact solutions when the two given trees are large or have a large reticulate number showed to whom correspondence should be addressed the relationship between the reticulate number and the number of reticulate vertices in a hybridization network recently several programs have been developed for the problem those programs only output a number or a maximum acyclic agreement forest none of them gives an optimal hybridization network in this article by implementing the o d n time algorithm due to we obtain a program named hybridnet that can construct optimal hybridization networks rapidly
