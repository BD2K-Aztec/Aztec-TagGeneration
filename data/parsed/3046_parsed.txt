modeling mechanistic biological_networks an advanced boolean approach_motivation the understanding of the molecular sources for diseases like cancer can be significantly_improved by computational_models recently boolean_networks have become very popular for modeling signaling and regulatory_networks however such models rely on a set of boolean functions that are in general not known unfortunately while detailed information on the molecular_interactions becomes available in large_scale through electronic_databases the information on the boolean functions does not become available simultaneously and has to be included manually into the models if at all known results we propose a new boolean approach which can directly utilize the mechanistic network information available through modern databases the boolean function is implicitly defined by the reaction_mechanisms special_care has been taken for the treatment of kinetic features like inhibition the method has been applied to a signaling model combining the wnt and mapk_pathway availability a sample c implementation of the proposed method is available for linux and compatible systems throughan important focus in systems_biology are emergent properties of biological_systems properties which arise from the system as a whole and which cannot be explained by looking at individual components alone a common_theme in this evolving field are biological_networks which describe complex relations between biological_entities modeling these networks uncovers the systems behavior as a whole based on the properties and interactions of the contained compounds an important subset of such networks describes mechanistic processes among biochemical species such processes play_an in cellular_metabolism signal transductions and gene_regulation computational_models of these networks have been investigated for a long time a first category of models concentrate on single pathways i e functionally_related parts of the networks with the use of differential_equations schoeberl to whom correspondence should be addressed such models usually yield high_quality predictions of the system dynamics with quantitative information on the molecule concentrations those models however require accurate kinetic_parameters the emergence of large_scale electronic_databases like kegg reactome or the pathway interaction_database pid opened new directions in modeling biological_networks for large models it is often unfeasible to obtain all the necessary kinetic_parameters in such cases so_called structural methods are applied these include elementary_flux flux_balance and petri_nets a further structural method that became very popular in particular for signaling and gene_regulatory are boolean_networks in a boolean_network each compound is represented by a network node and has an associated boolean value this value either represents the existence of a compound i e it is true if the compound is present in a significant concentration and false if not or it represents the activity in the network nodes are connected by edges that represent biochemical_interactions the boolean value of a node is calculated in each step of the algorithm through a boolean function which depends on the boolean values of all inbound nodes usually while the topology of the network is known e g from interaction_databases or qualitative interaction studies the boolean function is unclear one approach is to estimate this function by adapting the model to experimental_data as shown in we introduced a different boolean approach for metabolic_networks the concept of scopes which circumvents this problem here a metabolic reaction is active if all of its substrates are present i e true subsequently all compounds become true for which at least one producing reaction is active hence the boolean function is clearly defined by the topology and is represented by the conjunction and of all substrates of a reaction in signaling and gene_regulatory the situation is more complex in fact there exist different views on these networks a phenomenological view represents experimental_findings like a and c activate and b and d inactivate protein e this view which is similar to the sbgn activity flow page
