data_and rgtsp a generalized top scoring pairs package for class_prediction a top scoring pair tsp classifier consists of a pair of variables whose relative ordering can be used for accurately predicting the class label of a sample this classification rule has the advantage of being easily_interpretable and more robust against technical variations in data as those due to different microarray_platforms here we describe a parallel implementation of this classifier which significantly_reduces the training time and a number of extensions including a multi class approach which has the potential of improving the classification_performance availability_and full c source_code and r package rgtsp are freely_available from http lausanne isb sib ch vpopovic research the implementation relies on existing openmptop scoring pairs are simple twovariables binary classifiers in which the prediction of the class label is based solely on the relative ranking of the expression levels of the two genes the rank based_approach to classification ensures a higher degree of robustness to technical variations and makes the rule easily portable across platforms also the direct comparison of the expression_level of the genes is easily_interpretable in the clinical context making the tsps attractive for medical tests m r m be a vector of measurements e g gene_expression representing a sample and let the corresponding class label be y with two classes denoted by and then for all pairs of variables i and j a score is computed where p are conditional_probabilities estimated from the data and the corresponding decision_rule is if sign s i j x i sign s i j x j then predict y otherwise y the pairs are ordered by the absolute_values of their scores and the top t pairs t are then considered for the final model remarkably training a tsp does not require the optimization of any parameter and does not depend on any threshold selecting a suitable value for t should be done following the usual machine_learning to whom correspondence should be addressed paradigm for optimizing meta parameters see for example shows an example of a tsp predicting the estrogen_receptor the decision boundary in grey is always a line with a slope of
