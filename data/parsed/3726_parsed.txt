programming strategy for efficient modeling of dynamics in a population of heterogeneous cells motivation heterogeneity is a ubiquitous property of biological_systems even in a genetically identical population of a single cell_type cell to cell differences are observed although the functional behavior of a given population is generally robust the consequences of hetero geneity are fairly unpredictable in heterogeneous populations synchronization of events becomes a cardinal problemparticularly for phase coherence in oscillating systems results the present article_presents a novel strategy for construction of large_scale simulation programs of heterogeneous biological_entities the strategy is designed to be tractable to handle heterogeneity and to handle computational_cost issues simultaneously primarily by writing a generator of the model to be simulated we apply the strategy to model glycolytic oscillations among thousands of yeast_cells coupled through the extracellular medium the usefulness is illustrated through i benchmarking showing an almost linear relationship between model size and run time and ii analysis of the resulting simulations showing that contrary to the experimental_situation synchronous oscillations are surprisingly hard to achieve underpinning the need for tools to study heterogeneity thus we present an efficient strategy to model the biological_heterogeneity neglected by ordinary mean field models this tool is well posed to facilitate the elucidation of the physiologically vital problem of synchronization quantitative modeling of the dynamic_behavior of living_systems has to be realistic in terms of both biochemistry and biophysics and in the description of the structural_complexity of living matter compared with equivalent problems in other parts of natural science complexity in biological_systems is increased because structural_elements with similar function e g the cells in a tissue are not completely identical although biological_function seems stable and robust the functional consequences of various kinds of heterogeneity in cellular_systems are rather difficult to predict and are fairly unexplored in the literature this article_describes a new programming strategy aiming to model heterogeneous populations of biological_entities from a modeling perspective cellular_heterogeneity entails a huge increase in the number of parameters and variables as i diversity among cells is introduced by allowing kinetic_parameters to vary even for systems with identical metabolic_networks where kinetic expressions and the species are the same for all cells and ii the chemistry in each individual cells is described through unique sets of corresponding species most reactions of a metabolic_network are composite reactions where rates may depend on several elementary rate_constants and or stationary concentrations varying from cell to cell the programming strategy has been designed to produce code that is computationally effective and at the same time manageable for the programmer this is accomplished by writing a code generator program which automatically generates c code from descriptions of cell interactions the metabolic_network and the kinetic_parameters the strategy handles spatial as well as temporal models and allows for easy change of scale and of chemical_composition the strategy was developed to study the dynamics of oscillatory_behavior in a population of heterogeneous cells notably usual mean field models per definition neglect the problem of intercellular_signaling and synchronization vital for biological_function which are at the heart of the presented strategy the modeling is illustrated through the classical example of metabolic oscillations in a stirred suspension of yeast_cells first studied by in this system thousands of modeled cells are coupled by exchange of chemical_species through a common extracellular_environment a model of a single_cell embedded in a cell solution is used as an illustrative example the strategy allows for the generation of a large number of cells each with distinct properties the overall compartments and reaction_network are given in because the system easily can be scaled up to a very large system ordinary_differential odes we briefly discuss powerful features to speed up computations we illustrate the usefulness of the strategy by analyzing and comparing the resulting model_simulations using various methods the yeast system is a particular simple example of an interacting cellular system glycolytic oscillations within individual cells give rise to oscillations in the concentrations of extracellular species if extracellular oscillations can synchronize the individual cells the whole system will be phase_locked in an oscillatory state this is precisely what is observed in the experimental system simulating systems of cells on the basis of two wellestablished kinetic_models however did not produce in phase oscillations even with periodic forcing with extracellular acetaldehyde aca x the results show that realistic kinetic_models of a large population of heterogeneous oscillators are sometimes surprisingly hard to synchronize thus it underpins the need for this type of modeling to facilitate understanding of the physiologically vital synchronization process in populations of cellular oscillators the main_result in this article is the python code that generates the c code to be compiled and run see supplementary_information to illustrate the power of the proposed programming strategy we also include some basic run time figures our basic test runs included heterogeneity in all v max values of enzymatic_reactions with an sd of relative to the value of v max see below as these parameters are heterogeneous among cells simulating an experiment of min corresponding to consumption of mm dissolved glucose shows that runtime scales almost linearly with system size a novel strategy for construction of temporal or spatio_temporal large_scale models of heterogeneous biological_entities has been presented the strategy was illustrated by modeling a single cell_type in a stirred suspension but coupled cells of different types could be modeled by the same principle the strategy is particularly well suited to study synchronization processes in heterogeneous_cell large models of coupled cells tend to be stiff and have off diagonal couplings in their jacobians however the present strategy is flexible enough to allow for system specific implementations of user_defined processing to enhance run time performance simulations of yeast_cells in two recent models of yeast cell oscillations showed that the sensitivity of the core glycolytic oscillator onmost likely is too weak in the models to allow for globally synchronized oscillations
