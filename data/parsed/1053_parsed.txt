structural_bioinformatics comment on 'protein protein binding_affinity prediction from amino_acid sequence' predicting the strength of interactions between globular_proteins is a central and important topic in structural_bioinformatics the amino_acid represents the chemical bonding in a protein which along with the solvent dictates how it folds into an ensemble of thermally accessible states in turn structure specifies the strength and identity of its binding_partners by establishing the specific arrangements of intermolecular_interactions and the intramolecular strain required to achieve them in a recent paper yugandhar and gromiha claim to be able to circumvent this and predict proteinprotein binding_affinities directly from sequence with astounding accuracy in this letter we highlight that feature_selection by stepwise_regression is applied without employing an information criterion y scrambling or regularization and the method is not validated using an outer cross_validation loop or external validation_set the reported energy_functions contain many terms that are functionally unrelated to binding the reported prediction_errors are significantly_lower than experimental_errors in the training_set and variations due to environmental_factors when an external test_set is used predicted affinities have a correlation of approximately zero with experimental_data
