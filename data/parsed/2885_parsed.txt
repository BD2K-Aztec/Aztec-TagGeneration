genome_analysis metaabc an integrated metagenomics platform for data adjustment binning and clustering metaabc is a metagenomic platform that integrates several binning tools coupled with methods for removing artifacts analyzing unassigned reads and controlling sampling_biases it allows users to arrive at a better interpretation via series of distinct combinations of analysis tools after execution metaabc provides outputs in various visual formats such as tables pie and bar charts as well as clustering result diagrams availability metaabc source_code are available atmetagenomics is a field that involves sampling sequencing and analyzing the genetic_material of unculturable microorganisms in microbial_communities while maintaining their physiological_conditions in habitats large_amounts of metagenomic_datasets have been accumulated for analysis in these years through the rapid advancement of sequencing_technology one of the main focuses in metagenomics is the comparative_study of metagenomes based on microbial compositions and diversities that are obtained by binning binning assigns sequences to phylogenetic_groups according to their taxonomic origins recently many binning tools such as megan phymmbl sort items and discribinate were developed to achieve_higher binning accuracy as the above binning methods become widely used some data adjustment methods have lately been proposed to improve metagenomic_data analysis for example it is known that pyrosequencing produces artificial duplicated reads andindicated that removing
