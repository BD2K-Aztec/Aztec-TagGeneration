detection and interpretation of metabolite transcript coresponses using combined profiling data motivation studying the interplay between gene_expression and metabolite_levels can yield important information on the physiology of stress_responses and adaptation strategies performing transcriptomics and metabolomics in parallel during time series experiments represents a systematic way to gain such information several combined profiling datasets have been added to the public_domain and they form a valuable resource for hypothesis generating studies unfortunately detecting coresponses between transcript_levels and metabolite abundances is non trivial they cannot be assumed to overlap directly with underlying biochemical_pathways and they may be subject to time delays and obscured by considerable noise results our aim was to predict pathway comemberships between metabolites and genes based on their coresponses to applied stress we found that in the presence of strong noise and time shifted responses a hidden_markov based similarity outperforms the simpler pearson_correlation but performs comparably or worse in their absence therefore we propose a supervised method that applies pathway_information to summarize similarity statistics to a consensus statistic that is more informative than any of the single measures using four combined profiling datasets we show that comembership between metabolites and genes can be predicted for numerous kegg_pathways this opens opportunities for the detection of transcriptionally regulated_pathways and novel metabolically related genes availability a command_line software_tool is available atchanges in metabolite abundances are the first molecular_events that follow shifts in an organisms environment as the steady_state of metabolism is broken gene_expression changes to reestablish homeostatic_control and to adapt the system to the altered living_conditions this interlocking regulation between gene_expression and metabolite_levels manifests in intricate patterns of coresponses where metabolite and transcript_levels alternately vary consistently with the behavior of both regulators and targets therefore the elucidation of metabolite and transcript coresponses can yield important_clues to the consequences of to whom correspondence should be addressed altered environmental_conditions on the biochemical level as well as to the organisms coping_strategies from the perspective of biotechnology knowing which genes affect metabolite_levels is crucial for metabolic_engineering since metabolism cannot whereas gene_expression can be altered directly consequently many studies using metabolomics and transcriptomics in parallel have been performed to monitor development e g and stress_responses e g in time series experiments the datasets from this type of experiments are now a valuable resource with the potential to fill similar needs as the widely_applied gene coexpression databases e g for hypothesis generating research transcripttranscript tt correlations that derive from genes coding for enzymes that catalyze nearby reactions are stronger than correlations that derive from genes that catalyze metabolically distant reactions when the system is not at steady_state abundances of neighboring metabolites also tend to be correlated this observation was used to approximate the glycolysis pathway from metabolite abundance measurements the inverse relationship between metabolitemetabolite mm correlations versus pathway distance was recently shown to manifest also on the omics level during heat and cold stress_responses in escherichia_coli although interpreting mm correlations is far from straightforward metabolitetranscript mt correlations are arguably even more multifaceted first since enzymes influence the reaction speed metabolically driven correlations are more intuitive between transcripts and metabolite fluxes than for the more easily_measured abundances second correlations are not expected for metabolites that are rapidly consumed by subsequent reactions third other modes such as post_translational appear to be more common for regulating enzyme_activity than transcription however there are many other reasons for correlations between metabolites and transcripts that do not derive from the underlying biochemical_pathway in a review ladurner described several mechanisms in which metabolites can tune gene_expression they include riboswitches direct_interactions with transcription_factors regulation of cofactors chromatin_remodeling chromatin_modification and hormone_signaling in plants the last is arguably the best known since hormones play_central in nearly all stress_responses and developmental programs with these considerations in mind it becomes clear that mt correlations may take many forms exhibiting various degrees of noise time lags and conditionality on the studied response seefor examples therefore to detect such coresponses usingpage i i i in the glucosinolate gls synthesis_pathway during sulfur deficiency a atst a catalyzes a late step in the synthesis of indolylmethylgls and its transcript is positively correlated with the reaction_product b cyp f and mam catalyzes aliphatic gls synthesis from methionine that appear anticorrelated with isoleucine also a precursor for aliphatic gls via a pathway that shares enzymes with the methionine aliphatic gls pathway c sur catalyzes a later step in aliphatic gls synthesis and appear correlated with methylthiobutyl gls at a positive time lag combined profiling data methods that can handle these issues and deliver interpretable results are needed we presented an approach for detecting coresponses between metabolites and transcripts using combined profiling time series data in previous_studies the direct or lagged pearson_correlation was used for identifying such patterns but as demonstrated by our simulations this approach does not work well for short time series with strong noise and time lagged responses our hmmbased similarity measure performed well also in this most degenerate scenario but as expected not better than the pearson_correlation in the more favorable scenarios in general both mm and tt correlations are expected to decrease with increasing distance in the underlying metabolic_pathways by looking at differences in the correlations between cognate and non cognate transcript and metabolite pairs we could reproduce earlier_findings with the co dataset for tt and mm correlations and for mm correlations with the sulfur datasets however different from we could not see a dependency between metabolic distance and mt correlations for any of the studied datasets regardless of the used measure circumstances such as differences in experiment designs and analytical platforms may be causative of this discrepancy possibly since a thaliana is a much more complex organism than yeast it could also show less obvious dependency on the pathways that have been deciphered primarily in single_cell organisms nonetheless with the inevitably high number_of among pairwise_correlations we contend that coresponses on the level of whole pathways are both more likely to be detectable and easier to interpret in actual stress_response data we saw similar tendencies as in our simulation pearson was better at detecting direct clear responses and hmm was better at more complex patterns d in combined profiling data we both expected and saw many types of coresponses between metabolites and transcripts however the nature of these responseslagged or direct noisy or clearis not enough for judging their relevance because they have many possible origins each with its own expected pattern therefore we propose to combine different types of measures and then to summarize them by looking at a set of true associations as guiding examples this approach worked well the combined hmm pearson methods were best for predicting pathway comemberships between the metabolites and transcripts on all four datasets the richness of the interplay between metabolism and gene_expression requires attentiveness when interpreting observed patterns while direct coregulation is conceptually possible pleiotropic and indirect causes are presumably more likely however observed coresponses may still be informative for understanding the perception of stress and the events that follow on a molecular level we presented three examples of this i in plant stress_responses photosynthesis is strongly downregulated to avoid the production of detrimental reactive_oxygen while metabolism undergoes largescale changes with decreasing energy_production the atp_adp drops and free phosphate levels increase these are the same patterns we observe under cold_stress and sulfur deficiency however under conditions of elevated co which may initially be beneficial to the plant the photosynthesis rate increases and consequently phosphate levels start to decrease this pattern was also detected with our approach although it is overloaded by circadian rhythmic expression ii oas is a key metabolite in sulfur assimilation and also a member of the cytokinin zeatin synthesis_pathway cytokinins themselves are well known repressors of sulfur uptake the observation of a strong increase in atckx expression before the increase in the oas levels may therefore be a manifestation of upregulated sulfur transport and of changes that follow sulfur assimilation the coresponses in the glucosinolate synthesis_pathway discussed bywere also clearly detected in both root and shoot datasets supplementary figs s and s pathway iii during elevated co conditions as the expression of photosynthesis genes increases carbon_assimilation also changes as it is a central_metabolism pathway metabolites involved in starch and sucrose synthesis show complex behavior but our method still highlighted coresponses between them and related transcripts interestingly both the pearson_correlation and hmm consensus statistics were informative here but completely orthogonal furthermore the opls da model prioritizes different metabolites highlighting that different types of coresponse patterns are present and that pearson and hmm complement each other predicted mt associations by combining several stress_response datasets using a bayesian_approach as that methodology was based on the use of pearson_correlations and does not handle time lags it would profit from the incorporation of the coresponse statistics proposed here the presented photosynthesis example indicates that combining datasets may be useful also in our case however this appeared to be more of an exception than a rule since the significant pathways overall differed strongly between different datasets supplementary figs s s furthermore as a difficulty in combining datasets from completely different experiments there typically is a very small overlap of the detected metabolites for example only seven metabolites were measured in all the datasets we studied moreover combining data will only capture mt coresponses in pathways affected in the majority of the studied stress_conditions this may worsen predictions for stress specific metabolitetranscript associations extrapolation of the predictions with additional sources of biological data as shown with atpin indicates the power of the methodology for finding de_novo associations one interesting future aspect is the inclusion of further interaction data for validation purposes and integrative_analysis moreover we are currently developing a web_tool over an expanded collection of datasets that includes genome_wide predictions of mt associations
