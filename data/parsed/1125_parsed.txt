systems_biology computing autocatalytic sets to unravel inconsistencies in metabolic_network reconstructions motivation genome_scale reconstructions have been established as a powerful_tool for the prediction of cellular_phenotypes and metabolic_capabilities of organisms in recent_years the number of network reconstructions has been constantly increasing mostly because of the availability of novel semi_automated procedures which enabled the reconstruction of metabolic_models based on individual_genomes and their annotation the resulting models are widely used in numerous applications however the accuracy and predictive_power of network reconstructions are commonly limited by inherent inconsistencies and gaps results here we present a novel method to validate metabolic_network reconstructions based on the concept of autocatalytic sets autocatalytic sets correspond to collections of metabolites that besides enzymes and a growth_medium are required to produce all biomass components in a metabolic model these autocatalytic sets are well conserved across all domains of life and their identification in specific genome_scale reconstructions allows us to draw_conclusions about potential inconsistencies in these models the method is capable of detecting inconsistencies which are neglected by other gap finding methods we tested our method on the model seed which is the largest repository for automatically generated genome_scale network reconstructions in this way we were able to identify a significant number of missing pathways in several of these reconstructions hence the method we report represents a powerful_tool to identify inconsistencies in large_scale metabolic_networks availability_and the method is available as source_code onin recent_years genome_scale reconstructions have become an important tool in systems_biology they have the strong potential to combine distinct experimental_data with bibliomic resources to generate a comprehensive knowledge_base the resulting network reconstructions have been widely used to simulate metabolic_processes or to explore the metabolic_capabilities of various species a prominent approach applying network reconstructions is constraint_based such as flux_balance fba the use of metabolic_models and associated methods has granted access to diverse scientific subjects such as analysis of the bacterial_metabolism the prediction of growth_rates of escherichia_coli the comparison of growth_rates between wild_type and mutant_strains of e coli and metabolic_engineering until recently the process of network_reconstruction was timeconsuming and necessarily required laborious curation effort to cope with the increasing amount of available data automated methods became necessary to produce high_throughput reconstructions as well several approaches are available to address_this the model seed project successfully implemented one of these approaches and contains metabolic reconstructions which were primarily generated in an automated way however the automated process may neglect metabolic_capabilities of the focal organism or include wrongly identified functionalities to minimize this bias manual refinement and optimization are instrumental in the reconstruction_process representing the most intricate elements in the workflow to accelerate model curation automated and semi_automated methods for the detection and correction of gaps were developed and integrated in the automated reconstruction_process by the model seed gapfind and gapfill the most common approach used to identify gaps in network reconstructions is constraint based to whom correspondence should be addressed in conclusion asbig is an efficient method for detecting inconsistencies in existing genome_scale reconstructions the method facilitates network validation and automated gap_detection in primary_metabolism contributing considerably to the quality_improvement of metabolic_models asbig combines the conceptual approaches of autocatalytic metabolites and scope analysis thereby allowing to test network reconstructions for their integrity for each investigated metabolic model a minimal seed set of metabolites which provides access to all fundamental metabolic_pathways is computed putative flaws of the model can be deduced directly from identified minimal seed set the benefit of asbig was demonstrated by investigating different metabolic_models in the closely examined models numerous kinds of errors could be identified including i missing reactions ii missing pathways or iii gaps caused by insufficient knowledge of metabolic_processes furthermore not only single gaps in individual models were identified but also common flaws simultaneously present in several network reconstructions could be detected in a large screen of network reconstructions in contrast to the commonly_applied gap finding approach i e deriving putative gaps from the calculated flux_distributions asbig is a simple method and detects other types of inconsistencies hence the application of asbig contributes significantly to model refinement and validation representing a complementary_approach to existing gap finding methods
