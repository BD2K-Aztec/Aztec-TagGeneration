sequence_analysis medips genome_wide differential coverage analysis of sequencing_data derived from dna enrichment experiments motivation dna enrichment followed by sequencing is a versatile_tool in molecular_biology with a wide_variety of applications including genome_wide analysis of epigenetic_marks and mechanisms a common requirement of these diverse applications is a comparison of read_coverage between experimental_conditions the amount of samples generated for such comparisons ranges from few replicates to hundreds of samples per condition for epigenome_wide consequently there is an urgent need for software that allows for fast and simple processing and comparison of sequencing_data derived from enriched dna results here we present a major update of the r bioconductor_package medips which allows for an arbitrary number of replicates per group and integrates sophisticated statistical_methods for the detection of differential coverage between experimental_conditions our approach can be applied to a diversity of quantitative sequencing_data in addition our update adds novel functionality to medips including correlation_analysis between samples and takes_advantage of bioconductors annotation databases to facilitate annotation of specific_genomic availability_and the latest_version of medips is available as version and part of bioconductor the package comes with a manual containing detailed_description of its func tionality and is available atdna enrichment_methods are widely used for genome_wide identification of many different kinds of epigenetic_marks these techniques_include chromatin_immunoprecipitation for localizing transcription_factor or for revealing the genomic distribution of different histone_modifications methylated_dna immuno precipitation medip and methyl_cpg mbd protein capture are similar techniques but target the enrichment of dna_fragments containing methylated_cytosines similarly hydroxymethylcytosines can be detected by antiserum specific to cytosine hydroxymethylenesulfate cms after treatment with sodium_bisulfite it can be expected that further affinity methods will be developed for immunoprecipitation ip of known or novel kinds of epigenetic_marks to provide a general framework for efficient genomewide differential coverage analysis of ip sequencing_data we have improved the user_friendly medips package in contrast to the previous version the medips update is capable of processing an arbitrary number of replicates or samples per condition furthermore medips now integrates an elaborated statistical_framework developed for the digital nature of count_data which includes a model for biological_variation across replicates and has greatly_reduced runtime and memory_requirements to demonstrate the functionality of the medips package we processed recently_published medip_seq data that was generated to assess genome_wide epigenetic changes in mouse intestinal adenoma for this study differential_methylation was inferred for the sample groups by calculating wilcoxon rank tests for the normalized count values reads per million rpm of each window differentially_methylated dmrs were determined by applying filters for p values minimal coverage and ratios here we process the same data but by using the presented medips package version the commented r script showing the function calls of this analysis can be found in the supplementary_material from the five adenoma and seven normal control mouse samples m medip_seq reads were uniquely mapped to the mouse reference_genome ncbi mm using bowtie of which remain after replacing reads with the same position and orientation by one representative the saturation analysis indicates sufficient sequencing_depth and the cpg coverage indicates an effective medip enrichment seeand supplementary figs s and s comparison of the normalized relative methylation score values with bisulfite validation showed a good overall correlation of with a set of bisulfite validation assays previously performed byon the same genomic samples seeand supplementary the edger test for differentially_methylated finds dmrs p which correspond to of the genome correction_for leads to regions at false_discovery fdr shows the methylation logfc versus average log methylation ma plot dmrs are depicted as orange points p and red crosses fdr the result table containing the dmrs can be found in supplementary table s about of the dmrs identified byoverlap with the dmrs identified by medips a detailed comparison between the two approaches can be found in the supplementary_material although the overall number of hypo and hypermethylated regions is balanced preferential hypermethylation was found in functionally_important subgenomic regions such as promoters and cpg islands in particular cpg rich promoters showed a substantial enrichment of hyper over hypomethylation see the identification of cpg rich promoters as preferential targets for hypermethylation may provide important leads for further wet_lab for instance the analysis can be
