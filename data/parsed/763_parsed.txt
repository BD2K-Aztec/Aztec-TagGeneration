genetic and population analysis biomercator v an upgrade of genetic_map compilation and quantitative_trait meta_analysis algorithms compilation of genetic_maps combined to quantitative_trait qtl meta_analysis has proven to be a powerful approach contributing to the identification of candidate_genes underlying quantitative_traits biomercator was the first software offering a complete set of algorithms and visualization_tool covering all steps_required to perform qtl meta_analysis despite several limitations the software is still widely used we developed a new version proposing additional up to date methods and improving graphical_representation and exploration of large_datasets availability_and biomercator v is implemented_in and freely availableintegration of multiple independent qtl_mapping experiments is of major interest to unravel genetic_factors underlying complex_traits as a first step a consensus map is built from independent qtl maps and if available the organism reference_map qtls are then projected onto the consensus map and subjected to metaanalysis as a result meta qtls and mapped genes lie on the same consensus map greatly simplifying the inventory of candidate_genes in addition the confidence_interval ci of a meta qtl is often shorter than ci of corresponding qtls decreasing the number of candidate_genes to consider or the extent of fine_mapping to conduct in a survey of flowering time traits in maize meta qtls were identified including one corresponding to vgt which was subsequently cloned in the predicted region by fine_mapping as map compilation and qtl meta_analysis are not based on genotyping raw_data or trait measure they can be easily achieved from maps available from the literature or databases the biomercator software offers a complete set of analysis and visualization_tools dedicated to these approaches and is widely used but suffers several limitations we propose here a major upgrade of the software to overcome algorithm and graphical_user limitations map compilation can now be achieved in a single step whatever the number of maps there is no limitation to the number of meta qtl per chromosome and the code and qtl overview curve all traits right map c meta_analysis output meta qtl are drawn within chromosome and qtl ci is colored according to the probability of its belonging to meta qtls an enlarged region is displayed on the right along the full chromosome the dataset used is maize maps collected by traits are silking date brown days to pollen shed black and plant_height orange some regions and occupy a really large space impairing whole map representation to address such cases a new qtl track summarizing qtl data along the chromosomes has been developed basically this track is a curve depicting qtl density that may be weighted or not by r iii for whole map representation each chromosome can be enlarged independently at the user convenience in order to focus on regions of interest by default for a lighter display only a randomly_selected set of loci is represented at whole chromosome scale by zooming in progressively more loci are displayed however an option forcing the display of all loci is available datasets as well as analysis output may be exported in several formats tabulation delimited text_file xml either whole_genome map or single chromosome can be exported in jpeg png or the useful svg vectorial format allowing image editing in dedicated third_party software
