genepainter v resolves the taxonomic distribution of intron_positions conserved intron_positions in eukaryotic_genes can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic_trees to resolve ambiguous subfamily relationships in protein_families and to infer the history of gene_families this version of genepainter facilitates working with large_datasets through options to select specific_subsets for analysis and visualization and through providing exhaustive statistics genepainters application in phylogenetic_analyses is considerably extended by the newly implemented integration of the exonintron pattern conservation with phylogenetic_trees availability_and the software along with detailed documentation is available atthe rapid_growth of sequenced eukaryotes increasingly allows incorporating exonintron pattern information into phylogenetic_analyses conserved intron_positions have helped resolving the relationship of taxonomic lineages and have also extensively been used to reveal subfamily relationships within larger gene_families and to reconstruct ancient genes because the early eukaryotes were rather intron rich and the gene structure evolution towards the extant_species was dominated by intron loss events considerable taxonomic and sequence sampling is necessary to reconstruct the gene structure history of a gene or gene_family across the eukaryotic tree of life for example mammals and plants are known to have intron rich genomes while most unicellular organisms are intron poor however although the yeast_saccharomyces is known to contain only introns in total the yeasts dynein light_chain lc coding_region is split by two introns other ascomycetous fungi contain even up to seven introns while the human lc orthologs only contain a single intron in general intron gain events are rare and are most often recent events existing_tools for the comparison of gene structures like exalign cida ciwog geca and genepainter compare exon lengths or map intron_positions to positions in multiple amino_acid msa however none of the tools integrates gene structure conservation with taxonomic and phylogenetic_tree information here we present a new version of our genepainter software v which maps intron_positions onto the multiple_sequence and assigns intron gain_and to taxonomic branches and extant_species
