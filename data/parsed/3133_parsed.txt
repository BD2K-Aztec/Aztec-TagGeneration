genome_analysis mtoolbox a highly automated pipeline for heteroplasmy annotation and prioritization analysis of human_mitochondrial variants in high_throughput motivation the increasing availability of mitochondria targeted and off target sequencing_data in whole exome and whole_genome studies wxs and wgs has risen the demand of effective pipelines to accurately measure heteroplasmy and to easily recognize the most functionally_important mitochondrial variants among a huge number of candidates to this purpose we developed mtoolbox a highly automated pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mito chondrial dna from high_throughput sequencing_data results mtoolbox implements an effective computational strategy for mitochondrial_genomes assembling and haplogroup assignment also including a prioritization analysis of detected variants mtoolbox provides a variant_call file featuring for the first time allele specific heteroplasmy and annotation files with prioritized variants mtoolbox was tested on simulated samples and applied on genomes wxs datasets availability_and mtoolbox package is available at https sourceforge net_projects mtoolbox emerging discoveries in human_mitochondrial genetics driven by the advent_of have revealed that individuals exhibit a complex_mixture of mitochondrial genotypes and carry low_level heteroplasmic variants on the other hand the deeper the sequencing_coverage the higher the number of mitochondrial_dna mtdna variants and the variety of heteroplasmic ranges found per individual in this frame the deep_sequencing of mtdna raises the demand of effective pipelines to accurately measure heteroplasmy and to easily recognize the most functionally_important variants among a huge number of candidates to this purpose we developed mtoolbox a highly automated bioinformatics pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mtdna from high_throughput hts_data the mtoolbox workflow includes a computational strategy to assemble mitochondrial_genomes from whole_exome wxs and or whole_genome wgs_data which was further updated to detect insertions_and ins dels and to assess the heteroplasmic fraction hf of each variant allele with the related confidence_interval ci reported as sample specific meta_information in an enhanced version of the variant_call vcf file version the mtoolbox pipeline analyzes the reconstructed genomes for haplogroup assignment and variant_prioritization
