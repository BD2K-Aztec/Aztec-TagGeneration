sequence_analysis comparative_analysis of algorithms for next_generation read_alignment motivation the advent_of ngs techniques presents many novel opportunities for many applications in life_sciences the vast number of short_reads produced by these techniques however pose_significant computational challenges the first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short_reads to a reference_genome and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software_packages to perform this function as the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations the relative_merits of different software_packages remain_unclear however for scientists who generate and use ngs_data for their specific research_projects an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application results with a view to comparing existing short_read software we develop a simulation and evaluation suite seal which simulates ngs runs for different configurations of various factors including sequencing_error indels and coverage we also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure e g some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments using these criteria we comprehensively evaluate the performances of bowtie bwa mr and mrsfast novoalign shrimp and soapv with regard to accuracy and runtime conclusion we expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research_aims our results also provide insights into the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively seal can also be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep sequencing_data for various purposes e g identification of genomic_variants availability seal is available as open_source at http compbio case edu seal next_generation techniques are demonstrating promise in transforming research in life_sciences these techniques support many applications including metagenomics detection of snps and genomic structural_variants in a population dna_methylation studies analysis of mrna_expression cancer_genomics and personalized_medicine some applications e g metagenomics require de_novo sequencing of a sample while many others e g variant detection cancer_genomics require resequencing for all of these applications the vast amount of data produced by sequencing runs poses many computational challenges in resequencing a reference_genome is already available for the species e g the human_genome and one is interested in comparing short_reads obtained from the genome of one or more donors individual members of the species to the reference_genome therefore the first step in any kind of analysis is the mapping of short_reads to a reference_genome this task is complicated by many factors including genetic_variation in the population sequencing_error short read_length and the huge volume of short_reads to be mapped so_far many algorithms have been developed to overcome these challenges and these algorithms have been made available to the scientific_community as software_packages currently available software_packages for short_read include bowtie soap bwa mrfast mrsfast novoalign and shrimp in this article we assess the performance of currently available alignment_algorithms with a view to i understanding the effect of various factors on accuracy and runtime performance and ii comparing existing algorithms in terms of their performance in various settings for this purpose we develop a simulation and evaluation suite seal that simulates short_read runs for a given set of configurations and evaluates the output of each software using novel performance_criteria that are specifically_designed for the current application our results show significant differences in performance and accuracy as quality of the reads and the characteristics of the genome vary in the next section we briefly describe the alignment_algorithms that are evaluated in this article subsequently in section we describe the simulation suite implemented in seal and our performance_criteria in detail page as expected these alignment tools are designed with different approaches to trading off speed and accuracy to optimize detection of different types of variations in donor genomes this trade_off is evident in the performance of bwa and soap on the human_genome without a threshold value to eliminate unreliable reads bwa is not as accurate even at low_error at a base_pair substitution_rate of and falling sharply to at an error_rate of soap has a consistently high_accuracy even with no threshold and high_error based on these observations we can conclude that bwa is specifically_designed not to miss any potential mappings at the cost of reporting many incorrect mappings the evaluation of mrfast mrsfast and shrimp shows some expected trends since each fragment is potentially mapped to many locations in the genome we expect their strict accuracy value to be much lower than that of other tools as the error_rate increases from to however we see the strict accuracy measure increase for all three of these tools intuitively this seemingly surprising trend makes sense since we expect the number of potential genome mappings to decrease as the reads become less reliable thus reducing the number of incorrect mappings in relation to the single potential correct mapping these tools relaxed accuracy values as defined in section also show some expected trends since mrfast and mrsfast can report many genome locations for each fragment we expect their relaxed accuracy to be quite high for low_error and to decline as the error_rate increases we must emphasize the large difference between our relaxed and strict accuracy_measures in our evaluation of mrfast mrsfast and shrimp the relative usefulness of these two measures depends on the users specific research_aims one may be more interested in tools with good relaxed accuracy if studying structural_variants while strict accuracy may be of more use in genotyping snps we must also note that our analysis may not be fair to shrimpthis tool is designed for mapping color_space reads and our simulation does not generate this type of data as expected the tools show an overall linear relationship between coverage number of reads and the total runtime for most alignment tools we can further separate the total runtime into separate measurements for indexing and alignment if the index can be reused across multiple_alignment runs a high indexing time can be affordable we believe that our results will be useful to a wide_variety of genomic researchers though we must recognize that we cannot precisely simulate all experimental scenarios or sequencing hardware characteristics as the state of the art advances data from new sequencing hardware may challenge the assumptions that todays high_performing algorithms depend on similarly algorithms with unfavorable accuracy or speed on todays data_sets may find renewed use in the future
