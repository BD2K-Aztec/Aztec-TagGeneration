systems_biology amigo a toolbox for advanced model identification in systems_biology using global optimization motivation mathematical_models of complex_biological usually consist of sets of differential_equations which depend on several parameters which are not accessible to experimentation these parameters must be estimated by fitting the model to experimental_data this estimation problem is very challenging due to the non linear character of the dynamics the large number of parameters and the frequently poor information content of the experimental_data poor practical identifiability the design of optimal more informative experiments is an associated problem of the highest interest results this work presents amigo a toolbox which facilitates parametric identification by means of advanced numerical techniques which cover the full iterative identification procedure putting especial emphasis on robust_methods for parameter_estimation and practical identifiability analyses plus flexible capabilities for optimal_experimental availability the toolbox and the corresponding documentation may be downloaded from http www iim dynamic modeling and simulation are becoming standard_approaches to understand complex_biological model identification is at the core of model_building and involves the computation of unknown non measurable parameters by means of experimental_data fitting however parametric identification is a bottleneck in the modeling process due to mainly the frequently ill possed and multimodal nature of the associated optimization_problems and the poor practical identifiability due to lack of information in the available experimental_data the use of suitable optimization_methods to avoid local solutions has been illustrated during the last decade by many authors and some of these methods have been incorporated in software_tools such as copasi sbtoolbox potterswheel or senssb rodriguez these software_packages allow the dynamic simulation and analysis of systems_biology models including methods for sensitivity analysis and to whom correspondence should be addressed parameter_estimation and in some cases some basic facilities for experimental planning here we present the result of our research_efforts in the development of procedures to improve practical identifiability and to help in the design of informative experiments the underlying idea is to help the system biologist on how to stimulate and observe the system for the purpose of model identification
