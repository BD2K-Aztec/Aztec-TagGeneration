databases_and ecogene refseq ecogene tools applied to the refseq prokaryotic_genomes ecogene org is a genome_database and website dedicated to escherichia_coli k substrain mg that is revised daily using information derived from the biomedical_literature and in house analysis ecogene is a major source of annotation updates for the mg genbank record one of only a few genbank genome records that are updated by a community effort the reference_sequence refseq database built by the national_center comprises a set of duplicate genbank genome records that can be modified by the ncbi staff annotators ecogene refseq is being developed as a stand alone internet resource to facilitate the usage of ecogene based tools on any of the completed prokaryotic_genome records that are currently available at the refseq database availability the web_interface of ecogene refseq is available atnew sequencing_technologies have significantly_increased the volume of genomic sequence_data that are being generated the ncbi refseq collection is a curated sequence database providing a comprehensive non redundant and annotated set of sequences representing naturally_occurring dna rna and proteins included are taxonomically diverse sequences from plasmids organelles viruses archaea bacteria and eukaryotes the escherichia_coli k mg genome was the third sequenced_genome and is represented by the genbank u complete genome record which has been extensively revised since its original submission ecogene was developed to maintain display query and document the revised genome and proteome sequences and annotations ecogene is the modern version of the historical e coli k genetic_maps a suite of customized tools has been developed for ecogene providing functionality that is unavailable elsewhere we are now making these tools available for viewing and retrieving genomic maps and sequences for any prokaryotic genome_sequence through ecogene refseq the applications ported from ecogene to ecogene refseq include i primerpairs a tool for automatically designing genome_wide sets of primers to engineer either a clone_library or a deletion strain library ii search and download a search interface for querying and downloading gene information iii genepages web_pages displaying individual genes as well as dynamic gene maps and restriction_sites maps for genome navigation and iv cross reference mapping and download a tool for accessing many additional gene identifiers ecogene refseq is powered by the open_source content management platform drupal and supported by a mysql_database all data stored in the ecogene refseq mysql_database are faithfully parsed from refseq for efficient retrieval refreshed monthly to reflect annotation changes of the genomes currently there are bacterial_genomes and archaeal genomes in the ecogene refseq database ecogene refseq is developed to facilitate the usage of a set of tools available at ecogene with any prokaryotic_genome in the future we can add capabilities into ecogene refseq including manual_curation tools enabling an individual or interested group to build and re annotate an ecogene like database for any prokaryotic_genome
