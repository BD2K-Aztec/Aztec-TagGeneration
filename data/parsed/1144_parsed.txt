conspred a rule_based re annotation framework for prokaryotic_genomes motivation the rapidly_growing number of available prokaryotic genome_sequences requires fully_automated and high_quality software solutions for their initial and re annotation here we present conspred a prokaryotic genome_annotation framework that performs intrinsic gene predictions homology_searches predictions of non coding_genes as well as crispr repeats and integrates all evidence into a consensus annotation conspred achieves comprehensive high_quality annotations based on rules and priorities similar to decision_making in manual_curation and avoids conflicting predictions parameters controlling the annotation_process are configurable by the user conspred has been used in the institutions of the authors for longer than years and can easily be extended and adapted to specific needs summary the conspred algorithm for producing a consensus from the varying scores of multiple gene prediction programs approaches manual_curation in accuracy its rule based_approach for choosing final predictions avoids overriding previous manual curations during the two decades since the sequencing of the first bacterial_genomes the annotation of prokaryotic genome_sequences has become a routine task going along with the rapid_growth of public_databases this trend will further speed up due to recent improvements in metagenomics which enabled the reconstruction of near complete_genome of low abundant microbial community_members high_quality annotation of genome_sequences is essential in all areas of genome research and most important for comparative_genomics and functional_genomics compared to automatic tools the manual_annotation achieves significantly better results however high_costs and time constraints limit this strategy to few model_organisms or the annotation of very unusual or taxonomically novel genomes e g the vast_majority of genome_sequences in public_databases have been annotated using automatic software without expert curation a variety of software_tools which implement different gene and function prediction_approaches have been developed the annotation of prokaryotic_genomes stored in primary sequence archives is thereby based on methodological choices by the authors and the particular time of submission re annotation of genome_sequences is therefore crucial e g in comparative_genomics or re sequencing v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com projects to avoid artifacts due to technical inaccuracies public pipelines e g discussed in standardization of annotation strategies and re annotation has now also been addressed by the ncbi refseq project in addition to public resources limited in capacity and flexibility e g also locally applicable tools for the re annotation of prokaryotic_genomes are needed ideally these should incorporate all relevant types of evidence for structural and functional_annotation such as i intrinsic prediction of coding_sequences ii homology_based prediction of coding_sequences and their function iii structure sequence_based prediction of non coding rna genes and iv specific prediction of complex features such as crispr repeats several programs have been developed for this purpose e g differing in their utilization of different evidence types and their strategy for decision_making the authors of consorf have demonstrated that consensus gene prediction using hierarchical rules allows for fully_automatic high_accuracy identification of prokaryotic genes for large_scale re annotation of prokaryotic_genomes this concept needed to be further extended to non coding_genes complex features and functional_annotation furthermore according to the high computational costs of sequence_similarity based_approaches re annotation software should be able to utilize highperformance or cloud_computing facilities for these purposes we have developed conspred which facilitated numerous of our genome_sequencing and comparative_genomics projects during the last years e g conspred is a flexible software framework for fully_automatic integrative and comprehensive re annotation of prokaryotic_genomes conspred runs on a single linux computer or in a linux grid computing system the database files for conspred are updated monthly and can be downloaded from http fileshare csb univie ac at conspred data gb in conspred allows independent customization for each annotation run depending on the genome_size and the computational_resources the annotation takes few hours to several days without user intervention we used the well curated genome of escherichia_coli k mg to demonstrate the conspred annotation compared to selected other annotation platforms the majority of genes are consistently annotated by all of the four platforms most pseudogenes are annotated in the refseq record resulting from human curation rast and conspred additionally predict short genes a consequence of their lower minimal orf length setting only conspred and rast provide kegg annotations and conspred also includes eggnog assignments indicates that conspred provides a comprehensive genome_annotation regarding types of genetic_elements and functional_annotations further details and data for additional genomes with varying g c content and assembly completeness are shown in supplementary tables s and s conspred is primarily useful for the annotation of finished genome_sequences or high_quality genome drafts e g for submission to public_databases and for genome re annotation in comparative_genomics and functional_genomics projects of prokaryotes the refseq accession of the e coli k mg strain used in the overview is nc both conspred and prokka were executed with default_settings furthermore the customizability of the software framework makes conspred a valuable toolbox for evaluating and optimizing
