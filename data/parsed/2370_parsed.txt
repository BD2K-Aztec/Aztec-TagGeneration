structural_bioinformatics improved predictions by pcons net using multiple_templates multiple_templates can often be used to build more accurate homology_models than models_built from a single_template here we introduce pconsm an automated protocol that uses multiple_templates to build protein models pconsm has been among the top performing methods in the recent casp experiments and consistently perform better than the single_template models used in pcons net in particular for the easier targets with many alternative templates with a high degree of sequence_identity quality is readily improved with a few percentages over the highest ranked model built on a single_template pconsm is available as an additional pipeline within the pcons net protein_structure server accurate_predictions of protein_structures are important as we will never have access to experimental_structures for the vast_majority of proteins while high_quality experimental_structures are extremely_important homology_modeling techniques are widely_applicable much cheaper and can be applied on genomic_scale a wide_array of methods for protein_structure exists both stand alone software such as modeller and nest or available as web_servers the performance of different methods is assessed biannually through the community_wide casp experiment among other things casp has highlighted the importance of consensus based_approaches to the structure prediction_problem the oldest such method is pcons the creation of pcons was inspired by the successful consensus predictions made by the cafasp team at casp pcons has been among the topperforming automated predictors since casp and the top model_quality program in both casp and the pcons method is available as a web_server at http pcons net where users can upload their protein_sequences and obtain consensus predictions one limitation in pcons net is that it is based on single_template models while it is well accepted that the use of multiple_templates readily can improve the quality of models however one problem when using multiple_templates to whom correspondence should be addressed is that sometimes the different alignments contain contradictory information which results in convergence problems here we show that pconsm on average improve the models with a few percentage_points within the popular pcons net protein modeling web_server the benefits of pconsm are several primarily the qualities of the models appear on average to increase somewhat secondly the use of multiple_templates frequently leads to larger coverage of the target_sequence which means that less free modeling is necessary the throughput of pcons net detailed in is not affected by pconsm an initial model is obtained within a few minutes and the final model is achieved within h for the majority of targets
