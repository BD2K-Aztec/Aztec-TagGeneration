drugcomboranker drug_combination discovery based on target network_analysis motivation currently there are no curative anticancer_drugs and drug_resistance is often acquired after drug treatment one of the reasons is that cancers are complex_diseases regulated by multiple signaling_pathways and cross_talks among the pathways it is expected that drug_combinations can reduce drug_resistance and improve patients outcomes in clinical practice the ideal and feasible drug_combinations are combinations of existing food_and drugs or bioactive_compounds that are already used on patients or have entered clinical_trials and passed safety tests these drug_combinations could directly be used on patients with less concern of toxic_effects however there is so_far no effective computational_approach to search effective drug_combinations from the enormous_number of possibilities results in this study we propose a novel systematic computational_tool drugcomboranker to prioritize synergistic drug_combinations and uncover their mechanisms of action we first build a drug functional network based on their genomic_profiles and partition the network into numerous drug network communities by using a bayesian non_negative approach as drugs within overlapping community share_common mechanisms of action we next uncover potential targets of drugs by applying a recommendation system on drug communities we meanwhile build disease specific signaling_networks based on patients genomic_profiles and interac tome data we then identify drug_combinations by searching drugs whose targets are enriched in the complementary signaling modules of the disease signaling_network the novel method was evaluated on lung_adenocarcinoma and endocrine receptor positive breast_cancer and compared with other drug_combination approaches these case studies discovered a set of effective drug_combinations top_ranked in our prediction list and mapped the drug_targets on the disease sig naling network to highlight the mechanisms of action of the drug_combinations availability_and the program is available on request cancers are complex_diseases regulated by interactions of multiple signaling_pathways interacting with each other though there are some anticancer_drugs they are often not curative and associated with acquired_drug it is believed that a single drug can target only one disease signaling module whereas alternative signaling_pathways will be activated to maintain tumor development for example in melanoma the selective braf inhibitor plx can induce tumor responses in the majority of patients with braf v e mutant melanoma but the duration of this response is limited owing to the development of acquired_resistance which may be due to alternative_pathways parallel to the braf mek_erk signaling_pathway to reduce the drug_resistance effect and improve cancer treatment outcomes drug_combinations are considered as an optimal option the ideal drug_combinations expected by clinicians are combinations of food_and fda_approved or existing bioactive_compounds that have entered clinical_trials and passed safety tests these drug_combinations could be used by patients without toxic side_effects drug_combination prediction has been a challenging_task in computational_biology despite a few studies in the area the genetic_algorithm was for example proposed to find the optimal combinations of a small number of drugs based on the experimental_results the method however is not able to identify optimal drug_combinations from a large set of drugs as it requires experimental validations in the prediction process the machine_learning based_approach was proposed to classify drugs into combinations based on molecular and pharmacological features of drugs however the features of drugs are too general to be informative and the method does not integrate the rich genomic_profiles of drugs and disease into consideration combinatorial drug assembler cda was developed to identify drug_combinations based on enrichment_analysis of genomic profile data however the enrichment_analysis implemented in the method is based on differentially_expressed disease driver_genes are not clearly defined so that drugs targeting the causal dysfunctional signaling modules of disease maybe missed out to overcome the aforementioned problems we propose a novel computational_tool drugcomboranker for predicting drug_combinations targeting_multiple signaling modules of cancer specific networks through integrative_analysis of genomic_profiles of both drugs and cancers to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be

the parameters in the analysis we set a as one of and b to be equal to a when a and b are set to be the bnmfd algorithm will converge more quickly under this setting of a and b we test the drug

assign the number from to to each drug community and obtain the drugtarget networks by connecting the drugs in the same community through their targets the connected drugtarget networks provide us a useful way to drug_discovery
