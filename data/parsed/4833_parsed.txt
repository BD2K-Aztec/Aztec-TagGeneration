utilizing the jaccard_index to reveal population_stratification in sequencing_data a simulation_study and an application to the genomes_project motivation population_stratification is one of the major sources of confounding in genetic_association potentially causing false_positive here we present a novel approach for the identification of population_substructure in high_density genotyping_data next_generation data the approach exploits the co appearances of rare genetic_variants in individuals the method can be applied to all available genetic_loci and is computationally fast using sequencing_data from the genomes_project the features of the approach are illustrated and compared to existing methodology i e eigenstrat we examine the effects of different cutoffs for the minor_allele on the performance of the approach we find that our approach works particularly well for genetic_loci with very small minor_allele the results suggest that the inclusion of rare_variant data sequencing_data in our approach provides a much higher_resolution picture of population_substructure than it can be obtained with existing methodology furthermore in simulation_studies we find scenarios where our method was able to control the type error more precisely and showed higher power availability_and contact dmitry prokopenko uni bonn dein genetic_association the importance of population_substructure admixture and its potentially negative impact on the analysis results have long been recognized numerous methods have been designed to detect population_substructure and adjust genetic_association so_far almost all methods implicitly assumed that the extract the information about population_substructure from the variance_covariance of genotype data the approaches have been shown to be efficient and are able to guard genetic_association under most circumstances with the arrival of next_generation data rare_variants i e genetic_loci with small minor_allele are moving to the center of the genetic_association the hypothesis is that rare_variant sequencing_data will enable the direct identification of disease susceptibility_loci which genome_wide have not been very successful at although availability of rare_variant sequence_analysis holds_great the effects of population_substructure admixture on the association analysis of rare_variants are unclear and suitable adjustment methods have not been discussed widely in the literature the effectiveness of existing adjustment approaches which are mostly built on the estimation of the genetic_variance covariance_matrix is unclear for rare_variants since the estimation of the allelic covariance based on rare_variants might not provide sufficient power this expected power_loss can be attributed to the low variance of rare_variant genotypes and thus the covariance_matrix can be unreliable for small allele_frequencies e g it is suggested to use snps with common allele_frequencies for the eigenstrat approach moreover the key feature of rare_variant data in terms of population_substructure is that such variants are genetically much younger the mutations that originated rare_variants have occurred much more recently than those of common_variants allowing rare_variant data to reflect even relatively new admixture substructure it is therefore unclear whether the application of adjustment methods when they are computed based on common_variants is a suitable way to control for population_substructure admixture in rare_variant in this article we propose a method that is designed to detect population_substructure admixture both in rare_variant data and in common_variant data instead of utilizing the genetic_variance covariance_matrix the jaccard similarity_index is used among existing similarity_measures the jaccard similarity_index is most suitable for the similarity calculation based on sparse binary_data since it emphasizes mutual presences of minor alleles in comparison to identity by state similarity measure the jaccard_index has the advantage that it doesnt account for snps where a pair of individuals shares a genotype which is very efficient in a sparse dataset with only rare_variants we recommend when available to exclude potentially associated variants from the population_structure estimation if no such information is available we recommend to include all rare_variants in the analysis in fact rare_variants typically do not show strong linkage_disequilibrium with other rare or common_variants this is particularly due to their low minor_allele if the sample_size is marginal and the sample contains only variants with very small allele_frequency excluding some long_range ld regions can reduce the resolution of population_structure however if the jaccard_index is applied to common_variants we recommend to apply ld pruning on the common_variants prior to analysis the approach has the advantage that it can be applied to all available genetic_loci and it is computationally fast we have implemented a c program which takes the genotype matrix and the position file as input and produces the jaccard similarity matrix between individuals the application to the complete dataset of the genomes_project individuals variants with maf on one processor with gb ram running under linux took only h first we assess the performance of our approach by application to the genomes_project phase data a comparison of the results with existing methodology suggests that our approach provides better discrimination between subpopulations than current methodology the approach seems to work particularly well when we restricted the method to rare_variant loci in simulation_studies we evaluate the type error of our approach and compare it to eigenstrat which uses pca based on the genetic covariance_matrix for completeness we include in the simulation_studies a model_based admixture which uses a likelihood model to estimate population_structure under different scenarios the proposed methodology preserves the type error much better next_generation data is becoming highly available and numerous methods have been developed to study the association of variants with low minor_allele with complex_traits however the fact that rare_variants might represent different patterns of population_stratification is currently underestimated recently several consortia genomes uk k showed that variants with a very low minor_allele often cluster within one population those variants might represent younger_population specific mutations and hence can be utilized for population_structure correction in rare_variant tests we propose an approach for the detection of population_substructure in sequencing_data that utilizes the information about co appearances of the minor alleles between individuals the attractive features of the approach are its computational speed and its capability to expose population_substructure with higher_resolution within sequence_data than standard methodology it requires no removal of long_range ld regions when the dataset contains only rare_variants the approach can be seen as a modification of the eigenstrat approach in which the genetic covariance_matrix is replaced by the jaccard similarity matrix consequently existing methodology can be used to guard association tests against confounding due to population_substructure for example the principal_components based on the jaccard similarity matrix can be included into the association analysis as covariates or into the conditional sampling_approach for rare_variant several studies assessed the population_structure in rare_variants by applying standard pca based on genetic covariance data zhang et_al showed that including multiple classical pcs based on variants with low minor_allele might lead to power_loss overestimation in association analysis they also showed that classical pca when applied to variants with maf is sensitive to outliers and hence isnt effective in separating subpopulations we confirm this in left panel here the second pc is driven by the largest variance of the sparse individual genotypes based on rare_variants our method based on jaccard similarity matrix was specifically_designed to detect population_stratification based on variants with small minor_allele we can see that due to sparsity of datasets with rare_variants standard covariance based methods_fail to detect population_structure given the imminent arrival of large_scale whole_genome wgs studies there is a urgent need for methods that account for population_structure in datasets with rare_variants we evaluated our approach by simulation_studies and by application to the genomes_project data our empirical evidence_based on the application to the genomes_project data and simulation_studies suggests that the proposed methodology provides a finer resolution picture of population_substructure than existing methodology the simulation_studies show that our method is able to achieve equal or higher power in most of the simulated scenarios while maintaining the type error under the nominal level overall our method did not lose the power when increasing the number of principal_components included in the analysis in comparison the classical pca this is an important feature for real_data analysis with big sample_sizes
