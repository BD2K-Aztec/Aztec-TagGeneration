genetics_and a system for exact and approximate genetic_linkage of snp data in large_pedigrees motivation the use of dense single_nucleotide snp data in genetic_linkage of large_pedigrees is impeded by significant technical methodological and computational challenges here we describe superlink online snp a new powerful online system that streamlines the linkage_analysis of snp data it features a fully integrated flexible processing workflow comprising both well known and novel data analysis tools including snp clustering erroneous data filtering exact and approximate lod calculations and maximum_likelihood haplotyping the system draws its power from thousands of cpus performing data analysis tasks orders_of than a single computer by providing an intuitive_interface to sophisticated state of the art analysis tools coupled with high computing capacity superlink online snp helps geneticists unleash the potential of snp data for detecting disease genes results computations performed by superlink online snp are automatically parallelized using novel paradigms and executed on unlimited number of private or public cpus one novel service is large_scale approximate markov chainmonte carlo mcmc analysis the accuracy of the results is reliably estimated by running the same computation on multiple cpus and evaluating the gelmanrubin score to set aside unreliable results another service within the workflow is a novel parallelized exact algorithm for inferring maximum_likelihood haplotyp ing the reported system enables genetic_analyses that were previously infeasible we demonstrate the system capabilities through a study of a large complex pedigree affected with metabolic_syndrome availability superlink online snp is freely_available for researchers atgenetic linkage_analysis is a statistical_method for locating disease susceptibility_genes by finding patterns of excess co segregation between a genetic_marker and a phenotype of interest in a pedigree this method is recently gaining newfound interest thanks to the rapidly_growing availability of high_throughput sequencing_data bailey namely linkage_analysis of large_pedigrees can be better powered and more cost_effective than genome_wide for discovering rare_variants it has recently been shown that genetic_linkage can be performed using single_nucleotide snp genotypes extracted from sequencing_data demonstrating the necessity of efficient tools capable of analysing snp data in large_pedigrees existing packages that perform exact linkage_analysis such as liped linkage mendel fastlink genehunter vitesse o superlink merlin and allegro use either the elstonstewart algorithm the landergreen algorithm or a combination thereof while these packages have been successfully used for exact genetic_linkage of moderately sized families they are not suitable for analysing dense snp data in large_pedigrees owing to the high_computational of the aforementioned algorithms several approaches have been proposed to circumvent the high_complexity of linkage_analysis in large_pedigrees one approach is to split a large pedigree into several smaller easier to analyse pedigrees but this can result in significant power_loss another wellestablished approach is the approximate analysis of large to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com pedigrees through markov chainmonte carlo mcmc available in packages such as loki morgan and simwalk the main_drawback of mcmc methods is the lack of a reliable accuracy measure for which there is no general analytical analysis other approaches include estimating identical by descent regions heuristically or by observing each marker separately but an exact method for analysing dense snp data in large_pedigrees using the full pedigree_information is still lacking the analysis of dense snp data in large_pedigrees also necessitates suitable interoperable software_tools for manipulating bulky raw snp data while several snp data manipulation packages have been developed in recent_years e g snp hitlink easylinkage plus igg mega and snpp none is tightly integrated with a software_package capable of parallelizing linkage_analysis tasks across a multitude of cpus superlink online snp provides a comprehensive and easy to use solution for both computational and technical_challenges posed by linkage_analysis of snp data in large_pedigrees first the system makes extensive use of modern distributed computing technologies which provide both performance and functional_improvements impossible otherwise the exact linkage_analysis is sped up by using thousands of cpus in parallel superlink online snp uses novel methodologies to reduce the amount of computations required for a single analysis by up to a fold and uses a computer grid times larger than we reported before resulting in up to three orders_of analyses superlink online snp also parallelizes the approximate linkage_analysis of an arbitrary number of markers and pedigree members using the morgan software importantly the parallel infrastructure enables us to improve the practical utility of this analysis by providing a reliable accuracy estimate through the well established gelmanrubin gr statistic finally the system uses daoopt a novel parallel algorithm for maximum_likelihood haplotyping analysis yielding two orders_of analysis than previously_reported for demanding pedigrees second the system presents a simple intuitive and secure web_interface fully integrating these powerful data analysis services with a set of pre_and processing_tools for preparation and filtering of snp data and presentation of the results all the tools are designed to be used in succession where one may invoke each tool on the output received from another tool notably the system records the full history of every data artifact it produces thus enabling users to reconstruct all the processing_steps that led to a given result and easily reproduce the results when necessary all the input_data as well as the analysis results can be readily downloaded and entirely removed from the superlink online snp web_site by providing an intuitive_interface to sophisticated state_ofthe tools executed on thousands of cpus superlink online snp enables the computation of a variety of analyses that were infeasible before and helps geneticists exploit the full potential of snp data for detecting disease genes
