oncodriverole classifies cancer_driver in loss of function and activating mode of action motivation several computational_methods have been developed to identify cancer drivers genesgenes responsible for cancer development upon specific alterations these alterations can cause the loss of function lof of the gene_product for instance in tumor_suppressors or increase or change its activity or function if it is an oncogene distinguishing between these two classes is important to understand tumorigenesis in patients and has implications for therapy decision_making here we assess the capacity of multiple gene features related to the pattern of genomic_alterations across tumors to distinguish between activating and lof cancer_genes and we present an automated approach to aid the classification of novel cancer drivers according to their role result oncodriverole is a machine_learning based_approach that classifies driver_genes according to their role using several properties related to the pattern of alterations across tumors the method shows an accuracy of and matthews correlation_coefficient of classifying genes in the cancer gene census the oncodriverole clas sifier its results when applied to two lists of predicted cancer drivers and tcga derived mutation and copy_number features used by the classifier are available atresearch in cancer_genomics has identified hundreds of genes involved in different stages of tumorigenesis due to specific somatic events single_nucleotide and large_scale amplifications and deletions of chromosomal_regions have been identified as two of the main driver alterations in human tumors the genes suffering these alterations are traditionally classified as oncogenes_and depending on their role in cancer development when the product of tumor_suppressors lose their function tumor_cells tend to proliferate faster driver alterations in these genes frequently exhibit a recessive behavior the loss of function lof can be achieved through truncating or missense_mutations dna deletions or hypermethylation of their promoters some known lof genes most notably brca_and carry germline variants that increase the susceptibility to develop a tumor because only one hit is required to inactivate their function oncogenes on the other hand increase or change their function upon somatic variants in tumorigenesis therefore their mode of action follow a dominant pattern as one faulty copy of the gene is frequently enough to provide the required phenotype a copy_number gain may exponentiate the oncogenic_function of the gene a point_mutation may achieve the same result by changing key_amino which results in constitutive_activation of the protein or produce a new biochemical function these special cases are also regarded as activating driver_mutations as the new function is gained much like in the case of classic oncogenes the cancer gene census cgc is a regularly updated compilation of well studied cancer_genes which classifies their mode of action as dominant or recessive following the oncogene tumor_suppressor paradigm lof and act activated hereafter the cgc contains some genes implicated in cancer this is a rather small fraction of the genomes in the human_genome international human_genome but recent largescale re sequencing_projects of tumor_genomes suggest many additional genes may be involved in tumorigenesis one important first step in the analysis of datasets of cancer_genomics alterations is the identification of the genes that drive tumorigenesis this is a non trivial problem because tumor_samples contain up to thousands of somatic alterations the list of genes altered in tumors is heterogeneous even within the same cancer type therefore the difficult_task is to distinguish between driver and passenger alterations the most intuitive way to identify driver_genes is to detect signals of positive_selection across tumor_samples because cancer cell_populations undergo a selection process during the progression of the disease different methods that aim to identify driver_genes tackle different evidences to achieve their goal two recent efforts to comprehensively identify driver_genes across large cohorts carried_out by combining several signals of positive_selection detected respectively and likely driver_genes although years of experimental work have revealed the role of most well known cancer_genes now our capability of detecting drivers has surpassed our capacity to probe their mode of action thus revealing the mode of action of driver_genes in tumorigenesis is becoming crucial to fully understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis this is essential for the development of new targeted_cancer because as a general rule only act drivers are in principle susceptible to targeted_drugs although exceptionally some mutated tumor_suppressors may be targeted e g to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

bioinformatics approaches to make this classification as accurately as possible vogelstein et_al recently described the so_called rule to detect tumor_suppressor and oncogenes based on their mutational pattern across tumor_samples it states that genes with truncating_mutations are tumor_suppressors whereas genes with of missense_mutations in recurrent positions are oncogenes while it correctly detects and classifies most of the well known cancer_genes the rule fails to identify drivers included in newer catalogs mostly the lowly recurrent ones building upon the same idea davoli et_al developed a machine_learning approach to directly identify tumor_suppressor and oncogenes from the somatic alterations observed across cohorts of tumor_samples through their mutational and copy_number patterns many cancer drivers are recognized correctly by carefully selected_features we recently_proposed a strategy to obtain a comprehensive list of drivers minimizing the probability of detecting false_positive by combining complementary_methods that detected different signals of positive_selection once a list of high_confidence drivers hcds is obtained it is important to classify those in their mode of action to this aim we first carefully assessed the capability of features to differentiate between these two groups of cancer_genes then we combined different sets of features with various classification algorithms to create several automated classifiers we trained these classifiers with cgc genes and after careful check of their performance we selected a random_forest algorithm that achieves an accuracy acc of which we call oncodriverole it is the first freely_available automatic classifier that undertakes the task of assessing the mode of action of driver_genes used in this setting it may shed light upon the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in major cancer_types we have used it to classify the two previously mentioned lists of mutational drivers that have been recently_published namely hcds and cancer and describe the results of this analysis two main rationales to detect lof and act driver_genes acting across tumor_samples exist the first approach consists in directly detecting genes that exhibit known alterations patterns corresponding to these two classes from mutations and cna data this strategy was first conceptualized byto be implemented later on as a machine_learning algorithm by in the second approach first driver_genes acting in tumor_samples are detected by combining the signals of positive_selection they exhibit then in a second step these drivers are classified into the two aforementioned classes exploiting similar alteration patterns as in the first approach this second two step approach has two main advantages first genes that do not exhibit clear alterations pattern that define them as lof or act can still be detected as drivers if they show clear signals of positive_selection second the combination of several signals controls the ratio of false_positive drivers identified which is unattainable to the direct classification of genes this is the reason why we have decided to develop oncodriverole a machine_learning classifier which takes a list of pre selected driver_genes and sorts them according to their mode of action we first carefully compared and selected a set of features that best captures the differences of alterations patterns of these two groups of drivers we then used those features to train the classifier on a carefully trimmed subset of the cgc genes when applied to two recent lists of drivers we found that even under strict classification conditions oncodriverole was able to classify more drivers than the rule and the tuson machine_learning algorithm the oncodriverole validation procedure identified several likely misclassified drivers in the cgc the most salient examples of these are probably some genes that drive hematopoietic_malignancies upon translocation and fusion with other genomic_regions all classified as dom in the gcg however when analyzed using mutational and cnas data from the pancancer dataset some of them appear as clear lof drivers for instance oncodriverole assigns mll runx and suz classification probabilities under see supplementary tables s s for feature and classification values these genes could be act drivers upon fusion to other genes but lof upon mutations even though oncodriverole is able to classify most of the genes in the two drivers lists as lof or act it still leaves few of them unclassified some of these correspond to lowly recurrent drivers whose mutational features are not correctly computed because of the scarcity of their alterations sequencing more tumors will certainly improve their classification others may not have a clear enough pattern to be classified in one of the two classes as they could be exhibiting different roles in different contexts in some rare cases the method misclassifies known cancer_genes for example keap is classified as an act driver although it is reported to lose its function upon mutation a close look at its mutational pattern reveals missense_mutations dominate and accumulate in certain regions of the protein as member of a ubiquitin mediated proteolysis complex the function of keap is probably essential to the cell and its impairment is likely lethal therefore few truncating_mutations may appear in keap and it is ultimately misclassified by oncodriverole future finer measurements of the impact of missense_mutations may help correcting this problem summing up in this article we have described the development and validation of oncodriverole an approach to differentiate between lof and act driver_genes the oncodriverole classifier is freely_available bg upf edu
