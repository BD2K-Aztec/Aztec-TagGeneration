how threshold behaviour affects the use of subgraphs for network comparison motivation a wealth of proteinprotein_interaction ppi data has recently become available these data are organized as ppi_networks and an efficient and biologically_meaningful method to compare such ppi_networks is needed as a first step we would like to compare observed networks to established network models under the aspect of small subgraph counts as these are conjectured to relate to functional_modules in the ppi_network we employ the software_tool graphcrunch with the graphlet degree_distribution agreement gdda score to examine the use of such counts for network comparison results our results show that the gdda score has a pronounced dependency on the number of edges and vertices of the networks being considered this should be taken into account when testing the fit of models we provide a method for assessing_the of the fit between random graph models and biological_networks based on non parametric tests using this method we examine the fit of erdsrnyi er er with fixed degree_distribution and geometric d models to ppi_networks under these rigorous tests none of these models fit to the ppi_networks the gdda score is not stable in the region of graph density relevant to current ppi_networks we hypothesize that this score instability is due to the networks under consideration having a graph density in the threshold region for the appearance of small subgraphs this is true for both geometric d and er random graph models such threshold behaviour may be linked to the robustness and efficiency properties of the ppi_networks recent_advances in experimental science and in literature mining techniques have generated a considerable amount of proteinprotein_interaction ppi data from several organisms these interactions are often integrated to form networks which can help put the proteins into their functional and physiological context a reliable and efficient method for large network comparison would be very useful such a comparison may yield mechanistic and evolutionary insights help to identify missing links and even aid network validation for those organisms where experimental_data are scarce a first step is to establish a method for network comparison with well studied random_network models current ppi_networks are unfortunately still very incomplete and rife with noise von they tend to have a to whom correspondence should be addressed large_number and false_negatives these obscure meaningful conclusions and offer challenges to robust_methods of analysis network comparison is also a computationally difficult_task because typical ppi_networks are relatively large e g saccharomyces_cerevisiae already has about binary ppis in the dip database depending on the aspect under which networks are to be compared short lists of summary_statistics are often used classical summary_statistics used include the degree_distribution the mean path_length and the clustering_coefficient seefor an overview and many more summary_statistics here we compare networks based on small subgraphs since cell_biology is thought of as modular many pathways and feedback_loops are inherently seen as detachable modules while it has been shown that network_motifs alone do not determine function in general there is the possibility of a close connection between subgraphs and biological functionality our aim is to compare biological_networks and random graph models under the aspect of similar subgraph counts such subgraph counts were introduced bywith the aim of detecting over represented small subgraphs they compared counts for connected node subgraphs in real_world networks to those of certain random networks and called those patterns network_motifs see alsofor a review counting small connected subgraphs in large ppi_networks is computationally_demanding moreover the number of possible subgraphs of n nodes increases exponentially with n e g for n we have two differently connected subgraphs and for n disregarded the frequency subjacent to the definition of motifs and counted connected induced subgraphs with nodes which they call graphlets a subgraph s of g is said to be induced if it contains all the edges that appear in g over the same subset of nodes for example the only induced subgraphs of a triangle are edges methods have also been developed to count and node graphlets used a combinatorial colour coding technique to count up to node non induced subgraphs arguing that these are more relevant to compare the incomplete and noisy networks currently available to combine the distributions that result from these graphlet counts the so_called relative graphlet frequency rgf distance and the graphlet degree_distribution agreement gdda have been suggested the rgf distance identifies all subgraphs with nodes in two networks and compares the frequency of their appearance while the gdda statistic defines node specific permutation groups called automorphism orbits within each of the nodes possiblepage i i i
