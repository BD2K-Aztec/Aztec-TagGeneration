structural_bioinformatics acsm noise_free graph_based signatures to large_scale receptor based ligand prediction motivation receptor_ligand are a central phenomenon in most biological_systems they are characterized by molecular_recognition a complex process mainly driven by physicochemical and structural_properties of both receptor and ligand understanding and predicting these interactions are major_steps towards protein ligand prediction target_identification lead_discovery and drug_design results we propose a novel graph basedbinding pocket signature called acsm which proved to be efficient and effective in handling large_scale protein ligand prediction tasks we compare our results with those described in the literature and demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes the competitors techniques finally we predict novel ligands for proteins from trypanosoma_cruzi the parasite responsible for chagas_disease and validate them in silico via a docking protocol showing the applicability of the method in suggesting ligands for pockets in a real_world scenario availability_and datasets and the source_code areto test and validate the ability of our signature to describe binding_sites to support and aid in proteinligand interaction prediction tasks we designed an extensive set of experiments first we show our method can be used in large_scale ligand prediction and evaluate its precision in doing this task then we compare the three proposed versions of acsm signatures and evaluate which one presents the best descriptive power to ligand prediction after that we present the comparative results concerning state of the art methods described in the literature and its respective datasets finally we apply our methodology to pockets of t cruzi proteins and predict ligands to them comparing the binding_free of the ligands docked with receptors with those of real complexes available at the pdb via a redocking protocol and with ligands randomly_chosen
