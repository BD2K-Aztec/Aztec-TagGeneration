structural_bioinformatics ifoldrna v folding rna with constraints a key to understanding rna function is to uncover its complex d structure experimental methods used for determining rna d structures are technologically challenging and laborious which makes the development of computational_prediction of substantial interest previously we developed the ifoldrna server that allows accurate prediction of short nt tertiary rna_structures starting from primary sequences here we present a new version of the ifoldrna server that permits the prediction of tertiary_structure of rnas as long as a few hundred nucleotides this substantial increase in the server capacity is achieved by utilization of experimental information such as base_pairing and hydroxyl_radical probing we demonstrate a significant benefit provided by integration of experimental_data and computational_methods availability_and http ifoldrna dokhlab org contact dokh unc euthe ifoldrna is a physical simulation based automated rna_structure webserver designed to predict d rna_structure based on available sequence_data the previous version of ifoldrna allowed prediction of the structure of short rna_molecules nt within a root_mean rmsd from corresponding experimental_structures the limitation on rna size is due to inaccuracies in the force_field and insufficient sampling increasing sequence size quickly becomes computationally prohibitive since the rna conformational_space grows exponentially we have previously shown that sampling conformational_space can be drastically_reduced by use of experimental constraints allowing us to correctly predict the tertiary_structure of rna up to a few hundred nucleotides_long here we present a second version of ifoldrna which allows automated inclusion of two categories of constraints base_pairing and nucleotide solvent_accessibility the source of base_pairing information can be generated either by sequence covariation analysis or by using a number of chemical probing techniques the shape technique in particular has proven to be a quick and effective method for determining rna_secondary to infer solvent_accessibility ifoldrna v uses data from hydroxyl_radical probing hrp experiments in hrp rna in solution is treated with reagents that generate hydroxyl_radicals which cleave rna strands by identifying cleavage frequency for specific nucleotide bonds solvent_exposure can be determined incorporating these data as a burial force in simulations imposes long_range constraints on folded structures the ifoldrna v webserver generates accurate_predictions of rna tertiary_structure using dmd predicted structures are typically within a rmsd from crystal_structures for nt rna the average processing time for an rna of this size is day we demonstrate how the inclusion of constraints increases the performance of the server on the example of m box riboswitch nt the structure of rna of this size is challenging to predict de_novo without constraints the quality of the predicted structure is poor rmsd between the predicted and the crystal_structures calculated through phosphate atoms is a the interaction_network fidelity inf is the inclusion of the basepairing constraints improves the prediction rmsd a inf the resulting structure has correct base_pairing while most of the higher_order tertiary contacts are missing the addition of hrp data significantly increases the quality of the prediction rmsd a inf we observe formation of the correct secondary_and closer examination of the predicted structure using mc annotate reveals that it has out of canonical base_pairs au or cg aadenine u uracil c cytosine g guanine and out of noncanonical ug base_pairs as compared with the crystal_structure as a benchmark we used two other servers rnacomposer and drna the structure predicted by rnacomposer rmsd a inf has correct base_pairing however most of the higher_order tertiary contacts are missing the structure predicted by drna rmsd a inf only partially reproduces correct base_pairing and does not recapitulate most of the higher_order tertiary contacts
