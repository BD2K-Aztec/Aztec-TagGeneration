radis analysis of rad_seq data for interspecific phylogeny in an attempt to make the processing of rad_seq data easier and allow rapid and automated exploration of parameters data for phylogenetic_inference we introduce the perl pipeline radis users of radis can let their raw illumina data be processed up to phylogenetic tree_inference or stop and restart the process at some point different values for key_parameters can be explored in a single analysis e g loci building sample loci selection making possible a thorough exploration of data radis relies on stacks for demultiplexing of data removing pcr duplicates and building individual and catalog loci scripts have been specifically written for trimming of reads and loci sample_selection finally raxml is used for phylogenetic inferences though other software may be utilized availability_and radis is written in perl designed to run on linux and unix platforms radis and its manual are freely_available fromrestriction site associated dna_sequencing rad_seq is a promising tool to confidently resolve phylogenetic_relationships among eukaryote species and genera e g however analyzing rad_seq data to infer phylogenies remains_challenging as it requires many steps and decisions to process raw_data into a format ready for analysis some steps can be achieved using a collection of well packaged software but others require bioinformatic skills an examination of data is required to better analyze their quality and impact on topology branch_lengths assessment of the robustness of the resulting trees to the parameters chosen for loci building and loci sample_selection is required but represents a tedious and error_prone task when done manually in an attempt to standardize processing of rad_seq data for phylogenetic_inference allow fast and automated exploration of key options and facilitate comparison among clustering_methods to form sets of loci e g stacks we designed the user_friendly perl pipeline radis between barcodes and sample codes can be provided to allow file renaming barcodes lib names txt progress of the analysis can be followed stdout stderr files output_files and necessary subdirectories are automatically created in a directory specified by the user data cleaningreads that do not pass illuminas filtering are discarded radis relies on process radtags from the software pipeline stacks to demultiplex data users can choose to remove nucleotides from the and ends of forward and reverse reads e g to remove enzyme cut sites or bad quality nucleotides if barcodes of different sizes are used reads are automatically trimmed to the same length to remove pcr duplicates radis then uses clone filter stacks finally sequence files are renamed after the sample codes at each step of the process files are created that provide summary_statistics on the number of reads removed kept data analysispurified read outputs from the first step are processed individually and a set of loci is produced for each sample using ustacks stacks users can provide a list of values to be tested for m the maximum number of nucleotides that may be different between stacks assembly of exactly matching reads to be merged into a single locus http creskolab uoregon edu stacks param tut php individual_loci are then merged into a catalog of loci with cstacks stacks users can provide a list of values for the parameter n the number of mismatches allowed between individual_loci when generating the catalog exploring alternate parameterization allows the user to find a good compromise for merging orthologous loci from distant_species whilst ensuring that paralogs and nonhomologous loci are not merged users can then perform loci and sample_selection to build datasets that fit with their prior_knowledge of the studied species they can fix a minimum number of loci required for a sample to be kept in the analysis or retain only loci for which at least a given number of samples have sequences a list of values can be provided users can also choose to remove loci in which paralogs and non homologous_sequences are probably merged together phylip formatted files that meet the selection_criteria are produced by radis finally combined datasets concatenation of the full sequence of each locus are analyzed using raxml stamatakis a b to produce phylogenetic_trees users can delay implementation of raxml analyses in order to increase the number of cpus to be used explicit names are used for output directories and files making the results obtained with different sets of parameters easily distinguished and compared e g stacks m n s l sel phy is the phylip formatted combined dataset obtained when individual_loci are built using m m ustacks the catalog of loci is built using n n cstacks only sample with at least loci l and loci for which at least samples have sequences s are selected sel it is noteworthy that radis can process data from as many rad libraries as needed
