morpholibj integrated library and plugins for mathematical morphology with imagej motivation mathematical morphology mm provides many powerful operators for processing d and d images however most mm plugins currently implemented for the popular imagej fiji platform are limited to the processing of d images results the morpholibj library proposes a large collection of generic tools based on mm to process binary and grey level d and d images integrated into user_friendly plugins we illustrate how morpholibj can facilitate the exploitation of d images of plant_tissues availability_and morpholibj is freely_available imagej net morpholibjthe continuous development of microscopy imaging_techniques results in increasingly better spatial_resolution signal_quality and throughput and allows d imaging of biological cells tissues or organisms biological images present specific difficulties for automated analysis due to data dimensionality space time channels etc acquisition artefacts or low contrast there is thus a recurrent need for efficient image_processing and for user_friendly software that integrates them to meet the needs for generic implementations and imagej interfaces of mm operators we developed the gpl licensed morpholibj library morpholibj implements a large collection of mm algorithms applicable to d and d grey level images and integrated into userfriendly interfaces the morpholibj library provides a set of generic tools for image_processing and analysis of biological_samples we demonstrated its applicability on d images of plant_tissue the cell resolved data provided by morpholibj will be useful for the analysis of cell_lineage and the modelling of plant_growth and morphogenesis in d
