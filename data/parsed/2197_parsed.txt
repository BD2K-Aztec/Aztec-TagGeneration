genome_analysis high_throughput analysis of epistasis in genome_wide with biforce motivation genegene_interactions epistasis are thought to be important in shaping complex_traits but they have been under explored in genome_wide gwas due to the computational challenge of enumerating billions of single_nucleotide snp combinations fast screening_tools are needed to make epistasis_analysis routinely available in gwas results we present biforce to support high_throughput analysis of epistasis in gwas for either quantitative or binary disease case control traits biforce achieves great computational_efficiency by using memory_efficient data_structures boolean bitwise operations and multithreaded parallelization it performs a full pair_wise genome_scan to detect interactions involving snps with or without significant marginal_effects using appropriate bonferroni_corrected significance thresholds we show that biforce is more powerful and significantly_faster than published tools for both binary and quantitative_traits in a series of performance tests on simulated_and we demonstrate biforce in analysing eight metabolic traits in a gwas cohort snps individuals and two disease traits in another snps cases and controls on a node computing cluster biforce completed analyses of the eight metabolic traits within day identified nine epistatic pairs of snps in five metabolic traits and snp_pairs in two disease traits biforce can make the analysis of epistasis a routine exercise in gwas and thus improve our understanding of the role of epistasis in the genetic_regulation of complex_traits availability_and the software is free and can be downloaded fromgenome wide association studies gwas have been successful in identifying a large number of trait associated genetic_loci but are less successful in identifying much of the genetic_variation genegene_interactions epistasis both authors contributed equally to this work to whom correspondence should be addressed are thought to be a potential source of unexplained genetic_variation but they remain_largely in gwas conducted so_far a major_hurdle for studying epistasis in gwas is the lack of widely_accepted algorithms that are fast enough to effectively handle high_density snps and can map different forms of epistasis while keeping false_positive fprs under control high_throughput tools are needed to make epistasis analyses routinely available in gwas and ultimately improve our understanding of the role of epistasis in the genetic_regulation of complex_traits significant efforts have been made to develop new tools and algorithms for epistasis detection in gwas using either deterministic or stochastic_methods such as regression machine_learning and bayesian based_approaches most of these algorithms concern only gwas for case control binary disorders and still require substantial computing time to analyse epistasis in one trait in real gwas data partial search_strategies based on biological_knowledge or filtering unimportant snps prior to analysis are adopted in some studies in order to reduce excessive computing burden but risk missing some types of variation fast but comprehensive methods to analyse epistasis in gwas conducted for many complex i e continuous and quantitative_traits are lacking previously we showed that high_throughput analysis of epistasis in quantitative_traits in gwas was feasible using computers with general_purpose graphics_processing we also suggested a search algorithm using the information of pre identified loci in a full pair_wise genome_scan to increase the power of detection of epistasis which was applied successfully in recent_studies for binary and complex_traits these ideas are combined in a unique tool biforce to support highthroughput epistasis_analysis for either binary or quantitative_traits on commonly used computer systems herein we describe the algorithm and essential features of biforce and compare the performance of biforce with that of boost in binary_traits and plink in quantitative_traits through simulation both of which perform exhaustive pair_wise search based on regression_based statistics over commonly used computer systems as biforce we also demonstrate biforce analysis of epistasis in real gwas data i e eight metabolic traits in the northern_finland nfbc provided by dbgap http www ncbi nlm nih gov gap and two disease traits provided by the wellcome_trust wtccc https www wtccc org uk ccc it is hoped that with biforce the analysis of epistasis in gwas will become a routine exercise thus facilitating accumulation of information on epistasis hence improving our understanding its role in the genetic_regulation of complex_traits we have shown that biforce is a unique tool that can support high_throughput analysis of epistasis in gwas for either binary or quantitative_traits biforce achieves great computational_efficiency by integrating three major advances in computing i e bitwise data_structures boolean bitwise operations and multithreaded parallelization with fast calculation of pair_wise interactions the implementation of the combined search algorithm i e using a less stringent threshold to detect marginal snp interactions increases the power ofthe strategy of using a less stringent threshold for marginal snp interactions is statistically justifiable and has been validated in simulations elsewhere and successfully_applied in real_data our simulation_results support the strategy and justify that biforce is working as expected biforce differs from boost mainly in the strategy of detection of marginal snp interactions thus in binary_traits the power of detection by biforce should be higher than or equal to that from boost as shown in our simulation_results biforce differs from plink in the strategy of detection of marginal snp interactions as well as the use of genotype models and hence it is not straightforward to assess the individual impact of the strategy on the biforce power gains in quantitative_traits especially when the power of detection was generally low however with reference to the simulation_results in the boost study comparing boost genotype models against plink allelic models it is clear that the power advantage in biforce over plink in scenarios using model with maf of and can be mostly attributed to the strategy of detection of marginal snp interactions because the model simulated favours the allelic models in these scenarios whereas in the scenario using model with maf of the biforce power advantage can be attributed to the use of genotype models because as maf increases towards the model simulated generates less marginal_effects and thus marginal snp interactions are more difficult to be detected nevertheless the power gains in biforce are not surprising because all the four interaction models favour marginal_effects to some extent it is worth noting that allelic models implemented in plink may have some advantage over biforce in situations where empty cells i e no samples available in certain genotypes in the nine cell contingency_table supplementary note are prevalent
