sequence_analysis biobloom tools fast accurate and memory_efficient host_species sequence screening using bloom filters large_datasets can be screened for sequences from a specific organism quickly and with low memory_requirements by a data_structure that supports time and memory_efficient set membership queries bloom filters offer such queries but require that false_positives be controlled we present biobloom tools a bloom filter_based sequence screening_tool that is faster than bwa bowtie popular alignment_algorithms and facs a membership query algorithm it delivers accuracies comparable with these tools controls false posi tives and has low memory_requirements pipelines that detect pathogens and contamination screen for host sequences so they do not interfere with downstream_analysis the alignment based_algorithms that these pipelines use provide mapping locations that are irrelevant for classification and thus perform more computation than is needed to address this we have developed biobloom tools bbt bbt uses bloom filtersprobabilistic constant time access data_structures that identify whether elements belong to a set bloom filters are similar to hash tables but do not store the elements themselves instead they store a fixed number of bits for every element into a common bit array thus they use less memory but queries to the filter may return false membership hits because of hash collisions in the common bit array the false_positive fpr resulting from these false hits can be managed by increasing the size of the filter supplementary_material using bloom filters for sequence categorization was pioneered by the program facs here we describe a bloom_filter implementation that includes heuristics to control false_positives and increase speed
