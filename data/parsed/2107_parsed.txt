systems_biology gpu meta storms computing the structure similarities among massive amount of microbial_community samples using gpu motivation the number of microbial_community samples is increasing with exponential speed data_mining among microbial_community samples could facilitate the discovery of valuable biological_information that is still hidden in the massive data however current methods for the comparison among microbial_communities are limited by their ability to process large amount of samples each with complex community_structure summary we have developed an optimized gpu based software gpu meta storms to efficiently measure the quantitative phylogen etic similarity among massive amount of microbial_community samples our results have shown that gpu meta storms would be able to compute the pair_wise similarity_scores for samples within min which gained a speed up of times compared with single core cpu and times compared with core cpu therefore the high performance of gpu meta storms could facilitate in depth data_mining among massive microbial_community samples and make the real_time analysis and monitoring of temporal or conditional changes for microbial_communities possible availability_and gpu meta storms is implemented by cuda compute_unified and c source_code is available at http www computationalbioenergy org meta storms html because most microbes are not isolatable and cultivatable metagenomic methods have been used to analyze a microbial_community as a whole next_generation techniques have enabled the fast profiling of structures for a large number of microbial_communities thus a rapidly increasing amount of metagenomic profiles for microbial_communities have been archived in public_repositories and research_laboratories around the world such as mg rast and camera while ncbi http www ncbi nlm nih gov also contains thousands of metagenomic related projects with samples with such a large_volume of metagenomic profiling data it has become possible and important to compare the complex structures of microbial_communities in large_scale for in depth data_mining to discover precious biological patterns hidden in those massive data a number of methods have been proposed for comparison of different metagenomic_samples megan can compare multiple samples based on taxonomy levels without considering phylogenetic_relationships among taxa stamp metarep and metarank process metagenomic_data using standard statistical_tests mainly t tests and principal_component with some modifications some s rrna amplicon analysis toolkits such as mothur and qiime include unifrac and fast unifrac algorithms which use distances among species to make phylogenetic beta diversity measurement more effective at showing ecological patterns nevertheless the restriction in the amount of samples for comparison as well as running speed limits the extension of these tools on analysis of huge number of microbial_community samples moreover current needs for real_time monitoring of temporal or conditional changes for microbial_communities in environment and energy research_areas have made these methods inadequate recently we have proposed a more efficient method metastorms for quantitative_comparison between microbial_community samples based on a binary phylogenetic_tree with a time complexity of nlog n n is the number of species in one sample however as the amount of samples increases the overall time complexity of m nlog n m is the number of samples for the pair_wise comparison always leads to an unacceptable running time therefore such computingintensive tasks require novel ultra high processing throughput to whom correspondence should be addressed
