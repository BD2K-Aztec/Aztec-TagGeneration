pyfdap automated analysis of fluorescence_decay after photoconversion fdap experiments we developed the graphical_user pyfdap for the fitting of linear_and decay functions to data from fluorescence_decay after photoconversion fdap experiments pyfdap structures and analyses large fdap datasets and features multiple fitting and plotting options availability_and pyfdap was written in python and runs on ubuntu linux mac os x and microsoft windows operating_systems the software a user guide and a test fdap data_set are freely_available for download from http people fluorescence microscopy_techniques have been widely used to measure the properties of fluorescently labeled_proteins in embryos tissues and cells over the last decade the repertoire of fluorescent_proteins has been extended with the discovery and engineering of photoconvertible proteins that change their emission_properties upon light exposure and that can be used to track sub populations of pulse labeled_proteins photoconvertible proteins have recently been adapted to determine protein_stability via microscopy based fluorescence_decay after photoconversion fdap assays in fdap assays a protein of interest is tagged with a photoconvertible protein and expressed in vivo after photoconversion the decay in fluorescence_intensity of the protein is monitored the data is then fitted with a decay function that models protein clearance to calculate protein half_lives protein_stability is context dependent for example protein_stability might be different inside cells and in the extracellular_space both intra_and protein half_lives can be determined by fdap using a static intracellular signal to create masks for intraand extracellular intensities we have previously described how to execute fdap experiments in living zebrafish_embryos here we provide a standardized computational framework to analyse the resulting datasets our software pyfdap features i a comprehensive data format for handling sorting and annotating large fdap datasets ii the ability to separate fdap datasets into their intra_and components based on counter labeling iii established fitting algorithms and iv a user_friendly environment that allows researchers from a non computational background to easily evaluate fdap datasets pyfdap is an open_source gui for the analysis and handling of fdap data usage of pyfdap does not require any programming knowledge the straightforward gui provides a quick workflow and the integrated terminal and open_source nature of pyfdap enable researchers to extend the software to suit their needs
