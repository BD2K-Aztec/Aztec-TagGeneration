gene_expression model free unsupervised gene_set screening based on information enrichment in expression_profiles motivation a number of unsupervised gene_set screening methods have recently been developed for search of putative_functional gene_sets based on their expression_profiles most of the methods statistically evaluate whether the expression_profiles of each gene_set are fit to assumed models e g co expression across all samples or a subgroup of samples however it is possible that they fail to capture informative gene_sets whose expression_profiles are not fit to the assumed models results to overcome_this we propose a model free unsupervised gene_set screening method matrix information enrichment_analysis miea without assuming any specific models miea screens gene_sets based on information richness of their expression_profiles we extensively compared the performance of miea to those of other unsupervised gene_set screening methods using various types of simulated_and the benchmark tests demonstrated that miea can detect singular expression_profiles that the other methods_fail to find and performs broadly well for various types of input_data taken together this study introduces miea as a broadly_applicable gene_set screening_tool for mining regulatory programs from transcriptome_data recently a number of gene_set screening methods have been introduced successfully to analyze regulatory programs hidden in transcriptome_data while classical microarray_analyses focus on individual genes gene_set screening methods search a prescribed gene_set library for gene_sets with informative expression_profiles in given transcriptome_data by treating a gene_set as a unit these methods enhance statistical_power as well as make results easier to biologically interpret for example gene_set gsea which finds gene_sets showing differential_expression between two sample groups has become one of the pivotal tools for transcriptome_analysis a lot of other methods employing similar supervised approach are used to search to whom correspondence should be addressed for gene_sets associated with given sample labels however if we want to globally search for putatively functional gene_sets irrespectively of association with sample labels we need another approach that does not rely on supervision of sample labels i e the unsupervised_approach for this purpose proposed a method to find a set of genes whose expressions are induced or repressed in any samples based on a hypergeometric_test although their pioneering method realizes an unsupervised_approach this method can also be regarded as a kind of supervised method in that it tests differential_expression between a single sample and the others we recently_proposed an unsupervised method extraction of expression module eem to search for gene_sets that have significantly large subsets of genes coherently expressed in the input transcriptome_data also proposed a method termed gene_set expression coherence_analysis gseca which selects gene_sets based on expression coherence gseca is different from eem in that gseca measures expression coherence taking_into all the members in the gene_set rather than focusing on the coherent subset since eem assumes that a significant gene_set is co expressed across all samples it is possible that eem fails to capture gene_sets that exhibit coherent expression_patterns across only a subset of samples to overcome_this we also developed an extended version of eem termed biclustering based eem beem which takes_advantage of a biclustering algorithm to identify gene_sets coherently expressed in a subgroup of samples compared with the supervised approach few gene_set screening methods have so_far employed the unsupervised_approach and also there remain some problems to be solved in the existing_methods for example although eem and beem evaluate expression coherence of an input gene_set based on specific models i e co expression across all samples or a subgroup of samples it is possible that such a model_based fails to capture informative expression_profiles that do not fit to the assumed model to address this problem we developed a novel model free method termed miea matrix information enrichment_analysis without assuming any specific model miea evaluates information in expression_profiles therefore it could be used to search for gene_sets associated with any types of informative expression_profiles in order to reveal the properties of miea and other unsupervised gene_set screening methods we extensively performed benchmark tests to compare their performances using both simulated andin this study we introduced a new unsupervised model free gene_set screening method miea and extensively compared its performance with those of the four existing unsupervised gene_set screening methods ssa eem beem and gseca ssa is a reformulated version of the classical gene_set screening method proposed by ssa shows by far the worst performance in all the benchmark tests this result seems reasonable when considering that ssa tests over or underexpression of a gene_set in each single sample individually while the other methods take into account expression_profiles of a gene_set across multiple samples on the other hand eem which tests expression coherence across all samples performs broadly well for various types of input_data beem which tests over or underexpression in a subgroup of samples works well for the gnf expression dataset confirming our previous_report however in the other expression datasets eem outperforms beem biclustertype expression modules targeted by beem are less common than coherent expression modules targeted by eem in most real expression datasets the feature of these methods is that they are based on the rigid model_assumptions there are pros_and about this feature a notable advantage of this feature is that it can be utilized for not only gene_set screening but also expression module discovery if a gene_set is taken as significant by eem and beem a subset of genes should be co expressed across all samples or in a subgroup of samples eem and beem can extract the subset as an expression module this expression module discovery approachbrings us much biological_knowledge especially when combined with additional_analyses of the extracted module information however note that eem and beem potentially fail to capture expression_profiles which do not fit to their expression module models similarly to eem gseca assumes expression coherence of input gene_sets as an indication of its functionality however while eem tests existence of a coherent subset in the input gene_set gseca evaluates overall coherence by calculating the sum of correlations for all gene_pairs in the gene_set in the real_data test this approach retrieves the largest number of gene_sets as significant possibly by capturing loosely coherent patterns that cannot be detected by eem an example of such an expression_profile is given in supplementary however note that gseca cannot capture a gene_set containing subsets whose expressions are anti correlated because the coherence signals cancel each other out supplementaryshows an example taken as significant by miea eem and beem but not gseca this case was also shown in the simulated_data test using the sine_wave model supplementaryand g the newly_introduced method miea is designed to detect any informative expression_profiles of the input gene_sets without assuming any specific models this notable feature endows the method with the broad_applicability so that it can capture complex expression_profiles that the other model based methods_fail to detect supplementaryand d shows such complex expression_profiles which are hard to be captured by any simple models however note that this broad_applicability comes at cost in case where a model_based would be appropriate the model free method has less power demonstrated by the simulated_data test using the coherent and bicluster model collectively we conclude that miea is broadly_applicable to various types of gene_sets and expression datasets while eem and gseca also have comparably broad_applicability since eem and gseca have biased preferences for their targets they might perform better than miea when applied to their favorite target although each method alone seems to have enough performance combining these different methods would enable more comprehensive screenings for functional gene_sets this study not only introduced miea but also revealed unique characteristics of the novel and existing unsupervised gene_set screening methods by performing extensive benchmark tests taken together with our previous_studies this study provides a foundation for unsupervised gene_set screening analysis a novel paradigm in transcriptome_data analysis
