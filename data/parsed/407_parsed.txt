gene_expression an r package to analyse lc_ms metabolomic_data mait metabolite automatic identification toolkit current_tools for liquid_chromatography and mass spec trometry for metabolomic_data cover a limited number of processing_steps whereas online tools are hard to use in a programmable fashion this article introduces the metabolite automatic identification toolkit mait package which makes it possible for users to perform meta bolomic end_to liquid_chromatography data analysis mait is focused on improving the peak annotation stage and provides essential tools to validate statistical_analysis results mait generates output_files with the statistical results peak annotation and metabolite_identification availability_and http b slab upc edu software and downloads metabolite automatic identification toolkit liquid_chromatography lc_ms is an analytical_technique used widely in metabolomics to detect molecules in biological_samples a wide_array of software_tools is available for lc_ms profiling data analysis including commercial programmatic and online tools a commercial example is analyst whereas some open_source packages permit programmatic processing such as the r package xcms to detect peaks or camera and astream for peak annotations there have been efforts on just peak annotation using java mzmine and mzmatch are modularized tools coded in java that are focused on lc_ms data preprocessing and visualization online tools permit sample_processing through a web graphical_user such as xcmsonline http xcmsonline scripps edu or metaboanalyst refer to supplementaryfor a comparative between the capabilities for some of the main available tools in this context we introduce a new r package called metabolite automatic identification toolkit mait for automatic lc_ms analysis the goal of the mait package is to provide an array of tools that makes programmable metabolomic end_to statistical_analysis possible see section of the supplementary_material for details about the mait modularity mait includes functions to improve peak annotation through the process called biotransformations and to assess the predictive_power of statistically_significant metabolites that quantify class separability the example data_files are a subset of the data used in the reference which are distributed freely through the faahko package mait was used to read and analyse these samples using the functions depicted in see the tutorial in the supplementary_information the significant features for each class are found using statistical_tests and analysed through the different plots that mait produces using the following function call peaks were detected at this point the first annotation stage is launched next we gather the significant features from the peaks detected after the welchs tests of these features were found to be significant through the spectralsigfeatures function statistical plots such as heat maps boxplots and principal_component score plots can be generated supplementary figs s and s significant features are annotated after checking for certain neutral losses biotransformations r mait spectralsigfeatures mait p r mait biotransformations mait peakprecision by using only the ssf a validation stage is launched obtaining a classification ratio of with three training samples for all classifiers these results suggest that the significant_variables separate both classes completely r mait validation mait iterations trainsamples finally the database is mined to identify the significant features r mait identifymetabolites mait peaktolerance
