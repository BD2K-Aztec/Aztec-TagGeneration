genetics_and solarius an r interface to solar for variance_component analysis in pedigrees the open_source environment r is one of the most widely used software for statistical computing it provides a variety of applications including statistical genetics most of the powerful_tools for quantitative genetic_analyses are stand alone free programs developed by researchers in academia solar is one of the standard_software programs to perform linkage and association mappings of the quantitative_trait qtls in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity solarius allows the user to exploit the variance_component methods implemented in solar it automates such routine operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype data it parses also the model output and contains summary and plotting functions for exploration of the results in addition solarius enables parallel_computing of the linkage and association_analyses that makes the calculation of genome_wide more efficient availability_and solarius is available on cran and on github https github com ugcd solarius variance_component vc models or linear_mixed are powerful_tools for genetic_studies particularly of quantitative_traits these models are attractive because they account for the contribution of individual genetic_loci while efficiently including polygenic and other confounding_effects shared among individuals implementation of the vc methods has been traditionally a computationally challenging_task and solar is one of the first and well established vc tools that focuses on the analysis of quantitative_trait qtls in extended pedigrees solarius delivers to the r user three main quantitative genetic_models polygenic linkage and association the motivation to develop the solarius software came from the extensive experience of the group that studies the genetic_analysis of idiopathic thrombophilia gait project the first goal of solarius was to provide an effortless data manipulation in a polygenic analysis needed to be explored for such a large number of phenotypes the second goal was to conduct the genomewide scans for both linkage and association mappings in an efficient way by means of parallel_computing
