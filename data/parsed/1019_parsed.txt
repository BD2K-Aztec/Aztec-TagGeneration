cnaseg a novel framework for identification of copy_number changes in cancer from second generation sequencing_data copy_number abnormalities cnas represent an important type of genetic_mutation that can lead to abnormal cell_growth and proliferation new high_throughput promise comprehensive characterization of cnas in contrast to microarrays where probe design follows a carefully developed protocol reads represent a random_sample from a library and may be prone to representation biases due to gc_content and other factors the discrimination between true and false_positive cnas becomes an important issue results we present a novel approach called cnaseg to identify cnas from second generation sequencing_data it uses depth of coverage to estimate copy_number states and flowcell to flowcell variability in cancer and normal samples to control the false_positive we tested the method using the colo melanoma cell_line sequenced to fold coverage an extensive simulation scheme was developed to recreate different scenarios of copy_number changes and depth of coverage by altering a real_dataset with spiked in cnas comparison to alternative_approaches using both real_and showed that cnaseg achieves superior precision and improved_sensitivity estimates availability the cnaseg package and test data are available ata wide_spectrum of mutation mechanisms contributes to the onset and progression of cancer copy_number abnormalities cnas represent an important type of genetic_mutation that lead to abnormal cell_growth and proliferation amplification of many oncogenes and loss of tumour_suppressor have been implicated in the development and progression of the cancer phenotype different microarray to whom correspondence should be addressed technologies have been successfully used to identify cnas in cancer however their resolution is limited by the number and location of probes on the array currently available snp_array platforms comprise million probes and have a lower_detection of kb new sequencing_technologies promise comprehensive characterization of copy_number profiles in cancer in particular paired_end read_mapping pem allows the detection of insertions_and ranging from a few base_pairs indels to tens of megabases the fact that pem allows mapping of the direction of reads makes it possible to identify copy neutral events such as structural_rearrangements several methods have been developed to identify indels and structural_rearrangements in contrast detection of cnas from pem data is much less explored in the literature although several methods such as rdxplorer and cnv seq have been developed to find copy_number in normal individuals they have not been tested on cancer data so it is not clear if they can detect cnas across the whole range of sizes and magnitudes present in cancer here we present a method cnaseg developed specifically for identification of cnas in cancer from second generation sequencing_data in contrast to microarrays where probe design follows a carefully developed protocol reads represent a random_sampling from a library and may be prone to representation biases due to gc_content and other physico_chemical characteristics variability could also arise from misalignment caused by mutation hotspots in a tumour consequently discrimination between true and false_positives becomes an important issue a limitation of the published approaches is that in their current versions they do not facilitate assessment of the false_positive error_rate of detected cnas in cancer_genomes we have developed a novel framework for the identification of cna events that uses flowcell to flowcell variability to estimate the false_positive and the depth of coverage to finalize copy_number calls in addition to dataset specific thresholding our method has other advantages it uses the skellam distribution to compare read_depth in tumour and control samples which allows the use of smaller window sizes for copy_number estimation and leads to greater sensitivity in pinpointing breakpoints for small cnas by comparing the method to alternative_approaches using real_and we show that cnaseg achieves superior precision and improved_sensitivity estimates here we present a novel framework cnaseg for identification of copy_number in cancer from second generation sequencing_data it utilizes read_depth variability between different flowcells from cancer and matched normal samples to control the false_positive by comparing to alternative segmentation_methods we showed that cnaseg significantly increases the precision of cna detection at a comparable sensitivity although specific to illumina_reads this general approach could readily be extended to other sequencing_technologies here we use flowcell to flowcell variability to disentangle genuine cna events from noise but in principle the cnaseg framework can be modified to allow for other sources of variation now that a human_genome can be sequenced to high coverage on one flowcell lane to lane variability could be used instead for identifying technical variation another important future extension to the cnaseg framework is incorporation of explicit modelling of normal_tissue admixture in cancer samples and heterogeneity of cancer_cells in a tumour both extensions will be necessary for making accurate copy_number calls and understanding tumour evolution compared with microarrays second generation sequencing provides much higher_resolution for detecting cna events inaddition sequencing using paired_end gives more information about molecular_mechanisms leading to copy_number changes a number of algorithms utilize anomalous insert_sizes and orientation of pem reads to identify structural_variation sv in normal individuals detection of sv abnormalities in cancer is an important topic in its own right as positioning of breakpoints can aid detection of fusion_genes and suggest sv based mechanism of gene_inactivation our approach uses read_depth to determine copy_number changes in cancer and complements sv detecting approaches the problem of using sv as the sole source of information in detecting cnas is compounded by the large sizes of many cnas compared with cnvs and also by the variety of molecular_mechanisms and hence pem properties that can lead to copy_number changes with complex breakpoints consequently the placement of breakpoints using sv data will not comprehensively segment cancer genome however sv information is poised to improve detection of cna events once better understanding of mechanisms behind genomic_instability in cancer becomes available for example knowledge of svs can be used to build a heterogeneous hmm where the probability of transitions between states is influenced by sv locations
