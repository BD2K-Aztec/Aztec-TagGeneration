data_and moduland plug in for cytoscape determination of hierarchical layers of overlapping network modules and community centrality the moduland plug in provides cytoscape users an algorithm for determining extensively overlapping network modules moreover it identifies several hierarchical layers of modules where meta nodes of the higher hierarchical layer represent modules of the lower layer the tool assigns module cores which predict the function of the whole module and determines key_nodes bridging two or multiple modules the plug in has a detailed java_based graphical_interface with various colouring options the moduland tool can run on windows linux or mac os we demonstrate its use on protein_structure and metabolic_networks availability the plug in and its user guide can be downloaded freely from http www linkgroup hu modules php nodes of biological_networks often belong to multiple network communities recently a number of methods were published to determine tightly or extensively overlapping network modules our moduland framework introduced community landscapes the xy plane of a community landscape is a conventional d visualization of the network whereas the z axis represents community centrality community centrality of a given edge or node was defined as the sum of local influence zones of all network edges or nodes including the given edge or node supplementary thus community centrality represents an integrated measure of the whole networks influence to one of its edges or nodes hills of the community landscape correspond to network modules supplementary yielding extensive overlaps this concept led to the development of the moduland family of network modularization methods to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded as the joint first authors the widely used cytoscape program has several very useful clustering plug_ins however these methods do not focus on extensive modular overlaps and do not build a modular hierarchy where meta nodes of the higher_level represent modules of the lower level moreover existing plug_ins do not provide measures identifying the centre of the module as well as key_nodes bridging two or multiple modules see supplementary table s and supplementary discussion here we introduce the cytoscape plug in of the most widely_applicable version of the moduland method family we demonstrate its ability to determine biologically_relevant extensively overlapping network modules hierarchical layers of modules module cores and key inter modular nodes using protein_structure and metabolic_networks
