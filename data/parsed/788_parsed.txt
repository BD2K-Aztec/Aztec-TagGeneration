gene_expression birte bayesian_inference of context specific regulator activities and transcriptional_networks in the last years there has been an increasing effort to computationally model and predict the influence of regulators transcription_factors mirnas on gene_expression here we introduce birte as a computationally attractive approach combining bayesian_inference of regulator activities with network reverse_engineering birte integrates target_gene predictions with different omics_data entities e g mirna and mrna data into a joint probabilistic_framework the utility of our method is tested in extensive_simulation and demonstrated with applications from prostate_cancer and escherichia_coli growth control the resulting regulatory_networks generally show a good agreement with the biological_literature availability_and birte is available on bioconductorgene regulation is one of the most important biological_processes in the living_cell its malfunctioning is directly associated with many human_diseases transcription_factors tfs are one of the most relevant drivers of mrna_expression in addition mirnas can degrade or inhibit translation of target_mrnas on the post_transcriptional level thus both tfs and mirnas influence mrna concentration jointly together in complex_networks based on existing tf and mirna target_gene prediction_methods during the last years there has been an increasing effort to computationally model regulatory_networks and draw_conclusions about context specific regulator activities also considered statistical interactions between regulators which they depicted as networks in our earlier publication we devised birta as a method which combines mirna and mrna_expression data into a joint probabilistic_model to infer condition specific activities of tfs and mirnas birta is formulated in a bayesian regression_framework and uses a so_called spike and slab prior to infer probabilities of activation for transcription_factors and mirnas in a sparse manner birta does not support statistical interactions between regulators independent of the question to predict context specific regulator activities structure_learning of gene_regulatory directly from expression data has been widely_studied in this article we introduce birte as a combined approach to estimate context specific regulator activities and networks between these regulators birte first uses a significant_improvement of birta to infer activities of regulators and their statistical interactions from expression data and target_gene predictions a key difference to birta is a computationally_efficient analytical marginalization of regression_coefficients which yields far better prediction_performance and fold less computation time after estimation of active regulators birte employs nested effects model nem structure_learning to infer the associated transcriptional_network a key difference to many existing_methods at this point is that our approach does not rely on direct mrna measurements of regulators but employs information of differential_expression of downstream_target v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup combirte combines inference of regulator activities with network reverse_engineering for inference of regulator activities we rely on an extension of our previous birta method the most significant_difference is the analytical and computationally_efficient marginalization of regression_coefficients which results in fold faster computation time furthermore our simulations indicate that birte not only outperforms birta but also a hypergeometric_test and the lasso based gemula with respect to prediction of active regulators and regulator regulator interactions birte performs post_hoc inference of networks between active regulators via nem structure_learning which infers subset relationships of differentially_expressed target_genes according to our simulations the approach yields far more reliable network reconstructions than typical methods that use observational expression data of regulators application of birte to a gene_expression data measuring response to different growth conditions in e coli as well as to a combined mrna and mirna dataset from prostate_cancer patients demonstrated the principal agreement with the biological_literature we thus think that birte could be a useful contribution to decipher biological_context specific regulatory_networks conflict of interest none declared
