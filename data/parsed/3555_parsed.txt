phyluce is a software_package for the analysis of conserved genomic_loci targeted enrichment of conserved and ultraconserved genomic_elements allows universal collection of phylogenomic data from hundreds of species at multiple time scales ma to ma prior to downstream inference data from these types of targeted enrichment studies must undergo preprocessing to assemble contigs from sequence_data identify targeted enriched loci from the off target background data align enriched contigs representing conserved loci to one another and prepare and manipulate these alignments for subsequent phylogenomic inference phyluce is an efficient and easy to install software_package that accomplishes these tasks across hundreds of taxa and thousands of enriched loci availability_and phyluce is written for python phyluce is supported on osx and linux redhat centos operating_systems phyluce source_code is distributed under a bsd style license from https www github com faircloth lab phyluce phyluce is also available as a package https binstar org faircloth lab phyluce for the anaconda python distribution that installs all dependencies and users can request a phyluce instance on iplant atmosphere tag phyluce the software manual and a tutorial are available from http phyluce readthedocs org en latest and test data are available fromtarget enrichment of conserved and ultraconserved elements hereafter conserved loci allows universal phylogenomic analyses of nonmodel organisms at multiple time scales the strength of the approach derives from its ability to collect sequence_data from thousands of loci across hundreds of species permitting phylogenetic comparisons across deep phylogenetic breaks such as organismal classes ma and shallower evolutionary divergences such as populations ma when the goal of data_collection is to infer the evolutionary_history of species the subsequent analytical tasks are generally to i assemble the sequencing_reads which may span tens to hundreds of individuals ii identify putative orthologs among the assembled_contigs on a sample by sample basis while removing putative paralogs iii easily generate datasets that contain different individuals individuals included from other experiments or conserved locus data harvested from individual genome_sequences iv identify and export sequence_data from orthologs across all individuals in the set v align the data and optionally trim resulting alignments in preparation for phylogenetic_inference vi compute summary_statistics on the aligned data and vii perform utility functions on the sequence or alignment data to prepare them for downstream_analyses using a variety of phylogenetic_inference programs phyluce pronounced phy loo chee is the first opensource easy to install software_package to perform these tasks for target enriched conserved loci in a computationally_efficient manner
