specific identification and quantification of circular_rnas from sequencing_data circular_rnas circrnas are a poorly_characterized class of molecules that have been identified decades_ago emerging high_throughput methods as well as first reports on confirmed functions have sparked new interest in this rna species however the computational detection and quantification tools are still limited results we developed the software tandem dcc and circtest dcc uses output from the star read_mapper to systematically detect back splice_junctions in next_generation data dcc applies a series of filters and integrates data across replicate sets to arrive at a precise list of circrna candidates we assessed the detection performance of dcc on a newly_generated mouse_brain data_set and publicly_available sequencing_data our software achieves a much higher_precision than state of the art competitors at similar sensitivity levels moreover dcc estimates circrna versus host gene_expression from counting junction and non junction reads these read_counts are finally used to test for host gene independence of circrna expression across different experimental_conditions by our r package circtest we demonstrate the benefits of this approach on previously_reported age dependent circrnas in the fruit_fly availability_and the source_code of dcc and circtest is licensed under the gnu general public licence gpl version and available from https github com dieterich lab dcc or circtest circrnas are a recently rediscovered class of abundant and universally expressed rna species the development of software solutions for detecting and quantifying circrnas is slowly gaining momentum despite the increasing interest in circrnas circrnas are characterized by a back splicing event where the downstream splicing tail joins back with the upstream splicing head to form a circular rna_structure see supplementary this structure becomes visible in sequencing_data as scrambled exons as the co linearity of genome and transcript is violated however the existence of back splicing junction reads does not prove the circularity of the transcript of origin other mechanisms e g trans_splicing may yield such reads but only circrnas are depleted in polya enriched samples and resistant to rnase r treatment so_far all available algorithms are using these back splicing reads as a key element in circrna detection as a consequence detection performance heavily depends on the employed read_mapper and its ability to map circrna junction reads to the underlying genome or transcriptome the two most recent addition to the circrna detection tool set are ciri and knife other circrna detecting pipelines have been published along with research_papers but seem to perform worse than the two in the corresponding benchmarks it has been recently shown that circrnas may vary in their abundance relative to their host gene it is interesting to statistically discern cases where circrna and linear isoform_expression are tightly_coupled from the ones where expression diverges between the two to this end read_counts over the back splice_junction are typically used as an estimate of circrna expression and read_counts from exons or linear splice_junctions as an estimate of the host gene_expression we present a software tandem for circrna detection dcc and relative quantification circtest we could show that dcc has a higher_precision than its competitors for single and paired_end data_sets moreover we adapt a statistical_framework based on the beta binomial_distribution for identifying host gene independent changes in circrna expression additional information are provided in supplementary text
