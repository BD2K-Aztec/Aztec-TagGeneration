computational quantification of metabolic_fluxes from a single isotope snapshot application to an animal biopsy motivation quantitative determination of metabolic_fluxes in single tissue_biopsies is difficult we report a novel analysis approach and software_package for in vivo flux quantification using stable_isotope results we developed a protocol based on brief timed infusion of c isotope enriched substrates for the tricarboxylic_acid tca_cycle followed by quick freezing of tissue_biopsies nmr measurements of tissue_extracts were used for flux estimation based on a computational_model of carbon transitions between tca_cycle metabolites and related amino_acids to this end we developed a computational framework in which metabolic systems can be flexibly assembled simulated and analyzed flux parameters were quantified from nmr multiplets by a partial grid_search followed by repeated neldermead optimizations implemented on a computer grid we implemented a model of the tca_cycle and showed by extensive simulations that the timed infusion protocol reliably quantitates multiple fluxes experimental_validation of the method was done in vivo on hearts of anesthetized pigs under two different conditions basal_state n and cardiac stress caused by infusion of dobutamine n about nine tissue_samples mg dry_weight were taken per heart tca_cycle flux was sem mol mingdw at baseline versus mol mingdw for dobutamine_stress oxygen_consumption calculated from the tca_cycle flux and from gold_standard blood_gas based measurements were close correlating with r p spatial_heterogeneity in metabolic_fluxes is detectable amongst the small samples we propose that our novel isotope snapshot methodology is suitable for flux measurements in biopsies in vivo availability non profit organizations will upon request be granted a non exclusive license to use the software for internal research and teaching purposes at no charge a web_interface for using the software on our computer grid is available undermetabolic fluxes reflect the function and dynamics of cells in the body however measuring metabolic_fluxes in small tissue_samples in animals in vivo is very difficult and needs i a special experimental strategy and ii sophisticated computational_analysis measurement of metabolic_fluxes in whole organs or large tissue_volumes was possible by measuring time series of c incorporation in intermediary metabolites with in vivo nmr_spectroscopy van developed a strategy to infuse substrates enriched with stable_isotopes for several minutes and arrest metabolism before a steady_state of label incorporation is attained metabolic_fluxes are then quantitated by computational_analysis from nmr measurements on a single tissue_sample collected at a single time point given the usually quite heterogeneous metabolism of tissue this approach overcomes the difficulty that a time series of metabolite_levels cannot be obtained from one small biopsy in tissue however an advanced computational_analysis is key to successfully perform these metabolic_flux measurements in vivo and is presented here it was desirable to optimize the original computational_analysis strategy and software to quantitate fluxes from biopsies this analysis was originally built on a package optimized for indicatordilution studies in a pet setting van the underlying models were built on early pre steady_state labeling work meanwhile further non steady_state approaches have been developed with applications in biotechnology here we present a new analysis approach optimized for the single time point analysis applicable to biopsies this approach is embedded in a software_package that makes it possible to build carbon transition models for arbitrary metabolic_pathways without the need to apply a computer programming_language metabolic_fluxes can be measured by infusion of substrates labeled with radioactive or stable_isotopes usually the time course of incorporation of label is followed for instance by in vivo nmr_spectroscopy or label is infused sufficiently_long that a stable steady_state is reached in the latter case relative fluxes can be determined and if uptake from outside the cells can be measured absolute fluxes can be derived under in vitro conditions uptake of a substrate can often easily be measured for instance the decrease of glucose in cell_culture gives its uptake in the cells however it is difficult to measure uptake of substrate in small regions in the body from the blood this would require measurement of metaboliteusing the fluxes program arbitrary metabolic_pathways can be modeled for the in vivo validation experiment a model of the tca_cycle was implemented and its flux parameters were optimized to fit the experimentally_measured nmr multiplets oxygen_consumption is stoichiometrically coupled to tca_cycle flux and could therefore be directly calculated from two of these parameters the optimization criterion used for the parameter_estimation consists of i the between the nmr multiplets computed by fluxes and the nmr multiplets experimentally_measured in the lipsss experiment and ii previous_knowledge about model_parameters added via bayesian priors the validation experiments were performed on pig hearts in vivo under two different metabolic conditions basal_state and cardiac stress_induced by dobutamine in the same hearts myocardial_oxygen was quantified from blood_gas and blood_flow measurements this classic physiological gold_standard was compared with the lipsss oxygen_consumption calculated from the parameter estimateswe developed and tested analysis methods and software for quantitation of metabolic_fluxes by in silico simulation of the lipsss protocol and validated the approach in vivo in animal lipsss experiments lipsss experiments entail that stable_isotope enriched metabolic substrates are given to the biological system and that the level of incorporation of the label in a brief well defined period of time allows determining the speed of metabolic turnover by computational_analysis as revealed by simulation the parameter_estimates for j tca and p dil show low standard_errors and were not sensitive to values of the parameters j exc t trans and p anap this means that the variations in j exc t trans and p anap have only small effects on the estimation of j tca and p dil therefore we chose to restrict j exc t trans and p anap by prior_knowledge encoded in bayesian priors to improve the estimation of j tca and p dil furthermore the in vivo experiments show that j tca j exc and p dil reveal the expected physiological differences between the control and the dobutamine stressed hearts individual_differences between the pigs were expected and indeed observed oxygen_consumption calculated from model_parameters corresponds with oxygen_consumption measured from blood_gas and are close to the line of identity it is expected that oxygen_consumption determined from blood_gas is higher than oxygen_consumption calculated from the tca_cycle measured with the lipsss protocol the blood_gas uptake includes other oxygen consuming reactions e g catalyzed by oxygenases or reactive_oxygen formation in addition to the oxygen_consumption linked to the tca_cycle oxygen_consumption calculated using lipsss data reflects only the reaction with reducing_equivalents produced in the tca_cycle flux this is in accordance with the findings of challoner hence the expected oxygen_consumption calculated using lipsss data is lower than uptake of oxygen from the blood measurements of other oxygen consuming reactions should be added to tca_cycle based calculations if one wants to precisely predict oxygen_uptake from the blood the differences in metabolism between hearts of the control and dobutamine group are reflected by the higher average oxygen_consumption in the dobutamine group high workload compared with the control_group we have preliminary evidence that in future versions of the software_package fluxes it is possible to implement i on the fly c code generation that makes simulations times_faster ii determination of optimal start values for parameter_optimization using a particle swarm algorithm iii simulation of nmr multiplet time series for multiple metabolites iv parameter_optimization using nmr multiplet time series of multiple metabolites and v multiple nonlinear optimization routines in conclusion fluxes is a framework designed for parameter_estimation in metabolic_models by fitting simulated nmr multiplets against multiplets measured during lipsss experiments fluxes can flexibly handle arbitrary metabolic_pathways that are not in isotopic steady_state and will work on most computer operating_systems fluxes was validated on nmr measurements from multiple tissue_biopsies from pig hearts the lipsss protocol based on taking biopsies at a single time point potentially has much higher spatial and biochemical resolution than in vivo nmr_experiments we anticipate that the lipsss approach in combination with the easy to use computer package fluxes will prove applicable to many metabolic_pathways and biological_systems such as central_metabolism in cancer biopsies as well as neurotransmitter and central_metabolism in neural cell_cultures and animal_studies
