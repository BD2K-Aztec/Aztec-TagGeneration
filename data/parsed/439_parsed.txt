genetics_and application of clinical text data for phenome_wide studies phewass motivation genome_wide gwass are effective for describing genetic complexities of common diseases phenome_wide studies phewass offer an alternative and complementary_approach to gwas using data embedded in the electronic_health ehr to define the phenome international_classification version icd_codes are used frequently to define the phenome but using icd_codes alone misses other clinically relevant_information from the ehr that can be used for phewas analyses and discovery results as an alternative to icd_coding a text_based phenome was defined by clinically_relevant terms extracted from marshfield clinics ehr five single_nucleotide snps with known phenotypic associations were genotyped in individuals and associated across the text_based phenome all five snps genotyped were associated with expected terms p most at or near the top of their respective phewas ranking raw association results indicate that text data performed equivalently to icd_coding and demonstrate the utility of information beyond icd_coding for application in phewas the genetic complexities of common diseases have been well defined by the use of the genome_wide gwas aside from only a few examples gwass have failed to identify single_nucleotide snps that reach a threshold where they can be used to predict prevent or even treat complex_diseases this may be due in part to disease heterogeneity and the fact that most snps genotyped during a gwas represent tag_snps for unknown and ungenotyped causal_variants as a complementary or alternative strategy to gwas phenome_wide studies phewass have demonstrated their effectiveness for rediscovering gwas associations while also identifying novel disease snp correlations whereas gwas is a phenotype to genotype strategy phewas reverses this paradigm by exchanging the disease and genome in a gwas with a specific genetic_variant and phenome in a phewas as such phewas is a genotype to phenotype strategy the first phewas was published in byin this first proof_of study five disease associated snps previously_identified by gwas were genotyped in a cohort of patients from vanderbilt university_medical each snp was associated with hundreds of international_classification version icd_codes that defined the icd based phenome of the five snps four demonstrated that the phewas technique was able to rediscover the expected associations the advantage of phewas over gwas is that phewas has the capacity to identify multiple_diseases that share a common genetic v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com doi bioinformatics btv phewass are quickly proving effective at rediscovering and discovering new gene_disease thus far most phewass have focused on genetic_variants with predetermined snp disease associations the largest of which was conducted on snps previously_identified by gwas phewas exhibits the power to identify novel associations and link multiple conditions to a shared genetic_etiology a commonality for the majority of phewass published to date is the use of icd_coding to define the phenome an advantage of icd based phenomes is the logical architecture of the codes such that similar conditions have similar codes for example icd_codes define diseases of the circulatory system icd_codes define different sub types of ischemic_heart icd_codes define acute myocardial_infarctions and at the highest phenotypic resolution icd_codes define acute myocardial_infarctions of anterolateral wall it is not surprising that icd based phewass have utilized a collapsing strategy to define cases and controls at varying levels of phenotypic resolution the current text_based phenome was arranged alphabetically and as such lacks intuitive structure another challenge of a text_based phenome is the interpretation of the word strings cases and controls in an icd based phenome are defined by the existence of a given icd_code although errors exist in the coding it is assumed that icd_coding is assigned based on clinical_manifestations in comparison phenotypes described by text data may be less clear cases and controls may be incompletely assigned because of misspellings or alternative word usage such as abbreviations furthermore words defining a text_based phenome may capture a term yet context beyond the term may be lacking for example non specific terms such as positional supplementary are captured in the text_based phenome further curation of the text_based phenome to remove such terms may improve the effectiveness of a text_based phewas using biomedical named_entity tools may be one approach in addition to non specific terms it is conceivable that association results from clinically_meaningful terms may still be difficult_to some clinical_notes may indicate that a patient has atrial_fibrillation patient does not have atrial_fibrillation and or patient has a family_history of atrial_fibrillation under these circumstances all individuals with the word string atrial_fibrillation will be lumped together independent of meaning this may explain why atrial_fibrillation was not the top word string for rs although it was still in the top p e the application of natural_language techniques such as negation analysis and ontology driven concept extraction may be effective when addressing these challenges regardless raw association results indicate that text data performed equivalently to icd_coding and in some instances clinical text data outperformed icd_coding and like gwas phewas is challenged by multiple comparison testing the current standard for adjusting multiple comparison testing has been the application of a bonferroni_correction unique to phewas is the correlative structure in the phenotypic_data as described earlier in an icd based phewas similar icd_codes may be correlated especially in phenomes that use a collapsing strategy to define cases and controls at different phenotypic resolutions furthermore correlations may also exist across codes this text_based phewas is no different a good example of the correlative structure in the text data may include the atrial_fibrillation snp_rs where the bigram fibrillation with is rooted in the trigram atrial_fibrillation with with both showing similar associations of all snps tested the amd snp_rs not only passed a snp dependent bonferroni_correction p e but also passed an experiment wise correction p e assuming a and total tests total tests snp phenotypes like icd_codes clinical text data can be efficiently extracted from an ehr system and can be effectively applied to a phewas with all of the words in a text_based phenome rooted to standard terms from a medical dictionary this approach may be easily translatable to other ehr systems clinical text data has the capacity to describe phenotypic_information at a high_resolution while also allowing the use of drug information that may provide_additional the interpretation of the phewas result as demonstrated by the amd associated snp and its application of clinical text dataassociation with the amd drug visudyne because icd_codes are used primarily for billing only those conditions that arise during a clinical visit are recorded for patients who come in and out of a service_area or for conditions that predate an ehr system icd_coding may not provide a comprehensive assessment of a patients disease history in comparison clinical_notes may capture both current and in depth historical health_information this may explain in part the larger case sizes for clinical text data compared with icd_coding of interest text data and icd_coding demonstrated similar associations yet both datasets had incomplete correlations between the cases and controls identified by either text data or icd_coding in general a larger percentage of cases are unique to text data compared with cases identified by icd_coding for example cases of ankylosing_spondylitis and ms were dramatically different in the text_based approached compared with the icd based_approach suggesting the potential for increased false_positives in a text_based phenome conversely snp_rs known to be associated with triglyceride metabolism was associated with patients with the word string elevated triglycerides p e whereas rs genotype was associated with patients diagnosed with pure hyperglyceridemia p e the correlation between cases and controls for this example was with of cases unique only to text data and of cases unique only to icd data this result may suggest that neither text data nor icd_coding can comprehensively identify all cases improvement in a text_based phenome may be achieved by implementing concept identification approaches such as negation analysis word sense disambiguation and abbreviation expansion furthermore further improvement may be achieved by combining different data types in conclusion this study demonstrates for the first time that raw text data from clinical_notes in an ehr system can be used effectively to define a phenome this study also validates that clinical text data including drug data can be applied to phewas as a complementary_approach to a gwas and icd based phewas the future of the phewas strategy may not be limited to either clinical text data or icd_coding a potential name for this approach might be called a text wide association study textwas the future of the phewas strategy may rely on multiple structured and unstructured data types this is particularly relevant as ehr systems become standardized bio repositories continue to grow and genomic medicine becomes widely_applied
