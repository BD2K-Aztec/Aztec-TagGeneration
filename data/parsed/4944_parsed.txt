xtalk a path based_approach for identifying crosstalk between signaling_pathways motivation cells communicate with their environment via signal_transduction on occasion the activation of one pathway can produce an effect downstream of another pathway a phenomenon known as crosstalk existing computational_methods to discover such pathway_pairs rely on simple overlap statistics results we present xtalk a path based_approach for identifying pairs of pathways that may cross_talk xtalk computes the statistical_significance of the average length of multiple short paths that connect receptors in one pathway to the transcription_factors in another by design xtalk reports the precise interactions and mechanisms that support the identified crosstalk we applied xtalk to signaling_pathways in the kegg and nci pid databases we manually_curated a gold_standard set of crosstalking pathway_pairs and a set of pairs that did not crosstalk for which xtalk achieved an area under the receiver_operator of a improvement over the closest competing approach the area under the receiver_operator varied with the pathway suggesting that crosstalk should be evaluated on a pathway by pathway level we also analyzed an extended set of pathway_pairs in kegg and to a set of more than pathway_pairs in nci pid for the top ranking pairs we found substantial support in the literature for kegg and for nci pid we provide examples of networks computed by xtalk that accurately recovered known mechanisms of crosstalk availability_and the xtalk software is available atcells communicate with their environment through signal_transduction typically a signaling_pathway contains a welldefined set of receptors and transcription_factors tfs upon activation of the pathways receptors a series of signaling interactions activate the tfs in that pathway thereby regulating the expression of target_genes as a down stream response on occasion these intra cellular signal cascades result in off target responses commonly known as pathway crosstalk more specifically crosstalk occurs when the activation of the receptors of a specific signaling_pathway results in the down stream response being executed by the tfs of a different pathway such a down stream response manifests itself through changes in the expression of the second pathways target_genes signaling_pathway crosstalk may lead to several cancers and has also been implicated in host_defense against pathogens in plants computational_methods have been developed to systematically predict crosstalk the simplest approach which we call nodes incommon or nic in this article asks if two pathways share any proteins based on the observation that shared proteins may mediate crosstalk hsu and yang estimated pathway crosstalk based on similarities in gene_ontology interactionbased methods try to identify crosstalk by quantifying the connectivity between pathway_pairs given a proteinprotein_interaction linked two pathways a and b if more edges connected the proteins in a to the proteins in b than expected by chance in a randomly wired network in the case when two pathways are known to crosstalk developed a method that used a combined signaling_network to identify the protein s responsible for crosstalk a similar approach biological_process linkage networks bpln linked two processes a and b if the proteins annotated to a were connected to more proteins annotated to b than expected by chance in this article we selected bpln as an exemplar of the interaction based techniques these approaches have several drawbacks the nic methods cannot identify crosstalk when the two pathways have very few or no common proteins for example mapk_pathway and the hippo_pathway crosstalk but share only a few proteins more importantly these methods treat a pathway simply as a set of proteins while the edge based_approaches do use interactions between proteins they fail to identify crosstalk when the members of pathway a do not interact with the members of pathway b as in the case of crosstalk from the hif pathway to the wnt_pathway more importantly they do not consider the canonical structure of a pathway a set of receptors connected via regulatory signaling and physical_interactions to a set of tfs therefore they are unlikely to discover the mechanisms or the sequence of interactions that underlie pathway crosstalk to develop our method xtalk we started by considering the biological definition of crosstalk crosstalk occurs between two signaling_pathways a and b when the stimulation at the receptors of pathway a causes a cellular response downstream of pathway b usually carried_out by the tfs in b we reasoned that there must be at least one directed path of signaling and regulatory_interactions along which a signal can traverse from some receptor of pathway a to some tf in pathway b we expected these paths to be short so that the signal could travel rapidly to affect the response crosstalk can also be asymmetric a may crosstalk with b i e stimulation of as receptors controls at least one of bs tfs but b may not crosstalk with a i e stimulation of bs receptors has no effect on any of as tfs as in the case of crosstalk from the insulin_like i pathway to the leptin pathway using these guiding_principles we developed xtalk to identify the k shortest_paths from any receptor in pathway a to each tf in pathway b where k is a user_defined parameter we implemented an efficient dynamic_programming based_approach to exactly compute the statistical_significance of the crosstalk by design xtalk reports the precise sequences of interactions and mechanisms that support the identified crosstalk between pathways to the best of our knowledge databases of pathway crosstalk are currently unavailable for validation of methods such as xtalk to overcome this challenge we created a gold_standard set of directed pathway_pairs that crosstalk to create this dataset we restricted our definition of crosstalk to only those events that occur when an interaction e g activation inhibition or binding between two proteins mediates the crosstalk we acknowledge that several other mechanisms of crosstalk exist including proteinprotein_interaction events feedback_loops and when members of pathway b are downstream_targets of tfs in pathway a we plan to incorporate these mechanisms in the future we studied over publications for evidence of crosstalk between pairs of pathways in the kegg_database we found literature support for crosstalk between pairs these pairs formed our gold_standard dataset we evaluated xtalk in several ways we used receiver_operator roc_curves to compare xtalk nic and bpln for the pathway_pairs that we had explicitly considered for inclusion in the gold_standard section xtalk achieved an area under the roc auc of which was an improvement of over its closest competitor bpln we observed that the auc of xtalk varied from one pathway to another section therefore we studied the three pathways with the lowest aucs we found support in the literature for out of false_positive pathway_pairs section we also considered xtalk s results from an experimentalists perspective by examining the top three highest ranking pairs for each pathway xtalk had a precision of for these ranks we were able to find support in the literature for seven false_positives notably in both this and the previous analysis we were able to find the appropriate publications only after including proteins in xtalk s crosstalk networks in our pubmed queries we expanded our analysis by applying xtalk to a comprehensive set of signaling related pathway_pairs in the kegg finally we highlight the utility of the xtalk networks in recovering the known mechanisms of crosstalk and assisting in the manual_curation of pathway_pairs we studied the kegg and nci pid databases we divided all the pathway_pairs we analyzed into three sets supplementary sections i the kegg curated set containing the pathway_pairs we considered for inclusion in the gold_standard ii the kegg test_set containing other pathway_pairs and iii the nci pid test_set containing pathway_pairs we performed several types of evaluations kegg curated set first we used it to compute auc values for each algorithm section we also computed the auc values for each pathway individually section second for the pathways with the lowest aucs we used xtalks crosstalk networks to search the literature for support for false_positive section third in a complementary evaluation we studied the false_positive pairs among the highest ranking results for each pathway since an experimentalist is likely to be interested in following such predictions for validation section test_sets we considered the highest ranked pairs of pathways computed by xtalk for each of the two test_sets section we estimated the precision of xtalk by determining which pairs contained support in the literature for crosstalk for these analyses we only considered xtalk since it outperformed nic and bpln on the first analysis as we show in section finally we discuss the crosstalk networks for specific top_ranked pathway_pairs sections and we have developed xtalk a novel path based_approach to identifying pathway crosstalk xtalk identifies crosstalk by computing several short paths along which an external signal can be transduced from the receptors of one pathway to the tfs of the other when evaluated upon a literature curated gold_standard set of pathway_pairs xtalk achieved an auc of a value much higher than node and edge based_approaches nic and bpln respectively we observed a high variance in auc from one pathway to another focusing on the three pathways with the lowest aucs we succeeded in finding support in the literature for out of falsepositive pairs involving these pathways conversely taking an experimentalists perspective we focused on false_positives among highly ranked pairs and found support in the literature for out of pairs it is notable that search queries yielded the relevant publications only when we augmented the pathway names with key_proteins that mediated the crosstalk we learnt the identities of these proteins only after examination of the crosstalk networks these results underscore both the considerable difficulties and subtleties in constructing a gold_standard database of pathway crosstalk and the value of xtalk in discovering crosstalk events in the second analysis we evaluated crosstalk on two test_sets of pathway_pairs one from kegg and the other from nci pid that we did not consider for inclusion in the gold_standard the literature contained evidence for approximately of pairs ranked highly by xtalk for each dataset these results suggest that an experimentalist interested in a poorly_studied pathway or one that is not in our gold_standard may benefit from focusing experiments on the topranked predictions made by xtalk moreover crosstalk networks can provide useful suggestions on the underlying_mechanisms for the analysis of kegg_pathways we used a signaling_network derived from all relations in the kegg_database we analyzed two versions of this signaling_network kegg family and keggprotein the value of k for each pathway in the kegg protein was on average times larger than that for the kegg family during the construction of the kegg protein network we expanded each interaction between two nodes in the kegg family network into a complete bipartite_graph between the member proteins from each node in the kegg family supplementary sectionare considering extensions of xtalk that explicitly take into account the information on whether an interaction is activating or crosstalk network constructed by xtalk from the nfjb pathway a to the neurotrophin pathway b using the kegg family network seefor details on node and edge colors and shapes supplementarydisplays the complete network inhibitory it is also important to consider cell and tissue_specificity xtalk and its future versions promise to serve as powerful analytic_methods to discover novel pairs of crosstalking pathways and the underlying_mechanisms
