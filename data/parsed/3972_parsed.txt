repeat and error aware comparison of deletions motivation the number of reported genetic_variants is rapidly_growing empowered by ever faster accumulation of next_generation data a major_issue is comparability standards that address the combined problem of inaccurately predicted breakpoints and repeat induced ambiguities are missing this decisively lowers the quality of consensus callsets and hampers the removal of duplicate entries in variant databases which can have deleterious_effects in downstream_analyses results we introduce a sound framework for comparison of deletions that captures both tool induced inaccuracies and repeat induced ambiguities we present a maximum matching algorithm that outputs virtual duplicates among two sets of predictions annotations we demonstrate that our approach is clearly superior over ad_hoc criteria like overlap and that it can reduce the redundancy among callsets substantially we also identify large_amounts of duplicate entries in the database of genomic_variants which points out the immediate relevance of our approach availability_and implementation is open_source and available from https next_generation ngs_technology has led to generation of big_data also in biology the rapid accumulation of ngs_data has triggered the development of an equally overwhelming amount of tools for their exploration including many tools for the prediction of structural_variants see the reviews by an immediately arising pressing concern are cross genome and cross project comparability of variant call sets e g from the genomes_project consortium the genome of the while resolution of related issues is instrumental for successful genetics research there are only little statistically and algorithmically rigorous approaches addressing this here we suggest a formal framework for identifying duplicate deletion calls a major source of problems about ngs data_formats and tool evaluation is the repetitiveness inherent to the majority of genomes the resulting read_mapping ambiguity can decisively hamper the exact allocation of structural_variations svs as well as insertions_and indels within a genome on top of that another major source of prediction inaccuracies are the technical and theoretical tool specific limitations these are often well known for instance sequencing_errors ambiguities during the alignment of reads to a reference or point_mutations close to the breakpoints might cause split_read approaches to be inaccurate by a few bases paired_end approaches on the other hand infer the deletion size according to the difference of the expected fragment length and the resulting distance of the mapped_reads since the original fragment length is only known approximately the deletion size predictions are less accurate than for split read_aligners in addition the location of the deletion needs to be confined to the region between the paired ends which introduces further inaccuracies see for examplefor details on the different kinds of approaches popular split read_aligners are pindel and platypus while breakdancer and clever are paired_end approaches as we will outline in the following the simultaneous presence of repeats and even slightly inaccurate breakpoint predictions makes_it to compare two deletion calls as done when merging call sets created by different tools as e g in the recent consensus caller by or when searching variant databases e g since indels and svs play_important in cancer and many other diseases and in general_populations alleviating such issues can make a highly_beneficial contribution to the field
