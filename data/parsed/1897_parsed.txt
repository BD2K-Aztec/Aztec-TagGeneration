fuma reporting overlap in rna_seq detected fusion_genes a new generation of tools that identify fusion_genes in rna_seq is limited in either sensitivity and or specificity to allow further downstream_analysis and to estimate performance predicted fusion_genes from different tools have to be compared however the transcriptomic context complicates genomic location based matching fusionmatcher fuma is a program that reports identical fusion_genes based on gene name annotations fuma automatically compares and summarizes all combinations of two or more datasets in a single run without additional programming necessary fuma uses one gene_annotation avoiding mismatches caused by tool specific gene_annotations fuma matches more fusion_genes compared with exact gene matching due to overlapping genes and accepts intermediate output_files that allow a stepwise analysis of corresponding tools a new generation of bioinformatics_tools has been released that aims to detect fusion_genes within rna_seq however the current_tools are limited in either sensitivity or specificity making their results impractical for downstream_analysis and subsequent validation as shown in other domains of high_throughput analysis using a consensus of tools may improve performance by compensating for individual tool error profiles since no single tool shows superior detection performance a consensus based fusion_gene detection in rna_seq can improve both downstream_analysis as well as overall performance moreover to identify limiting_factors and promote improvement of current_algorithms an accurate estimation of sensitivity_and is required for which an accurate fusion_gene comparison is crucial therefore comparing validated and in silico predicted fusion_genes in an automated fashion and summarizing identical fusion_genes in two or more datasets in an easy and accessible way is a desirable feature ideally sensitivity_specificity estimation should be based upon the identified genomic breakpoints provided as two chromosomal_locations however the nature of rna_seq complicates this strategy as reads may span exon_junctions and breakpoints are more likely to be expected in introns because of their relative large size introducing additional uncertainty when trying to pinpoint the exact genomic_position of the dna breakpoint for instance using exact position based matching epm results in poor overlap between tools supplementary section s a less conservative strategy used in dna_seq analysis involves comparing genomic_intervals which can be defined by adding flanking_regions to intron sizes are differing and lastly a substantial number of genes do overlap with each other due to opposite strand positioning therefore we designed a new method fuma which boosts the current fusion_gene matching functionality of the chimera package to address the challenges outlined above fuma was tested on publicly_available data and results provided as part of the chimera package supplementary section s concordance of the matching methods was assessed using refseq gene_annotation while epm reported less than half of the overlaps of fuma egm performed better but was still outmatched by fuma specifically egm missed of the fusion_genes due to not accounting for overlapping genes and importantly five of the missed fusions had been validated fuma o also reported a matching intergenic fusion event in a large gene that likely represents a false_positive
