systems_biology design and analysis of large_scale biological rhythm studies a comparison of algorithms for detecting periodic signals in biological data motivation to discover and study periodic processes in biological_systems we sought to identify periodic patterns in their gene_expression data we surveyed a large number of available methods for identifying periodicity in time series data and chose representatives of different mathematical perspectives that performed well on both synthetic data and biological data synthetic data were used to evaluate how each algorithm responds to different curve shapes periods phase_shifts noise levels and sampling rates the biological_datasets we tested represent a variety of periodic processes from different organisms including the cell_cycle and metabolic cycle in saccharomyces_cerevisiae circadian_rhythms in mus_musculus and the root clock in arabidopsis_thaliana results from these results we discovered that each algorithm had different strengths based on our findings we make recommendations for selecting and applying these methods depending on the nature of the data and the periodic patterns of interest additionally these results can also be used to inform the design of large_scale biological rhythm experiments so that the resulting data can be used with these algorithms to detect periodic signals more effectively many methods for detecting periodicity or patterns in biological time series data exist and these methods often come from scientific fields outside of biology although these methods may perform well for their original area of intended use it is often unclear how well they will perform on a given biological dataset in this study we investigate the utility of four algorithms ours is not the first effort to tackle this question of algorithm selection in de they compared the performance of their new method with five existing_methods visual_inspection fourier and correlation scores partial_least single_pulse model cubic spline model and bayesian_model on three cell_cycle datasets from saccharomyces_cerevisiae by they demonstrated that their new method outperformed these other methods at identifying genes from benchmark gene_sets which was attributed to including a measure of amplitude in their scoring as in many such studies they found that no single method performed the best across all their benchmark sets analyzed the performance of five algorithms phase consistency address reduction cyclohedron test stable persistence and lombscargle ls on the outputs of the segmentation clock in mus_musculus they compared the top results of the algorithms with benchmark sets of known cyclic genes they then looked at the algorithms top genes that were not in the benchmark sets to see if they had a biological connection to known cyclic behaviors some methods performed better in the first task others performed better in the second analyzed the performance of three closely_related spectral_analysis schemes ls capon and missing_data amplitude and phase estimation mapes on a cell_cycle dataset in s cerevisiae for their benchmarks they used the list of genes involved in the cell_cycle fromand the list of genes not involved in the cell_cycle from de their results showed that ls outperformed the other methods each of these studies measured the performance of algorithms by how well they can identify known sets of genes for a given periodic process cell_cycle somitogenesis etc to avoid the potential_biases and challenges in this approach we augmented our study of biological data section with a study on synthetic datasets section so that we could quantify an algorithms performance against known ground_truth we used synthetic data to characterize algorithm performance for different signal shapes noise levels and sampling rates that are present in different organisms and technologies synthetic data were also to whom correspondence should be addressed used to investigate the algorithms ability to recover period phase and amplitude previous_studies generally focused on one type of periodic signal or one type of organism our goal is to study how algorithms perform across a variety of organisms and periodic processes we used algorithms to analyze experimental_data from several systems the cell_cycle and metabolic cycle in s cerevisiae circadian_rhythm in m musculus and the root clock in arabidopsis_thaliana we focused on microarray_datasets and designed the synthetic data to capture the characteristics of these data types after evaluating a large collection of algorithms de lichtenberg dl ls jtk cycle jtk and persistent homology ph were selected for comparison several other algorithms were evaluated but not included in further analysis because of similarity to tested algorithms being too general using pre_processing algorithms lesser performance or no available implementation these included but were not limited to cosopt arser lspr and address reduction the four algorithms were chosen because they derive from four different mathematical_methods for identifying periodicity they were also selected for their ability to work on datasets with limited_numbers of periods as the microarray_datasets we examine contain periods each defines periodicity differently weights aspects of rhythmicity differently e g amplitude profile shape and responds differently to noise irregular intervals and missing_data periodic signals are often described using the properties of cosine curves period amplitude and phase_shift period is the length of one cycle or alternatively the distance before a pattern repeats amplitude is one half the peak to trough height phase_shift is the distance that the signal has been shifted in time each of these algorithms returns a list of p values or scores for each of the time series evaluated based on some combination of periodicity and or amplitude the ls method was developed in the field of astrophysics as a fourier style method but was designed to deal with data that exhibit irregular sampling which is typical of observational_data in astronomy it measures the correspondence to sinusoidal curves and determines their statistical_significance jtk has its origins in statistics but was adapted for biological data in it correlates pairs of points and then computes the significance of the correlation to that of a reference curve the algorithm described by de lichtenberg dl was constructed specifically for the yeast_cell and thus comes directly from biology it measures the periodicity of a signal but also takes_into a measure of the amplitude it uses permutations to generate a background distribution for measuring significance ph comes from the field of computational topology an area that lies at the intersection of mathematics and computer science ph examines persistence pairings of minima and maxima along the curve a single minima and maxima is considered to be the ideal perfect oscillation additional smaller oscillations create more minima and maxima that are interpreted as a less perfect curve our findings_suggest that curve shape has the largest impact on the scoring of biological_signals by these periodicity detection_algorithms especially under conditions of higher noise or lower sampling_rate algorithms such as ls dl and jtk rely on comparing data with reference curves ls and dl assume a sinusoidal curve jtk can use a user specified curve therefore they will perform most accurately when the data match the assumptions specified by the reference curves additionally as noise increases or sampling_rate decreases the ability of these algorithms to classify non standard_curve shapes degrades much more rapidly than for true cosine shapes this is helpful when a specific type of shape is being sought and any other types should be filtered out but is limited in a more exploratory setting when it is unknown what curve shapes a periodic process might produce this also brings up the question of preprocessing the data to remove factors external to the expression levels noise systematic_error population averaging effects etc to perform preprocessing the type of external factor must be identified and quantitatively characterized in way that an algorithm can correct for it additionally computationally fitting and resampling data at a higher rate can make a dataset more amenable to computational_approaches but in the case of ls and jtk would alter the resulting p values although these could increase performance of periodicity detection_algorithms caution_should to avoid altering the underlying signal the applicability of the recommendations will vary depending on how well the characteristics in the data are known and how well the assumptions of these tests match these characteristics in cases where the characteristics of noise the number of cycles or shape are not known in the dataset these recommendations should be relaxed and we suggest using several algorithms additionally if the characteristics of the data are not similar to the synthetic signals e g profiles are more similar to a square_wave then the recommendations may not perform as desired given their different underlying ideas of periodicity these algorithms could be used together to recover a more comprehensive set of periodic signals within a dataset this is especially useful when the signal attributes are not known beforehand additionally these algorithms also contain components for measuring phase_shift and amplitude that could be used separately and supplemented with other methods amplitude could be a useful measure of regulation and phase_shift is an important measure of timing being able to accurately estimate phase_shifts between transcripts can allow us to reconstruct timing and suggest regulatory_relationships another issue is how to interpret and compare the p values or scores that are returned by these methods the work ofand futschik andsuggests that the significance of the results is generally overestimated in statistical_methods where the null_model may have more randomness than exists in the data this causes the significance values to be excessively optimistic and overestimates the number of periodic genes additionally ls and jtk return p values and these p values change if the sampling density changes therefore the periodicity of two identical profiles one with twice as many time points as the other is not directly comparable using the final p values from these algorithms as we have seen in this study there are several algorithms that could be run against biological_datasets that will return results of interest to improve these results there must be an understanding of what information is available in the data what answers are being sought in the data and which algorithms will be best able to bridge the gap between these two points
