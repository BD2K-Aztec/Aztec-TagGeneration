prediction of nucleosome_positioning by the incorporation of frequencies and distributions of three different nucleotide segment lengths into a general pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition motivation nucleosome_positioning plays_important many eukaryotic intranuclear processes such as transcriptional_regulation and chromatin_structure formation the investigations of nucleosome_positioning rules provide a deeper_understanding of these intracellular_processes results nucleosome_positioning prediction was performed using a model consisting of types of variables characterizing a dna sequencethe number of nucleotide_sequences the number of nucleotide combinations in period of a helix and mono and di nucleotide distributions in dna_fragments using recently_proposed stringent benchmark_datasets with low biases for saccharomyces_cerevisiae homo_sapiens caenorhabditis_elegans and drosophila_melanogaster the present model was shown to have a better prediction_performance than the recently_proposed predictors this model was able to display the common and organism dependent factors that affect nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences as well therefore the predictors developed here can accurately_predict nucleosome_positioning and help determine the key factors_influencing this process nucleosomes are the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin and each one is formed by dna base_pair bp sequences wrapped tightly around a histone_octamer the precise nucleosome formation and its inhibitory_effects on promoters enhancers and insulators play crucial roles in the precise regulation of transcription the precise nucleosome_positioning facilitates dna_replication dna_repair and rna_splicing therefore the elucidation of nucleosome_positioning steps may allow an in depth understanding of various biological_processes recently high_resolution genome_wide nucleosome maps were obtained for several model_organisms in contrast to this the determinant factors of the nucleosome_positioning remained_unclear however with the increase in the availability of high_quality experimental_datasets various computational_methods and tools for the prediction of nucleosome_positioning were proposed reviewed in providing valuable insights and allowing the mechanisms determining nucleosome_positioning to be unveiled furthermore the construction of the accurate predictors can lead to the possibility of the analysis of single_nucleotide snp and gene_mutation effects on this process many of these predictors were constructed based on the information about the frequencies and distributions of the combinations of polynucleotide sequences as feature_vectors sequence_dependent mechanical_properties such as sequence_dependent geometry and dna_fragment flexibility were also considered for the characterization of nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences furthermore a powerful web_server called psein one was developed where all existing feature_vectors for dna rna and protein peptide_sequences can be generated see references_cited in together with the generation of the feature_vectors for the sequences defined by users themselves for human homo_sapiens worm caenorhabditis_elegans and fly drosophila_melanogaster genomes constructed the stringent benchmark_datasets of nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences with low similarities in order to examine the performance of nucleosome position predictors additionally predictors inuc pseknc and inuc psestnc we call inuc pse predictors were proposed and they were shown to have better success_rates in the prediction of nucleosome_positioning than any of the previously_developed predictors furthermore for yeast_saccharomyces genomes constructed a stringent benchmark_dataset using the same methodology as and predicted the nucleosome_positioning in yeast_genome based on the deformation energies of dna_fragments in order for inuc pse predictors to show the best prediction_performance for nucleosome_positioning in different organisms different sets of parameter_values must be used the sequence predicted as the nucleosome forming sequence in one organism may be predicted as the nucleosome inhibiting sequence in another organism this shows that the function of any given dna_sequence in assisting or inhibiting nucleosome formation depends on the investigated organism however no key_factors and criteria affecting this process could be elucidated using this predictor because inuc pse predictors are based on support_vector svm additionally based on these datasets some common short motif nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences were found however the nucleosome_positioning cannot be predicted sufficiently well using only these motives in this study a novel nucleosome_positioning predictor was developed based on the linear_regression consisting of types of variables with different fragment length scalesthe number of nucleotide_sequences the number of nucleotide combinations in period of helix and mono and di nucleotides distributions in whole dna_fragments this predictor exhibited better prediction_performance than the recently_developed inuc pse predictors for the same benchmark_datasets of human and fly genomes and displayed common and organism dependent key_factors of nucleosome_positioning explicitly a series of recent_publications demonstrated in compliance with chous step rule that in order to establish a useful sequence_based statistical predictor for a biological system the following five guidelines should be observed a how to construct or select a valid benchmark_dataset to train and test the predictor b how to represent the biological sequence samples by catching their key features associated with the target to be predicted c how to introduce or develop a powerful algorithm to operate the prediction d how to properly perform crossvalidation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy and e how to establish a user_friendly web_server for the predictor that is accessible to the public below these steps are further explained ls model based predictor can predict nucleosome_positioning in human and fly genomes more accurately than the recently_proposed nucleosome position predictors can additionally the predictor defined here can display the details of organism dependent key_factors for the determination of nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences the chosen s seq s seq s seq and s seq in ls model differed greatly between human worm and fly genomes supplementary this indicates there are many organism dependent differences in the features contributing to the nucleosome formation the coefficients of these variables m d t and p and constant value q obtained by multiple_regression clearly showed organismdependent specificities supplementary these differences are presented in the following examples i in ls models of these genomes that contained common variables their coefficients signs often differed between the organisms ii there were only variables with the same signs of their coefficients between these organisms and these were t ctt or aag t ttg or caa p ttttt or aaaaa p gcttc or gaagc p gtgtc or gacac and p ggatc or gatcc poly da dt sequences such as aaaaa sequence are known as physically rigid sequences therefore the sequences containing these motives inhibit the nucleosome formation in the genomes of several organisms which was confirmed by experimental_evidence and the use of different nucleosome_positioning predictors which is consistent with the results presented here the sequences with high_gc were reported to have a nucleosome forming tendency however considering the results of the recent_studies nucleotides found in the nucleosome forming sequences are a or t nucleotides located at the appropriate positions which seems to agree with the results obtained in this study iii when only the variables described above were chosen in ls model based predictor accs for human worm and fly genomes were acc and respectively which is much lower than the values obtained using the model with suitable variables however even when these variables were removed from the ls model based predictor with suitable variables the decrease in accs for human worm and fly genomes was not considerable and the obtained acc values were and respectively this indicates that the organism specific sequence_patterns dominantly contribute to the determination of nucleosome forming abilities iv the weight of the contribution of the set s seq j k nuc or kj k nuc for each k is defined as wk number of chosen s seq j k nuc or k j k the obtained wk values were different for different organisms for example w k as the smallest k and w k as the largest k were obtained for human worm and fly genomes respectively this indicates that the length_scale of nucleotide combinations required for the characterization of nucleosome forming sequences depends on the organism analyzed v the weight of the contribution of the set s seq i di seq or di seq near and far from the center of sequence dyad position was defined as wnear wnear values were similar values in the datasets for the investigated organisms the values of wfar and were obtained for human worm and fly genomes respectively where wfar for fly was shown to be of that for worm and for human this suggests that the contribution of the sequences far from the dyad position to the nucleosome formation depends on the organism type using the tns model based predictor the obtained acc values of nucleosome position predictions for human worm and fly genomes were much lower than those obtained using ls model based predictor while acc was obtained for yeast_genome this clearly demonstrates organism dependent characteristics of nucleosome forming and inhibiting sequences showing that the nucleosome_positioning is much more easily predicted in yeast than in higher organisms weights of the contributions of s seq j k nuc or k j k the predictors developed here can predict nucleosome_positioning in human fly and yeast genomes with higher accuracy than the recently_proposed predictors and can determine the key factors_influencing this positioning in human worm fly and yeast genomes in contrast to the recently_proposed inuc pse predictors ls model based predictor developed in this study is based on the following sequence properties as well i combinations of nucleotides located further away than those considered by inuc pse predictors ii more detailed distributions of a t and dinucleotide sequences in a dna_fragment than those in inuc pse predictors these properties most likely contribute to the exhibited improved_performance of the predictor proposed here in comparison with the inuc pse predictors however the variable selections and the formalization of the model can be improved and further modifications are needed for this predictor to perform better than the recent ones recent_studies suggested that sequence_dependent geometry and flexibility of each dna_fragment may play_important in the determination of its nucleosome forming ability furthermore the nucleosome forming ability of each sequence may change with intracellular and environmental_conditions because of this the predictors should be modified in the future by considering these physical and chemical influences additionally as demonstrated in a series of recent_publications e g during the development of new prediction_methods user_friendly and publicly_accessible web_servers can significantly enhance the impacts of these tools therefore the future efforts will include providing a web_server for the use of the prediction method presented here
