a fast and robust statistical_test based on likelihood_ratio with bartlett correction to identify granger_causality between gene_sets we propose a likelihood_ratio lrt with bartlett correction in order to identify granger_causality between sets of time_series the performance of the proposed test is compared to a previously_published bootstrap based_approach lrt is shown to be significantly_faster and statistically powerful even within non normal_distributions an r package named ggranger containing an implementation for both granger_causality identification tests is also provided temporal association between genes in time series expression data can be studied through the identification of granger_causality granger_causality in time series data was mathematically formalized byand later implemented to a multivariate framework by allowing the identification of conditional relationships recently proposed the application of granger_causality to identify relationships between sets of genes i e to identify if a set containing n genes granger causes another set with m genes their main goal is to create networks representing pathway level connections that could help the understanding of molecular_mechanisms biological_processes in the above_mentioned work the authors propose a bootstrap procedure to test and identify granger_causality despite the usefulness of the bootstrap method to identify test granger_causality it to whom correspondence should be addressed is computationally_intensive becoming particularly slow when accurate p values are required to overcome this drawback here we propose an analytical_approach based on likelihood_ratio lrt for time series experiments containing less than points we also propose a bartlett correction in order to improve the asymptotic approximation of the statistics two simulations were carried_out in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed lrt with bartlett correction based test first since the granger_causality between sets of gene_expression time series data is a generalization of the multivariate version proposed by it is necessary to know if the proposed lrt is as good as the classic walds test in terms of statistical_power in a multivariate context by using the vector autoregressive var model_simulation the second simulation consists in comparing the performance of the proposed test with the previously_published bootstrap based method in a context where one would like to identify granger_causality between sets of time series data the results show that i the lrt is equivalent to walds test in the multivariate_model in terms of statistical_power ii the lrt is much faster and has a higher statistical_power than the bootstrap method when analyzing sets of time series data and iii both the lrt and bootstrap can control the rate of false_positives even under non normal noises an r package named ggranger containing the identification method for granger causalities the bootstrap procedure and the lrt with bartlett correction is provided
