genome_analysis anntools a comprehensive and versatile annotation toolkit for genomic_variants anntools is a versatile bioinformatics application designed for comprehensive annotation of a full spectrum of human genome_variation novel and known single nucleotide_substitutions snp snv short insertions_deletions indel and structural_variants copy_number sv cnv the variants are interpreted by interrogating data compiled from constantly updated sources in addition to detailed functional characterization of the coding variants anntools searches for overlaps with regulatory_elements disease trait associated loci known segmental_duplications and artifact prone regions thereby offering an integrated and comprehensive analysis of genomic_data the tool conveniently accepts user provided tracks for custom annotation and offers flexibility in input data_formats the output is generated in the universal variant_call high annotation speed makes anntools suitable for high_throughput facilities while a low memory_footprint and modest cpu requirements allow it to operate on a personal computer the application is freely_available for public use the package includes installation scripts and a set of helper tools availability http anntools sourceforge net increasing volumes of next_generation and microarray_data demand efficient bioinformatics_analysis tools capable of highthroughput processing and accurate interpretation of various types of detected changes detailed annotation of the genomic_variants with assessment of their possible functional or regulatory_roles allows researchers to highlight potentially significant findings and prioritize candidates for further analyses while there are a number of bioinformatics_tools developed specifically for this purpose to the best of our knowledge the majority of the published_methods are limited to whom correspondence should be addressed to interpretation of single nucleotide_substitutions snp snv and small insertions_deletions indel and do not currently offer an integrated analysis of the full spectrum of variants occurring in the coding_and of the human_genome here we present anntools a fast versatile and user_friendly application designed for complete annotation of novel and publicly known snp snv indel and sv cnv called from next_generation and microarray_data the main advantages of our method are its integrative approach not limited by the specific type or genomic location of the variant the ability to evaluate both functional and regulatory_regions and incorporation of variant frequency data to highlight potentially significant variants our application allows individual and batch query processing and offers flexibility in input data_formats the output is generated in the universal variant_call vcf as the current de facto community standard complete documentation is available on the anntools website_http anntools sourceforge net we provide installation scripts demos and a set of helper tools to perform custom annotation and data transformation for future visualization and analysis anntools was applied to three sets of next_generation data snp calls generated at mount sinai school of medicine from whole_exome of the caucasian trios hapmap ceu and sets of indel and sv calls downloaded from the pilot_project of the genomes consortium since the available indel and sv calls were in the hg assembly of the human_genome we converted the coordinates to hg using the ucsc lift over tool out of a total of snps were previously_reported in dbsnp and were novel the results are summarized in supplementary table s supplementary_materials examples of the anntools output are presented in supplementary table s supplementary_materials comparison of the anntools promoter prediction with the regionminer and gene_promoter tools both part of the popular commercial genomatix software_suite http www genomatix de demonstrated concordance genomatix localized variants to putative promoter_regions while anntools identified including all identified by the genomatix tools annotation speed for each set was lines min on the x gnu linux ubuntu lts server direct comparison with two popular annotation programs annovar http www openbioinformatics org annovar and variant effect predictor tool snpeff http snpeff sourceforge net confirmed that our method is sufficiently fast while having the advantage of providing a more comprehensive annotation for the genomic_variants see performance testing in supplementary_materials to evaluate the impact of the expanding size of the database on annotation speed we tested anntools performance under different conditions and determined that a fold expansion of the database caused only a fold increase in annotation time as a result of records being sorted and indexed see performance testing in supplementary_material complete annotated vcf files for each dataset are available from the anntools website in summary we developed a fast and comprehensive tool capable of annotating multiple types of human genomic_variants in a highthroughput setting easily parallelized python source_code allows for the simultaneous annotation of multiple call sets in highperformance computer cluster environments on the other hand a low memory_footprint and modest cpu requirements enable anntools to run on a personal computer the tool is designed with clear separation of application logic from the user_interface and data permitting independent development testing and maintenance
