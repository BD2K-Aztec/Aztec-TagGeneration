mixture_models for analysis of the taxonomic_composition of metagenomes motivation inferring the taxonomic profile of a microbial_community from a large collection of anonymous dna sequencing_reads is a challenging_task in metagenomics because existing_methods for taxonomic_profiling of metagenomes are all based on the assignment of fragmentary sequences to phylogenetic categories the accuracy of results largely depends on fragment length this dependence complicates comparative_analysis of data originating from different sequencing_platforms or resulting from different preprocessing pipelines results we here introduce a new method for taxonomic_profiling based on mixture modeling of the overall oligonucleotide distribution of a sample our results indicate that the mixture based profiles compare well with taxonomic profiles_obtained with other methods however in contrast to the existing_methods our approach shows a nearly constant profiling accuracy across all kinds of read_lengths and it operates at an unrivaled speed availability a platform independent implementation of the mixture modeling_approach is available in terms of a matlab octave toolbox at http gobics de peter taxy in addition a prototypical implementation within an easy to use interactive tool for windows can be downloaded metagenomics provides a holistic_approach to the analysis of microbial_communities that overcomes the necessity of isolating single organisms for cultivation investigating a mixture of genetic_material from the whole spectrum of organisms researchers can now obtain comprehensive descriptions even of highly_diverse communities further comparative_metagenomics offers new possibilities for studying the distinguishing characteristics of a wide_range of ecosystems which are shaped by specific combinations of microorganisms in particular research on the human_microbiome has begun to elucidate the community_structures associated with the human_body important medical perspectives for instance arise to whom correspondence should be addressed from comparing gut_microbiome profiles to differentiate between healthy and diseased states to investigate the taxonomic_composition of metagenomes many studies focus on sequencing the s rrna gene which currently provides the best resolution in terms of the available number of operational_taxonomic in the reference_databases besides the selectivity of primers another difficulty for quantitative analysis arises from the varying copy_number of the s rrna gene a pure s analysis however completely neglects the functional potential encoded in the metagenome in contrast whole metagenome sequencing allows simultaneous taxonomic and functional profiling which provides a deeper insight into the structure of a microbial_community the taxonomic_profiling of whole metagenome sequencing_reads is a challenging_task and several techniques have been developed to extract the phylogenetic_signal encoded in the sequenced material to date all approaches rely on the classification of sequencing_reads in most cases a supervised binning of sequences according to an assignment to predefined taxonomic categories is performed although an unsupervised binning is possible for longer contigs the comparison of metagenomes becomes difficult with the inclusion of unlabeled bins methods for the classification of sequencing_reads have been based either on homology using sequence_similarity or on genomic_signatures in terms of oligonucleotide composition homology based_methods include the taxonomic evaluation of blast hits and phylogenetic_analyses of particular marker_genes von or protein_domains signature based_approaches have been realized based on the correlation of oligonucleotide frequencies machine_learning and probabilistic_models all these methods are highly dependent on read_length for homology based_approaches the number of significant similarity hits decreases considerably for shorter reads additionally the estimation of genomic_signatures in sequencing_reads becomes increasingly difficult for decreasing read_lengths for sequence_lengths below bp earlier approaches showed a sharp breakdown in accuracy which has been improved with recent tools all methods require a minimum read_length in order to be applicable in many cases this condition restricts the use of ultrashort read techniques for metagenome profiling as a consequence page as do all other methods for taxonomic_profiling of whole metagenome sequences our method crucially depends on the range page
