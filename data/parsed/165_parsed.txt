genome_analysis agplus a rapid and flexible tool for aggregation plots aggregation plots are frequently used to evaluate signal distributions at user interested points in chip_seq analysis agplus a new and simple command_line enables rapid and flexible generation of text tables tailored for aggregation plots from which users can easily design multiple groups based on user definitions such as regulatory_regions or transcription_initiation availability_and this software is implemented in ruby supported on linux and mac osx and freely_available ataggregation plots are frequently used to convert genome_wide chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq into a simple curve of averaged chip_seq signal_intensities at user interested points anchor points such as regulatory_sequences aggregation plots allow differences in the signal distribution among different chip_seq to be assessed intuitively many chip_seq analysis toolkits include software for the creation of aggregation plots including homer bwtools cgat ngsplot and htseq these software are designed to analyze transcription_start tsss transcription_factor tfbss exon_intron structures etc for example ngsplot takes a configuration file of gene_sets with corresponding raw_data to produce a visual of different chipseq signal distributions at gene_loci more recently chip_seq applications have begun to offer diverse purposes for aggregation plots however user definitions of the anchor points required for aggregation plots are not trivial e g comparisons of the signal distribution of transcription_start around different gene_sets gene_ontology database or a set defined by their gene_expression data or regulatory_regions promoters enhancers or other non coding_region therefore a simpler tool for loci definitions and grouping tasks is preferred here we introduce agplus a flexible tool designed for the creation of aggregation plots using various points of user interest we have developed agplus a tool that enables rapid and flexible creation of aggregation plots this tool is expected to reduce effort and time for aggregation style analysis by chip_seq users
