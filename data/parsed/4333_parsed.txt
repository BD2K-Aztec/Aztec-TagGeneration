somvarius somatic variant identification from unpaired tissue_samples motivation somatic variant_calling typically requires paired_tumor tissue_samples yet paired normal_tissues are not always available in clinical_settings or for archival samples results we present somvarius a computational_method for detecting somatic variants using high_throughput sequencing_data from unpaired tissue_samples we evaluate the performance of the method using genomic_data from synthetic and real tumor_samples somvarius identifies somatic variants in exome seq data of coverage with at least precision and recall_rates when compared with paired tissue somatic variant_calls in real tumor_samples we demonstrate the utility of somvarius by identifying somatic_mutations in formalin_fixed samples and tracking clonal dynamics of oncogenic mutations in targeted deep sequencing_data from pre_and treatment leukemia samples availability_and somvarius is written in python and available at http www sjdlab org resources assessment of somatic and germ_line mutations to tailor personalized diagnosis and treatment is becoming a corner stone for precision_medicine in oncology initiatives somatic_mutations are typically detected by comparing sequencing_data from target e g tumor and matched control tissues e g benign_tissue from the same patient initiatives such as the icgc tcga dream genomic mutation calling challenge have shown that popular algorithms can detect somatic_mutations from paired_tumor tissue_samples with reasonably high_accuracy however in many practical situations matched control tissues are not available and it remains_challenging to distinguish between somatic and germ_line variants in those cases for instance matched normal samples are not routinely_obtained in clinical care additionally a considerable proportion of the older ffpe and fresh_frozen tumor_samples have no matched control tissues available popular variant_calling tools are not designed to identify somatic and germ_line variants from unpaired tissue_samples and there have been only limited efforts to detect somatic_mutations from unpaired samples we present somvarius a computational_method for detecting somatic variants using high_throughput sequencing_data from unpaired tissue_samples somvarius accepts sorted alignment files bam as input and outputs predicted somatic_mutations in the variant_call vcf thereby enabling its easy integration into any standard genome analysis_pipeline it also generates an optional output providing information about the status of known
