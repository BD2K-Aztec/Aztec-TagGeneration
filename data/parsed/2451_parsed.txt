inferring dynamic gene_networks under varying conditions for transcriptomic network comparison motivation elucidating the differences between cellular_responses to various biological conditions or external_stimuli is an important challenge in systems_biology many approaches have been developed to reverse_engineer a cellular system called gene network from time series microarray_data in order to understand a transcriptomic response under a condition of interest comparative topological_analysis has also been applied based on the gene_networks inferred independently from each of the multiple time series datasets under varying conditions to find critical differences between these networks however these comparisons often lead to misleading_results because each network contains considerable noise due to the limited length of the time series results we propose an integrated approach for inferring multiple gene_networks from time series expression data under varying conditions to the best of our knowledge our approach is the first reverse_engineering method that is intended for transcriptomic network comparison between varying conditions furthermore we propose a state of the art parameter_estimation method relevance weighted recursive elastic_net for providing higher_precision and recall than existing reverse_engineering methods we analyze experimental_data of mcf_human stimulated by epidermal_growth or heregulin with several doses and provide novel biological_hypotheses through network comparison availability the software netcomp is available at http bonsai ims u tokyo ac jp shima netcomp systems_biology aims to understand a cellular_process through quantitative mathematical_models one of the important problems in systems_biology is to reverse_engineer the dynamics of genegene_interactions called gene network from time series expression data several techniques have been developed for the mathematical_modeling of these dynamics from time series expression data notably differential_equation state_space model rangel to whom correspondence should be addressed vector autoregressive var model opgen and dynamic_bayesian in this light a key challenge in the application of these methods is to develop new strategies and theoretical_frameworks for the comparative_analysis of multiple gene_networks that is to infer gene_networks from multiple time series expression data under various biological conditions or external_stimuli for example different doses of a chemical compound or a growth_factor and to identify subnetworks interactions that are conserved or not conserved among the conditions comparative topological_analysis provides a very good opportunity to reveal the differences between regulatory structures and understand cellular_responses to varying conditions however this is not an easy task because the number of candidate interactions is very large as compared to the number of true interactions this problem becomes more serious for short time series data as of october in time series experiments designed to comparison between multiple biological conditions from public_databases such as gene_expression geo and array express were short time series with fewer than time points in these cases the application of existing reverseengineering methods to these short time series data leads to poor_performance in that a large_number and false_negatives are produced in network_inference therefore the noisy interactions inferred using existing_methods make it difficult to identify critical differences and similarities between conditions and to produce useful results in this study we propose a novel integrated approach for inferring multiple gene_networks from time series expression data under varying biological conditions it should be noted that earlier algorithms aimed to infer a gene network under a condition of interest and they were not intended to compare multiple gene_networks that is to infer each gene network independently based on only samples from a condition of interest called exact samples our approach is different from these earlier approaches in that it aims at both network_inference and comparison and it uses exact samples along with samples from other conditions called relevant samples to the best of our knowledge other than the proposed method no other method is available for reverse_engineering multiple gene_networks in order to compare transcriptomic responses under different conditions shows a conceptual view of the proposed method our key assumption is that large regions of the gene_networks are conserved and that small regions are changed between conditions this implies that a network model for generating a sample under conceptual view of our method using an example of inferring gene_networks under three different biological conditions no stimulation and no perturbation stimulation with receptor ligands and perturbation with small compounds from time series microarray_experiments traditional inference is based on exact sample information black line our proposed inference is based on both exact sample information gray line and relevant sample information black line a condition is partially related to the other network models for generating a sample under other conditions we develop a new parameter_estimation method called relevance weighted recursive elastic_net rw renet for inferring multiple network_structures based on both exact sample information and relevant sample information rw renet automatically infers conserved interactions from samples under all the relevant conditions and unconserved interactions from samples under each condition with a similarity based on the comparison between estimators this enables us to achieve a higher prediction_accuracy of inferring gene_networks as compared to earlier methods without losing critical differences between gene_networks under certain conditions we test our approach using simulated_data and experimental_data of mcf_human to assess its performance relative to that of the existing_methods we addressed the problem of inferring and comparing multiple gene_networks between varying conditions from time_series numerous approaches have been developed using mathematical_models in order to reverse_engineer a gene network under a condition of interest from time series data however no studies have addressed the problem of gene network_inference from the viewpoint of network comparison we proposed a novel integrated approach for reverse_engineering multiple gene_networks that is intended for transcriptomic network comparison a stateof the art estimation method called rw renet automatically infers conserved interactions from samples under all the relevant_information and unconserved interactions from samples under each condition with a similarity based on the comparison between the estimators this method achieves higher pr and rc than the earlier methods in gene network_inference and comparison we also supported biological_hypotheses and provided new biological findings in experimental_data of mcf_breast under egf and hrg stimulations through comparative network_analysis using rw renet
