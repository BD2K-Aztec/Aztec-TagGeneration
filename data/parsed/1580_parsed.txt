genetics_and enriching targeted sequencing_experiments for rare_disease alleles motivation next generation targeted_resequencing of genome_wide gwas associated genomic_regions is a common approach for follow_up of indirect association of common_alleles however it is prohibitively_expensive to sequence all the samples from a well powered gwas study with sufficient depth of coverage to accurately call rare genotypes as a result many studies may use next_generation for single_nucleotide snp discovery in a smaller number of samples with the intent to genotype candidate snps with rare alleles captured by resequencing this approach is reasonable but may be inefficient for rare alleles if samples are not carefully_selected for the resequencing experiment results we have developed a probability based_approach sampleseq to select samples for a targeted_resequencing experiment that increases the yield of rare_disease alleles substantially over random_sampling of cases or controls or sampling based on genotypes at associated snps from gwas data this technique allows for smaller_sample for resequencing experiments or allows the capture of rarer risk_alleles when following up multiple regions sampleseq selects subjects with an even representation of all the regions sampleseq also can be used to calculate the sample_size needed for the resequencing to increase the chance of successful capture of rare alleles of desired frequencies genome_wide gwas are based on the premise that densely genotyped common_alleles will have statistical_power causal associations with traits at nearby ungenotyped common mutations through short range linkage_disequilibrium ld the basis for this strategy is the common disease common_variant cdcv hypothesis this approach has been proven to be effective in many scenarios for mapping small genomic_regions to traits see the national human_genome to whom correspondence should be addressed for all simulated scenarios we calculated the number of rare_disease alleles captured for the cdrv scenarios where the allele_frequency of the trait locus is well estimated the sampleseq algorithm consistently provided higher_yields of captured disease alleles than the other methods for all sample_size thresholds supplementary tables s these results demonstrate the benefit in efficiency that sampleseq can provide over the other alternatives the yield of rare_disease alleles provided by sampleseq is a little higher over all sample_sizes than by ranking case subjects by their burden of risk_alleles the other three alternative_approaches were less efficient than sampleseq by large percentages among the four alternative_approaches those relying on the burden of the proxy marker risk_alleles were better than those not using this information and those focusing on cases were better than those not limited to cases these results are as expected as both the burden of marker risk_alleles and disease status are informative for the likelihood of carrying real disease variants as sampleseq is able to appropriately combine these two pieces of information it often results in a more efficient selection of subjects than the alternatives when only one piece of information was used using the burden of proxy marker alleles performed_similarly to the random_selection of cases with the former being slightly better when the prevalence was k and and the latter slightly better when k and we also observed that as trait prevalence increased the total number of captured rare_disease alleles decreased supplementary tables s this was due to the fact that the same number of disease variants with similar effects would account for a high fraction of heritability for a low prevalence disease than for a high prevalence disease which resulted in a higher likelihood for a patient of a low prevalence disease to carry a disease variant in the targeted_regions in our simulations we also simulated a single region of size mb with a single disease variant the results followed the same pattern data not shown we note that sampleseq is sensitive to very low values of p d as the algorithm is involved with solving linear equations for which the solutions will be highly_variable due to nearly singular matrices at very small values of p d our experience is that p d should be at leastthe maximum possible disease alleles over all sample_sizes in our simulated scenario the random_selection of cases performed much better than using the burden of proxy marker alleles this is most likely due to the large number of disease alleles to be found among the cases on both allelic backgrounds of snp a compared to the number of causal alleles in controls for the cdcv scenario we compared sampleseq to the alternative_methods when the disease alleles were not rare but we assumed that p d in our calculations in these experiments sampleseq was slightly more efficient than the burden of proxy alleles in cases and was slightly less efficient than the burden of proxy risk_alleles regardless of case status supplementary this was also true when p d was close to the true frequency of d also notable was the generally smaller magnitude of differencesamong the other three methods these results are due to the presence of many disease alleles in both cases and controls as a result of the subtle effect_sizes simulated in this scenario we further summarized the results of these simulations by comparing the average expected counts of disease alleles as determined by sampleseq e d to the average count of observed disease alleles d for each scenario and sample_size as the calculation of e ik is based on a hypothetical disease variant frequency p d in our calculations e d may not match the true number of disease alleles for the cdrv scenarios where the frequency of d was between and the ratio of the average expected to observed alleles across sample_sizes were for k for k for k and for k when the allele_frequency of d was constrained to fall within the range and p d was set to the ratio of e d to d was for k however for the sa scenario the ratio of average e d to d was although this value is counting the observation of all disease alleles in a region where there were disease alleles in the simulation per region also for the cdcv scenario the ratio of average e d to d was demonstrating that our method is based on finding rare_disease alleles and that if the disease alleles are common they will occur much more often than expected by sampleseq assuming a rare p d although e ik changes as the hypothetical disease variant frequency changes using these estimates to rank subjects when an incorrect allele_frequency is used in the calculation is still an effective means of selecting subjects to demonstrate this we calculated e d under p d and using the simulation parameters from the experiment in and present their correlation_coefficients in while the magnitude of the value of e d is proportional to the assumed value of p d the ranking of subjects is similar even when p d is misspecified five regions one rare_disease variant per region k correlations for cases are in the upper triangle and those for controls are in the lower triangle variant than a case subject who is heterozygous for some of those risk_alleles sampleseq allows us to quantify their probabilities of carrying real disease variants and then select subjects accordingly we observe that compared to random controls samples of random cases have much better performance for discovering rare_disease alleles which is consistent_with some investigators may choose to evaluate a set of controls in order to perform screening with association tests before proceeding to large_scale variant based genotyping this is likely the most effective strategy when resources are abundant for resequencing studies and sample_sizes are large however when sample_sizes are small we would expect most of the ability to detect the presence of rare_disease alleles in the population to come from the cases as the majority of samples selected by sampleseq will be cases in some situations it may be reasonable to resequence some controls to augment the sampleseq selection the control_subjects could then be used to screen variants for frequency differences and prioritize for genotyping this comparison would be biased due to the frequency enrichment achieved by sampleseq but could help discern the snps that should be tested for association with the trait with unbiased approaches such as genotyping in the full cohort however reallocating resources to sequence additional controls would also lower the chance of seeing real disease variants in the cases if the number of subjects that can be resequenced is small we advocate also using the sequence_context and putative biological impact of variants to prioritize snps for genotyping as there will not be a large amount of statistical_information for comparing rare_variant frequencies in small samples some recent research has shown that association testing from sequence_data may provide slightly more statistical_power than variant based genotyping on a per subject basis using two recently_developed tests of association however we note that due to the large difference in the cost of resequencing to the cost of variant based genotyping on a per unit of resources basis many more subjects could be genotyped with variant based_methods than could be resequenced thereby the statistical_power an association might be considerably better in a large sample of variant based genotypes than in a small sample of sequence_based genotypes utilizing the same resources the goal of this work is to optimize the resources expended for resequencing studies preserving dna samples and financial assets for subsequent steps in investigations the key element of the model that provides sampleseq with a performance advantage over counting common risk_alleles is the assumption of rare ancestral recombination between snps a and d we assumed that disease variant d originated on the risk_allele a background which resulted in three haplotypes ad ad and ad to break up the ld between the snps through recombination the recombination event needs to occur in the double heterogyzotes for which the frequency is quite low as d is rare moreover if the two snps are close enough to have very low recombination fraction between them then the chance of breaking up the ld between the snps will be small this is supported by our simulation_data the recombinant haplotype frequency averaged across all our cdrv haplotype pools suggesting p da is a reasonable assumption it is implemented in our software for the ease of computation in simulations where this assumption was badly violated such as the cdcv scenario the performance of sampleseq was still competitive with the burden of risk_alleles in cases we also noted that as the prevalence in our simulations increased but the ors of rare_disease variants was held_constant the proportion of cases not carrying any risk_alleles at any of the target disease_loci increased this observation is a result of our simulation strategy but it is perhaps worthy of note that high prevalence traits may require many more rare risk_alleles than low prevalence traits for the cdrv model to account for most of the trait heritability for a highly_heritable common trait thereby if there are not a large number of associated regions identified for a high prevalence trait it is possible that the yield of rare_disease alleles from a
