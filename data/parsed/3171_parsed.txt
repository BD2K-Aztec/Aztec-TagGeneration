systems_biology multi task consensus clustering of genome_wide transcriptomes from related biological conditions downloaded from motivation identifying the shared and pathogen_specific components of host transcriptional_regulatory programs is important for understanding the principles of regulation of immune_response recent efforts in systems_biology studies of infectious_diseases have resulted in a large collection of datasets measuring host transcriptional_response to various pathogens computational_methods to identify and compare gene_expression modules across different infections offer a powerful way to identify strain specific and shared components of the regulatory program an important challenge is to identify statistically_robust gene_expression modules as well as to reliably detect genes that change their module memberships between infections results we present mulcch multi task spectral consensus clustering for hierarchically related_tasks a consensus extension of a multi task clustering_algorithm to infer high_confidence strain specific host response modules under infections from multiple virus strains on simulated_data mulcch more accurately identifies genes_exhibiting pathogen_specific patterns compared to non consensus and nonmulti task clustering_approaches application of mulcch to mammalian tran scriptional response to a panel of influenza_viruses showed that our method identifies clusters with greater coherence compared to non consensus methods further mulcch derived clusters are enriched for several immune system related processes and regulators in summary mulcch provides a reliable module based_approach to identify molecular_pathways and gene_sets characterizing commonality and specificity of host response to viruses of different pathogenicities availability_and the source_code is available at https bitbucket org roygroup transcriptional_regulatory play_an in driving genome_wide mrna_levels in dynamic biological_processes such as response to stress or pathogenic infections identification of unique and shared components of transcriptional_regulatory can be useful for designing more sensitive therapeutics or to exploit shared vulnerabilities of the immune system recently compendia of genome_wide mrna_levels measuring mammalian host response have become available for multiple related conditions that represent responses to similar types of infections e g different influenza_viruses or from similar diseases e g different respiratory_diseases such datasets can be computationally interrogated to identify common and pathogen_specific components of transcriptional_regulatory transcriptional_regulatory exhibit a modular_organization defined by sets of genes that are co expressed under different environmental_conditions thus a module based analysis for each condition followed by a comparison of module patterns across conditions can provide a systematic identification of the major patterns of conserved and condition specific transcriptional_response between different conditions differentially responding genes can be identified as those genes that change their module assignments between conditions to study condition specific modules and identify genes that switch module assignments we need a correspondence between modules across multiple conditions and be able to identify statistically_robust changes in module assignments between conditions consensus clustering is an established procedure for improving the robustness of clustering_algorithms which are typically used for module identification however consensus clustering has thus far not been applied to module identification across multiple conditions a second challenge is that the individual conditions themselves might be related which if exploited can improve the confidence in detecting shared and context specific patterns a third related challenge is that identification of differentially responding genes using modulebased analysis have typically focused on two conditions however as the number of conditions increase it is important to find sets of genes that might be induced in a subset of conditions but repressed in another subset to reliably identify condition specific and common patterns of expression across multiple conditions such as infection to multiple viruses we propose multi task spectral consensus clustering for hierarchically related_tasks mulcch a new consensus clustering extension for existing multi task clustering_algorithms multi task clustering provides a principled machine_learning framework to cluster multiple datasets one from each condition simultaneously each dataset from a condition is viewed as a separate task and is clustered separately while information is shared between the tasks multi task extensions have been developed for specific clustering_algorithms including k means and mixture_models multi task clustering frameworks can provide a correspondence between the clusters across the datasets making it straightforward to identify gene_sets that respond in a conserved manner across the conditions here we provide a consensus clustering extension to an existing multi task clustering_algorithm arboretum which additionally exploits hierarchical relationships among the clustering tasks section arboretum is a gaussian_mixture based multi task clustering approach that infers modules of co expressed genes from multiple gene_expression while incorporating the hierarchical relationships across different conditions the arboretum algorithm was originally applied to expression datasets from different species in a phylogeny but is broadly_applicable to multi task clustering problems that are related by a hierarchy the consensus clustering component of our approach relies on spectral clustering which is applicable for clustering entities related by a graph we represent an ensemble of multiple clusterings of the same dataset as a weighted graph of genes with edge_weights representing the confidence of gene_pairs that are in the same cluster we compared our method to other existing clustering_algorithms using simulated and real expression data we evaluated the algorithms based on well established measures of cluster quality as well as new criteria that are important for identifying condition specific e g virus specific and strain specific genes based on simulations we found that mulcch and consensus versions of tested clustering_algorithms dominated most other clustering_algorithms in terms of cluster quality and ability to accurately detect genes that change module assignments we applied our approach to measurements of host transcriptional_response to influenza_virus in human calu cell_line and mouse_lung samples our results identified modules with common and pathogenicity specific patterns that are associated with various immune_response processes taken together our approach provides a systematic way to detect common and condition specific patterns of transcriptional_response across multiple conditions while exploiting known relationships among the conditions with our ever increasing ability to profile transcriptional_responses from multiple diverse biological contextsdifferent diseases cell_types or infectionsthe need to identify common and context specific regulatory network_components is becoming increasingly important this is especially a challenge in systems_biology studies of infectious_disease research where such shared and unique network_components can guide common treatment_regimens as well as identify host response aspects that are triggered as a function of strain virulence to address this challenge we proposed mulcch a multi task consensus clustering approach to identify sets of host_genes that are co expressed in a similar manner under infection with multiple viruses as well as to identify genes that exhibit differential_patterns of expression between subsets of virus_infections application of our approach to human and mouse transcriptomic_data enabled us to find genes and processes that responded in a virus or pathogenicity specific_manner module based analysis of transcriptional_responses is a powerful approach to identify the major patterns of expression during a dynamic process and several approaches have been developed to identify these modules from one condition however when considering multiple labeled conditions such as the different viruses in our problem methods that can use existing condition labels while finding gene groups within each condition are needed the benefit of multi task clustering is that it is more likely to find commonalities in cases where an independent clustering might not a global correlation of profiles of human calu cell response to different influenza infections showed that one medium pathogenicity virus ns trunc was not correlated with the other similarly pathogenic viruses supplementary however using our approach we were still able to find modules in this virus that significantly overlapped with modules exhibiting the same pattern from other viruses this suggests that there can be subsets of genes that are correlated despite there being little correlation between genome_wide profiles the ability to reliably detect module transitions for individual genes is extremely_important because clustering_approaches in general are known to be prone to reaching local_optima we used a consensus clustering approach to extract high_confidence cluster assignments and cluster transitions the choice of the consensus clustering_algorithm was important and influenced the quality of results in particular the spectral method produced better clusters than the hierarchical method as measured by silhouette index while consensus gmm was able to learn stable clusters it was not able to identify module transitions reliably likely because it does not solve the matching problem across strains which we had to do as a post clustering step incorporating the pathogenicity relationships using the hierarchical relatedness approach of the arboretum framework was useful to identify genes_exhibiting patterns of pathogen specificity instead of considering all possible types of transitions we applied our rule_based pattern extraction procedure on virus groups defined by pathogenicity subtrees to identify genes that exhibited the same module assignment between the same group of pathogenicity but differed in module assignment between pathogenicity groups most genes that exhibit such patterns are similar among the medium and high pathogenicities in this work we relied on the accuracy of the pathogenicity tree to relate the viruses one direction of future_research is to explore simultaneous learning of modules as well as the tree_topologies to relate the different viruses an alternate route would be to use multitask feature learning approaches that do not assume any structure on the tasks and aim to learn most informative features across all tasks simultaneously another promising extension to the model would be to integrate different types of omic measurements e g proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics with appropriate data specific generative_models in conclusion our consensus based multi clustering approach is a novel and robust approach to identify common and context specific sets of co expressed genes that can be applied to large_numbers of related viruses as systems_biology studies expand to additional viruses approaches such as ours will be increasingly useful for guiding targeted_therapeutics the numbers in each row specify the module in which the process was enriched only processes that were enriched in both viruses of a pathogenicity group were considered
