the evolution of nitrogen_fixation in cyanobacteria motivation fixed nitrogen is an essential requirement for the biosynthesis of cellular nitrogenous_compounds some cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen contributing significantly to the nitrogen cycle agriculture and biogeochemical history of earth the rate and position on the species phylogeny of gains_and of this ability as well as of the underlying nif genes are controversial results we use probabilistic_models of trait evolution to investigate the presence and absence of cyanobacterial nitrogen_fixing ability we estimate rates of change on the species phylogeny pinpoint probable changes and reconstruct the state and nif gene complement of the ancestor our results are consistent with a nitrogen_fixing cyanobacterial ancestor repeated loss of nitrogen_fixation and vertical descent with little horizontal_transfer of the genes involved the cyanobacteria are a biochemically and morphologically diverse clade of gram_negative with major_environmental and economic roles and effects including global primary_productivity potential uses in biofuel_production and in presenting water_borne health_hazards via toxin_production cyanobacteria are key biocatalysts in the n cycle the rice paddies of asia which feed over half of the worlds population depend upon cyanobacterial n fixation the cyanobacterial genus trichodesmium is responsible for of the total global nitrogen_fixation of tg n y cyanobacteria may have existed for billion years or more a question of primary importance to our view of the biological environment of the early earth and to whom correspondence should be addressed to cyanobacterial evolution is whether the last cyanobacterial common_ancestor lcca could fix n reduce n to nh snchezconcluded that lcca was not n fixing a study of cyanobacterial genomes agreed with this conclusion a study of a greater number of genomes including basal n fixers synechococcus sp ja ab cyanobacteria bacterium yellowstone a prime and synechococcus sp ja ba cyanobacteria bacterium yellowstone b prime reconstructed the status of lcca as ambiguous but due to use of parsimonious ancestral state reconstruction the relative support for presence versus absence of n fixation could not be quantified where present in cyanobacteria n fixation is performed by proteins encoded by nif genes the central enzyme is nitrogenase n ase a molybdenum dependent atp hydrolyzing complex of two metalloproteins a dinitrogenase heterotetramer that contains the active_site for the reduction of n its and subunits are coded by the nifd and nifk genes respectively and a dinitrogenase reductase homodimer coded by nifh that transfers high_energy electrons to dinitrogenase n ase is inactivated upon oxygen binding suggesting an origin prior to the great oxygenation event at the start of the proterozoic eon between and million_years there are about nif genes in cyanobacteria of which are regarded as core to the n fixation pathway or including the crucial non nif transcriptional_regulator patb included the nif genes nifehdkub and patb in the lcca genome that they predicted using parsimony reconstructions though they state that this reconstruction is ambiguous nif genes have been highly evolutionarily_conserved despite being present in a wide_range of bacterial and archaeal taxa a vanadium dependent system nitrogenase is found in addition to nitrogenase in the cyanobacterium_anabaena variabilis iron_dependent nitrogenase is known in other groups on a phylogeny of cyanobacterial genomes we perform empirical_bayes ancestral state reconstructions for the ability to fix n and for the presence absence of nif orthologous_groups empirical_bayes ancestral state reconstruction quantifies ambiguity by giving a posterior_probability for each state at each ancestral node we address the question of whether there has been any gain of n fixation within the cyanobacterial
