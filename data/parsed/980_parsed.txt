gene_expression cisase a likelihood_based method for detecting putative cis regulated allele_specific in rna sequencing_data allele_specific ase is a useful way to identify cis_acting regulatory variation which provides opportunities to develop new therapeutic_strategies that activate beneficial alleles or silence mutated_alleles at specific_loci however multiple problems hinder the identification of ase in next_generation ngs_data results we developed cisase a likelihood_based method for detecting ase on single_nucleotide snv exon and gene levels from sequencing_data without requiring phasing or parental information cisase uses matched dna_seq data to control technical bias and copy_number cnv in putative cis regulated ase identification compared with state of the art methods cisase exhibits significantly_increased accuracy and speed cisase works moderately well for datasets without dna_seq and thus is widely_applicable by applying cisase to real_datasets we identified specific ase characteristics in normal and cancer tissues thus indicating that cisase has potential for wide_applications in cancer_genomics availability_and cisase is freely_available atallele specific gene_expression ase refers to the differential_expression of two alleles in a diploid_genome ase is primarily a result of the associated cis_element variation and allele specific epigenetic_modifications germline ases are usually associated with the existence of regulatory_elements which exert a pronounced effect on human phenotypic polymorphism and common diseases somatic ases ases of somatic_mutations in tumors are often genetically linked to tumor drivers thus ase studies provide an opportunity for the development of new therapeutic_strategies that activate beneficial alleles or silence mutated_alleles at specific_loci next_generation ngs allows for the genome_wide identification of ase however several problems exist the first problem is technical and intrinsic allele bias which we and others have previously demonstrated for example reads carrying single_nucleotide snvs are less likely to be correctly mapped than those carrying reference genotype another example is that a large proportion of previously_identified ases especially in tumor_samples have been found a result of copy_number cnvs rather than cis regulation the second problem is that gene level ase detection usually requires phased snvs or parental genomes which are usually not available although methods to phase singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps into individual haplotypes exist these methods cannot be applied to somatic_mutations in tumors the third problem relates to testing ase with statistical confidence two simple statistical_methods i e binomial and chi_square have been frequently used in snv level ase detection however these methods do not make full use of the information of these complex sequencing_datasets although several tools have been developed for ase detection none has addressed all of these concerns to overcome the problems outlined above we proposed a new computational_method and developed a software_tool cisase based on a likelihood_ratio cisase uses dna_seq data to make site by site adjustments for rna allele imbalance assessment to reduce the effects of technical bias and cnv and reports ase putatively caused by cis regulation cisase also considers the base_quality of each base to reduce the influence of sequencing_error we tested cisase on both simulated_and and compared it with other methods cisase exhibits significantly_improved accuracy and computational speed compared with existing_methods we applied cisase to public colon tumor datasets and observed several important features i e germline ase hotspots of human_leukocyte hla loci cancer somatic ase genes in focal_adhesion and extracellular_matrix ecm receptor_interaction pathways these findings revealed a landscape of germline and somatic ase in colon_tumors and highlighted broad applications of our cisase method in ase detection in this work we present a novel flexible computational_method cisase to detect ase at the snv exon and gene levels cisase makes full use of information from dna_seq and rna_seq to achieve an unbiased estimation of ase by default cisase adopts a site by site adjustment for ase identification by using the dna allele ratio this procedure reduces the artifacts from technical and mapping bias and cnvs making cisase efficient for detecting putative cis regulated ases in the absence of matched dna_seq data cisase performed moderately well additionally the implementation of a pseudo phasing function in cisase allows the incorporation of unphased snv data into an individual exon gene or isoform to evaluate the performance of cisase for ase detection we performed extensive analyses based on both simulated_and from multiple resources i e human and mouse colon tumor celllines and a phased genomes_project individual cisase outperformed the chi_square in terms of accuracy especially for genes with low sequencing_depth additionally cisase exhibits greatly_increased accuracy and computation speed compared with other previous methods based on complex models by applying cisase to a panel of paired_tumor human colon samples we identified hla loci as the most significant hotspot of germline ases in both tumor and normal samples in tumor_samples somatic ase showed widespread overexpression of mutant_alleles indicating oncogenic roles of the mutant genes these results confirmed the ability of cisase to detect tumorassociated ases
