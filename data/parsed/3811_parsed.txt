pypanda a python_package for gene_regulatory reconstruction panda passing attributes between networks for data assimilation is a gene_regulatory inference_method that uses message passing to integrate_multiple sources of omics_data panda was originally coded in c in this application note we describe pypanda the python version of panda pypanda runs considerably faster than the c version and includes additional features for network_analysis availability_and the open_source pypanda python_package is freely_available ataccurately inferring_gene is one of the most important challenges in the analysis of gene_expression data although many methods have been proposed computation time has been a significant limiting_factor in their widespread use panda passing attributes between networks for data assimilation is a gene_regulatory inference_method that uses message passing between multiple omics_data types to infer the network of interactions most consistent with the underlying data panda has been applied to understand transcriptional_programs in a variety of systems here we introduce pypanda a python implementation of the panda algorithm following the approach taken inand optimized for matrix operations using numpy van_der this approach_enables the use of fast matrix multiplications using the blas and lapack functions thereby significantly decreasing run time for network prediction compared with the original implementation of panda which was coded in c and used for loops we observe further speed increase over the c code because pypanda automatically uses multiple processor cores through the numpy library we have also expanded pypanda to include common downstream_analyses of panda networks including the calculation of network in and out degrees and the estimation of single sample networks using the recently_developed lioness algorithm
