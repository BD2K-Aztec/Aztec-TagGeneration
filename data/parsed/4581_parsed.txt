data_and the ccpn metabolomics project a fast protocol for metabolite_identification by d nmr we present here the freely_available metabolomics project resource specifically_designed to work under the ccpnmr analysis program produced by ccpn collaborative computing project for nmr vranken et_al the ccpn data model for nmr_spectroscopy development of a software pipeline proteins the project consists of a database of assigned d and d spectra of many common metabolites the project aims to help the user to analyze and assign d and d nmr_spectra of unknown metabolite mixtures spectra of unknown mixtures can be easily superimposed and compared with the database spectra thus facilitating their assignment and identification availability the ccpn metabolomics project together with an annotated example dataset is freely_available via metabolomics is a newly_emerging field of omics research aiming to give an analytical description of the metabolites in complex biological_samples and to describe the global dynamic metabolic_response of living_systems to biological stimuli or genetic_manipulation nmr_spectroscopy is making significant_contributions in this burgeoning area it is successfully being used to identify_biomarkers in biofluids for various diseases to analyze drug_toxicity and to determine drugs in vivo efficacy and selectivity its potential ability to handle complex_mixtures of metabolites makes it a primary tool in both identification and quantification of the multitude of different molecules that constitute unprocessed biological mixtures d h nmr_spectra of biological mixtures are characterized by extensive peak overlap or spectral congestion therefore acquisition of d nmr_spectra e g h c hsqc hmbc and h h tocsy is a prerequisite for compound to whom correspondence should be addressed identification however the paucity of metabolomics software with dedicated d metabolite spectrum resources and coupled analysis capabilities often makes assignment of metabolite resonances a challenging_task we present here the metabolomics project dataset based on ccpnmr analysis software consisting of a series of d and d nmr_spectra of standard compounds whose resonances h and c have been fully assigned and annotated this repository can be efficiently applied to the rapid identification of the metabolic_components of unknown mixtures supplementary tables s s
