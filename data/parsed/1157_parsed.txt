control an open_source framework for the analysis of chemical reaction_networks we introduce control a web_based framework for analysis of chemical reaction_networks crns it is designed to be both extensible and simple to use complementing existing crn related tools control currently implements a number of necessary and or sufficient structural tests for multiple equilibria stable periodic orbits convergence to equilibria and persistence with the potential for incorporation of further tests differential_equation models of chemical reaction_networks crns encompassing many ecological epidemiological and related non negative systems are almost universally complicated by parameter_uncertainty however dynamical_properties of large classes of crn models are remarkably robust to changes in parameter_values leading to a range of results relating network_structure to dynamical_behavior such parameter free approaches to the analysis of crns fall into the scope of chemical_reaction network_theory fuelled in part by its implications to systems_biology chemical_reaction network_theory has seen a surge of interest in recent_years attacking questions about multistationarity global stability oscillatory_behavior and persistence many of the results in chemical_reaction network_theory lend themselves to algorithmic implementation which is useful for large_networks in this article we introduce control crn tool a new fully open_source platform currently coded in c java octave and php to perform computations on crns without the need for any proprietary software control has a web_based front end interfacing with a suite of modular tests to which users may add new tests in any language with its array of features control complements existing software_tools the chemical reaction_network toolbox is a proprietary windows program that implements the results of deficiency theory as well as checks for concordance equivalent to network injectivity it applies to various types of kinetics including mass action and generates detailed information about network_properties multiple and degenerate steady_states and their stability reaction_network equilibria study toolbox ernest and crnreals are matlab toolboxes aimed at testing multistationarity and distinguishability and identifiability of crns respectively tests for multistationarity of crns are also implemented in maple while not all criteria included in these tools are currently tested in control its extensible nature allows for their future inclusion we have written control aiming for a user_friendly with maximal functionality implementing state of the art theory on crns we expect future inclusion of further results from the rich theory of crns with contributions from the research_community gk general kinetics ma mass action kinetics the system is injective on the relative interior of each non trivial stoichiometry class the fully open system is injective on the non negative orthant for example with mass action kinetics ma of the networks was injective on the relative interior on each non trivial stoichiometric class only slightly more than with general kinetics gk see for more details futile cycle dsr graph
