large_scale analysis of signal reachability motivation major disorders such as leukemia have been shown to alter the transcription of genes understanding how gene_regulation is affected by such aberrations is of utmost_importance one promising strategy toward this objective is to compute whether signals can reach to the transcription_factors through the transcription regulatory_network trn due to the uncertainty of the regulatory_interactions this is a p complete problem and thus solving it for very large trns remains to be a challenge results we develop a novel and scalable method to compute the probability that a signal originating at any given set of source genes can arrive at any given set of target_genes i e transcription_factors when the topology of the underlying signaling_network is uncertain our method tackles this problem for large_networks while providing a provably accurate result our method follows a divide_and strategy we break down the given network into a sequence of non overlapping subnetworks such that reachability can be computed autonomously and sequentially on each subnetwork we represent each interaction using a small polynomial the product of these polynomials express different scenarios when a signal can or cannot reach to target_genes from the source genes we introduce polynomial collapsing operators for each subnetwork these operators reduce the size of the resulting polynomial and thus the computational_complexity dramatically we show that our method scales to entire human regulatory_networks in only seconds while the existing methods_fail beyond a few tens of genes and interactions we demonstrate that our method can successfully characterize key reachability characteristics of the entire transcriptions regulatory_networks of patients affected by eight different subtypes of leukemia as well as those from healthy control samples availability all the datasets and code used in this article are available at bioinformatics cise ufl edu preach scalable htm major disorders such as cancer have been shown to alter the transcription of a large_number and thus affect the mechanism that governs cells functions many complex_disorders such as acute_lymphoblastic however yield a varying spectrum of expression_profiles and as a result cannot be robustly characterized by merely studying the gene_expressions an important part of cell_biology research is the study of the causal_relationship between extracellular conditions and the cell response such causality is governed by a chain of biochemical_reactions through which extracellular signals are transmitted from membrane_receptors to transcription_factors i e reporters via proteinprotein_interactions while the pattern of this mechanism is similar for all organisms important variations in its quantitative aspects such as gene_expressions result from external_perturbations differentiation_stage of the cell timing of dna_replication and various epigenetic mutations therefore detecting these quantitative variations is an important source of information for assessing the fitness of the organism and ultimately for diagnosis and prognosis extensive evidence suggests that there is a degree of uncertainty in our knowledge of interactions within cells the source of this uncertainty is fold first the biological_processes that are modeled as protein interactions in biological_networks are stochastic events second the evidence in support of an interaction is not entirely decisive for the actual presence of the interaction due to many reasons such as epigenetic variations across different cells several schemes have already been proposed to assess the reliability of protein interactions in the form of confidence values such interaction confidence values are now available in large biological_network databases such as mint and string recent_studies often model the uncertainty of the interactions in biological_networks using probabilistic networks we adopt the same model in this article namely each node of the network denotes a gene and the directed edge from a node v i to node v j denotes that the gene corresponding to v i can regulate the gene denoted by v j through an interaction each edge in this network is a probabilistic event that is it is considered possible but not certain reflecting the insecure knowledge of the gene_regulation process a common way to model the uncertainty of each edge is to associate it with a probability value which is computed for each interaction from several factors gene_expressions available evidence for it and network_topology around it the ability to compute confidence values for interactions provides opportunities to model and study biological_networks accurately it however comes at a high price as the uncertainty of the topology of interactions makes studying biological_networks a computationally challenging_task the challenge is that a probabilistic network represents a large number of alternative deterministic network_topologies more precisely a network with n probabilistic edges yields n possible network configurations as each one of the n edges may be present or absent for instance in to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the

contactjournals permissions_oup com the probabilistic network shown on top corresponds to deterministic networks since it contains probabilistic edges in this article we address the problem of characterizing the signaling reachability in transcription regulatory_networks trns unlike most of the existing_literature we eliminate the limitations of the classical assumption that all interactions are deterministic and adopt the more descriptive probabilistic network more specifically given a set of source genes s fs s s a g and a set of target_genes t ft t t b g we compute the reachability profile of that network as a doubly indexed vector r where for all i j such that i a j b the entry ris the probability that a signal originating at s i can reach t i i e s i regulates t j we show that the reachability profile can help us understand how different disorders that alter the cellular_functions based on the signaling patterns of the gene_regulatory we particularly focus on leukemias which is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the transcription patterns summary of related work the problem of computing reachability in uncertain network_topologies has drawn significant attention in the context of network reliability various exact methods as well as approximate_methods have been proposed we refer interested readers to several surveys on the topic theoretical results on the complexity of the problem reveal that it is p complete husfeldt and taslaman the problem is significantly simplified in the case of acyclic graphs this type of graphs can be represented as bayesian_networks for which various inference algorithms exist however for this simple case sophisticated inference algorithms are unnecessary in the context of biological_networks the problem for general graphs was first addressed by the goal of these authors was to infer the structure of the signaling_network that best explains a set of gene_knockout pairs given a proteinprotein_interaction to achieve_this they developed a method to compute the reachability probability for each knockout gene_pair their method is an exact solution based on the inclusionexclusion principle van however due to its high time complexity this method works accurately only for very small networks i e those with a few tens of nodes preach computes the exact reachability probability based on polynomial multiplication it is significantly_faster than the inclusionexclusion method offor networks where there are many paths however it does not scale to large_networks thus the existing solutions cannot be used to study entire trns and there is a great need for accurate yet efficient methods contributions here we develop a novel method that computes the probability that a signal originated at a given source gene can reach to a given target_gene in a given probabilistic network unlike existing_methods our solution is both precise i e it computes this probability without error and it scales to large_networks our method follows a divide_and approach we partition the given probabilistic network into a sequence of loosely connected clusters of nodes on the boundary between two such consecutive clusters lies a set of nodes called node separators any signal which originates from the source node and arrives at any node in the latter cluster must visit the node separators similar to preach we model the given probabilistic network using polynomials the form of the polynomials of our method however differs from that of preach in a way that allows us to collapse the polynomial to very small_size that is determined by the size number of interactions of the clusters and the number of nodes in a given boundary each term in our polynomial evaluates the existence probability of a collection of subsets of interactions in brief instead of computing the reachability probability from the given source node to the target node we incrementally compute the reachability probability from the source node to each node separator in sequential_order that allows us to avoid storing a massive fraction of terms of the polynomial i e the terms corresponding to the nodes in earlier clusters our experimental_results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method scales to very large network sizes while the inclusionexclusion method and preach fail we also observe that the reachability profiles provide a valuable resource for characterizing leukemias and differentiating the centrality of the genes across different leukemias as well as healthy_control in summary the key contributions of this work are we introduce a new quantity for evaluating the state of a biological_network the reachability profile we introduce a novel fast and scalable method to compute the reachability profile of large_networks based on polynomials and polynomial collapsing operators we demonstrate the usefulness of reachability profiles in detailed analysis of different types of leukemias the rest of the article is organized as follows section_describes our method section_presents our experimental_results section concludes with a brief discussion in this section we experimentally evaluate our method section presents the datasets and the experimental_setup section examines the running time of our algorithm section presents the reachability profiles_obtained with our method section evaluates gene centrality based on the reachability profiles section analyses the stability of the human trn in this article we have characterized different types of leukemias based on the state of the regulatory_networks in patients affected by this disease the state is evaluated through reachability profiles the reachability profile describes the ability of regulator genes to affect the transcription_factors for this we developed a fast exact method for computing the probability for a signal to reach from a source node to a destination node in a probabilistic network the rigorous mathematical apparatus which involves polynomials and polynomial collapsing operators allows fast execution time demonstrated in the performance evaluation experiments valuable uses of the reachability profiles illustrated in this article include leukemia subtype classification gene centrality evaluation and regulatory_network stability analysis all these are valuable tools for evaluating the viability of the trn under varying conditions as a whole not just limited to individual gene_expressions levels an interesting
