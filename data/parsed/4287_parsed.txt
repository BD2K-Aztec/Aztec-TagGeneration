structural_bioinformatics slim on diet finding short_linear on domain interaction interfaces in protein_data motivation an important class of protein interactions involves the binding of a proteins domain to a short_linear motif slim on its interacting_partner extracting such motifs either experimentally or computationally is challenging because of their weak binding and high degree of degeneracy recent rapid increase of available protein_structures provides an excellent opportunity to study slims directly from their d structures results using domain interface extraction diet we characterized distinct slims from the protein_data pdb of which are validated in varying_degrees have literature validation are supported by at least one domainpeptide structural instance and another have overrepresentation in high_throughput ppi data we further observed that the lacklustre coverage of existing computational slim detection methods could be due to the common_assumption that most slims occur outside globular_domain regions of slim that we reported are actually found on domain domain interface some of them are implicated in autoimmune and neurodegenerative_diseases we suggest that these slims would be useful for designing inhibitors against the pathogenic protein_complexes underlying these diseases our findings show that d structure based slim detection_algorithms can provide a more complete coverage of slim mediated protein interactions than current sequence based_approaches proteinprotein_interactions are vital to virtually every biological_process some important biological_processes such as the signaling_pathways require proteinprotein_interactions that are designed for fast_response to stimuli these interactions are usually transient easily formed and disrupted and specific while other protein_protein are mediated by the binding of two large globular_domain interfaces domaindomain interactions these transient interactions typically involve the binding of a protein domain to to whom correspondence should be addressed a short stretch of amino_acid which is usually characterized by a simple sequence pattern i e a short_linear motif slim we call these domainslim interactions numerous well known and biologically_important domains such as sh sh ww fha and pdz have been found to interact with their partners via domainslim interactions the small binding areas on the slims result in weak binding_affinity that makes them suitable for mediating the transient interactions compared with the larger domaindomain interaction interfaces domainslim interfaces are also better candidates for intervention by small_molecules however current wet_lab for detecting slims are laborious and time consuming it is also a challenge to detect these motifs in silico due to their short_length and highly degenerative nature one popular_approach is to mine slims that are overrepresented in a set of non homologous_proteins known to be interacting with a particular protein domain or known to share a similar biological_function e g dilimot and slimfinder another line of computational_approach finds slims from sets of densely interacting_protein for example the work ofand d star there are several drawbacks with these approaches first as the slims are highly degenerative most of these algorithms mask conserved structured regions which are assumed not to have many slims such as globular_domains to reduce false_positives recently it was found that such filtering has caused some true motifs to be missed second the motifs identified via the sequence based_approaches are not guaranteed to occur on the binding_interface such atomic_level of details can only come from high_resolution d structures third the algorithms are highly dependent on the accuracy of the interaction identification experiments however these interaction data are well known to be noisy von the rapid increase of protein_structure data in the protein_data pdb database offers an excellent opportunity to detect slims directly from d structures instead of the proteins sequences some researchers have begun to exploit the structural data by using the structures as templates to find seed binding_motifs which are subsequently enriched using the available protein_protein ppi data they therefore suffer from the accuracy and coverage limitations of the ppi data like the previous methods in this work we directly find de
