genome_analysis casot a genome_wide cas grna off target searching tool the crispr_cas or cas guide rna system is a newly_developed easily engineered and highly_effective tool for gene_targeting it has considerable off target effects in cultured_human cells and in several organisms however the cas guide rna target_site is too short for existing alignment tools to exhaustively and effectively_identify potential_off casot is a local tool designed to find potential_off in any given genome or user provided sequence with user specified types of protospacer adjacent motif and number of mismatches allowed in the seed and non seed regions cas grna guide rna or cas single guide rna a customized type of clustered_regularly crispr associated crispr_cas system has recently been used for effective gene_targeting in many organisms and cultured_cells this system is easy to design and engineer only a single short grna which contains nt region reverse complementary to one strand of the target dna the protospacer with an ngg motif in end the protospacer adjacent motif pam of the target_site has to be synthesized for a particular target_site the same cas nuclease can be used universally this notably reduces the cost of both time and labor promoting the broad and rapidly developing application of this system however the specificity of cas grna needs careful evaluation for example cas grna seems to have considerable offtarget effects in cultured_human cells and in several organisms in vitro experiments suggest that the pam type could influence the cleavage_activity the ngg type of pam shows the highest activity pam of nag comes second and pam of nngg shows the weakest activity mismatches in different regions of the protospacer in the target_site also have different effects a mismatch in the region of the first nt adjacent to the pam called the seed_region may cause a notable reduction of the cleavage_activity of cas grna whereas mismatches in the other region of the protospacer the non seed_region have a much weaker effect an approach to identify potential_off in any given genome or other sequence is necessary to evaluate the off target effects of cas grna in vivo an online tool used for cas grna target design also supports the prediction of certain potential_off however neither a detailed scoring algorithm nor an adjustable option is available in this tool and only a few genomes can be searched for target or off target_sites other online tools tagscan or pattern match http viewer shigen info medakavw patternmatch are available to search for regions in some commonly used genomes or only in the medaka genome with up to two mismatches on the other hand widely used heuristic alignment tools like blastn and blat are not designed for exhaustive searching for short nucleotide_sequences as short as nt in addition the variable types of pam with random nucleotides also need to be considered during the search for potential offtarget sites here we report casot a downloadable and open_source tool designed to identify potential_off of given cas grna targets or target pairs in any user specified sequence or genome with several tunable parameters like pam type and the mismatch number in the seed up to nt and non seed regions supplementary_material s
