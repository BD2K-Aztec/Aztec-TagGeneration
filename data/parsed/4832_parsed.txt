gene_expression utilizing rna_seq for de_novo coexpression network_inference motivation rna_seq experiments have_shown for transcriptome_profiling while sequencing increases the level of biological detail integrative data analysis is also important one avenue is the construction of coexpression_networks because the capacity of rna_seq for network construction has not been previously evaluated we constructed a coexpression_network using striatal samples derived its network_properties and compared it with microarray_based networks results the rna_seq coexpression_network displayed scale_free hierarchical network_structure we detected transcripts groups modules with correlated profiles modules overlap distinct ontology categories neuroanatomical data from the allen brain atlas reveal several modules with spatial colocalization the network was compared with microarray derived networks correlations from rna_seq were higher likely because greater sensitivity and dynamic range higher correlations result in higher network_connectivity heterogeneity and centrality for transcripts present across platforms network_structure appeared largely preserved from this study we present the first rna_seq de_novo network_inference rna_seq is a relatively new method for gene_expression analysis that has provided_important transcriptome structure the level of detailed biological_insight available through transcriptome_sequencing is superior to microarray_platforms most notably in detecting alternatively_spliced and non_coding and small_rnas that are not generally interrogated using microarray_platforms in addition rna_seq offers significantly_higher levels of transcript accuracy when compared to microarray_platforms to whom correspondence should be addressed while increasing our understanding of specific biological_processes these new insights have also brought into focus the full extent of the complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes in this context integration of rna_seq into a systems level framework of transcription analysis is increasingly important network_analysis provides a productive approach to visualization and analysis of high_throughput transforming the data into a graph network framework offers distinct advantages allowing the adoption of techniques developed in graph_theory engineering and computer science these approaches can directly relate specific biological_interactions or disease_states with the network_properties and dynamics gene coexpression_networks have provided_important the global structure of the transcriptome in a variety of species the transcriptome coexpression_network displays many properties often associated with biological and social_networks modularity centralization heterogeneity and clustering as experimental_techniques improve and the level of technical experimental_noise decreases improved estimates of these parameters can be expected our results illustrate the advantages of rna_seq in gene coexpression_network construction importantly we find that the increased dynamic range and accuracy of deep_sequencing as compared with microarray_platforms allows better estimation of network_properties such as network density connectivity centralization and heterogeneity we find that rna_seq estimates of these values are generally higher than values derived from microarray_data this is of interest because heterogeneity and centralization distinguish hierarchical networks from purely random networks note that several modules do not appear preserved based on cross tabulation based preservation measures while this may reflect real differences between platforms it could also be due to the instability observed in many clustering procedures von luxburg a major advantage of the networkbased module preservation statistics z density etc used in this article is that they do not require module assignment in the test_dataset and therefore allow one to make rigorous claims regarding module preservation according to these preservation statistics we find that network module structure is significantly preserved across platforms in particular with respect to density based preservation statistics we derive functional_annotation and neuroanatomical features of the transcriptome that provide insights into the biological_mechanisms the coexpression structure we find that genes that share functional_annotation are often coexpressed as are genes that share spatial localization within the striatum taken together our results suggest that network approaches are a promising_avenue of integrative rna_seq
