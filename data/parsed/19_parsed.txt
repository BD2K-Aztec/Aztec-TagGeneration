abc a tool to identify snvs causing allele specific transcription_factor binding from chip_seq motivation detection of allelic imbalances in chip_seq reads is a powerful approach to identify functional non coding single_nucleotide snvs either polymorphisms or mutations which modulate the affinity of transcription_factors for chromatin we present abc a computational_tool that identifies allele specific binding of transcription_factors from aligned chip_seq reads at heterozygous snvs abc controls for potential false_positives resulting from biases introduced by the use of short_sequencing in chip_seq and can efficiently process a large number of het erozygous snvs results abc successfully identifies previously_characterized functional snvs such as the rs breast_cancer associated snp that modulates the affinity of foxa for the chromatin availability_and the code is open_source under an artistic license and ver sioned on github https github com mlupien abc abc is written in perl and can be run on any platform with both perlgenome wide association studies gwas have identified thousands of single_nucleotide snv representing genomic_loci associated with human traits and disease the causal_variant s underlying each association are hard to identify because most of the associated loci fall outside of annotated_genes chip_seq allows for the identification of transcription_factor tf_binding across the genome functional studies have shown that many trait disease associated loci modulate the affinity of tfs for chromatin noncoding somatic_mutations found in tumors can also modulate tf_binding to promote tumor_growth and progression the generation of chip_seq for tfs in normal cells and tumors provides an opportunity to directly_assess the functional effect of risk_variants and somatic_mutations on tf_binding this creates a need for a computational_tool to systematically identify snvs imparting an allelic_imbalance in tf_binding to the chromatin to eliminate alignment biases existing_tools incorporate the alignment of the chip_seq reads to two separate genomes the use of two representative parental genomes assumes a diploid set of chromosomes therefore the applicability of these tools to cancerthe rs snp imposes allele specific binding of foxa in mcf_cells based on chip qpcr using abc against foxa chip_seq from mcf_cells reports increased binding intensity of foxa to the variant versus reference allele of the rs snp specifically aligned_reads from the foxa chip_seq map to the variant allele while map to the reference allele p no strand or position biases are observed p and a high processed signal is reported at this site normalized read_depth in addition we applied abc genome_wide to identify snvs modulating binding_affinity of the pu or spi supplementary_information and znf in gm cells abc provides the ability to identify allelic_imbalance in tf_binding similar to a traditional allele specific chip qpcr_assay and to what is reported by ni and colleagues however we do not attempt to call snvs from the chip_seq and we control for potential_biases in the alignment across alleles abc can be used to help understand the role of snvs associated with traits or disease by directly assessing their capacity to modulate tf_binding to the chromatin are sequenced from both ends in chip_seq assays the reads grey are short and less than the dna fragment_size selected for sequencing reads map to the positive solid grey and negative dashed grey strands the tf_binding black is inferred by extending the reads in a strand specific_manner b the snvs location within the tf_binding can be inferred from the aligned_reads the distribution of total positive_and strand reads should be equal between alleles the coverage window of a snv is limited to twice the read_length used dashed green lines c allele specific binding of foxa caused by the rs snv the reads containing the reference red and variant blue alleles as well as the distribution of the positive solid grey and negative dashed grey reads are shown left the interpretation of the results is illustrated middle indicating the preference of the tf green for the variant allele the processed signal peak is shown right funding
