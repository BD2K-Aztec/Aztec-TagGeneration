grass a generic algorithm for scaffolding next_generation assemblies motivation the increasing availability of second generation high_throughput hts technologies has sparked a growing interest in de_novo genome_sequencing this in turn has fueled the need for reliable means of obtaining high_quality draft_genomes from short_read sequencing_data the millions of reads usually involved in hts experiments are first assembled into longer fragments called contigs which are then scaffolded i e ordered and oriented using additional information to produce even longer_sequences called scaffolds most existing scaffolders of hts genome_assemblies are not suited for using information other than paired_reads to perform scaffolding they use this limited information to construct scaffolds often preferring scaffold length over accuracy when faced with the tradeoff results we present grass generic assembly scaffolder a novel algorithm for scaffolding second generation sequencing assemblies capable of using diverse information_sources grass offers a mixed integer_programming formulation of the contig scaffolding_problem which combines contig order distance and orientation in a single optimization objective the resulting optimization_problem is solved using an expectationmaximization procedure and an unconstrained binary quadratic_programming approximation of the original problem we compared grass with existing hts scaffolders using illumina paired_reads of three bacterial_genomes our algorithm constructs a comparable number of scaffolds but makes fewer errors this result is further improved when additional data in the form of related genome_sequences are used availability grass source_code is freely_available fromhigh throughput sequencing hts technologies such as illumina illumina inc san_diego ca roche applied science penzberg germany and solid and iontorrent life technologies to whom correspondence should be addressed carlsbad ca produce millions of short dna_reads of typical lengths of bp at low_cost making them attractive for de_novo sequencing_applications with the aid of assembly algorithms short_reads can be joined together into longer_sequences called contigs however contigs are typically shorter than the sequenced dna_molecules as genomic repeat regions longer than the read_length cannot be unambiguously assembled using the read sequences alone scaffolding the process of using additional data to place contigs in the right order orientation and at the right distance in longer gapped supercontigs called scaffolds is a crucial step in obtaining high_quality draft_genome paired_reads mate_pair or paired_end depending on the sequencing protocol i e reads of known relative orientation order and approximate physical distance are often used for scaffolding additional information including reference_sequences of related organisms restriction maps and rna_seq can be used to derive more accurate contig placement thereby reducing the cost of finishing experiments and allowing for more reliable downstream_analyses however most existing scaffolding algorithms are not able to utilize such information for scaffolding to our knowledge only bambus and sopra can make use of additional data_sources although the latter was not originally designed for this purpose generally the contig scaffolding_problem csp is finding a linear ordering and orientation of contigs that minimizes the number of unsatisfied scaffolding constraints these constraints are derived from the available data through translation of the inherent distance order and orientation constraints onto the contigs the derived constraints can be mutually_exclusive which makes the problem of minimizing the number of unsatisfied constraints np_hard consequently practical scaffolding algorithms only approximately solve this problem bambus separately finds contig_orientation and order and uses greedy heuristics to remove inconsistent constraints sspace greedily extends scaffolds using a heuristic stopping criterion and sopra uses an iterative procedure to identify a subset of contigs with consistent scaffolding constraints notable exceptions are opera and the mip scaffolder which simplify the csp by dropping types of constraints opera implements an algorithm for finding an exact csp solution without minimumcontig distance constraints the mip scaffolder couples a mixed integer_programming mip formulation of the csp that does not enforce order constraints with an algorithm heuristically dividing the original problem into subproblems to be solved exactly we propose a novel generic assembly scaffolding grass algorithm that can be applied to any type of scaffolding information our work is similar to as we propose a mip formulation of the scaffolding_problem however we combine contig_orientation order and distance in a single quadratic optimization objective similar to we employ an iterative procedure to select a consistent subset of contigs however we apply an expectationmaximization strategy to maximize the objective_function that identifies inconsistent constraints rather than contigs thereby retaining more scaffolding information we implemented the algorithm in c and tested it on de_novo assemblies of paired_read data for the bacteria eschrichia coli pseudoxanthomonas suwonensis and pseudomonas_syringae and compared it with the sspace opera and mip scaffolders grass produces a competitive number of scaffolds with fewer scaffolding errors particularly when combining various sources of scaffolding information we presented grass a generic scaffolding algorithm suitable for combining multiple information_sources as well as grass incorporating a post_processing scaffolding step its use was demonstrated by scaffolding genomes based on paired_read data and information in related genome_sequences both individually and combined grass achieves the best results when all available scaffolding information is used as this allows conflicting_information from a single source to be ignored when the majority of sources do not support it such a mode of operation is supported by the possibility of choosing weights for the individual information_sources combined with the contig link erosion threshold we compared grass with a number of state of the art scaffolders sspace mip and opera on three datasets grass constructs the most accurate scaffolds on all datasets while keeping the number of scaffolds low only sspace consistently produces lower numbers of scaffolds but these are significantly less accurate the accuracy contiguity tradeoff displayed by grass puts it in a unique niche compared with existing scaffolders the current_implementation of grass supports the use of paired_read information and related genomes for scaffolding however the algorithm is not limited to any particular set of information_sources we will extend grass to allow use of other sources such as optical restriction maps rna_seq and est data
