fasthic a fast and accurate algorithm to detect long_range chromosomal interactions from hi c data motivation how chromatin folds in three_dimensional d space is closely_related to transcription_regulation as powerful_tools to study such d chromatin conformation the recently_developed hi c technologies enable a genome_wide measurement of pair_wise chromatin_interaction however methods for the detection of biologically_meaningful chromatin_interactions i e peak_calling from hi c data are still under development in our previous work we have developed a novel hidden markov_random hmrf based bayesian_method which through explicitly mod eling the non negligible spatial dependency among adjacent pairs of loci manifesting in high_resolution hi c data achieves substantially improved robustness and enhanced statistical_power in peak_calling superior to peak callers that ignore spatial dependency both methodologically and in performance our previous bayesian_framework suffers from heavy computational costs due to intensive computation incurred by modeling the correlated peak status of neighboring loci pairs and the inference of hidden dependency_structure results in this work we have developed fasthic a novel approach based on simulated field approximation which approximates the joint_distribution of the hidden peak status by a set of independent random_variables leading to more tractable computation performance_comparisons in real_data analysis showed that fasthic not only speeds up our original bayesian_method by more than five times bus also achieves higher peak_calling accuracy the spatial organizations of chromosomes play_a in transcription_regulation in particular regulatory_elements such as enhancers often contact with the promoters of targeted genes by forming long_range dna looping understanding such d chromatin conformation provides novel insights into the regulation mechanisms of gene_expression the recently_developed hi c technologies enable a genome_wide measurement of chromatin_interaction in the hi c data the contact_frequency between any two chromatin loci is measured by the number of paired_end spanning across them higher read_count indicates more frequent chromatin_interaction and closer spatial_proximity the rapid accumulation of hi c data with high sequencing_depth enables the study of chromatin_interaction at the unprecedented_resolution however the detection of biologically_meaningful long_range poses great challenges most existing_methods assume that the chromatin_interaction frequencies for different loci pairs are independent which is clearly invalid if two loci show high interaction frequency their adjacent loci will be more likely to interact with each other to fill in this gap we have recently_developed a novel hidden markov_random based bayesian hmrfbayes method to explicitly_model the spatial dependency among adjacent loci by borrowing information across neighborhood loci hmrf achieves substantially improved robustness and enhanced statistical_power while extremely promising hmrfbayes is based on a bayesian_framework which requires intensive computation the key challenge is to efficiently and effectively infer the dependency_structure underlying the hidden peak status to address this challenge we developed a novel algorithm named fasthic which approximates the joint_distribution of the hidden peak status by a set of independent random_variables under such approximation we adopted an em_algorithm for statistical_inference compared with hmrfbayes fasthic not only speeds up by more than five times but also achieves higher peak_calling accuracy we first conducted simulation_study to compare the performance of fasthic with hmrfbayes supplementary_material section s these two methods achieved comparable statistical efficiency in parameter estimations supplementary and peak_calling accuracy supplementaryand noticeably fasthic ran more than five times_faster than hmrfbayes supplementary due to the novel implementation of simulated field approximation next we re analyzed the hi c data in human imr cells where topological associated domains tads were identified we analyzed each tad separately to detect intra tad chromatin_interactions at kb resolution we didnot analyze inter tad chromatin_interactions because low sequencing_depth for inter tad reads the average number of intratad and inter tad reads are and respectively since we have shown that hmrfbayes outperforms afc and fit hi c in this work we only compared the performance of fasthic and hmrfbayes supplementary we did not compare with hiccups since its software is not publicly_available overall fasthic and hmrfbayes obtained highly_similar peak_calling results the spearman_correlation of peak probabilities between fasthic and hmrfbayes within each tad has median and standard_deviation in addition we compared the peak_calling results from fasthic and hmrfbayes with the chromatin_loops identified from the in situ hi c data shows that peaks identified by fasthic have slightly_higher overlap with chromatin_loops than peaks identified by hmrfbayes overall fasthic and hmrfbayes achieved highly_similar peak_calling accuracy in real hi c data in human imr cells next we compared the computational time of four different peak callers with different tad sizes in general the running time increases quadratically with the tad size for all tads the average running time for fasthic hmrfbayes afc and fit hi c are and s respectively fasthic runs much faster than hmrfbayes and afc although fit hi c runs faster than fasthic we have showed that the hmrf based_approach outperformed fit hi c in peak_calling accuracy compared with fit hi c we believe that fasthic achieves a reasonable balance between speed and accuracy to further compare the performance of fasthic and hmrfbayes we analyzed two additional hi c datasets in human h embryonic_stem and human gm lymphoblastic cells we detected intra tad chromatin_interactions at kb resolution to evaluate peak_calling accuracy we compared the peak_calling results from fasthic and hmrfbayes with the recently_published chia_pet data on h and gm cells we found that peaks identified from fasthic show much higher overlap with chromatin_loops detected from chia_pet data than those identified from hmrfbayes in both h and supplementary and gm cells these results demonstrate that fasthic achieves higher peak_calling accuracy than hmrfbayes in addition we explored modeling the dependency_structure with broader neighborhood but neither simulation_studies nor real_data analysis showed performance improvement supplementary_material section s in summary we have developed fasthic a fast and accurate algorithm to detect long_range from hi c data fasthic utilized the same hidden markov_random model as in our previous work but with a novel implementation of the simulated field approximation leading to more than five times speed up and higher peak_calling accuracy we believe that fasthic has potential to become a useful tool in studying chromatin spatial_organization
