no promoter left behind nplb learn de_novo promoter architectures from genome_wide transcription_start promoters have diverse regulatory architectures and thus activate genes differently for example some have a tata_box many others do not even the ones with it can differ in its position relative to the transcription_start tss no promoter left behind nplb is an efficient organism independent method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from experimentally_identified genome_wide tsss without relying on known promoter elements as a test case we show its application in identifying novel architectures in the fly genome availability_and web_server at http nplb ncl res in standalone also at https github com computationalbiology nplb mac osx linux promoters play_a in transcription_initiation by harbouring specific dna elements which act as transcription_factor recognition_sites but how these promoter elements pes contribute to the diversity in transcriptional_regulation is not yet clear while highthroughput technologies are increasingly used to produce accurate maps of transcription_start tsss the subsequent step of characterizing promoters and their functions is still done using two rather dated approaches the first involves classifying them based on known pes such as the inr motif or tata_box unfortunately a majority of promoters and their activities cannot be explained by the presence_or of these few pes alternatively de_novo motif_discovery methods are used to identify overrepresented elements directly from the sequences these can miss pes present only in a small fraction of promoters since promoters have diverse_mechanisms of activation most pes fall in this category even methods that identify cis_regulatory fail here since although they look for motif combinations these are still required to be common across the full set van no promoter left behind nplb is a new method modelled along the lines of unsupervised_learning with feature_selection that partitions tss aligned promoter_sequences into distinct promoter architectures pas each characterized by its own set of pes all learned de_novo since it explicitly allows for diversity nplb can be applied to the full dataset leaving out no promoter in contrast to the standard approach of presorting preselecting promoters on the basis of criteria such as presence of known pes or tss peak characteristics in this new parallel software the number of pas and pes are determined automatically using a mix of bayesian modelling and cross_validation
