integrated genome_browser visual_analytics platform for genomics motivation genome_browsers that support fast navigation through vast datasets and provide interactive visual_analytics functions can help scientists achieve deeper insight into biological_systems toward this end we developed integrated genome_browser igb a highly configurable interactive and fast open_source desktop genome_browser results here we describe multiple updates to igb including all new capabilities to display and interact with data from high_throughput sequencing_experiments to demonstrate we describe example visualizations and analyses of datasets from rna_seq chip_seq and bisulfite sequencing_experiments understanding results from genome_scale experiments requires viewing the data in the context of reference genome_annotations and other related datasets to facilitate this we enhanced igbs ability to consume data from diverse sources including galaxy distributed annotation and igb specific quickload servers to support future visualization needs as new gen ome scale assays enter wide use we transformed the igb codebase into a modular extensible platform for developers to create and deploy all new visualizations of genomic_data availability_and igb is open_source and is freely_available from http bioviz org igb genome_browsers are visualization software_tools that display genomic_data in interactive graphical formats since the s genome_browsers have played_an in genomics first as tools for building inspecting and annotating assemblies and later as tools for distributing data to the public later the rise of genome_scale assays created the need for a new generation of genome_browsers that could display users experimental_data alongside reference sequence_data and annotations integrated genome_browser igb first developed in at affymetrix was among the first of this new breed of tools igb was first written to support affymetrix scientists and collaborators who were using whole_genome tiling arrays to probe gene_expression and transcription_factor as part of the encode_project as such igb was designed from the start to display what we would now call big_data in bioinformaticsmillions of probe intensity values per sample igb was one of the first genome_browsers to support visual_analytics in which interactive visual interfaces augment our natural ability to notice patterns in data the thresholding feature described below is an example because early igb development was publicly_funded affymetrix released igb and its companion graphics library the genoviz software_development kit as open_source in since then we have continued to develop igb adding new features and incorporating libraries and code from many other open_source projects e g cytoscape our first article introducing igb appeared in and focused on visualization of tiling_array data here we describe new visual_analytics and data_integration features developed for highthroughput sequencing_data we also introduce a new plug in v c the author published_by igb is implemented as a stand alone rich client desktop program using the java programming_language to run igb users download and run platform specific installers these support automatic updates and include the java virtual_machine making it unnecessary for users to install and maintain java separately igbs implementation as a local application rather than as a web app means that igb can access the full processing power of the users local computer igb is always present on the users desktop regardless of internet connection status but igb can also use the web to consume data as described below because igb runs locally users view their own datasets without uploading them to a server which can be important when working with confidential data
