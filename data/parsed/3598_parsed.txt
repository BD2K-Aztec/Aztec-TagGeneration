polymarker a fast polyploid primer_design pipeline the design of genetic_markers is of particular relevance in crop breeding_programs despite many economically_important being polyploid organisms the current primer design_tools are tailored for diploid species bread_wheat for instance is a hexaploid comprising of three related genomes and the performance of genetic_markers is diminished if the primers are not gen ome specific polymarker is a pipeline that generates snp markers by selecting candidate primers for a specified genome using local_alignments and standard primer design_tools to test the viability of the primers a command_line and a web_interface are available to the community availability_and polymarker is available as a ruby biogem bio polyploid tools web_interface http polymarker tgac ac uk breeding_programs rely on dense genetic_maps with markers e g snps that can be used to identify the presence_or of specific_alleles in homozygous or heterozygous_state standard primer design_tools are designed to work in diploids where genome duplications are rare wheat is a polyploid composed of three genomes a b and d referred to as homoeologues that are related between and sequence_identity yet distinct this creates a problem for the design of pcr_primers specific to an individual homoeologue a common approach to circumvent this issue is to manually design primers with a genome specific variant at the of the primer to increase specificity we introduce polymarker a tool to automate the design of genome specific_primers thereby reducing the time invested in this process to make polymarker accessible to scientists and breeders we developed a web_server where custom snps can be submitted for the design of genome specific assays genotyping lgc that comprises a common primer and two allele_specific since the allele_specific are restricted in position the common primer is used to incorporate the chromosome specific variants when possible to test if the primer candidates are viable primer rozen and is invoked using the genomic reference of the target chromosome the starting positions of the primers to distinguish between alleles is selected with the sequence force left end option of primer to design the common primer the option sequence force right end is used on two runs of primer for the chromosome specific and semi specific_primers a final run of primer is executed without the sequence force right end option to find viable primers after the primers are tested with primer polymarker selects a primer_pair with the highest specificity polymarker is a pipeline written as a biogem extending bioruby to extract regions from fasta files and to support operations on nucleotide_sequences with iupac ambiguity codes
