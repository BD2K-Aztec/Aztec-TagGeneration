conceptmetab exploring relationships among metabolite sets to identify links among biomedical concepts motivation capabilities in the field of metabolomics have grown tremendously in recent_years many existing resources contain the chemical_properties and classifications of commonly identified metabolites however the annotation of small_molecules both endogenous and synthetic to meaningful biological_pathways and concepts still lags behind the analytical capabilities and the chemistry based annotations furthermore no tools are available to visually explore relationships and networks among functionally_related groups of metabolites biomedical concepts such a tool would provide the ability to establish testable_hypotheses regarding links among metabolic_pathways cellular_processes phenotypes and diseases results here we present conceptmetab an interactive web_based for mapping and exploring the relationships among biologically defined metabolite sets developed from gene_ontology kegg and medical_subject using both kegg and pubchem compound identi fiers and based on statistical_tests for association we demonstrate the utility of conceptmetab with multiple scenarios showing it can be used to identify known and potentially novel relationships among metabolic_pathways cellular_processes phenotypes and diseases and provides an intuitive_interface for linking compounds to their molecular_functions and higher_level biological_effects availability_and http conceptmetab in recent_years metabolomics has emerged as a new quantitative technique with the ability to characterize large_numbers of small_molecules in a wide_variety of biological_samples advances in liquid chromatographymass spectrometry lcms gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms and nuclear_magnetic nmr allow rapid and quantitative measurement of several hundreds of metabolites untargeted lcms based_methods have potential to push the number of detected metabolites to several thousands however securing the identities of the individual_features remains_challenging and time consuming as experimental detection methods continue to improve metabolomics has the potential to provide increasingly informative readouts of metabolic changes in complex in contrast to genes and proteins metabolites have been described as providing direct signatures of biochemical activity and are therefore easier to correlate with phenotype following these technological_advances a number of pathway_databases and tools linking metabolites to biochemical_reactions enzymes proteins and genes were developed reviewed in among these there are several tools for metabolite set enrichment testing including msea metaboanalyst and mbrole these programs follow the paradigm of gene_set tools which test for biological_functions or pathways e g gene_ontology go or kegg_pathways that have significant gene overlap with an experimentally_derived set of genes biological_interpretation of metabolites has unique challenges compared to genes including a relatively small number of measurable metabolites low coverage of those by annotation databases and the presence of ubiquitous metabolites e g co factors to improve the annotation of small_molecules to their biological_contexts we developed metab mesh which contains significant associations p between compounds and biomedical terms metab mesh uses pubchem and medical_subject mesh_terms to identify statistically_significant co occurrences of metabolites and mesh_terms in published manuscripts thus annotating metabolites to biomedical concepts via the literature an additional challenge to working with metabolites is the lack of convenient standardized identifiers while iupac nomenclature provides a systematic method of naming organic_compounds and chemists use the cas registry number biologists prefer more familiar names that often ignore counter_ions consequently biological_databases often contain such names or use their own identifiers to address these challenges careful assembly of metabolite sets with synonyms and cross_references is needed due to these challenges metabolite enrichment testing has not been as widely used as for genes enrichment testing among predefined biologically_relevant metabolite sets can help us better understand and overcome the above challenges and improve enrichment testing with experimental_data the careful assembly characterization and exploration of metabolite sets could facilitate the discovery of relationships among metabolic_reactions diseases and other biological_phenomena in terms of the metabolites involved indeed several tools for exploring similar relationships based on gene_sets exist and have been fundamental in generating novel hypotheses and identifying unexpected associations however no comparable tool based on small metabolites yet exists we have developed conceptmetab to explore the relationships among metabolite based biomedical concepts and generate novel hypotheses metabolites were annotated to biomedical concepts using kegg the three branches of go and medical_subject from the national_library mesh statistically_significant associations were identified among all pairs of metabolite sets concepts and maintained with additional supporting_information the conceptmetab website enables searching browsing filtering and data exporting capabilities as well as complementary visualizations network graphs and heatmaps we demonstrate the utility of conceptmetab with example workflows and by illustrating important relationships identified with metabolites that were not identified with genes in summary conceptmetab assists in understanding links between metabolites metabolic_pathways and biological_phenomena phenotypes environmental_exposures and diseases as the ultimate readout of metabolic_state metabolomics has the potential to transform our understanding of mechanisms underlying_disease and further enhance knowledge generation through integration with other omics_data as experimental metabolomics matures and the number of measurable metabolites approaches the estimated number of endogenous metabolites metabolomics together with transcriptomics proteomics and epigenomics will provide a comprehensive understanding of a biological system as a whole while gene based_technologies analysis methods and annotation have well established standards and an abundance of relevant bioinformatics software the parallel requirements for high_throughput metabolomics still lag far behind as a step towards bridging this gap we have developed a tool that annotates both endogenous and synthetic small compounds to various types of biological_concepts and that provides interactive_exploration of the relationships among these concepts with the novel mesh based annotation source we have increased the number of annotated metabolites by fold and shown that many relevant relationships not identified by genes are identified via metabolites the ability to visualize relationships not only between pairs of metabolite sets but also the network_structure among many can help bridge the gaps from molecular level to phenotype level to population level biomedical concepts no other program allows testing for significant_enrichment among predefined metabolite sets the few programs that currently offer enrichment testing of experimental metabolite sets only annotate a small minority of compounds the next step will be to expand upon conceptmetab to offer such analysis with greatly expanded annotation in conceptmetab both kegg and pubchem ids were used to maximize annotation giving us the benefits of both traditional annotation sources such as kegg and go and our mesh_term annotations we chose kegg because it is well established consistent and cross_referenced with pubchem we recognize that other databases such as biocyc
