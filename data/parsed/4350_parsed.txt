sparse quadratic time simultaneous alignment and folding of rnas without sequence_based heuristics motivation rna_seq experiments have revealed a multitude of novel ncrnas the gold_standard for their analysis based on simultaneous alignment and folding suffers from extreme time complexity of on subsequently numerous faster sankoff style approaches have been suggested commonly the performance of such methods relies on sequence_based heuristics that restrict the search_space to optimal or near optimal sequence_alignments however the accuracy of sequence_based breaks down for rnas with sequence_identities below alignment approaches like locarna that do not require sequence_based heuristics have been limited to high_complexity quartic time results breaking this barrier we introduce the novel sankoff style algorithm sparsified prediction and alignment of rnas based on their structure ensembles sparse which runs in quadratic time without sequence_based heuristics to achieve this low complexity on par with sequence_alignment sparse features strong sparsification based on structural_properties of the rna ensembles following pmcomp sparse gains further speed up from lightweight energy computation although all existing lightweight sankoff style methods restrict sankoffs original model by disallowing loop deletions and insertions sparse transfers the sankoff algorithm to the lightweight energy_model completely for the first time compared with locarna sparse achieves similar alignment and better folding quality in significantly less time speedup at similar run time it aligns low sequence_identity instances substantially more accurate than raf which uses sequence_based heuristics availability_and sparse is freely_available atthe majority of transcripts are non_coding ncrnas which unlike mrnas do not code for proteins ncrnas are associated with a large range of important_cellular furthermore there is increasing evidence of pervasive transcription e g particularly up to ncrnas have been predicted in the human_genome alone analyzing the huge amount of rna_sequences poses major challenges for bioinformatics particularly since the sequence of related ncrnas is often conserved only weakly while the rnas can still share a strongly conserved consensus structure therefore taking sequence and structure similarity into account is indispensable for ncrna analysis however accurate methods for this purpose have extreme computational costs the gold_standard for rna alignment has been introduced by because structure_prediction and alignment of rnas depend on each other sankoffs approach solves the alignment and folding problem simultaneously for two rna_sequences it finds two energetically_favorable structures of the same shape together with a good alignment that reflects the similarity of the structures for this purpose sankoff composes its objective_function from a sequence_alignment score and the free_energies of the two structures because of the extreme on time complexity of this algorithm numerous sankoff like strategies have been developed aiming to speed up sankoffs task while preserving accuracy as much as possible a major class of such methods utilizes information from sequencebased alignment to reduce_the for the computationally much more expensive alignment and folding algorithm this idea was introduced in and later refined by dowell and eddy and the latter restricts the alignment space to an envelope around the base matches whose sequence_alignment probabilities exceed a fixed cutoff generally such approaches have to cope with the well known fact that sequence_alignment fails for sequence_identities below consequently sequence_alignments can provide hints at the optimal structure based alignment but are potentially far off moreover even with such improvements sankoff like methods remain too expensive for large analysis tasks like clustering putative ncrnas in large_datasets e g the entire human_transcriptome or even meta genomics data pmcomp suggested a fundamentally different route to faster rna alignment it introduced a new sankofflike scoring model that enables lightweight computation for this purpose it employs a base_pair based energy_model instead of the original loop based energy_model furthermore pmcomp simplifies sankoffs model by predicting only a single consensus structure tools like locarna foldalignm and locarna p build on the pmcomp model but additionally sparsify the folding spaces of both rnas resulting in on time complexity carna extends the pmcomp model to pseudoknot structures raf combined the ideas of resulting in a lightweight sankoff variant with sequence_based speed up we presented a novel method for simultaneous alignment and folding of rnas the relevance of this method is fold first we developed the first full featured lightweight variant of the sankoff model this fundamentally improves over the lightweight model of pmcomp because this model drastically lowered the computational_burden of simultaneous alignment and folding it has been adopted by many successful rna alignment approaches however all of these methods lack the full flexibility of the sankoff model for the first time sparse combines this flexibility with lightweight computation second we present a novel method to speed up sankoff style alignment that is purely based on the structure ensemble of rnas in particular it does not have to resort to sequence_based heuristics which could compromise the alignment_quality we showed that by sparsification based on ensemble probabilities of unpaired bases and base_pairs in specific loops simultaneous alignment and folding requires only quadratic time performing bralibase benchmarks we demonstrated that also in practice the method provides a profound speed up at similar speed as one of the fastest known simultaneous alignment and folding tools raf sparse maintains high alignment and folding quality for the twilight zone of rnas with low sequence_identity which are particularly hard to align finally these benchmarks and concrete examples see appendix suggest that the added expressivity of the novel lightweight model improves the folding accuracy
