data_and remark an automatic program for clustering orthologs flexibly combining a recursive and a markov clustering_algorithms remark is a fully_automatic tool for clustering orthologs by combining a recursive and a markov_clustering mcl algorithms the remark detects and recursively clusters ortholog pairs through reciprocal blast best hits between multiple_genomes running software_program recursiveclustering java in the first step then it employs mcl algorithm to compute the clusters score matrices generated from the previous step and refines the clusters by adjusting an inflation_factor running software_program markovclustering java this method has two key features one utilizes to get more reliable results the diagonal scores in the matrix of the initial ortholog clusters another clusters orthologs flexibly through being controlled naturally by mcl with a selected inflation_factor users can therefore select the fitting state of orthologous protein clusters by regulating the inflation_factor according to their research_interests availability_and source_code for the orthologous protein clustering software is freely_available use at http dasan sejong ac kr wikim notice html implemented_in and supported on windows and linux contact identifying orthologs automatically is very useful for functional_annotation and studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics an orthology group identified by a semi_automated method is the clusters of orthologous group cog database in national_center ncbi it first identifies groups of three proteins with best reciprocal blast hits and then performs case by case manual_analysis to eliminate false_positives introduces inparanoid a fully_automatic program to detect orthologs and inparalogs between two species developed orthomcl which generates orthologs from multiple species using the mcl algorithm the mcl algorithm is known to be effective for detecting protein_families with especially complicated domain structure it is a graph partitioning algorithm based on network flow which is to simulate the flow to whom correspondence should be addressed within a graph such that the flow is encouraged where the current is strong but it is discouraged where the current is weak we here introduce the remark tool that clusters orthologs flexibly through adjusting a parameter according to the users interest the fundamental algorithms and its evaluation were introduced in the previous work based on reciprocal blast best hits of gene_pairs between two genomes the method_utilizes to get more reliable results the diagonal scores in the matrix of the initial ortholog clusters and clusters orthologs flexibly through being controlled naturally by mcl with a selected inflation_factor users can therefore select the fitting state of orthologous protein clusters by regulating the inflation_factor according to their research_interests
