tarpred a web_application for predicting therapeutic and side effect targets of chemical_compounds motivation discovering the relevant therapeutic_targets for drug like molecules or their unin tended off targets that predict adverse_drug is a daunting task by experimental_approaches alone there is thus a high_demand to develop computational_methods capable of detecting these potential interacting targets efficiently results as biologically annotated chemical data are becoming increasingly available it becomes feasible to explore such existing knowledge to identify potential ligandtarget interactions here we introduce an online implementation of a recently_published computational_model for target prediction tarpred based on a reference library containing individual targets with active ligands tarpred accepts interactive graphical input or input in the chemical file_format of smiles given a query compound structure it provides the top_ranked interacting targets for each of them tarpred not only shows the structures of three most similar ligands that are known to interact with the target but also highlights the disease indications associated with the target this information is useful for understanding the mechanisms of action and toxicities of active_compounds and can provide drug_repositioning opportunities an emerging avenue that brings system biology to drug_discovery is polypharmacology which hypothesizes that most drugs exert their effects via multi_target interactions such drug promiscuity has also led to unwanted and unexplained drug reactions it is therefore in high_demand to develop in silico approaches for identifying potential biological_targets for chemical_compounds which can be used to i obtain small_molecules with optimum therapeutic_effects ii explore ligandtarget interactions and their related biochemical_mechanisms and iii increase research productivity towards valid drug_repositioning recently the rapid_growth of bioassay data volume has brought new opportunities to in silico target prediction a plethora of ligand based target prediction_models has been proposed for example the is a featured one among them that quantitatively estimates pharmacological relationships of targets by the set similarities of their respective ligands these relationships have led to the discovery of many new uses and side_effects for drugs by compiling a large reference library containing drug relevant target families individual ligands and a total of binding data between them we initially_developed an efficient and accurate target fishing scheme using k nearest_neighbor knn based data fusion with molecular similarity searching compared with sea the proposed approach exhibited superior_performance on predicting both therapeutic and off targets for the approved drugs from drugbank and therapeutic target_database ttd it also showed excellent results on other external validations that try to identify newly_reported ligandtarget interactions or to predict side effect targets for drugs withdrawn due to human ether a go gorelated gene herg toxicity to bring more benefits of this approach we here present a user_friendly web_application that permits easy and effective drug_targets prediction
