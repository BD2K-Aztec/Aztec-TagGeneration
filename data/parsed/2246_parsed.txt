data_and hum calculator and hum package for r easy to use software_tools for multicategory receiver_operating analysis receiver_operating roc_analysis is usually applied in bioinformatics to evaluate the abilities of biological_markers to differentiate between the presence_or of a disease it includes the derivation of the useful scalar performance measure area_under for binary_classification tasks as real applications often deal with more than two classes multicategory roc_analysis and the corresponding hypervolume under the manifold hum measure have become a topic of growing interest to support researchers in carrying out multicategory roc_analysis we have developed two tools in different programming environments which feature user_friendly object oriented and flexible interfaces and enable the user to compute hum values and plot d and d roc_curves availability the software is freely_available from our web sitereceiver operating characteristic roc_analysis as an alternative to classification_accuracy has been used extensively to estimate the discriminative_power of classifiers in two class classification_problems during the last decade several theoretical investigations in the field of multicategory roc_analysis have provided different approaches to calculate the hypervolume under the manifold hum the equivalent to the area_under auc of binary roc_analysis in a multidimensional setting the special_case of class roc_analysis is described in where for each class the two possible misclassifications are treated equally a so_called one versus rest scenario in the average of all one versus rest aucs is proposed as an approximation of the auc we recently reported a new extension of roc_analysis which uses a simple scheme to compare two or more classifiers in their abilities to differentiate among multiple categories this approach to multicategory roc_analysis expresses the discriminatory_ability of the classifier as a hum measure with perfect discrimination corresponding to a hum of and the hum of the null_hypothesis to n where n corresponds to the number of categories to be separated several r packages for two class roc_analysis exist but they do not allow to take into account multiple categories we here present two software_tools that should make multicategory roc_analysis available to a broader scientific_community
