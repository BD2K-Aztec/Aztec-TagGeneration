linear effects models of signaling_pathways from combinatorial perturbation data motivation perturbations constitute the central means to study signaling_pathways interrupting components of the pathway and analyzing observed effects of those interruptions can give insight into unknown connections within the signaling_pathway itself as well as the link from the pathway to the effects different pathway_components may have different individual contributions to the measured perturbation_effects such as gene_expression changes those effects will be observed in combination when the pathway_components are perturbed extant approaches focus either on the reconstruction of pathway structure or on resolving how the pathway_components control the downstream_effects results here we propose a linear effects model which can be applied to solve both these problems from combinatorial perturbation data we use simulated_data to demonstrate the accuracy of learning the pathway structure as well as estimation of the individual contributions of pathway_components to the perturbation_effects the practical utility of our approach is illustrated by an application to perturbations of the mitogen_activated in saccharomyces_cerevisiae signaling_pathways convey stimuli from the outside or inside of the cell to generate required cellular response for example under osmotic_stress the high_osmolarity glycerol hog mitogen_activated mapk_pathway in yeast is activated and the signal is transported from the receptors down to the mapkk pbs which in turn phosphorylates the mapk hog finally hog regulates several transcription_factors which activate the hyper osmotic stress_response genes the central means to study signaling_pathways is by cellular perturbations hence computational_analysis modeling and interpretation of perturbation data constitute the crucial tools in the field examples of experimental perturbations include crispr_cas genome_editing genetic knock outs gene_deletions or transcriptional knock downs through rna_interference rnai for the hog pathway in saccharomyces_cerevisiae its components were perturbed by deletion and the effect of these perturbations was assessed in osmotic stress_conditions by measuring global expression changes between perturbed and wild_type cells o the rationale behind the perturbation studies is that interrupting the signal flow in the pathways gives insight into both their structure and their downstream_targets first with the interruption at a certain node in the pathway the signal cannot be transmitted further for example when the mapkk is deleted the mapk downstream cannot be phosphorylated in this way perturbations propagate in the pathway along its edges in the same way as the signal second each node in the pathway may have its own direct_or contribution to the perturbation_effects such as gene_expression changes those effects will be observed in combination when the pathway_components are perturbed the focus of the present work is computational_analysis of cellular_signaling from perturbation data the aim is to model the structure of interactions within the pathway as well as the contributions of its components to the observed perturbation_effects the proposed approach is motivated by two problems that are inherent to the analysis of perturbation data the first problem concerns the perturbation effect gap problem a common discrepancy between the perturbed and the observed variables in most experimental_studies the perturbed signaling_pathway constitutes one layer of the system layer in only indirectly connected to v c the author published_by to our knowledge lem is the first approach which uses observed effects of perturbations of hidden_variables to tackle two tasks at the same time first it resolves the interconnections between the perturbed pathway_components layer in and second it derives their individual contributions to the observed effects layer results on simulated_data clearly show that lems are indeed capable of accurately solving both tasks one group of existing_approaches with the most prominent class of models based on nested effects assumption nems and extensions is mostly concerned with the first task the output brought by lems from perturbation data is richer than what can be inferred with the nem based_methods but also requires more input as well as sensitivity y axis b e and specificity y axis c f of edge learning decrease with growing noise levels indicated by colours and increase with the number of times the experiments are repeated x axis both for the exhaustive_search over node networks ac and greedy search over node networks df the addition of an increasing number of non linear effects colours g h i decreases the fraction of perfectly learned pathways y axis g as well as sensitivity y axis h and specificity y axis i of edge learning regardless of the number of times the experiments are repeated x axis here plotted for greedy network search the performance of structure_learning is most affected by high noise values and addition of non linear effects
