sparql enabled identifier conversion with identifiers org motivation on the semantic_web in life_sciences in particular data is often distributed via multiple resources each of these sources is likely to use their own international resource identifier for conceptually the same resource or database record the lack of correspondence between identifiers introduces a barrier when executing federated sparql queries across life_science data results we introduce a novel sparql based service to enable on the fly integration of life_science data this service uses the identifier patterns defined in the identifiers org registry to generate a plurality of identifier variants which can then be used to match source identifiers with target identi fiers we demonstrate the utility of this identifier integration approach by answering queries across major producers of life_science linked data availability_and the sparql based identifier conversion service is available without restriction at http identifiers org services sparql semantic_web technologies such as the resource_description rdf http www w org tr rdf primer and sparql http www w org tr rdf sparql query offer a powerful paradigm for publishing and exploring life_science data through standardization of format and data access for example the open_source bio rdf project converts dozens of public biological_databases and datasets from legacy formats into rdf and provides a mechanism to explore these as linked data recently established bioinformatic organizations such as dbcls http togows dbcls jp ncbi https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov rdf nextprot and the embl ebi in collaboration with the uniprot consortium have made some datasets available in rdf thereby significantly extending the network of the linked open data all efforts use http based international resource identifiers iris to identify and link data items this facilitates querying across network linked resources but the lack of a universal identifier system requires mappings across all the different identifiers in use identifiers org the identifiers org registry contains data collections and over iri patterns the service can be used to find alternative but equivalent iris or check whether two iris identify the same concept for supported data collections this service eliminates the need to know the set of valid iri patterns in advance and the need to devise elaborate string manipulation operations in a federated sparql query the query example below illustrates how the service can be used to query across datasets with different iri schemes in this example we run a federated query to find human proteins from uniprot and their domains from interpro bio rdf that are used in a models components of type sbml species from biomodels linked dataset this query can be executed using biomodels sparql endpoint http www ebi ac uk rdf services biomodels sparql and takes around s the service bridges the gap between the identifiers org specified bio rdf specified and uniprot specified identifiers further examples are readily available at http identifiers org documentation leveraging the wealth of biomedical big_data for discovery requires simple and effective approaches to tame the challenge of working with heterogeneous overlapping and diverse data of particular concern is assignment of different identifiers for identical resources as well as for conceptually identical resources identifier integration is the subject of much research that focuses either on integrating conceptually identical objects or their relations van in contrast our work focuses on the problem of having multiple identifiers for the same database object which is an emerging issue among semantic_web data providers our solution is rapid scalable and will grow to provide new identifier based mappings as additional iri patterns are added to the identifiers org registry this iri conversion service provided by identifiers org as a sparql service will enable users to focus on asking meaningful questions across biological_datasets of interest rather than figuring out how to generate the right identifiers
