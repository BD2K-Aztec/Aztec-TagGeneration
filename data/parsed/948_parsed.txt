databases_and chemblspace a graphical explorer of the chemogenomic space covered by the chembl database motivation the chemblspace graphical explorer enables the identification of compounds from the chembl database which exhibit a desirable polypharmacology profile this profile can be predefined or created iteratively and the tool can be extended to other datathere is much recent interest in designing ligands with well defined polypharmacology arising both from the increased awareness of the multiple interactions of existing_drugs and the likely improved efficacy of treatments which engage at several points in biological_networks it is straightforward to search public or proprietary data_sources for compounds which are known to hit predefined sets of targets to provide starting points for a multi_target discovery project meanwhile visualization approaches have been developed that analyse a biologically_motivated protein network for molecules that show interactions with more than one component this allows the opportunistic identification of previously unconsidered target combinations there are several powerful network_visualization and analysis tools available for this purpose including several free open_source applications e g cytoscape however these tools are designed to support arbitrary network types thus it is not directly possible to analyse a chemogenomic network in combination with molecular_structures and activity profiles this integration of visual network exploration and activity profile lookup can be achieved by chemblspace the user_interface is designed for the visual_exploration of a chemogenomic space in which the network vertices correspond to proteins that have at least one ligand in common with other targets the user can interactively select proteins and list their ligands subsequently designing an activity profile by adding more targets or anti targets to the selection and adjusting protein specific activity thresholds furthermore the user does not have to know the profile in advance but can create it interactively considering the matching ligands as well as other associated proteins that might not have been clear choices initially the molecules that meet the created activity profile are displayed within the application and the full collection can be saved as an sd file
