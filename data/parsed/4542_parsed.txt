genetics_and te displayer for post genomic analysis of transposable_elements te displayer can be used to retrieve genetic_polymorphisms caused by transposable_elements tes in large genomic_datasets and present the results on virtual gel images this enables researchers to compare te profiles in silico and provides reference profiles for experimental analyses availability_and freely_available on the web attransposable elements tes are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic_organisms tes have caused profound structural and functional changes to genomes where they continue to persist in and shape the evolution of the host the molecular domestication of tes in eukaryotic_organisms has resulted in viral immunity against murine_leukemia in mus species the maintenance of telomeres in drosophila and has contributed to site_specific v d j recombination in jawed_vertebrates although the majority of tes are not currently active their historical activity led to te derived polymorphisms the currently active tes are a major driving_force for genome_evolution and revealing te activity is also essential to understanding genome_evolution one method to reveal genome_wide insertions caused by tes is transposon display td this technique is a modification of a previously described technique referred to as amplified_fragment aflp den td starts with the digestion of genomic_dna with a restriction_enzyme adapter oligonucleotides are then ligated to the digested_genomic fragments the first round of amplification pre amplification is performed using a primer complementary to the adapter sequence and another primer complementary to the target te a second selective pcr_reaction is often performed using the pre amplification products as templates with a nested primer_set selective amplification pcr_products are analyzed by gel or capillary_electrophoresis if a te family has a high_copy in a genome selective nucleotide s can be added to the end of the adapter primer used in the selective amplification reducing the to whom correspondence should be addressed number of bands per lane den the approximate copy_number of a te family in a genome can be estimated from the number of bands differences in banding_patterns reveal te insertion polymorphisms between individuals current te transposition activity in an individual organism may be inferred from the appearance of new bands on a td gel here we describe a computational algorithm that follows the conceptual principles of td the program called te displayer has a graphical_user and runs on windows and linux operating_systems supplementary the output includes a virtual gel image and detailed genomic location information for each band te displayer was tested using tes in the aedes_aegypti drosophila_melanogaster caenorhabditis_elegans arabidopsis_thaliana and oryza_sativa genomes and all of the output from te displayer is consistent with the output from manual_inspection the mobility of a dna_fragment on acrylamide gel is inversely proportional to its size therefore the positions of the bands are calculated using the formula d d s s where d is distance and s is size
