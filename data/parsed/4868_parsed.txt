data_and visualgraphx interactive graph visualization within galaxy motivation we developed visualgraphx a web_based interactive visualization_tool for large_scale graphs current graph visualization_tools that follow the rich internet paradigm lack an interactive and scalable visualization of graph_based data visualgraphx aims to provide a universal graph visualization_tool that empowers the users to efficiently explore the data for themselves at a large_scale it is available as a visualization plugin for the galaxy platform such that visualgraphx can be integrated into custom analysis_pipelines availability_and visualgraphx has been released as a visualization plugin for the galaxy platform under afl and is available with instructions and application data atany biological system carries out its function through an elaborate interaction of a multitude of molecular_components that together form complex biological_networks visualization of these networks is of great interest in modern biology as it helps to gain insight into complex biological_processes provide an overview of some of the major biological_networks for which graphs are an appropriate mathematical representation as of today various desktop based applications that are able to visualize large_scale graphs exist most notable are cytoscape gephi and tulip in addition the graphviz software_package provides a comprehensive collection of open_source tools for the visualization of graphs on the basis of the dot graph description language it is widely_distributed because it can be called from general_purpose languages via specific interfaces however the emergence of the internet as the default software platform triggered a shift toward rich internet applications these provide a rich and interactive user experience in a cross_platform manner through a standard web_browser visualization of large_scale graphs benefits from this paradigm as web development technologies facilitate interactivity and scalability touchgraph v r touchgraph llc usa tom sawyer visualization v r tom sawyer software usa and many eyes follow the rich internet paradigm and are able to visualize graph data in a sophisticated manner but still lagging behind the possibilities offered by current web standards and are beyond that not optimized for biological_networks similarly cytoscape_web is a web_based network visualization_tool that is modeled after cytoscape hyperscape implements hypergraphs to capture complex hierarchical structures but has its limitations in the generalization for biological_networks nevertheless hypergraphs provide an interesting concept both in the visualization and analysis of biological_networks the galaxy system for biological data analysis for a long time did not offer graph visualization recently an effort for the visualization of graphs graphvis https github com eterisokhoyan graphvis has been integrated into the galaxy main instance it is based on the cytoscape library for javascript we aim to contribute to this field and present visualgraphx for the interactive_exploration of large_scale graphs in a scalable manner that utilizes current web standards to provide a rich user_interaction v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comwe used visualgraphx for the visualization of the results of covenntree which is a method for the comparative_analysis of large_datasets covenntree generates a rooted tree based on the ncbi taxonomy in which the nodes are associated with weighted venn diagrams to illustrate the relation of the different datasets creation of the diagrams is outsourced because they are given as urls to the google chart api which visualgraphx can handle directly the output of covenntree consists of a network file that defines the structure of the tree and a corresponding attribute file that contains the properties of the nodes we wrote a tool that converts these files to the json graph format namely vgx converter installable through the galaxy toolshed as visualgraphx precomputes an initial subgraph as opposed to loading the full graph at once it accelerates the buildup of large_scale graphs loading a graph that contains nodes and edges mtor chembl jgf with visualgraphx took s while loading into cytoscape took roughly s which corresponds to speedup we further increased the network size to k nodes egdes for which the buildup of the graph took about s for further illustration of the general applicability of visualgraphx we visualized data from the causal biological_networks database we have converted several different biological_networks from this database and deposited them in the repository for visualization with visualgraphx with visualgraphx we present a general visualization plugin for the galaxy platform through which it can be easily integrated in any bioinformatics pipeline where interactive graph visualization is of interest visualgraphx has been structured with regard to the mvc concept and utilizes internal libraries of galaxy to accurately fit to the platform for the visualization we made use of widespread web standards that allow us to provide a more dynamic and interactive_visualization of large_scale graphs than current_tools furthermore the structure of visualgraphx allows it to be extended for more specific use cases of graph visualization and its streaming design where data is loaded and visualized on demand ensures its performance even for large_scale graphs
