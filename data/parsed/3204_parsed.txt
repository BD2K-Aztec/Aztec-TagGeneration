systems_biology ncc auc an auc optimization method to identify multi biomarker_panel for cancer_prognosis from genomic and clinical data downloaded from motivation in prognosis and survival studies an important goal is to identify multi biomarker panels with predictive_power using molecular_characteristics or clinical_observations such analysis is often challenged by censored small_sample but high_dimensional genomic_profiles or clinical data therefore sophisticated models and algorithms are in pressing need results in this study we propose a novel area_under auc optimization method for multi biomarker_panel identification named nearest centroid classifier for auc optimization ncc auc our method is motived by the connection between auc score for classification_accuracy evaluation and harrells concordance_index in survival analysis this connection allows us to convert the survival time regression_problem to a binary classification_problem then an optimization model is formulated to directly maximize auc and meanwhile minimize the number of selected_features to construct a predictor in the nearest centroid classifier framework ncc auc shows its great performance by validating both in genomic_data of breast_cancer and clinical data of stage_ib non_small nsclc for the genomic_data ncc auc outperforms support_vector svm and support_vector based recursive_feature svm rfe in classification_accuracy it tends to select a multi biomarker_panel with low average redundancy and enriched biological meanings also ncc auc is more significant in separation of low and high_risk cohorts than widely used cox_model cox_proportional and l cox_model l penalized in cox_model these performance gains of ncc auc are quite robust across subtypes of breast_cancer further in an independent clinical data ncc auc outperforms svm and svm rfe in predictive_accuracy and is consistently better than cox_model and l cox_model in grouping patients into high and low_risk categories conclusion in summary ncc auc provides a rigorous optimization framework to systematically reveal multi biomarker_panel from genomic and clinical data it can serve as a useful tool to identify prognostic_biomarkers for survival analysis survival analysis studies the time to occurrence of a certain event identifying significant biomarkers for prediction is longstanding as an important topic to provide better understanding here one key challenge is that the outcome variable of interest for survival analysis is sometimes censored which means the survive time is only partially known in addition the candidate features are always in high_dimension with the rapid development of high_throughput measurement technologies as a result discovering feature combinations is suffering from curse of dimensionality how to overcome the above difficulties and identify the most accurate prognostic multi biomarker_panel from survival data to assist_clinicians is the problem we want to address the most widely used model for survival analysis is cox_proportional cox_model it can handle the censored survival data in a rigorous way and provides an estimation of the hazard_ratio and its confidence_interval however cox_model directly utilizes the noisy and censored_data to predict the survival ratio thus often leads to poor_prognosis also cox_model uses all features with high_dimensionality in general it is trained on a particular dataset and usually generalized poorly to other independent datasets to avoid_overfitting l penalized cox_model l cox_model was proposed to perform variable_selection and shrinkage which makes it very useful for de_noising and identifying the most meaningful features nonetheless both cox_model and l cox_model heavily depend on the quality of input survival time in reality harrells concordance_index ci is a widely used performance measure for assessing prediction_models in survival analysis the main idea is that it doesnt consider the value of survival time but the rank of patients by their survival_times in dream breast cancer_prognosis challenge challenge models will be scored by calculating the ci between the predicted survival and the true survival information in the validation dataset the final_assessment of models and the determination of the best performer will be based on the ci of predictions on the test_dataset http www the dream project org recently ci is used to assess the clinical_utility of cancer genomic and proteomic_data across tumor_types in the cancer_genome tcga project in this sense it is natural to directly optimize ci to select biomarkers and construct predictive_models however maximizing ci is a non convex_optimization with non differentiable objective_function and hard to solve we notice that ci and auc area_under are identical and equate the mann_whitney statistics in the absence of censored_data we could use auc to assess the classification_accuracy and further to approximate ci with this connection our motivation is to convert survival time regression to a binary classification_problem and then maximizing auc for example we choose the year threshold in practice without loss of generality i e we predict whether the patient can live longer than years in clinical study the year survival_rate is commonly used as a survival_rate for estimating the prognosis of a particular disease it serves as a general accepted standard by the american_cancer to assess the cancer malignancy in addition year threshold leads to the balanced positive_and datasets supplemental in this way we focus to solve a classification_problem about maximizing auc classical classification methods such as support_vector logistic_regression k nearest_neighbor have been widely used in survival analysis and achieved good performance moreover proposed the time dependent auc which was adopted as evaluation for the model performance nevertheless none of these methods optimize auc directly to construct classifiers auc is an important performance measure that has been widely used some algorithms have been developed to optimize auc based on surrogate loss those technologies can be borrowed in optimizing auc to deal with the censored survival data meanwhile the rapidly developed high_throughput measuring techniques usually generate high_dimensional genomic or clinical data feature_selection is necessary along with model estimation to reduce data dimension and model_complexity also it helps to provide intuitive understanding here we denote selected_features having potential diagnostic usage as biomarkers importantly features combine in linear or nonlinear ways to improve diagnostic_accuracy this useful feature combination is named as multi biomarker_panel its a challenging_task to select a biomarker subset to maximize accuracy in computation here wrapper methods give a good example for its complexity the idea of these state of art feature_selection is to use each subset to train a model and then test on a hold out dataset since wrapper methods need to go through all the possible subsets they are computationally_intensive for example if there are features it should train models to select the best subset by comparing models error_rates on the hold out validation dataset to reduce the computational_complexity some heuristic methods have been proposed for example support_vector based recursive_feature svm rfe has become one of the leading methods and is being widely used it adopts an intuitive strategy to remove a feature with the smallest coefficient in svm model one step we note that this stepwise feature selection_strategy may miss some critical feature combinations in this article we convert the survival time regression to a classification_problem aiming to select a small group of biomarkers and maximize auc score specially we propose a single optimization model based on nearest centroid classifier with feature_selection which maximizes auc and minimizes the number of selected_features simultaneously to make the computation tractable maximizing auc is slacked to minimize a loss function meanwhile we use l norm to minimize the number of selected_features instead of l norm thus make it could be efficiently solved by a linear_programming finally our method predicts whether a patient survives longer than years in a fast and efficient way to validate the performance we apply the new method to gene_expression data of breast_cancer and clinical data of stage_ib non_small nsclc the results show that our method can identify panels of biomarkers with good survival prediction_performance
