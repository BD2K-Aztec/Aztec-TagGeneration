prediction of individualized therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer from genomic_profiles motivation somatic homozygous_deletions of chromosomal_regions in cancer while not necessarily oncogenic may lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities specific to cancer_cells compared with normal cells a recently reported example is the loss of one of the two isoenzymes in glioblastoma cancer_cells such that the use of a specific_inhibitor selectively inhibited_growth of the cancer_cells which had become fully dependent on the second isoenzyme we have now made use of the unprecedented conjunction of large_scale cancer_genomics profiling of tumor_samples in the cancer_genome tcga and of tumor_derived in the cancer_cell as well as the availability of integrated pathway_information systems such as pathway_commons to systematically search for a comprehensive set of such epistatic vulnerabilities results based on homozygous_deletions affecting metabolic_enzymes in tcga cancer studies and cancer_cell we identified candidate metabolic vulnerabilities present in tumor_samples and cell_lines up to of these vulnerabilities can be targeted with at least one food_and drug we suggest focused experiments to test these vulnerabilities and clinical_trials based on personalized genomic_profiles of those that pass preclinical filters we conclude that genomic_profiling will in the future provide a promising basis for network pharmacology of epistatic vulnerabilities as a_promising availability_and a web_based for exploring all vulnerabilities and their details is available at http cbio mskcc org cancergenomics statius along with supplemental data_files comprehensive cancer profiling studies such as the cancer_genome tcga and other studies by the international cancer genome consortium have helped identify many genomic_alterations in cancer_genomes including homozygous_deletions that often result from genomic_instability deletions that confer a proliferative advantage such as the homozygous_deletion of a tumor_suppressor are selected in cancer_cells via clonal_expansion other deletions with relatively little effect on the tumors proliferative capabilities can be seen at low frequencies when they are by chance co selected with other oncogenic events both types of deletions however result in the loss of a locus that often contains multiple genes such a deletion may not be lethal to a cell if one or more unaffected partner_genes e g an isoenzyme can sufficiently carry the load of the deleted partner but the loss of these passenger genes may create therapeutic vulnerabilities on loss of an initial gene interference with the function of its partner gene s may result in cell_death a phenomenon known as synthetic_lethality recently_published a case study for synthetic_lethality for glioblastoma enolase performs an essential function in cells catalyzing the conversion of phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic_pathway at least three known genes_encode enolase isoenzymes eno eno and eno eno has been shown to be homozygously deleted in certain glioblastomas probably as a passenger event to the deletion of erffi but the tumor_cells are able to survive because of the activity of other enolase encoding_genes in particular eno although the loss of eno alone may not be lethal cancer_cells lacking eno are selectively vulnerable to the loss of eno i e synthetic_lethality whereas non cancer_cells with intact eno can tolerate a loss of eno most of the cancer_genomics research focuses on identifying driver alterations by frequency or occurrence pattern and exploiting them to treat_cancer however there is an opportunity to exploit synthetic lethalities specific to particular populations of cancer_cells created by the homozygous loss of genes responsible for core cellular_functions these are rare patient specific events and there are no existing_tools for identifying these vulnerabilities for a given patient a system that can efficiently analyze genomic_data from biological_samples to identify particular therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer_cells specific to those samples based on potential synthetic_lethal partner_genes can identify personalized treatments to inhibit or kill those cancer_cells here we describe a computational_method statius named after the roman poet publius papinius statius who is known for his famous poems achilleid and thebaid to systematically predict metabolic vulnerabilities in tumor_samples from genomic_profiles we present results obtained from the analysis of publicly_available cancer studies integrating data in an automated manner from multiple data resourcesincluding several pathway_databases drugtarget annotation resources and cancer_genomics utilitieswe were able to predict sample specific metabolic vulnerabilities which result from a homozygous_deletion event in the corresponding sample and list drugs that can help exploit each particular vulnerability the complete list of the predicted vulnerabilities can be found at http cbio mskcc org cancergenomics statius
