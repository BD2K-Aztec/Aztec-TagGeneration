structural_bioinformatics the smartcyp cytochrome_p metabolism prediction server the smartcyp server is the first web_application for site of metabolism prediction of cytochrome_p mediated drug_metabolism availability the smartcyp server is freely_available for use on the web at www farma ku dk smartcyp where the smartcyp java program and source_code is also available for download the most important drug_metabolizing in humans are cytochromes p cyps they oxidize a wide_range of substrates and contribute to the metabolism of of all drugs while there are methods for site of metabolism prediction which are solely based on semi_empirical calculations of the substrates more accurate results should be achieved by explicitly including the reactivity of each site in a substrate hitherto reactivity models for cyps have been restricted to semi_empirical calculations of the stability of intermediates later studies have shown that more accurate activation_energies for cyps can be computed by performing very time consuming density_functional dft transition_state calculations on a heme_group porphyrin_ring model smartcyp however presents the first solution for both fast and exact prediction of cyp reactivity accuracy of activation_energies is ensured by making very extensive dft_calculations and speed is gained by saving these in a precalculated library so that they need only be looked up at execution smartcyp has been validated for prediction of metabolism by the a isoform which contributes to the metabolism of half of all drugs smartcyp has also been shown to work well for six other cyp isoforms b in this application note we describe the smartcyp server the first web_service for prediction of cyp mediated metabolism
