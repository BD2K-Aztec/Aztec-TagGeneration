bioinformatics_discovery sequence_analysis herpesviral helicase primase subunit ul is inactivated b family polymerase motivation herpesviruses are large dna_viruses causing a variety of diseases in humans and animals to develop effective treatment it is important to understand the mechanisms of their replication one of the components of the herpesviral dna_replication system is a heli caseprimase complex consisting of ul helicase ul primase and ul ul is an essential herpesviral protein involved in multiple proteinprotein_interactions intriguingly so_far no ul homologs outside of herpesviruses could be identified moreover nothing is known about its structure or domain_organization results here combining sensitive homology detection methods and homology_modeling we found that the ul protein_family is related to b family polymerases in the course of evolution ul has lost the active_site and has undergone a reduction of dna_binding the loss of active_site explains the failure to detect any catalytic_activity of ul a structural model of human_herpes ul constructed as part of the study is consistent with the mutation data targeting its interaction with primase ul it also provides a platform for studying multiple interactions that ul is involved in the two other components of helicaseprimase complex show evolutionary links with a newly characterized human primase that also has dna poly merase activity primpol and the pif helicase respectively the role of these enzymes in recovering stalled_replication suggests mechanistic and functional_similarities with herpesviral proteins herpesviruses are a large group of double_stranded ds dna_viruses responsible for a variety of human and animal_diseases therefore understanding herpesviral dna_replication is of great_importance for the development of effective drugs in addition many herpesviral dna_replication proteins have functional counterparts in eukaryotes thereby providing important insights into eukaryotic_dna mechanisms human_herpesvirus hhv has seven proteins essential for dna_replication these include origin binding_protein ul dna_polymerase ul and its processivity factor ul single_stranded ssb protein icp ul and the tripartite helicaseprimase complex consisting of ul ul and ul ul is a superfamily i dna_helicase related to yeast pif and bacterial recd ul is a primase belonging to the superfamily of archaeo eukaryotic primases ul does not have any known catalytic_activity it appears to be important for the nuclear_import of ul and ul and is known to interact not only with the ul ul subcomplex but also with ul icp and ul surprisingly despite the essential role of ul in dna_replication so_far nothing is known about its structure and domain_organization moreover there are no known homologs of ul outside the herpesviruses using a combination of sensitive homology detection methods and protein_structure modeling we explored the ul family and found that the c terminal half of ul is related to b family polymerases this finding came as a surprise because ul is devoid of catalytic_activity our subsequent sequence and structure analysis revealed that ul has lost motifs important for the polymerase catalytic_activity and has undergone a reduction of dna_binding to see whether ul ul ul helicase primase is evolutionary_conserved in herpesviruses we further explored each of the three components as a result we identified missing ul helicases in the family malacoherpesviridae thereby providing further support for the evolutionary_conservation of the helicaseprimase complex interestingly interactions related to those within the helicaseprimase complex have also been observed in eukaryotes our finding that ul is a homolog of b family polymerases and that it has lost the active_site explains why no catalytic_activity of ul could be found what could be the evolutionary origin of ul one possibility is that ul originated from the duplication of herpesviral dna_polymerase ul alternatively ul could be derived from some ancestral form of a b family polymerase however the sequence_similarity with b family polymerases is low precluding a straightforward answer to this question the analysis of homologs of ul and ul the other two subunits of helicaseprimase complex showed that their links to eukaryotic enzymes are even clearer thus all three components of helicaseprimase complex have mechanistic and perhaps functional_similarities with the corresponding eukaryotic_proteins for example ul an inactive polymerase may be compared with the c terminal region of pol which corresponds to an inactivated exonuclease polymerase module serving as a protein binding platform ul has recently been found to interact with the polymerase ul whereas yeast pif interacts with pol ul ul forms subassembly as part of helicase primase complex an interesting question is whether their eukaryotic homologs interact or at least cooperate in certain conditions although the direct evidence is lacking there are some hints that they might for example primpol and pif both help to bypass difficult to replicate sites the observation of the correlated expansion of the primpol like and pif protein_families in trypanosomes is another hint that they might be linked functionally if not physically at least two pairs of trypanosomal primpol and pif homologs participate in the same processes thus tbpri and tbpif function in replication of dna maxicircles while tbpri and tbpif are involved in replication and segregation of minicircles obviously differences between the herpesviral and the eukaryotic counterparts are to be expected however the consideration of similarities may provide help in advancing the knowledge in both systems
