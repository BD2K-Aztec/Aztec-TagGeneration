databases_and advance_access pip db the protein isoelectric_point database a proteins isoelectric_point or pi corresponds to the solution ph at which its net surface_charge is zero since the early days of solution biochemistry the pi has been recorded and reported and thus literature_reports of pi abound the protein isoelectric_point database pip db has collected and collated these data to provide an increasingly comprehensive database for comparison and bench marking purposes a web_application has been developed to warehouse this database and provide public access to this unique resource pip db is a web enabled sql database with an html gui front end pip db is fully searchable across a range of properties availability_and the pip db database and documentation are available at http www pipfor a macromolecular polyprotic systemsuch as protein dna or rnathe isoelectric or isoionic pointcommonly referred to as the isoelectric_point pi can be defined by the point of singularity in a titration curve corresponding to the solution ph value at which the net overall surface_charge and thus the mobility of the ampholyte sums to zero protein pis can be determined in several ways but are generally determined using either polyacrylamide gel_based isoelectric_focusing or ief or capillary ief or cief separation by pi is a key_component of d gel_electrophoresis a key precursor of proteomics where discrete spots can be digested in gel and proteins subsequently identified by analytical mass_spectrometry analysis of whole proteomes indicate that at the system level pis exhibit a multimodal distribution indicative of significant phylogenetic constraints on surface_charge theoretical_calculation of pis can aid proteome_analysis assuming the protein to be denatured calculation is rapid requiring only the sequence to be known most techniques exploit tabulated values for pka values for ionizable amino_acid which are assumed constant irrespective of structural context a proteins pi is one of the most comprehensively determined and widely_reported characteristic quantities in biochemistry and proteomics however such reports are typically almost incidental within the wider characterization of a protein or proteins thus far no dedicated web accessible database of protein pi values has been made available thus we describe here the protein pi database pip db our ongoing attempt to catalogue comprehensively the pis of proteins as reported in the literature
