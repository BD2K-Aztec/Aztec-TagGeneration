family genome_browser visualizing genomes with pedigree_information motivation families with inherited_diseases are widely used in mendelian complex disease studies owing to the advances in high_throughput family genome_sequencing becomes more and more prevalent visualizing family genomes can greatly_facilitate human_genetics studies and personalized_medicine however due to the complex genetic_relationships and high similarities among genomes of consanguineous family_members family genomes are difficult to be visualized in traditional genome visualization framework how to visualize the family genome variants and their functions with integrated pedigree_information remains a critical challenge results we developed the family genome_browser fgb to provide comprehensive analysis and visualization for family genomes the fgb can visualize family genomes in both individual_level and variant level effectively through integrating genome data with pedigree_information family genome_analysis including determination of parental origin of the variants detection of de_novo mutations identification of potential recombination_events and identical by decent segments etc can be performed flexibly diverse annotations for the family genome variants such as dbsnp memberships linkage disequilibriums genes variant effects potential phenotypes etc are illustrated as well moreover the fgb can automatically search de_novo mutations and compound_heterozygous variants for a selected individual and guide investigators to find high_risk genes with flexible navigation options these features enable users to investigate and understand family genomes intuitively and systematically availability_and the fgb is available atfamilies with inherited genetic_diseases are widely used as cases in mendelian complex disease studies recently advances in highthroughput sequencing_technologies have led the family genome_sequencing to become more and more popular in these studies through analysis of family genome sequencing_data such as variant_calling variant prioritizing etc researchers are able to better understand the genetic_basis of mendelian complex_diseases in variant level and create insights for disease prediction diagnosis and treatment in family genome_sequencing analysis millions of variants are called from sequencing_data most of them are rare or have no functional significance several methods such as gemini varianttools mendelscan farvat etc are developed to identify causal_variants in family_based of disease however visualization is always the most intuitive and straightforward approach to compare and validate the remaining candidates of disease_causing several methods tools and statistical_models have been developed for family based variant detection annotation and analysis mendelscan prioritizes candidate variants and searches mendeliandisease genes by analysing sequencing_data and pedigree phenotype information in family studies of mendelian_diseases gemini annotates genetic_variants by integrating a diverse and adaptable set of genome_annotations into a unified database to facilitate interpretation and data exploration varianttools provides a command_line driven toolset for building more sophisticated analytical_methods famann automatically selects and annotates variants segregating in each family and shared across families for facilitating disease variants or genes discovery in family based sequencing studies var md analyses the dna sequence_variants produced by human exome_sequencing and generates a ranked_list of variants using predicted pathogenicity mendelian_inheritance models genotype quality and population variant frequency data farvat is a family based rare_variant test and estimates minor_allele of each rare_variant between affected and unaffected individuals with the best linear unbiased estimators famseq builds on bayesian_networks and the markov_chain algorithm and provides a confidence measure for variant_calls using data from all family_members which can improve the quality of rare_variant detection in family based sequencing studies these tools and methods optimize simplify and automatize many analysis processes in family based sequencing studies generating huge amount of genetic_variants for downstream validation and visualization visualization provides users intuitive descriptions of raw_data various visualization_tools have been developed for facilitating different types of genomic studies comprehensive genome_browsers such as the ucsc_genome ensembl genome_browser etc can rapidly and reliably display genomes of many species together with dozens of integrated genome_annotations including genes and transcripts variation comparative_genomics regulatory data etc some standalone genome_browsers are available for the interactive_exploration of large_datasets especially the high_throughput sequencing_datasets for example the integrative_genomics and savant genome_browser they can also display a wide_variety of genomic_annotations to support data analysis there are many visualization_tools focusing on visualizing particular types of data such as epigenome browser for visualizing epigenome data and hawkeye for visualizing large_scale assembly data gbrowse and huref browser are used to display the genome of a single individual tasuke is developed for the visualization of variations annotations and read_depth of multiple_genomes the personal genome_browser is designed and developed for visualizing functions of individual genome variants although these genome_browsers enable researchers to view and interact with genomic_annotations and data at any requested portion of genomes they have no functionality with pedigree_information the pedigree shows the relations and phenotypes of a family a few tools such as haplopainter and pedimap are developed for displaying phenotypic and genotypic data for related individuals linked in pedigrees these tools focus on visualizing pedigrees rather than genomes family genome sequencing_data including both exome_sequencing and whole_genome sequencing_data have been generated by many family based mendelian and complex disease studies the visualization and comparison of disease_causing of family_members can provide intuitive understanding of the genetic_basis of mendelian and complex_diseases thus can support decision_making in healthcare however currently there is a lack of visualization_tools dedicated to analysing variants for family genomes we developed the family genome_browser fgb to support the comprehensive analysis and visualization for genomes of related individuals linked in pedigrees the fgb enables investigators to upload and view family genome variants with the pedigree_information of the family based on the relations among family_members users are able to investigate the genetic_similarities differences among consanguineous individuals in variant level various kinds of family based analysis such as determination of parental origin of the variants recognition of de_novo mutations identification of potential recombination_events and identical by decent ibd segments etc can be performed by flexibly specifying different family_members and analysis modes diverse bioinformatics resources such as dbsnp linkage_disequilibrium ld hgnc genes refseq genes ncbi resource omim etc are integrated in the fgb for comprehensively annotating the genomic_variants for individuals whose parents variant data are available the fgb offers a scanning function for automatically finding de_novo mutations and compound_heterozygous variants of the individual the two kinds of suspicious variants may have the potential to cause dominant and recessive genetic_diseases the scan can be performed on the whole_genome a chromosome or a cytoband the fgb provides necessary and convenient genome visualization and analysis features dedicated to family_based these features enable users to investigate and understand family genomes intuitively and systematically the fgb accepts variant_call vcf files and ped format texts as inputs of variant data of multiple_genomes and pedigree_information illustrates family genomes in a standard pedigree chart and shows genomic_variants and their functional consequences in a vertical linear genome display
