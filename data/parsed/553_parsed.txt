astral ii coalescent_based species_tree with many hundreds of taxa and thousands of genes motivation the estimation of species phylogenies requires multiple_loci since different loci can have different trees due to incomplete_lineage modeled by the multi species coalescent model we recently_developed a coalescent_based method astral which is statistically consistent under the multi species coalescent model and which is more accurate than other coalescent based_methods on the datasets we examined astral runs in polynomial time by constraining the search_space using a set of allowed bipartitions despite the limitation to allowed bipartitions astral is statistically consistent results we present a new version of astral which we call astral ii we show that astral ii has substantial advantages over astral it is faster can analyze much larger datasets up to species and genes and has substantially better accuracy under some conditions astrals running time is on kjx j and astral iis running time is onkjx j where n is the number of species k is the number of loci and x is the set of allowed bipartitions for the search_space availability_and astral ii is available in open_source at httpsthe estimation of species_trees is complicated by the fact that different parts of the genome have different evolutionary_histories therefore the different gene_trees obtained on different loci are often in conflict with each other and with the true species_tree gene_tree discord due to incomplete_lineage ils is a major_challenge to species_tree and is a particular problem for rapid radiations where several speciation_events occur in a relatively short amount of time because of the possibility of gene_tree conflict species_tree estimations are increasingly based on multiple_loci one approach to estimating the species_tree simply concatenates the sequence_alignments for the different loci together and estimates a tree on the concatenated alignment however concatenation based analyses can be statistically inconsistent under the multi species coalescent and can result in incorrect trees with high support because of this potential for concatenation analyses to produce incorrect species_trees many methods have been developed that are designed to address gene_tree incongruence due to ils some of these methods have been proven statistically consistent under the multi species coalescent which means that they will return the true species_tree with high_probability given a large enough number of true gene_trees some of these coalescent based_methods e g mp est byand njst by are now in widespread use despite the availability of coalescent based_methods many biological_datasets are too large for the available methods for example mp est cannot be used on large_datasets due to computational reasons other coalescent based_methods are even more limited for example beast a method that co estimates gene_trees and the species_tree cannot be used with more than about species computational challenges in real_dataset analyses have required the development of coalescent based_methods that could analyze larger v c the author published_by
