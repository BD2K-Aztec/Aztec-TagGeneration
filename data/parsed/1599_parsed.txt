epimirbase a comprehensive database of microrna epilepsy associations micrornas are short non coding rna which function to fine_tune protein levels in all cells this is achieved mainly by sequence specific binding to untranslated_regions of target_mrna the result is post_transcriptional interference in gene_expression which reduces protein levels either by promoting destabilisation of mrna or translational_repression research published since shows that micrornas are important regulators of gene_expression in epilepsy a series of microrna profiling studies in rodent and human tissue has revealed that epilepsy is associated with wide_ranging changes to microrna levels in the brain these are thought to influence processes including cell_death inflammation and rewiring of neuronal_networks micrornas have also been identified in the blood after injury to the brain and therefore may serve as biomarkers of epilepsy epimirbase is a manually_curated database for researchers interested in the role of micrornas in epilepsy the fully searchable database includes information on up and down_regulated micrornas in the brain and blood as well as functional studies and covers both rodent_models and human epilepsy epilepsy is one of the most common neurological_disorders affecting million people worldwide it is characterised by recurring seizures abnormal synchronous firing of groups of neurons within the brain that disrupt sensory motor and other brain functions although antiepileptic_drugs help control seizures for many patients there is no cure for epilepsy and about one in three patients are drug_resistant analysis of brain_tissue from patients and rodent_models suggests that there are large_scale changes in gene_expression within affected brain_regions pitk nen and understanding what controls gene_expression may open new avenues for treatment or prevention of epilepsy micrornas are short non_coding which function to fine_tune protein levels in all cells they achieve this mainly by sequence specific binding to untranslated_regions of target_mrna the result is post_transcriptional interference in gene_expression which reduces protein levels either by promoting destabilisation of mrna or translational_repression targeting typically requires a nt watson_crick base_pairing the so_called seed_region between the end of the microrna and its mrna target this interaction is mediated by proteins of the argonaute ago family in particular ago since research has emerged that shows micrornas are important regulators of gene_expression in epilepsy changes to many different micrornas have been reported to date through a combination of animal_studies and analysis of human tissue_samples the regulated micrornas are implicated in controlling levels of proteins involved in processes such as cell_death inflammation re wiring of v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com neuronal_networks and other cell functions micrornas have also been identified in the blood after injury to the brain and therefore may serve as biomarkers of epilepsy a number of functional studies have determined that the manipulation of individual micrornas can exert a powerful effect on seizures and seizure induced neuronal_death as active investigators in this growing_area of epilepsy research we recognised the need for a database to keep track of the rapidly_expanding published_literature on micrornas and epilepsy we have developed epimirbase in order to provide complete and up to date information on all publications relating to micrornas and epilepsy the database contains over manually_curated microrna entries including up down_regulated micrornas from high_throughput profiling studies of human brain_tissue and rodent experimental_models after evoked seizures and in chronic_epilepsy low_throughput expression analysis and functional studies in which micrornas have been manipulated in seizure models and microrna biomarker_studies in which micrornas have been surveyed in biofluids such as blood in epilepsy patients and animal_models of epilepsy
