bioinformatics_discovery circular_rnas are depleted of polymorphisms at microrna binding_sites motivation circular_rnas circrnas are an abundant class of highly_stable rnas that can affect gene_regulation by binding and preventing micrornas mirnas from regulating their messenger_rna mrna_targets mammals have thousands of circrnas with predicted mirna_binding but only two circrnas have been verified as being actual mirna sponges as it is unclear whether these thousands of predicted mirna_binding are functional we investigated whether mirna_seed sites within human circrnas are under selective_pressure results using snp data from the genomes_project we found a significant decrease in snp density at mirna_seed sites compared with flanking_sequences and random sites this decrease was similar to that of mirna_seed sites in untranslated_regions suggesting that many of the predicted mirna_binding in circrnas are functional and under similar selective_pressure as mirna_binding in mrnas micrornas mirnas are small nt_long non_coding that are involved in gene_expression regulation through binding to so_called seed sites in untranslated_regions utr of target messenger_rnas mrnas however mirnas are also thought to bind to a new class of non_coding called circular_rnas circrnas a class of stable rnas with a circular shape many circrnas contain predicted mirna_target and at least two circrnas can act as mirna sponges that decrease the amount of mirnas available for binding to their target_mrnas microrna target_sites located in mrnas may harbour dna variations such as single_nucleotide snps which are short nucleotide insertions deletions or substitutions that occur with a frequency in a population snps in mirna_target can affect mirna binding to the target_mrna and subsequent gene_regulation similarly mirna_target on circrna genes may also harbour snps that affect mirna binding circrnas are getting more and more studied for their potential sponge effect but the functional consequences of the many predicted mirna sites in circrnas remain_unclear because predicted mirna_target on mrnas have a decreased snp density because of selective_pressure at functional_elements we wondered whether the same is true for mirna_target in circrnas in this article we look at the snp distribution at predicted mirna_target located on circrnas because polymorphisms can affect functionality we expected that functional mirna_target on circrnas would harbour fewer polymorphisms than random sites by using snp data from the genomes_project we found that circrnas harbour a significant decrease in polymorphisms at predicted mirna_target suggesting that many of these are functional sites under selective_pressure we found that circrnas have a decreased snp density at mirna_seed sites compared with both flanking_regions and snp distributions at random seed motifs this decrease was comparable with previously_reported snp densities at mirna_target in mrna utrs suggesting that mirna_seed sites within circrnas have similar selective_pressure as mirna_seed sites within utrs consequently the sponge effect of circrnas on mirnas may be as functionally_important as mirnas regulatory effect on mrnas note the columns show the exon end denoting the type of splice_site the regions compared splice_site exons and introns the snp density_ratio of the first region over the second and the p values describing how the densities differ see section we saw a significant decrease in snp density at splice_sites compared with exons and introns as well as when comparing exons with introns snp distribution at splice_sites of circrnas panel a and b show respectively snp distributions at exons and ends distributions are corrected for circrna strands and normalized by the median snp count the x axis shows snp positions relative to the splice_site on both panels we see a higher snp density for introns a clear decrease at the splice_sites and a lower_density at exons compared with introns
