structural_bioinformatics cascleave a new approach for predicting caspase and granzyme cleavage targets motivation caspases and granzyme_b grb are important proteases involved in fundamental_cellular and play_essential in programmed_cell necrosis and inflammation although a number of substrates for both types have been experimentally_identified the complete repertoire of caspases and granzyme_b substrates remained to be fully characterized accordingly systematic bioinformatics studies of known cleavage_sites may provide_important their sub strate specificity and facilitate the discovery of novel substrates results we develop a new bioinformatics tool termed cascleave which builds on previous success of the cascleave tool for predicting generic caspase cleavage_sites it can be efficiently used to predict potential caspase specific cleavage_sites for the human cas pase and grb in particular we integrate heterogeneous sequence and protein functional information from various sources to improve_the of cascleave during classification we use both maximum relevance minimum redundancy and forward feature_selection techniques to quantify the relative_contribution of each feature to prediction and thus remove redundant as well as irrelevant features a systematic evaluation of cascleave using the benchmark data and comparison with other state of the art tools using independent test data indicate that cascleave outperforms other tools on protease specific cleavage_site prediction of caspase and grb cascleave is anticipated to be used as a powerful_tool for identifying novel substrates and cleavage_sites of caspases and grb and help understand the functional_roles of these important proteases in human proteolytic cascades availability_and http www structbioinfor org cascleave proteases are proteolytic_enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of protein or peptide substrates by hydrolysis of peptide_bonds they represent at least proteases of all gene_products in human and are involved in the functional regulation of a large number of important_physiological such as cell_cycle cell_proliferation programmed_cell dna_replication tissue_remodeling and immune_response most proteases carry out either highly or moderately selective cleavage of the scissile bonds within the cleavage_site of their substrates with the substrate_specificity ranging from preferences for a number of specific amino_acids at defined positions to more generic sites with limited or no discrimination at one position we are particularly interested in bioinformatic studies of the substrate_specificity of human caspases and the proapoptotic protease granzyme_b grb a family of cysteine and serine_proteases that are key_regulators of apoptosis initiation and execution both types are involved in a number of fundamental_cellular and play_a in apoptotic_cell they also are involved in other cellular_processes including cell_cycle cell_proliferation development cell_migration and receptor internalization caspases are known to have restricted substrate_specificity for an aspartic_acid d at position p of the target substrate this primary specificity is similar with that of the serine_protease grb which is delivered by natural_killer into virally infected and tumor_cells to date at least mammalian caspases have been identified and they can be categorized into three groups based on their substrate_specificities group i caspases caspase and prefer bulky hydrophobic amino_acids at the p site and cleave the peptide_sequence w l ehd group_ii caspases capspase and preferentially cleave the sequence_motif dexd whereas group_iii caspase and cleaves the motif i v l e h t d in contrast to the caspases grb prefers to cleave the sequence_motif iexd to whom correspondence should be addressed in summary we provided a novel approach termed cascleave which has significantly_improved the prediction of proteasespecific substrate cleavage_sites for caspase and granzyme_b by integrating heterogeneous sequence and functional features from multiple sources it uses a two step integrative framework to characterize protein_sequence and functional features that are important for determining the substrate_specificity of different proteases benchmarking experiments indicate that cascleave is able to provide a performance that is better than or competitive with other existing_tools prioritization and dissection of novel protease substrate_interactions will likely benefit from the development of caspase specific bioinformatic_tools such as cascleave to the best of our knowledge this study represents the first systematic effort to scrutinize and select more relevant_features that make a significant contribution to the prediction of caspase and grb cleavage_sites based on feature_selection in contrast to previous_studies few of which have used feature_selection to address this important task moreover the high_confidence predicted substrates and their cleavage_sites produced in this study also provide a rich knowledge_base for follow_up hypothesis driven experiments in the field of protease biology
