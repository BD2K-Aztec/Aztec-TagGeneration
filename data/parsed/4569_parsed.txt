the architecture of the gene_regulatory of different tissues the great variety of human cell_types in morphology and function is due to the diverse gene_expression that are governed by the distinctive regulatory_networks in different cell_types it is still a challenging_task to explain how the regulatory_networks achieve the diversity of different cell_types here we report on our studies of the design principles of the tissue regulatory system by constructing the regulatory_networks of eight human tissues which subsume the regulatory_interactions between transcription_factors tfs micrornas mirnas and non tf target_genes the results show that there are in out hubs of high in out degrees in tissue networks some hubs strong hubs maintain the hub status in all the tissues where they are expressed whereas others weak hubs in spite of their ubiquitous_expression are hubs only in some tissues the network_motifs are mostly feed_forward loops some of them having no mirnas are the common motifs shared by all tissues whereas the others containing mirnas are the tissue_specific ones owned by one or several tissues indicating that the transcriptional_regulation is more conserved across tissues than the post_transcriptional in particular a common bow tie framework was found that underlies the motif instances and shows diverse patterns in different tissues such bow tie framework reflects the utilization efficiency of the regulatory system as well as its high variability in different tissues and could serve as the model to further understand the structural adaptation of the regulatory system to the specific requirements of different cell functions there are some hundred of cell_types in the human_body harboring the same genome but showing quite diverse behaviors in morphology and biological_functions this suggests that the cells of different types are developed by eliciting different gene_regulatory all encoded in the human_genome ben tabou de this raises a number of questions what is the mechanism that governs the activation of different gene_regulatory are the gene_regulatory accounting for the different types of cells designed under a same principle or architectural framework what kinds of differences in regulatory to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as networks contribute to the diversity of cell_types these are key_questions in understanding_the the specific functions of different cell_types and are essential for cell regeneration that closely relates to the treatment of tissue_damage and injury involved in various diseases the gene_regulatory of a cell is supposed to contain the comprehensive regulatory information governing the gene_expression in this cell in previous_works the gene_regulatory mainly referred to the transcriptional_network which depicts the regulations at transcriptional level nevertheless the microrna mirna a small_rna that negatively_regulates the gene_expression at post_transcriptional level by binding to the mrna_sequences of its target_gene was found at the end of the th century so_far micrornas of different species have been identified and many useful databases and effective tools that are used to predict the targets of mirnas have been developed this gives the possibility to construct a more comprehensive map of gene_regulatory for certain cell_types by integrating transcriptional_and regulations of gene_expression nowadays there are several studies on the gene_regulatory covering both the transcriptional_and of genes for example pilpel and co workers constructed a global mirnatf regulatory_network for mammalian and studied the combinatory regulations between tfs and mirnas according to the local and global architecture of the network investigated the biological_functions of mirnas by pursuing the mirna motif profiles in the mirna tf regulatory_network developed an integrated strategy to construct and analyze the gene_regulatory from high_throughput sequencing_data however all of these works are focused on the genome_wide level studies about the regulatory_networks of specific tissues and their design principles are largely missing here we constructed the large_scale gene_regulatory of eight human tissues and investigated their design principles from the perspective of three levels i e the local structure of vertices i e degrees the small circuits i e network_motifs and the assembly of small circuits our results show that the tissue_specific regulatory_networks trns constructed and analyzed here contain hub nodes the specific features of which may vary_considerably among the tissues investigated the different trns also vary significantly with regard to the composition of topological motifs the instances of which are organized in a bow tie structure the bow tie structuresthe networks constructed here comprise edges that to the best of our knowledge are predicted by the most reliable approaches available as for the mirnatarget relations we took the union of the results of a number of predictors see section concerning the tf target connections we are confident that we successfully minimized the false_positive since a high percentage of the predicted edges could be recovered from available high_throughput datasets as well the trade_off of this attempt however certainly was a considerable false_negative it should thus be noted that the networks presented here are only based on the subset of tfbs with highest_affinity and conservativity to which we attribute the property of being seed sites in preparation these seed sites are assumed to play a particular role in flagging promoter_regions and thus would nicely coincide with the recently_published concept of pioneer factors as a first attempt to globally characterize a network the degree_distribution is usually analyzed the trns constructed here show a kind of mixed power_law exponential or broad_scale distribution or truncated scale_free with their power_law exponents in the range of degree_distribution which may be more on the power_law side in case of all in degree distributions or more on the exponential side for the mirna out degree_distribution in any case however we observed that most nodes of our trns exhibit a low connectivity while very few nodes show a very high degree we therefore felt that the concept of hub nodes is applicable to the networks constructed and studied here different functional types of hubs can be distinguished in the trns depending on the nature of the genes and whether they are in or out hubs the tf mirna in hubs e g e f and sox in brain testis and prostate runx in heart and liver and hsa_mir in brain and prostate act as the central processors receiving and integrating a great many of regulatory input from upstream_regulators and re distribute it to the downstream_genes whereas the tf mirna out hubs e g atf myc hsa_mir a and hsalet b in all the eight tissues act as central coordinators because they regulate large_numbers of targets interestingly some tfs and mirnas are both in and out hubs e g runx in testis ovary spleen and prostate bcl and hsa_mir in all the eight tissues acting as the central processors as well as central coordinators in contrast the non tf in hubs e g mapk in brain prostate and liver ak in all of the eight tissues may be central executors in the downstream biological_processes since they are the terminal genes in regulation whose expression_level is finely controlled by complex regulation in contrast to the majority of genes in the trns supplementary the in out hubs show a clear tendency to be shared by multiple tissues this may relate to an efficient utilization of the gene regulatory system there shows two kinds of hubs according to hub behaviors in different tissues one type preserves its hub status in all the tissues they are expressed in strong hubs whereas hubs of the other type switch into a non hub in some of the tissues where they are expressed weak hubs more mirna than tf hubs in particular almost all mirna out hubs are strong hubs supplementary thus the local structures around mirna hubs are more conserved across
