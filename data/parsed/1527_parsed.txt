data_and ecoh an enzyme commission number predictor using mutual_information and a support_vector motivation the enzyme nomenclature system commonly known as the enzyme commission ec_number plays_a in classifying and predicting enzymatic_reactions however numerous reactions have been described in various pathways that do not have an official ec_number and the reactions are not expected to have an ec_number assigned because of a lack of articles_published on enzyme assays to predict the ec_number of a non classified enzymatic_reaction we focus on the structural_similarity of its substrate and product to the substrate and product of reactions that have been classified results we propose a new method to assign ec numbers using a maximum common substructure algorithm mutual_information and a support_vector termed the enzyme commission numbers handler ecoh a jack knife test shows that the sensitivity precision and accuracy of the method in predicting the first three digits of the official ec_number i e the ec sub subclass are and respectively we furthermore demonstrate that by examining the ranking in the candidate lists of ec_sub generated by the algorithm the method can successfully predict the classification of enzymatic_reactions that fall into multiple ec_sub the better performance of the ecoh as compared with existing_methods and its flexibility in predicting ec numbers make it useful for predicting enzyme_function availability ecoh is freely_available via the internet atin the automatic prediction of protein functions and their evolutionary relations on a large_scale the computational_prediction of the catalytic_function of enzymes has traditionally been based on sequence_similarities the usefulness of this approach may be questioned because small changes in key_residues may greatly alter enzyme_function which necessitates alternative_approaches to assess enzyme similarities several researchers have focused on the similarity between functional_motifs and protein_structures and on the correlation between levels of protein expression in cells systematic annotation systems have been provided for generating and testing biological_hypotheses although one should note any propagation of functional mis annotation in the systems for example gene_ontology go is a controlled_vocabulary that can be used to describe gene_products structural_classification of proteins scop and class architecture topology homologous superfamily cath regard any pair of enzymes that share protein_domains as being similar the kyoto encyclopedia for genes and genomes kegg provides annotation of biochemical_pathways for genes other enzyme classification_systems such as the enzyme commission ec classification_scheme iupac iubmb and the reaction classification rc system are based on the chemical_reaction catalysed by the enzyme under consideration an ec_number consists of the letters ec followed by four digits separated by periods e g ec the first second and third number are termed class subclass and sub subclass respectively the ec system consists of six classes oxidoreductase ec transferase ec hydrolase ec lyase ec isomerase ec and ligase ec the subclass and sub subclass specify the type of enzymatic_reaction and its substrate requirements respectively in this manner a hierarchically_structured system is developed on the basis of the main ec classes for example ec is divided_into ec subclasses ecs and ec version although the system is designed to classify enzymatic_reactions based on their ec numbers enzymes themselves can be hierarchically grouped by their function owing to the fact that ec numbers are manually assigned by the nomenclature_committee of the international_union of biochemistry and molecular_biology iubmb many enzymatic_reactions have either incomplete ec numbers or no ec_number at all several studies have proposed methods to predict ec numbers a group of researchers attempted to use protein_sequences and structures to predict ec numbers achieved an accuracy of by using statistical_analysis to predict the top ec class furthermore dobson and doig andimproved the accuracy to and respectively by using a support_vector svm recently achieved an accuracy of by using a k nearest_neighbour algorithm k and binary fingerprints which indicate the presence_or of specific sequence signatures and focused on multi_label predictions further the similarity of catalysed chemical_transformations among protein_families has been to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com discussed some studies have proposed methods for automatically predicting ec numbers by focusing on chemical_transformations between substrates and products and ignoring protein_sequences and structures the rpair database was constructed to map information on atom types in three regions of the molecular_structures of substrateproduct pairs using the rpair database e zyme predicts possible ec_number of a target reaction by comparing the correlation between vectors that represent the occurrence of atom mapping patterns these researchers achieved a prediction_accuracy of e zyme is a rule_based method in two of their studies gasteigers group converted reactions only within classes ec and ec to physicochemical descriptors relating to the reacting bonds and classified them into ec_sub by using a self organizing neural_network a svm and hierarchical_clustering their svm gave an accuracy of proposed a method for the mapping of atom and bond types between substrates and products in a reaction using matrices and they obtained unique matrices for each ec sub subclass the use of a reaction graph_kernel rgk along with a random_walk kernel was proposed for performing approximate matching between atom mapping patterns the matching accuracy was although this method also uses the rpair database to achieve high prediction_performance it is used to identify the main substrateproduct pairs in a reaction latino and aires de sousa proposed physicochemical and topological descriptors named the molmap descriptor encoding bonding changes during chemical_reactions using matrices their random_forest predictors a semi_supervised algorithm gave an accuracy of for ec_sub for a genome_wide set of reactions their work showed that the predictions were reliable if a full balanced description of the reaction is used used typical chemoinformatics approaches to ec_sub that is a string type descriptor and a tanimoto similarity_metric nath and mitchell evaluated a combination of five descriptors and three machine_learning they used a svm random_forest and k nearest_neighbour algorithm they achieved accuracies of and in the case of the svm and random_forest respectively however their tanning set was limited to reactions and it was derived from the macie database in this study we investigated the automatic selection of important chemical_transformations from reactions for predicting the ec numbers of the reactions in the selection process we removed outliers and noise from chemical_transformations without any preconditions we propose a new method to flexibly predict ec numbers from the chemical_structure of substrates and products of unclassified enzymatic_reactions by the use of a maximal common substructure mcs algorithm mutual_information mi and svm through comparison of the structural fingerprint to a list of classified reactions
