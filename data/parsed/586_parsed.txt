data_and autobind automatic extraction of protein ligand binding_affinity data from biological_literature motivation determination of the binding_affinity of a protein ligand complex is important to quantitatively specify whether a particular small_molecule will bind to the target protein besides collection of comprehensive datasets for proteinligand complexes and their corresponding binding_affinities is crucial in developing accurate scoring_functions for the prediction of the binding_affinities of previously_unknown proteinligand complexes in the past_decades several databases of proteinligand binding_affinities have been created via visual extraction from literature however such approaches are time consuming and most of these databases are updated only a few times per year hence there is an immediate demand for an automatic extraction method with high_precision for binding_affinity collection result we have created a new database of proteinligand binding_affinity data autobind based on automatic information_retrieval we first compiled a collection of articles where the binding_affinities have been marked manually based on this annotated collection we designed four sentence patterns that are used to scan full_text as well as a scoring_function to rank the sentences that match our patterns the proposed sentence patterns can effectively_identify the binding_affinities in full_text our assessment shows that autobind achieved precision and recall on the testing corpus currently proteinligand complexes and the corresponding binding_affinities have been deposited in autobind from articles availability autobind is automatically updated on a monthly basis and it is freely_available atdetermination of the binding_affinity is essential for quantifying the protein interactions with other bio molecules for example actually estimating the proteindna binding_affinity is an important step to whom correspondence should be addressed in understanding the regulation mechanisms of cells in the field of drug_design the binding_affinity of a ligand to a given protein target is used to judge whether this ligand can be considered as a potential drug_candidate several databases of proteinligand binding_affinities have been proposed including ligand protein database lpdb protein ligand database pld pdbbind binding moad affindb and bindingdb these databases depend on structure databases and require much time and cost for the manual_inspection of the literature until september more than million articles indexed contain the descriptions of binding_affinity in the medline_database the time consuming manual extraction cannot timely accommodate the astonishingly increasing number of full_text therefore there is an immediate demand for automatic extraction of protein ligand binding_affinities information_retrieval ir is a computational technique aiming at extracting information from the literature without manual intervention summarization is a widely seen ir application in various areas which can automatically compile extractive summaries that include the important aspects of full_text in the biomedical_field this technique is used to generate gene_annotations and to search bio images in recent_years ir has been used to extract biological_entities of interest and their relationships for example activate and interact are two common relation terms that connect molecule entities this technique has been applied to proteinprotein_interactions pathway networks and drug_interactions however so_far there have been only a few studies that attempted to extract biological values or parameters for example spasicspasic et_al used terminology concept to index and select literature then a score function was implemented to rank the retrieved_articles by relevance of parameters for kinetic_modeling of yeast metabolic_pathways used a rule based_approach to collect kinetic_information of enzymes in general the experimental_procedures or results described in fulltext articles are hard for researchers to re use the fact that comparisons with events values and parameters are usually recorded in a more flexible way in the literature makes the in this article we describe the construction of autobind an automatic information_extraction system dedicated to protein ligand binding_affinity our system includes four patterns to identify candidate sentences describing proteinligand binding_affinity and a scoring_function to rank the identified sentences for extracting binding_affinities we applied autobind on the primary citations of all entries in the protein_data pdb many primary citations contain multiple affinities corresponding to different experimental_conditions such as wild_type and mutated proteins but only one represents the actual binding_affinity of the crystal_structure in this study we focused on the affinity corresponding to the structure in each primary citation since whose full text references can be easily retrieved finally the extracted proteinligand binding_affinities and the corresponding complex structures were organized as a public database named autobind note that autobind in this article refers both the extraction algorithm and the database the extraction algorithm is completely automatic however the binding_affinities deposited in the database have been approved manually in order to refine them and eliminate possible errors and inconsistencies on the other hand all the reported performances in tables and sections and were evaluated on the results obtained before the manual approval in short this article_presents an automatic extraction algorithm to expedite constructing and maintaining a database but the database construction was not fully_automatic the autobind database currently contains proteinligand complexes to our knowledge this is the largest collection of protein binding_affinities the database will be updated regularly this work presents a new automatic system autobind for extracting protein binding_affinity from literature overall our automatic extraction method collected almost twice binding_affinities compared to other databases of similar data the automatic extraction_process contains four ner methods for protein and ligand names four sentences patterns for sentence extraction and a ranking_method to pick sentence that correctly describes binding_affinities the experimental_results show that hybridizing multiple ner methods improved the performance of binding_affinity extraction these sentence patterns can quickly identify candidate sentences that may contain a protein binding_affinity these patterns were designed to ensure minimal false_negatives for as shown in the experimental_results high extraction recall finally the proposed ranking_method ensures minimal false_positives for high_precision the rank_based design facilities the following manual checking step biologists can start from the highest ranked sentences and stop immediately after a correct sentence is found the entire system significantly_reduces the extraction time while preserving the quality of the extracted binding_affinities
