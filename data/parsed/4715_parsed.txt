sequence_analysis tppred improving the prediction of mitochondrial targeting peptide cleavage_sites by exploiting sequence_motifs targeting peptides are n_terminal sorting signals in proteins that promote their translocation to mitochondria through the interaction with different protein machineries we recently_developed tppred a machine_learning method scoring among the best ones available to predict the presence of a targeting peptide into a protein_sequence and its cleavage_site here we introduce tppred that improves tppred performances in the task of identifying the cleavage_site of the targeting peptides tppred is now available as a web_interface and as a stand alone version for users who can freely download and adopt it for processing large volumes of sequences availability and implementaion tppred is available both as web_server and stand alone version at http tppred the vast_majority of mitochondrial_proteins are encoded by the nuclear_genome synthesized on the cytosolic ribosomes and therefrom translocated to the different sub mitochondrial localizations the best characterized mechanism that controls the import into the mitochondrion involves the detection of an n_terminal pre sequence the so_called targeting peptide which directs the protein across different translocating protein_complexes embedded in the outer and inner mitochondrial_membranes the sorting peptide is proteolytically cleaved when the protein reaches the final destination the detection of targeting peptides starting from protein_sequences is then an important step to fully characterize the sequence of the mature_protein and to annotate its function and localization different computational_methods can help the annotation of targeting peptides in proteins the best performing methods implement machine_learning such as artificial_neural support_vector svms hidden_markov and grammatical restrained hidden conditional_random grhcrfs here we describe tppred our new implementation for the prediction of mitochondrial targeting peptides and their cleavage_sites the new predictor combines tppred our previous grhcrf based method for the prediction of mitochondrial and plastidic targeting peptides with an additional refinement stepsvmbasedfor cleavage_site identification in particular the svm classifier is used to identify the correct cleavage_site by exploiting tppred prediction signals extracted in terms of grhcrfbased positional posterior_probabilities and a newly_defined feature that captures the occurrence of sequence_motifs previously recognized at the cleavage_sites when tested on the non redundant dataset of proteins ofmitochondrial and non mitochondrial_proteins see supplementary section tppred significantly_outperforms our previous tppred predictor on mitochondrial cleavage_site detection tppred being optimized for the prediction of cleavage_sites of mitochondrial_proteins is not adequate for the identification of plant targeting peptides in this article we present tppred a software_tool for the prediction of mitochondrial targeting peptides and their cleavage_sites the improved_performance of tppred is achieved by jointly exploiting for the first time to our knowledge peculiar sequence_motifs characterizing the cleavage_site and grhcrf prediction signals the new tppred predictor is able to better identify cleavage_sites when compared with our previous implementation the software is available as a web_server and most importantly as a stand alone program making it well suited for large_scale genomic analysis note see supplementary section for details about scoring measures
