systems_biology metdat a modular and workflow based free online pipeline for mass_spectrometry data_processing analysis and interpretation analysis of high_throughput metabolomics experiments is a resource_intensive process that includes pre_processing pre_treatment and post_processing at each level of experimental hierarchy we developed an interactive user_friendly online software called metabolite data analysis tool metdat for mass_spectrometry data it offers a pipeline of tools for file handling data pre_processing univariate_and statistical_analyses database_searching and pathway mapping outputs are produced in the form of text and high_quality images in real_time metdat allows users to combine data management and experiment centric workflows for optimization of metabolomics methods and metabolite analysis metabolomics experiments_conducted using mass_spectrometry produce spectral outputs amounting to gigabytes of data this is a result of elaborate experimental_set with several replicates time series studies and different types of treatment parameters for a single sample datasets from such experimental set up can be very complex querying information from several subsets of complex datasets and deriving meaningful biological_interpretation is very challenging to overcome this problem in data_handling and analysis the metabolomics research_community has recommended a minimal set of reporting standards and general_guidelines for data analysis interpretation and exchange of metabolomics experiments data pre_processing generally involves removal of noise and reduction of baseline of the raw_data the resulting data are normalized and scaled for univariate_and statistical_analysis visualization of the resultant output helps to understand and interpret experimental_results a number of standalone data analysis tools for preprocessing statistical_analysis and pathway mapping mzmine xcms masstrix metexplore bioconductor are freely_available on the web currently these available data analysis tools do to whom correspondence should be addressed not have the means to include information from experiment such as hierarchical data_structure as a result meaningful inferences based on comparisons at the various levels of data_structure are not straightforward and their associated effects are not easily interpreted most of the available tools require continuous interaction with users in the programs leading to delayed output here we present metabolite data analysis tool metdat to address gaps in the currently available software for mass_spectrometry data analysis in a systems centric approach metdat is a web_based with an open and integrated system that performs data preprocessing analysis followed by database_searches with filters to refine the output metdat also provides interactive and customizable modules and user driven analysis of data at hierarchical_levels
