systems_biology sbsi an extensible distributed software infrastructure for parameter_estimation in systems_biology complex computational_experiments in systems_biology such as fitting model_parameters to experimental_data can be challenging to perform not only do they frequently require a high_level of computational power but the software needed to run the experiment needs to be usable by scientists with varying levels of computational expertise and modellers need to be able to obtain up to date experimental_data resources easily we have developed a software_suite the systems_biology software infrastructure sbsi to facilitate the parameter fitting process sbsi is a modular software_suite composed of three major components sbsinumerics a high performance library containing parallelized algorithms for performing parameter fitting sbsidispatcher a middleware application to track experiments and submit jobs to back end servers and sbsivisual an extensible client application used to configure optimization experiments and view results furthermore we have created a plugin infrastructure to enable project specific modules to be easily installed plugin developers can take advantage of the existing user_interface and application framework to customize sbsi for their own uses facilitated by sbsis use of standard data_formats availability_and all sbsi binaries and source_code are freely_available from http sourceforge net_projects sbsi under an apache open_source the server side sbsinumerics runs on any unix based operating system both sbsivisual and sbsidispatcher are written in java and are platform independent allowing use on windows linux and mac os x the sbsi project website at http www sbsi ed ac uk provides documentation and tutorials
