the role of proteosome mediated proteolysis in modulating potentially_harmful transcription_factor activity in saccharomyces_cerevisiae motivation the appropriate modulation of the stress_response to variable environmental_conditions is necessary to maintain sustained viability in saccharomyces_cerevisiae particularly controlling the abundance of proteins that may have detrimental_effects on cell_growth is crucial for rapid recovery from stress_induced quiescence results prompted by qualitative modeling of the nutrient_starvation response in yeast we investigated in vivo the effect of proteolysis after nutrient_starvation showing that for the gis transcription_factor at least proteasome mediated control is crucial for a rapid return to growth additional bioinformatics analyses show that potentially_toxic transcriptional_regulators have a significantly_lower protein_half a higher fraction of unstructured regions and more potential pest motifs than the non detrimental ones furthermore inhibiting proteasome_activity tends to increase the expression of genes induced during the environmental stress_response more than those in the rest of the genome our combined results suggest that proteasome mediated proteolysis of potentially_toxic transcription_factors tightly modulates the stress_response in yeast a prompt and appropriate response to abrupt fluctuations in external conditions is crucial to survive stressful environmental changes especially in unicellular organisms such as the yeast_saccharomyces during the nutrient_starvation in order to ensure extended survival s cerevisiae cells exit the cell_cycle at g and enter the quiescent_state called g but rapidly resume growth and proliferation when nutrient_conditions turn favorable two conserved signaling_pathways ras camp and tor are known to coordinate the entry into and exit from the quiescent phase these two pathways regulate the entry into the stationary_phase converging on the protein_kinase rim and downstream transcriptional_activators including the stress_response stre transcription_factors tfs msn msn and to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint second authors the post diauxic shift pds transcription_factor gis the nutrient_starvation response is an intensively_studied process but the exact molecular_mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated on the one hand the scarcity of quantitative data pose a problem for the construction of quantitative_models on the other hand the current understanding of the causal regulatory wiring encourages the use of qualitative computational_models to gain new insights executable biology fisher and is an evolving paradigm that focuses on the design of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological_phenomena through the use of formal methods from engineering and computer science biological_knowledge can be captured in mathematically sound formalisms and then easily translated into executable algorithms for dynamical analysis and automatic reasoning here we show that formalizing the available knowledge on the nutrient_starvation response as a qualitative model highlighted the different modulation of gis availability encouraging further in vivo investigations on the role of proteosome mediated proteolysis proteasome mediated proteolysis is essential for many cellular_processes in yeast and other eukaryotes including regulation of protein concentrations and degradation of misfolded_proteins integrating our computational insights and the in vivo experiments with genome_wide bioinformatics analyses lead us to suggest that proteasome mediated proteolysis of potentially_toxic transcription_factors tightly modulates the stress_response in yeast
