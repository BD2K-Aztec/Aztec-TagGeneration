databases_and biogrid rest service biogridplugin and biogrid webgraph new tools for access to interaction data at biogrid the biological general repository for interaction datasets biogrid representational state transfer rest service allows full url based access to curated protein and genetic_interaction data at the biogrid database appending url parameters allows filtering of data by various attributes including gene names and identifiers pubmed id and evidence type we also describe two visualization_tools that interface with the rest service the biogridplugin for cytoscape and the biogrid webgraph availability_and biogrid data and applications are completely_free for commercial and non commercial use http webservice thebiogrid org resources interactions rest service http wiki thebiogrid org doku php biogridrest rest service parameter list and help http webservice thebiogrid org resources application wadl rest service wadl http thebiogrid org download php biogridplugin v download http wiki the aim of the biological general repository for interaction datasets biogrid http thebiogrid org is to curate and distribute comprehensive collections of physical and genetic_interactions from all major model_organisms including human biogrid currently houses interactions categorized by evidence code and supplemented with annotation such as modifications and phenotypes biogrid data are accessible through a searchable web_interface the osprey network visualization_tool and partner databases such as saccharomyces genome_database downloadable data_files in tab_delimited or psi mi xml formats are available for off line data analysis however since these files are often large and or complex full utilization of the data can require specialized scripts to be written from release biogrid has been made available in mitab format a tab_delimited format with biogrid evidence codes mapped to psi mi ontology to whom correspondence should be addressed terms the psicquic web_service has been established by the imex consortium http imex sourceforge net providing federated access to multiple interaction_databases including biogrid in mitab format although access via psicquic provides all available interactions in biogrid it is not ideal for provision of biogrid data as it does not contain original biogrid evidence codes post_translational phenotypes or freetext qualifiers here we describe a new representational state transfer rest web_service allowing access to full biogrid data and two visualization_tools that programmatically access it example use cases for all components are provided in supplementary_file
