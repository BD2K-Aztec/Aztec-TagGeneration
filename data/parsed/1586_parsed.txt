entropy driven partitioning of the hierarchical protein space motivation modern protein sequencing_techniques have led to the determination of million protein_sequences protonet is a clustering system that provides a continuous hierarchical agglomerative clustering tree for all proteins while protonet performs unsupervised classification of all included proteins finding an optimal level of granu larity for the purpose of focusing on protein functional_groups remain_elusive here we ask whether knowledge based annotations on protein_families can support the automatic unsupervised methods for identifying high_quality protein_families we present a method that yields within the protonet hierarchy an optimal partition of clusters relative to manual_annotation schemes the methods principle is to minimize the entropy derived distance between annotation based partitions and all available hierarchical partitions we describe the best front bf partition of proteins from uniref of protonet tree clusters bf based on pfam annotations contain clusters the high_quality of the partition is validated by the close correspondence with the set of clusters that best describe thousands of keywords of pfam the bf is shown to be superior to na ve cut in the protonet tree that yields a similar number of clusters finally we used parameters intrinsic to the clustering process to enrich a priori the bfs clusters we present the entropy based_methods benefit in overcoming the unavoidable limitations of nested clusters in protonet we suggest that this automatic information based cluster selection can be useful for other large_scale annotation schemes as well as for systematically testing and comparing putative families derived from alternative clustering_methods availability_and a catalog of bf clusters for thousands of pfam keywords is provided atthe explosive_growth in the number of sequenced proteins is mostly a result of the breakthroughs in sequencing_technologies and the corresponding sequencing of hundreds of organisms despite these advances the structure and function of most of these proteins remains_unknown the most successful method for functional_annotation of proteins is by sequence_alignment homology detection and inference techniques generalization of such approaches calls for charting the protein space by clustering or classification if successful each such group of proteins would represent a family classification into families is a critical component in structural and functional_genomics no accepted consensus exists for how many of these protein_families might comprise the entire protein space there are main orthologous_groups in addition to rare and peculiar single proteins with the increased number of complete proteomes a phyletic partition shows that thousands of families are associated with each multicellular_organism various expertbased databases provide a good description of protein_families for example interpro ipr is composed of models for families and domains and from a structural perspective there are superfamilies according to cath classification classifying the entire protein space into families serves not only as a method for large_scale protein annotations but also to support functional and structural genomic initiatives some prominent examples for protein classification are systers clustr and protonet the shared theme of all these resources is the hierarchical nature of the protein_families furthermore while all use blast_based statistical distance metrics for the clustering the implementation sensitivity the notion of the distance metrics and consequently the depth of the hierarchical representations are different for each of the underlying algorithm and resource an important differentiating factor between various classification_systems is the level of granularity more often than not definitions regarding the granularity are made arbitrarily not based on natural or systematic considerations the importance of granularity stems from the inherent diversity of the protein space while some families are well defined by their sequence e g rubisco ribosomal_proteins the boundaries of many other protein_families are blurred to complicate things even further some families may be best defined by a composition of several subfamilies while others are part of large and multifunctional superfamilies e g aaa superfamily g_protein protein_kinases gene_ontology database go and to some extent ipr incorporate the notion of parent_child for gene protein_family in cases where such relationships are accepted for example the neurotransmitter gated_ion ipr is a parent of hydroxytryptaminewe choose for this purpose pfam an extensive documentation of domains and families that represents one of the most reliable sources for protein_families pfam is a semiautomatic family database with a strict quality_control it contains models for protein_families and covers almost of known protein_sequences with coverage of amino_acids as such pfam is an extremely_valuable resource for addressing questions concerning the quality of structural and functional protein_families the classification provided by protonet is based on a bottomup unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical_clustering specifically it provides a full range of cluster granularity from single proteins to huge clusters that carry minimal biological coherence the root clusters it is possible to match the majority of pfam families to specific clusters within the protonet clustering moreover we search for natural clustering partitions from which the optimal granularity can be inferred the intuition for such a natural partition is for it to be entropically close to a partition based on pfam annotations of the proteins in this article we describe the theoretical basis for a novel entropy based procedure for best front bf searching to allow for a priori prediction of the bf we introduce additional intrinsic clustering parameters that partially separate the entire set of clusters present and those that are included in the bf we show that a combination of two such parameters is enough to strongly enrich the bf from all clusters our method to identify optimal granularity allows for automatic and systematic definition of the set of proteins that correspond to an orthologous family such automatic definition could supplement current_techniques in genome_wide annotation projects which are mostly based on expert annotation furthermore it will serve to define families using the matching of a large number of classification_systems such as metafam superfamily and more we show that the automatic information based cluster selection of the bf is extremely useful for a systematic comparing of clustering_methods furthermore the supervised approach can be applied to biochemical_functions such as enzyme classification as well as for structural superfamilies we provide a complete catalog of the bf clusters for ipr keywords the novel method described here offers a systematic framework to address the quality of protein classification_systems while we use protonet as our test_bed it is important to note that the tools and methods presented here are by no means limited in their scope to protonet these can be tailored to other hierarchical classification_systems the procedure is valid and expandable to other types of annotations it can possibly serve to suggest the bf for structural and functional_annotations such as scop cath however it must be noted that the procedure is currently only suited to annotation types with approximately one level of granularity application of the method to a notably hierarchical annotation type such as go protein annotations has determined unpublished results that the bf is the root containing all the proteins this is due to the fact that many go annotations are not separable i e there is a large inherent minimal level of entropy within the go annotations see discussion in our work shows that application of the annotation based optimal partitioning procedure to the protonet tree yielded a highly compressed number of protein clusters which are often highly_correlated with individual ipr keywords in addition we showed that an inherent property of clustering the lt could be used to remove clusters that will probably not be part of the bf partition the combination of these two results suggests the possibility of an automatic classification_method that would be capable of reconstructing the vast_majority of pfam ipr knowledge in terms of family boundaries an example for such automatic support could be submission of novel unannotated sequences to the protonet bf partition and assigning with a certain probability the sequence to one of the bf clusters each essentially equivalent to a certain protein_family an issue not yet addressed is the application of the method to a general set of protein annotations the distance measure defined here has a theoretical minimum of however this value will not be the true lower_bound for most annotation systems as even having protein with different annotations perhaps due to its being composed of multiple non overlapping domains will not allow the hkjcf term to go to for any partition of the proteins allowing the splitting of a protein into its domains could address this problem additionally calculation of the minimal theoretical value of the distance could be used to put the bf score in the context of its feasible values implicitly part of the annotation system used this theoretical lower_bound essentially defines the entropy inherent in an annotation system the protonet tree that is the basis for the informationtheoretic approach is based on uniref this implies that each cluster maybe weighted by hundreds of sequences for example in mammals there are protein_sequences named hemoglobin and named hydrolase these sets in uniref are compressed to and representatives respectively therefore the current analysis for protonet that is composed of million representatives is challenging with respect to the task in this study however extending the analysis for the expanded version of uniprotkb meets the limitation of computation feasibility not shown the current uniprotkb release already contains million sequences and million in uniref the statistical and information driven method presented allowing a rational navigating in such large resource in future work we will further validate bf hierarchies using statistical_learning methods such tests are meant to reflect how well the bf would perform in an unsupervised setting preliminary_results not shown indicate that the bf method is both robust and valid the main_drawback of the approach described above is its need for externally defined protein annotations therefore we would like to be able to learn the intrinsic parameters of a given system that predict with minimal error the clusters in a characteristic bf fortunately the amount and quality of protein annotation is rapidly increasing with pfam already including annotations the information_theoretic approach developed here can only benefit from such trends without sacrificing computational_efficiency or accuracy
