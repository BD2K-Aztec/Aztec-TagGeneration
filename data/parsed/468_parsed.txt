sequence_analysis arbitrator a software pipeline for on demand retrieval of auto curated nifh sequences from genbank motivation studies of the biochemical_functions and activities of un cultivated microorganisms in the environment require analysis of dna_sequences for phylogenetic characterization and for the development of sequence_based assays for the detection of microorganisms the numbers of sequences for genes that are indicators of environmentally important functions such as nitrogen n fixation have been rapidly_growing over the past_few obtaining these sequences from the national center for biotechnology informations genbank database is problematic because of annotation errors nomenclature variation and paralogues moreover genbanks structure and tools are not conducive to searching solely by function for some genes such as the nifh gene commonly used to assess community potential for n fixation manual collection and curation are becoming intractable because of the large number of sequences in genbank and the large number of highly_similar paralogues if analysis is to keep pace with sequence discovery an automated retrieval and curation system is necessary results arbitrator uses a two step process composed of a broad collection of potential homologues followed by screening with a best_hit strategy to conserved domains nifh sequences were identified in genbank as of november the false_positive is arbitrator rapidly updates a public nifh sequence database and we show that it can be adapted for other genes availability_and java source and executable code are freely_available to non commercial users at http pmc ucsc edu wwwzehr research database microorganisms catalyze a variety of biogeochemical transformations such as nitrogen n fixation that are critical for ecosystem_function because many microorganisms in the environment have not been cultivated studies of such functions depend on amplification and sequencing of genes that encode_proteins involved in the functions of interest this approach_facilitates detection and phylogenetic characterization of uncultivated microorganisms dinitrogen n is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere but is not bioavailable unless it is reduced to ammonia by n fixation biological n fixation can require the protein products of up to nif genes the nifh nifd and nifk gene_products are the structural_components of the conventional molybdenum mo containing nitrogenase enzyme the products of other nif genes are involved in roles such as regulation and biosynthesis in environmental studies nifh which encodes the iron fe protein of molybdenum mo vanadium v and iron fe nitrogenases is the most commonly used nitrogenase gene for the investigation of microorganisms with the potential to fix n as it is the most highly_conserved in sequence this gene can be used to examine the diversity of n fixing microorganisms in the environment provides insight into the evolution and ecology of n fixation and can indicate the potential for n fixation in microbial_communities the application of degenerate nifh pcr_primers enabled the discovery of novel nifh sequences in the environment this approach fueled studies of n fixation across a broad range of habitats including woody dicotyledenous plants rice_roots termite guts stromatolites central ocean gyres and salt marshes the size of phylogenetic_trees based on all available nucleotide_and expanded from sequences in to sequences in and to sequences in four or five depending on author major phylogenetic clusters have been described only three of these phylogenetically_related clusters contain true nitrogenase encoding nif genes cluster i nifh primarily comprises conventional nifh which encodes the fe protein of mo nitrogenase as well as vnfh genes that encode the fe protein of v nitrogenase note that vanadium nitrogenase genes cluster differently based on nifd or nifk genes organisms that contain cluster nifh genes include cyanobacteria and alpha beta_and proteobacteria cluster_ii nifh genes_encode the fe protein of alternative nitrogenases that contain iron but do not contain mo or v to whom correspondence should be addressed cluster iii is dominated by genes_encoding fe proteins of nitrogenases primarily of anaerobes including methanogens and sulfate reducers these nitrogenases likely contain mo clusters iv and v sometimes grouped as cluster iv contain nifh paralogues whose functions include photopigment biosynthesis and non n fixation electron_transport it has also been suggested that the function of cluster iv nifh paralogues found in non n fixing archaea is the biosynthesis of cofactor f essential to the production of methane the gene name nflh for nifh like has been proposed for these nifh paralogues as sequences are accumulating rapidly in gene sequence_databases ongoing efforts to retrieve and analyze new nifh records are necessary to elucidate relationships between phylogenetic categories and identify phylotypes in different ecosystems these efforts can be frustrated by the sheer number and growth_rate of nifh gene sequences deposited into the national_center ncbi genbank database for example in february gaby and buckley identified nifh sequences from the non redundant nucleotide collection database nr nt at genbank for a global census of nitrogenase diversity and records were manually_curated to form a database of sequences we estimate that in the intervening time between the download and publication of the related article in at least nifh sequences were added to the database we estimate that as of january there were nifh sequences in that database with a growth_rate of sequences per month retrieval involving human intervention now requires a significant investment of manpower that will increase over time an automated retrieval pipeline is needed to allow analysis to keep pace with data_collection however automating retrieval of all sequences of any specific gene from genbank is difficult moreover the most common query idioms for searching genbank are variants of blast which search for sequence_similarity rather than function approaches based on blast alone are likely to be overly sensitive as hits to nifh homologues with functions other than n fixation are not easily distinguished from genuine nifh hits text searches that analyze sequence_annotation can be misled by misannotation or misspellings in the annotation fields a text search for nifh in the nr protein database found only sequences of which we believe are not actually nifh the fungene database http fungene cme msu edu provides a repository of collections of functional_genes from genbank classified by hidden_markov however updates from genbank are infrequent and the hidden_markov approach is prone to false calls an alternative nifh database available to the public maintained at cornell requires the manual retrieval and curation of genbank nifh sequences to resolve these issues a software pipeline was developed called arbitrator that requires little human intervention and retrieves up to date nifh sequence collections within a few hours the software is adaptable to collecting sequences for genes other than nifh and is especially helpful for discriminating genes of interest from their paralogues as it incorporates an auto curation feature_based on best reversed psi_blast hits to genbanks conserved_domain arbitrators output is formatted for input into other programs such as the arb phylogenetic software environment supplementary appendix a provides a procedure for incrementally updating an existing nifh arb database using the output of arbitrator thus facilitating maintenance of a comprehensive updated gene database nifh gene_diversity studies and all single gene_diversity studies are hampered by the difficulty of collecting all sequences associated with the gene of interest ncbis genbank the database where newly_discovered sequences are deposited provides no service for selecting all records that are annotated as representing a specified gene a direct text search of the database would be of dubious value because of misannotations genbanks main query idiom is the blast_search which selects based on sequence_similarity regardless of function consequently a sequence collection pipeline that simply blasts a representative set of query genes will accept paralogues with the wrong function the challenge of supporting diversity studies is exacerbated by the rapid_growth of genbank the collection of nifh and presumably other genes appears to have been growing_exponentially for the past several years thus there exists an opportunity to facilitate diversity studies by increasing the efficiency of sequence retrieval
