discriminative and informative features for biomolecular text_mining with ensemble feature_selection motivation in the field of biomolecular text_mining black_box behavior of machine_learning systems currently limits understanding of the true nature of the predictions however feature_selection fs is capable of identifying the most relevant_features in any supervised_learning setting providing insight into the specific properties of the classification algorithm this allows us to build more accurate classifiers while at the same time bridging the gap between the black_box behavior and the end_user who has to interpret the results results we show that our fs methodology successfully discards a large fraction of machine generated features improving classification_performance of state of the art text_mining algorithms furthermore we illustrate how fs can be applied to gain understanding in the predictions of a framework for biomolecular event_extraction from text we include numerous examples of highly discriminative features that model either biological reality or common linguistic constructs finally we discuss a number of insights from our fs analyses that will provide the opportunity to considerably improve upon current text_mining tools biomedical_text tools are crucial to process the vast amount of information currently buried in millions of scientific_articles during the last decade natural_language nlp techniques have been implemented and successfully employed to extract proteinprotein_interactions and genedisease_associations recently a more extensive event_extraction challenge has been proposed during the bionlp shared task the goal of this challenge is to reliably extract several fundamental biological_events from text these events concern protein_metabolism e g transcription and catabolism protein_modification e g phosphorylation and fundamental molecular_events e g binding and localization furthermore regulatory_events and causal_relations are represented by specific regulation events this extraction challenge provides the opportunity to model more complex regulatory_pathways than ever before however the increased complexity of the challenge severely degrades the predictive capabilities of existing text_mining algorithms the bionlp shared task provides the community with standardized evaluation measures on a publicly_available dataset enabling a meaningful comparison between various systems analysis of the official results of the participating groups has indicated that supervised machine_learning ml systems using support_vector svms dominate the top_ranked systems the most popular_approach using carefully_designed rules generally provides higher_precision however svms can also be tuned to achieve such high levels of precision while maintaining high overall performance as a consequence svms are gaining_popularity in the bionlp community even though ml algorithms have been shown to achieve excellent_performance their typical characteristic of being a black_box often prohibits the end_user to fully understand the nature of the predictions this is definitely the case for event_extraction from text as typical datasets contain thousands of instances and thousands of features feature_selection fs can help to gain more insight into this data abundance by identifying features that are highly discriminative and marking these for the end_user at the same time this insight can be applied to develop more accurate nlp tools in this article we present the first extensive study of fs in the domain of bionlp related work has mainly been involved with feature_type selection in contrast our study analyzes not only the contribution of different feature_types but also investigates the most important features within one specific type revealing interesting_results both from a linguistic and a biological point_of this work builds on our previous study that included preliminary_experiments using a much less advanced fs method in section of this article we first present the methods used for event_extraction from text feature generation fs and classification next we demonstrate the stability of our fs algorithm present the classification results and analyze in depth the most discriminating features for various event_types section we will indicate how these results lead to more accurate_models as well as provide_interesting insights for the end_user finally section summarizes the main conclusions of our work this section_presents the main results of our study first we discuss the results for fs stability section and describe the classification results of the enhanced framework section further section discusses the relative importance of the various feature_types and finally section offers many in depth analyses of the discriminative_power of individual_features plots the distribution of the fs stability in function of the number of bootstraps used for the consensus ranking from this figure it is clear that using more bootstraps to create the consensus ranking has a beneficial_effect on the stability of the selected_features even though there are still small gains the stability improvements seem to saturate at about bootstraps while the figure is generated from the dataset on unary binding similar graphs are obtained for the other six datasets data not shown the increase in stability from baseline to a bootstrap consensus ranking is between on the transcription set and on the protein_catabolism set more stable fs means less variation of the selected_features which has two main benefits first of all stable fs identifies more meaningful features and allows the construction of better performing classifiers section furthermore it enhances the interpretability of the selected_features sections and
