structural_bioinformatics efficient rna pairwise structure comparison by setter method motivation understanding the architecture and function of rna_molecules requires methods for comparing and analyzing their d structures although a structural_alignment of short rnas is achievable in a reasonable amount of time large structures represent much bigger challenge however the growth of the number of large rnas deposited in the pdb database calls for the development of fast and accurate methods for analyzing their structures as well as for rapid similarity_searches in databases results in this article a novel algorithm for an rna structural_comparison setter secondary_structure based tertiary_structure similarity algorithm is introduced setter uses a pairwise_comparison method based on d similarity of the so_called generalized secondary_structure units for each pair of structures setter produces a distance score and an indication of its statistical_significance setter can be used both for the structural_alignments of structures that are already known to be homologous as well as for d structure similarity_searches and functional_annotation the algorithm presented is both accurate and fast and does not impose limits on the size of aligned rna_structures availability the setter program as well as all datasets is freely_available from http siret cz hoksza projects setter in addition to its role in the transfer of biological_information the evidence shows that rna_molecules also play_key a variety of cellular_processes rna shows among others an enzymatic_activity in ribozymes it takes part in the transcription_regulation and it is involved in the chromatin modeling rna d structure is hierarchical and can be divided_into primary secondary tertiary and quaternary levels rna_secondary motifs can be defined as double helices interconnected by various types of loop structures and are stable independently of their d folds tertiary_interactions stabilize the overall arrangement and packing of double helices in large rna_structures the first resolved rna crystal_structure was that for the yeast phenylalanine to whom correspondence should be addressed transfer_rna trna this achievement was followed by solving structures of other naturally_occurring trnas as well as of a variety of oligomeric rna model structures with the improvements in molecular_biological methods and in crystallographic techniques the size of solved rna_structures has later increased dramatically large rnas an arbitrary limit of residues is used to define large rnas allowed for the first detailed studies of rna_structure elements not found in smaller molecules such as continuous interhelical base_stacking rna domain structure and helical packing the function of an rna_molecule is largely determined by the d structure that is typically more evolutionarily_conserved than its sequence thus methods for the comparative rna function_annotation based on structural_similarity usually yield much better results than sequence based_approaches although detecting optimal structural_similarity between two biomolecules in d has been shown to be np_hard the development of automatic tools capable of an efficient and accurate rna structural_alignment has become an important part of structural_bioinformatics the study of rna tertiary and quaternary_structures must be facilitated by the software that is able to work both with small and large rna_molecules to be computationally_tractable currently available software_tools for comparing two rna d structures such as arts dial iparts sara sarsa or r d align are therefore based on heuristic approaches arts detects a maximum common substructure between two rna d structures using backbone phosphate atoms based on d similarity between solved rna_structures assessed by the arts algorithm a database of hierarchically classified structures darts was subsequently developed arts is not practical for comparison of large rna_molecules due to its cubic time complexity to overcome this problem the dial server using a dynamic_programming and running in a quadratic time was developed the dial alignment algorithm is based on torsion and or pseudotorsion similarity sequence_similarity and base_pairing similarity and it provides access to global local and semi global structural_alignments an improvement in the speed over the dial algorithm was later brought by parts an algorithm based on the so_called structural alphabet sa sa is an emerging concept in the structural_biology of proteins a protein_structure is represented as a limited series of letters each assigned to a well characterized conformation parts uses the vector quantization approach to derive an rna sa of letters representing the most common backbone_conformations the rna_structures are represented as d sequences of sa letters and these are aligned using classical_methods for pairwise and multiple_sequence a new set of sa letters was derived for the improved version of parts called iparts iparts outperforms its previous version parts as well as in some aspects another highly_efficient algorithm sara in sara distances among selected atoms are represented as unit vectors existing on unit spheres all to all unitvector root_mean division rmsd distances of consecutive unit spheres are computed and used as scoring_matrix for the dynamic_programming based global_alignment highly_accurate alignments of homologous molecules are produced by the r d align approach which is based on local nucleotide by nucleotide superpositions that effectively accommodate the flexibility of rna_molecules local_alignments are then merged to form a global_alignment by using a maximum clique algorithm on a specially defined local_alignment graph in this article a novel pairwise rna comparison method secondary_structure based tertiary_structure similarity algorithm setter is proposed the method divides the whole rna_structure into non overlapping generalized secondary_structure units gssus the structural_alignment is then obtained by using a distance measure based on rmsd transformations between all possible pairs of gssus the algorithm scales as o n with the size of gssu and as o n with the number of gssus in the structure the segmentation to gssus offers the advantage of high speeds even for the largest structures the algorithm can be used both for the d structural_alignments figs in the supplementary_information show several examples of pairwise structural_alignments as well as for d structural similarity_searches and for functional_annotation high_speed of the algorithm does not compromise its accuracy as is demonstrated by benchmarking of both structural_alignment and functional_annotation against other published_methods
