databases_and go elite a flexible solution for pathway and ontology over representation we introduce go elite a flexible and powerful pathway analysis tool for a wide_array of species identifiers ids pathways ontologies and gene_sets in addition to the gene_ontology go go elite allows the user to perform over representation analysis on any structured ontology annotations pathway database or biological ids e g gene protein or metabolite go elite exploits the structured nature of biological ontologies to report a minimal set of non overlapping terms the results can be visualized on wikipathways or as networks built in support is provided for over species and id systems covering gene disease and phenotype ontologies multiple pathway_databases biomarkers and transcription_factor and microrna targets go elite is available as a web_interface genmapp cs plugin and as a cross_platform application the analysis of pathways ontologies and other gene_sets has become the preferred method for biologists looking to identify global trends from genomic_datasets although a myriad of tools exist for pathway over representation few consider the structured nature of associated ontology data alternative ontologies and diverse gene_sets few support a wide_array of genomes or biological measurements and they are often limited in scope unlike ontologies pathways provide valuable qualitative contexts interactions reactions metabolites and cellular_compartments that highlight biological_relevance although various pathway resources now exist most over representation analysis ora tools are limited to one resource that is often outdated to address these deficiencies go elite was developed to provide an interchangeable and updatable model of pathway ontology species and gene id system relationships using these relationships
