structural_bioinformatics bayesian sampling of evolutionarily_conserved rna_secondary with pseudoknots motivation today many non_coding are known to play an active role in various important biological_processes since rnas functionality is correlated with specific structural_motifs that are often conserved in phylogenetically related_molecules computational_prediction of rna_structure should ideally be based on a set of homologous primary structures but many available rna_secondary programs that use sequence_alignments do not consider pseudoknots or their estimations consist on a single structure without information on uncertainty results in this article we present a method that takes_advantage of the evolutionary_history of a group of aligned rna_sequences for sampling consensus secondary_structures including pseudoknots according to their approximate posterior_probability we investigate the benefit of using evolutionary_history and demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared with similar methods based on rnase p rna_sequences and simulated_data availability phyloqfold a c implementation of our method is freely_available fromsince the first discovery of catalytic rna activity in the early s a great number of structural and enzymatic rnas have been found which are involved in a large variety of tasks concerning highly topical fields of research including gene_regulation tumor_biology and epigenetic phenomena a fundamental condition for the biological_function of rna is the ability to adopt complex tertiary_structures these molecule comformations are encoded to some extent by the sequence of the molecules nucleotides i e the primary structure since structure_determination by experimental_techniques like x_ray and nmr_spectroscopy are time consuming and costly to whom correspondence should be addressed researchers are interested in computational_methods to predict the molecules conformation based on its primary structure in cases when several similar functional rna_sequences of evolutionarily_related organisms are available their structure can be inferred by comparative_sequence since the biological_function of ncrnas is determined by their molecular_structure rna sequence_evolution is constrained by the secondary_structure changes in the molecules primary structure have less influence on selection_pressure as long as the secondary_and is maintained this is the case when compensatory mutations conserve complementarity between base_pairings thus in a multiple_sequence where structurally_similar parts are grouped together pairs of columns can be found that provide these co varying signals comparative structure_prediction use information like this to predict the structure that a group of related rna_sequences share i e the consensus secondary_structure if a structurally correct or at least a high_quality alignment is given methods of this category e g pfold and rnaalifold achieve very good results describe the algorithms implemented in pfold in terms of stochastic_context scfgs which generate secondary_structures with nested base_pairings this means that if position i is paired with position i i and j is paired with j j then either i j j i or j i i j must hold also many other rna_secondary reconstruction methods including rnaalifold focus on secondary_structures that fulfill this assumption an remaining problem is given by structural_elements called pseudoknots which contain non nested base_pairings even if they occur rather rarely pseudoknotted rnas are known to be essential for a large variety of functional processes in the cell several methods have been proposed to reconstruct secondary_structures with pseudoknots see for example the program ipknot of reconstructs pseudoknotted consensus structures from homologous rna_sequences benchmarks like comparna reveal that we cannot expect to find for every primary structure the correct secondary_structure with any of the available prediction_approaches even if pseudoknots are neglected for this reason it is important to assess the reliability of a prediction one possibility is to use bayesian sampling see for a primer
