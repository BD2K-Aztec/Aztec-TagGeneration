genomerunner web_server regulatory similarity and differences define the functional impact of snp sets motivation the growing amount of regulatory data from the encode roadmap epigenomics and other consortia provides a wealth of opportunities to investigate the functional impact of single_nucleotide snps yet given the large number of regulatory datasets researchers are posed with a challenge of how to efficiently utilize them to interpret the functional impact of snp sets results we developed the genomerunner web_server to automate systematic statistical_analysis of snp sets within a regulatory context besides defining the functional impact of snp sets genomerunner implements novel regulatory similarity differential analyses and cell_type regulatory enrichment_analysis validated against literature and disease ontology based_approaches analysis of disease trait associated snp sets demonstrated that the functional impact of snp sets corresponds to known disease relationships we identified a group of autoim mune diseases with snps distinctly enriched in the enhancers of t_helper cell_subpopulations and demonstrated relevant cell_type specificity of the functional impact of other snp sets in summary we show how systematic analysis of genomic_data within a regulatory context can help interpreting the functional impact of snp sets availability_and genomerunner web_server is freely_available www inte grativegenomics org contact the success of genome_wide gwass in finding causative single_nucleotide snps for mendelian_disorders is hindered by their failure to define complex patterns of nonmendelian inheritance such as seen in multi_factorial complex_diseases this is in part because of all snps lie outside protein_coding complicating our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms_involved furthermore of all snps are rare i e occurring in a small percentage of individuals typically and generally underemphasized in gwass thus only a fraction of valuable genetic_information is studied recent research has provided evidence that rare snps and snps outside of protein_coding can contribute to disease_manifestation by collectively altering dna_methylation histone_modifications enhancers chromatin_states deoxyribonuclease i dnase_i accessibility and transcription_factor binding leading to gene_expression changes reviewed in and disruption of proteinprotein_interactions yet exploring snps regulatory_relationships in a hypothesis driven manner is not just time consuming but also limited to the regulatory_mechanisms an individual researcher can think of conversely using systematically organized publicly_available regulatory data offers a data_driven investigation of potential functional mechanisms altered by snps to do this software is needed to facilitate systematic analysis of such genome_wide data recent_years have seen rapid_growth of publicly_available data on genome_organization and functional regulatory information the encyclopedia of dna elements encode_project the roadmap epigenomics program and others have been actively cataloguing functional regulatory genome_annotation datasets such as cell and tissue_specific histone_modification profiles dnase_i chromatin_states and transcription_factor tfbss although many breakthroughs have been made by the analyses of these datasets these resources remain underutilized by computational_biologists for systematic analysis and interpretation of the functional mechanisms associated with and potentially altered by experimentally_obtained omics_data in this article we describe the genomerunner web serveran automated framework for the statistical_analysis and interpretation of the functional impact of snp sets using regulatory datasets from the encode roadmap epigenomics and other projects genomerunner prioritizes regulatory datasets most significantly_enriched in snp sets and visualizes the most significant enrichments thus suggesting regulatory_mechanisms that may be altered by them in addition to prioritizing snp set specific regulatory enrichments functional impact genomerunner implements three novel approaches i regulatory similarity analysis aimed at identifying groups of snp sets having similar functional impact ii differential regulatory analysis developed to identify functional impact specific for a group of snp sets and iii cell_type regulatory enrichment_analysis designed to identify cell_type specificity of the functional impact we have reviewed related software_tools to highlight the novel functionality of genomerunner supplementary the article is organized as follows the methods part provides a brief overview of genomerunner functionality and analytical_approaches the results part illustrates the application of genomerunner to deepen our understanding of the potential functional impact of disease trait associated snp sets genomerunner identified a group of nine immunologic diseases with distinct_functional enrichment signature of the corresponding snp sets detected cell specificity of the regulatory enrichments relevant to disease_pathology and confirmed known enrichment of the immunologic disease associated snp sets in t_helper cell specific_enhancers h_k and h k ac activating histone_marks in summary we show how genomerunner an open_source web_server freely_accessible at http www integrativegenomics org aids in biological_interpretation of the significance of snp sets in terms of putative_functional impact
