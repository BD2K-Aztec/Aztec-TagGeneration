gene_expression pius peptide_identification by unbiased search we present pius a tool that identifies peptides from tandem_mass data by analyzing the six frame translation of a complete genome it differs from earlier_studies that have performed such a genomic search in two ways i it considers a larger search_space and ii it is designed for natural peptide_identification rather than proteomics differently from other peptidomics tools designed for genome_wide searches pius does not limit the analysis to a set of sequences that match a list of de_novo reconstructions availability source_code executables and a detailed technical report are freely_available atin peptidomics tandem mass_spectroscopy is commonly used to identify peptides an unknown peptide undergoes fragmentation its fragment masses are registered in a so_called fragmentation spectrum and the peptide_sequence is inferred from this spectrum this latter step is usually performed by database search_methods for each protein_sequence in the database potential fragments are predicted with their theoretical fragmentation spectrum a scoring_function then measures how well these spectra match the experimental one returning the top scoring solutions however if the peptide is not derived from one of the database sequences this strategy is bound to fail in peptidomics there are still many unidentified spectra of good quality presumably partially because of this one strategy to deal with this limitation is to use de_novo sequencing which infers the amino_acid from the mass differences between neighboring peaks in the spectrum however from spectra of moderate_quality this strategy cannot extract enough information to unambiguously infer the complete_sequence another strategy which we adopt in this note is to compare the observed spectrum with the theoretical one of any peptide that could be translated from the genome the proposed method called pius peptide_identification by unbiased search identifies peptides from fragmentation spectra using the six frame translation of the complete genome even though a peptide search against the complete translation of a genome has been investigated in the context of proteogenomics these studies were limited to small_genomes and or used additional assumptions that hold in the context of proteomics where protein_digestion occurs in vitro at predictable cleavage_sites but not in peptidomics where the proteolytic_processing occurs in vivo at sites that are difficult to predict further these studies aimed at protein gene_discovery whereas pius aims at peptide_identification the latter requires a much higher recall than the former identifying a few of the peptides from a genomic_region usually suffices to make a gene prediction all in all this means that peptidomics presents a markedly different context from proteomics recently three peptidomics methods have been proposed for genome_wide searches ms dictionary msgappeddictionary and iggypep the first two methods build a list of de_novo reconstructions called a spectral dictionary and use it to reduce the number of candidates in the search iggypep queries the full genome translation using complete de_novo reconstructions or partial peptide sequence_tags pst pius differs from these methods because its search is exhaustive not biased toward a subset of candidates and it eliminates the need for good quality psts many spectra of candidate bioactive_peptides remain unidentified to date to tackle this problem we present pius an open_source tool for peptide_identification from tandem_mass data pius searches the entire_genome without previous assumptions to reduce_the and is therefore most suited as a tool of last resort we have validated pius with maldi_tof spectra even when searching an entire mammalian_genome pius obtains correct identifications in a large majority of cases and has a much higher recall_rate than ms gappeddictionary
