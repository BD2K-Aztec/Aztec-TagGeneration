discriminatory_power of rna family models_motivation rna family models group nucleotide_sequences that share a common biological_function these models can be used to find new sequences belonging to the same family to succeed in this task a model needs to exhibit high_sensitivity as well as high_specificity as model construction is guided by a manual process a number of problems can occur such as the introduction of more than one model for the same family or poorly constructed models we explore the rfam database to discover such problems results our main contribution is in the definition of the discriminatory_power of rna family models together with a first algorithm for its computation in addition we present calculations across the whole rfam database that show several families lacking high_specificity when compared to other families we give a list of these clusters of families and provide a tentative explanation our program can be used to i make sure that new models are not equivalent to any model already present in the database and ii new models are not simply submodels of existing families structured non_coding are nucleotide_sequences that are not translated into protein but have in the folded_state their own specific functions this function is very much dependent on the secondary_and the folded_state while on the other hand the primary structure or sequence sees more change in the form of mutation one can define relationships between non_coding in different species a set of related sequences is called an rna family each set is defined by its members performing the same function in different species when genomes are sequenced one is interested in finding members of known families in the new data as well as finding new families if previously_unknown non_coding are discovered the problemfinding homologuesexists for proteins too software to perform the same kind of searches exists in the form of hmmer and the pfam_database using profile_hidden profile_hmms a mathematically convenient solution was found around which the algorithms could be built unfortunately the same solution proved inadequate for non_coding the task of building a model that describes a new family is still a mostly manual process finding new members of existing families on the other hand can be performed using software the problem we are discussing in this article applies equally well to other algorithms to whom correspondence should be addressed human acgucg aacuaga cow accugg aacuaga dog acuugg aag uca cat acgucgaaacuaga structure to search for homologue sequences but as our algorithm is specific toward an existing software_package namely infernal we will perform our analysis with respect to this software and the corresponding rfam database in order to model families of non_coding in a way that provides both sensitivity_and the consensus secondary_structure of the set of sequences has to be included in the mathematical_model from which the algorithm is created stochastic_context provide access to such models just as stochastic regular grammars in the form of profile_hmms can be used to model protein_families we begin with a succinct introduction to the process of first designing an infernal rna family model and then searching for new family_members building on those algorithms we can define the specificity of a given model compared to other known models in a natural way using the already established infernal language of bit scores the rfam database contains different models all pairwise calculations lead to a total of results the time to calculate the score and string for each pair is typically less than one second but of course depending on the size of the models in question of all pairs about are noteworthy with scores of bit or more shows the distribution of scores among all pairs of family models negative scores have been truncated towards zero as any score lower than this certainly means that the two models in question are separated very well among the high_scoring pairs are several interesting examples some of which we will take a closer look at similar results for other models can be extracted from the data available for download it is possible to generate among others model centric views that show the high_scoring neighborhood of a particular model and global views that show high_scoring pairs asaptly demonstrates clusters of families form early in this case only the highest scoring edges are drawn in table we have gathered some results the pair scores over bit have been split according to the abstract shape of the secondary_structures of the hit a shape is a representation of the secondary_structure that abstracts over stem and interior loop sizes in this case each pair of brackets defines one stem intervening unpaired nucleotides do not lead to the creation of a new stem hits such as are unstructured but similar sequences the shape is just one hairpin while the two shapes on the same string point to an interesting pair score as the string apparently folds into complex high_scoring structures that align well too in principle it is possible that the common sequence folds into two different secondary_structures at abstract shape level the most abstract this did not happen for the current rfam database our algorithm however is capable to deal with such cases let us now take a closer look at two examples that are particularly interesting the first was selected because rnasep is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease and the second to highlight how problematic models can be discovered st example the rnasep families for bacteria type a and b and archaea show weak separation as can be seen in the three involved models rfam id and have different noise cutoff scores the noise cutoff is the highest_score for a false hit in the rfam nr database scores above this threshold are likely homologues cf for the three different rnasep families these scores are and bit respectively a look atshows that no random_sequence could score high in both model and one can at most find a hit that is remote at best the picture is entirely different for the high_scoring sequence between rnasep link scores for different rnasep models with noise cutoff nc with weak separation values in brackets are the difference to the noise cutoff thresholds the difference is as at least as high as given a negative value means that in one or two of the models the score was lower than the noise cutoff for example the link score of bit between bact a and bact b is bit higher than the nc of bact b type a and rnasep in archaea here we find a sequence that is at least bit higher than the noise cutoff a similar picture presents itself for the sequence found for the two bacterial rnasep models though the score difference between the noise cutoff and the highest_score is only bit the sequences and their scores show something else too in section we described how to generate many similar strings from the one returned string in this case where the gap between cutoff and score is as wide as bit we could indeed create a very large number of strings each of which with a score that makes it a likely hit additionally the high scores between the three rnasep models are somehow expected given that all three models describe variants of rnasep nuclear rnasep not shown on the other hand is well separated from these three models with a maximal score of bit nd example for our second example we have chosen a set of four family models each presents with not only a high link score with regard to the others but also the scores are over the noise cutoff threshold by a large margin too i page i i i a high_scoring set of families explicitly selected for the large difference to the noise cutoff value models and score bit on some input which is at least bit higher than the respective noise cutoff value notice too that not all pairs show such a behavior models and have a high link score with bit but at least the noise cutoff value is higher than this value by bit making a hit less likely in one model some of the models were built using very few seed sequences and this seems to increase the chance of finding weak models we have presented a polynomial time algorithm that for any two covariance models returns a string that scores high in both models using this algorithm several questions regarding rna family models can be answered first it is possible to determine if a model has high discriminative_power against other models this is important to avoid false_positive when searching for previously_unknown new family_members the discriminative_power can be quantified using the same measure as used in infernal itself thereby giving answers in a language namely bit scores that makes comparisons possible and easy second if a model shows overlap with another it can be determined which regions of the model do actually show this behaviour this is possible as we not only return a score value but other information too this includes the offending string the respective secondary_structures and a detailed score account third the algorithm is extendable borrowing ideas from algebraic dynamic_programming an optimization algebra can be anything that follows the dynamic_programming constraints included are the cyk scoring algebra and the different information functions as well as an algebra product operation additional algebras require roughly a dozen lines of code fourth the maximin or link score lends itself as a natural similarity_score for rna_families closely_related families in terms of primary and secondary structurenot necessarily biological closeness show a higher link score than others this requires further investigation to determine how much biological_information can be extracted pure mathematics cannot answer which biological relation does actually exist in the case of prospective meta families we have two open research problems one is to take a closer look at high_scoring families to determine their biological relationship are high scores an artifact of poorly designed families or a case of an actual metafamily the other problem became evident in the st example where not all members of the rnasep family scored high against each other this suggests that meta families cannot be modeled in infernal directly but how to adapt rna family models in such a case remains_open researchers designing new families will also find value in the tool as one can scan a new family model against existing ones to be more confident that one has indeed identified a new family and not an already existing one in disguise the infernal users guide mentions homology between family models as a reason for the existence of the different cutoff scores for noise gathering and trusted we think it is important to be able to determine computationally the importance of the cutoff scores when assigning new hits to families another fact is that cutoff scores like the models themselves are set by the curators of the family our scoring_scheme relies on the infernal scoring algorithm itself as numbers of models were created from very few seed sequences it is possible that the relevant cutoff scores are set too high to capture remote members a cutoff score above the highest pair scores involving such a model could be of help while scanning new genomes for remote family_members finally we have to acknowledge that infernal uses the inside not the cyk algorithm to determine final scores this can pose a problem in certain exceptional circumstances but these should be rare mathematically cf cyk prob s m while inside prob sm the cyk algorithm gives the score for the single best alignment of sequence s and model m while the inside algorithm sums up over all possible alignments this just means that we underestimate the final score or said otherwise the inside scores for the link sequence given the corresponding models will be even higher than the cyk scores
