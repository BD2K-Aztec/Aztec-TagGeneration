oasis online analysis of small_rna deep sequencing_data oasis is a web_application that allows for the fast and flexible online analysis of small rna_seq srna_seq data it was designed for the end_user in the lab providing an easy to use web frontend including video tutorials demo data and best practice step_by guidelines on how to analyze srna_seq data oasis exclusive selling points are a differential_expression module that allows for the multivariate_analysis of samples a classification module for robust biomarker_detection and an advanced programming interface that supports the batch submission of jobs both modules include the analysis of novel mirnas mirna_targets and functional_analyses including go and pathway enrichment oasis generates downloadable interactive web reports for easy visualization exploration and analysis of data on a local system finally oasis modular workflow enables for the rapid re analysis of data small_rnas play_pivotal many biological_processes ranging from organismal development to disease_states including cancer as such they have gained recent interest not only in basic_research but also as therapeutic_targets and biomarkers of disease in clinical_settings the current method of choice for small_rna analysis is deep_sequencing which allows for the comprehensive charting of small_rnas at a reasonable price consequently it is not the generation of data but the subsequent analysis that is usually limiting to this end several web_applications have been developed that allow for the analysis of small rna_seq srna_seq data especially recent additions to the small_rna analysis landscape convince with their user_friendliness analysis portfolio and their performance these include magi an all in one application featuring structured interactive output isrna which combines powerful search functionality with an online project database and cpss a web_application that detects mirna edits and modifications although many good web platforms for the analysis of srnaseq data exist some important analysis features have yet to be integrated for example no current web_application allows for multivariate_data including multi group comparisons and the incorporation of covariate and interaction information also there is currently no web_application that allows for the identification of biomarkers of disease via integrated machine_learning modules finally current srna_seq web_services do not allow for automated analysis or batch submission of jobs via an advanced programming interface api a feature that would greatly_facilitate analysis workflows for frequent users in the end these functionalities should be paired with a solid prediction of novel mirnas their targets and functional_analyses using gene_ontology and pathway enrichment
