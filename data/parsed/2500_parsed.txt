bioimage_informatics integrated profiling of three_dimensional cell_culture models and d microscopy motivation our goal is to develop a screening platform for quantitative profiling of colony organizations in d cell_culture models the d cell_culture models which are also imaged in d are functional_assays that mimic the in vivo characteristics of the tissue_architecture more faithfully than the d cultures however they also introduce significant computational challenges with the main barriers being the effects of growth conditions fixations and inherent complexities in segmentation that need to be resolved in the d volume results a segmentation strategy has been developed to delineate each nucleus in a colony that overcomes i the effects of growth conditions ii variations in chromatin distribution and iii ambiguities formed by perceptual boundaries from adjacent nuclei the strategy uses a cascade of geometric filters that are insensitive to spatial non uniformity and partitions a clump of nuclei based on the grouping of points of maximum curvature at the interface of two neighboring nuclei these points of maximum curvature are clustered together based on their coplanarity and proximity to define dissecting planes that separate the touching nuclei the proposed curvature based partitioning method is validated with both synthetic and real_data and is shown to have a superior_performance against previous techniques validation and sensitivity analysis are coupled with the experimental_design that includes a non transformed cell_line and three tumorigenic cell_lines which covers a wide_range of phenotypic diversity in breast_cancer colony profiling derived from nuclear segmentation reveals distinct indices for the morphogenesis of each cell_line

models continue to play_a in evaluating therapeutic_targets elucidating aberrant pathways and identifying novel biomarkers traditionally cell_culture models are based on d monolayers that are grown on plastic but recent research indicates that cells grown in a d culture often behave more like cells in living_organisms this is partly due to the cellular_organization cellcell contact and unique cellextracellular matrix ecm adhesions and motility phenotype d cell_culture models offer many advantages over the d monolayer systems i each cell forms an ellipsoid with dimensions of microns whereas in the monolayer system each cell remains flat with a thickness of a few microns ii in a d system the entire cell_surface is exposed to neighboring_cells and extracellular_matrix in contrast in a d system a small percentage of the cell_surface is exposed to the other cells these differences in shape and surfaces are significant given that of the genome is known to encode membranebound macromolecules iii studies have shown that d morphological organizations have a profound impact on cellular function such as morphogenesis development response to therapy and patterns of gene_expression iv unlike conventional d models d culture assays distinguish tumor phenotypes from non malignant ones where the tumor_phenotype is often manifested as multicellular organizations owing to these differences there is a greater need for characterizing and quantifying organizations through the delineation of each cell because the protocols for nuclear_staining are well established we focus on delineating nuclear regions which also provides context for quantifying multiple endpoints in high_content in addition cell by cell analysis enables characterization of heterogeneity which is one of the central challenges and a fundamental property in cellular_systems it has been suggested that heterogeneity enables cellular_systems to explore a wide_range of phenotypic_responses where a specific subpopulation may serve as a predictor of response to perturbations an example is shown in supplementaryin the supplementary section given the aforementioned motivation there is clear gap in quantitative methods for characterizing multicellular organizations for the next generation of high_content systems this is partly due to the massive_amounts of d data that have to be acquired through confocal or deconvolution microscopy and the ambiguities that were present in the d assays must now be resolved in the d volume space in this article we propose a pipeline implemented within the insight segmentation and registration toolkit itk and the visualization toolkit vtk framework to delineate each nucleus and to profile morphometric and colony organization at an abstract level our approach is an extension of a previously_developed for monolayer cell_culture models nevertheless such an extension has proven to be challenging because of structural_heterogeneity and partitioning of
