orthonets simultaneous visual_analysis of orthologs and their interaction neighborhoods across different organisms motivation protein_interaction contain a wealth of biological_information but their large size often hinders cross organism comparisons we present orthonets a cytoscape_plugin that displays proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks from two organisms simultaneously highlighting orthology_relationships and aggregating several types of biomedical annotations orthonets also allows ppi_networks derived from experiments to be overlaid on networks extracted from public_databases supporting the identification and verification of new interactors any newly_identified ppis can be validated by checking whether their orthologs interact in another organism availability orthonets is freely_available wodaklab org orthonets recent_technological have contributed to a rapid_growth in the amount of data on gene and protein interactions as well as on protein and gene function although organisms such as yeast are comparatively well characterized othersincluding humanhave data for only a small fraction of their predicted genomes or proteomes in this case orthology_relationships can be used to transfer information on function and interactions from one organism to another thus assisting the prediction and validation of new interactors the orthonets plug in for cytoscape enables simultaneous visual_analysis of proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks in multiple_organisms by default the plugin provides direct access to updated networks from five model organismsyeast mouse human fly and wormconsolidated from major ppi databases and available from the irefweb resource resource http wodaklab org irefweb interactions are annotated with supporting_information such as interaction type experimental detection methods and supporting publications interacting_proteins in orthonets are further annotated with domain_architectures to whom correspondence should be addressed gene_ontology and if applicable disease information from the online_mendelian omim database
