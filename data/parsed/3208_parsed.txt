genome_analysis ncs incorporating positioning data to quantify nucleosome stability in yeast motivation with the spreading technique of mass sequencing nucleosome_positions and scores for their intensity have become available through several previous_studies in yeast but relatively few studies have specifically aimed to determine the score of nucleosome stability based on mass sequencing_data we proposed a nucleo some center score ncs for quantifying nucleosome stability by measuring shifts of the nucleosome center and then mapping ncs scores to nucleosome_positions in brogaard et_al s study results we demonstrated the efficiency of ncs by known preference of a t based tracts for nucleosome formation and showed that central nucleosomal_dna is more sensitive to a t based tracts than outer regions which corresponds to the central histone tetramer dominated region we also found significant flanking preference around nucleosomal_dna for a t based dinucleotides suggesting that neighboring sequences could affect nucleosome stability finally the difference between results of ncs and brogaard et_al s scores was addressed and discussed contacts the nucleosome is a fundamental repeating_unit of dna packaging in eukaryotic chromatin in yeast it is composed of a core containing bp segments of dna wrapped around a histone_octamer which consists of two h ah b dimers and one h h tetramer most of the dna is wrapped in nucleosomes to resemble a string with beads and neighboring nucleosomes are generally separated by linker dna approximately of genomic_dna is packaged in nucleosomes a previous study indicated that in saccharomyces_cerevisiae of the genome_sequences appear to be wrapped in nucleosomes the positioning of nucleosomes influences the accessibility of proteins to dna or blocks transcription factorbinding sites consequently nucleosomes are strongly associated with chromatin and gene_expression and they can regulate transcription_initiation dna_replication and dna_repair nucleosome_positions combined with histone variants and histone_modifications are the key to genome regulation and gene_expression in s cerevisiae an increasing number of studies have focused on nucleosome_positioning by using several technologies over the past several years early studies for identifying nucleosome_positions primarily relied on the tiled microarray_hybridization approach the first set of high_throughput positioning data was generated in followed by the complete high_resolution map of nucleosome_occupancy on a whole_genome with the maturity of high_throughput dna_sequencing many high_resolution maps of genome_wide nucleosome_positions have been made in recent_years among those data some nucleosomes have very consistent positions within the genome but others are unstable and varied divergence between the data can be caused by both artificial and natural factors the artificial factors including the biological procedure of nucleosome digestion quality of high_throughput technology and computational_method of data_processing make the comparisons between different datasets more complicated as for natural factors several determinants such as distinct dna_sequences dna_methylation histone variants post_translational transcription_factors and chromatin remodelers can affect nucleosome_positions this phenomenon of divergence in nucleosome_positions led to studies on the fuzziness or stability of nucleosome_positions such as position cluster during processing of nucleosome_positioning data the nucleosome position and the intensity for that position can be calculated using several computational_methods the standard_deviation of intensity values was usually directly used as fuzziness scores to measure the nucleosome dynamics or stability in some relevant studies however based on the design of biological procedures such as different concentrations of micrococcal nuclease_digestion this standard_deviation might not truly represent the dynamics or stability of nucleosome position and could possibly result from digestion preference or bias or could be affected by the binding_strength between the histone and dna instead of nucleosome dynamics or stability in this study we quantified nucleosome stability by considering the shift of nucleosome centers treating nucleosome stability as the probability of a nucleosome center in a specific position and determined the probability of shifting by observing differences between diverging data because high_throughput sequencing_data have been easily available in recent_years we developed to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com a computational_approach using the gaussian function to define the nucleosome center score ncs based on several published sequencing_data of s cerevisiae under different conditions then we used both ncs and precise nucleosome_positions at base_pair resolution to demonstrate the efficiency of ncs and to represent a clear relationship between ncs and sequence characteristics with the help of high_resolution brogaard et_al s nucleosome data and a reliable ncs clear patterns of dinucleotide preference around nucleosomal_dna and its neighboring dna were illustrated in our study finally we also indicated differences between ncs and scores from brogaard et_al s study and discussed their significance the calculation of ncs is based on the incorporation of mass raw_sequencing and it provides reliability in measuring the frequency change rate smoothing window_size bp surrounding the central nucleosome illustrating the preference of each dinucleotide for nucleosomes with a higher score in a ncp noise b ncp and c noise the poly da dt ratio of nucleosomal_dna for different levels of nucleosome score under four score schemes and different tolerating a t switches on inner and outer nucleosomal_dna regions the distribution of average nucleosome occupancies around the tss and tts for ncs and ncp noise shows that the patterns under the two different score schemes are similar but the ncs supports the model of the barrier nucleosome after the tss to a greater degree nucleosome stability this is because using a unifying processing method for all raw_sequencing can diminish the variance of each positioning data and combining different pns can supplement the insufficiency of single data in this study we applied ncs on the precise nucleosome_positioning data from brogaard et_al s work we then represented the efficiency of ncs based on known sequence characteristics of nucleosomal_dna and showed the differences and possible limits of original brogaard et_al s scores at the same time based on ncs a clear dinucleotide preference for stable nucleosomes was illustrated and significant flanking tendencies around nucleosomal_dna were also revealed for the dinucleotides aa tt at and ta the results of a t based dinucleotide and poly da dt show that the degrees of sequence_preference for the central and outer regions of nucleosomal_dna are different which is basically due to the fact that core histone h h tetramers dominate the free_energy of histonedna interactions in the comparison of ncs and brogaard et_al s score the pattern of ncs showed more reasonable behaviors on the influence of central nucleosomal_dna regions and disfavored the a t tract across nucleosomal_dna but we cannot judge or find definite reasons to explain the behaviors of the score from brogaard et_al s study nevertheless some possible assumptions based on observations of sequence characteristics were provided in our study because brogaard et_al s data support precise nucleosome_positions and ncs reliably reflects the nucleosome stability combing two data_sources can enhance the future_studies on epigenetic_regulation or nucleosome stability which is affected by several factors besides sequence_preference moreover we also provide the data of original ncs for each base_pair in the supplementary data so it will be easy to apply ncs to genome_wide related data such as data of histone variant site of histone_modification or even transcriptional_factor binding_site to investigate the relationship with nucleosome stability
