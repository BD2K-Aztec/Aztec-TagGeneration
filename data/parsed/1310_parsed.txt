structural_bioinformatics delphipka web_server predicting pk a of proteins rnas and dnas a new pk a prediction web_server is released which implements delphi gaussian dielec tric function to calculate electrostatic_potentials generated by charges of biomolecules topology parameters are extended to include atomic information of nucleotides of rna and dna which extends the capability of pk a calculations beyond proteins the web_server allows the end_user to protonate the biomolecule at particular ph based on calculated pk a values and provides the downloadable file in pqr format several tests are performed to benchmark the accuracy and speed of the protocol implementation the web_server follows a client server architecture built on php and html and utilizes delphipka program the computation is performed on the palmetto supercomputer cluster and results download links are given back to the end_user via http protocol the web_server takes_advantage of mpi parallel implementation in delphipka and can run a single job on up to cpus availability_and the delphipka web_server is available at http compbio clemson edu pka webserver biological_processes are affected by the ph of the cellular_environment for example enzyme catalysis protein_folding and binding protein_protein are all ph_dependent different protonation states of titratable residues within molecules due to ph changes can result in significantly different complex conformations and binding_free fast and accurate_predictions for pk a values of ionizable groups will facilitate investigations aiming at designing better drugs and more robust enzymes which are active and stable over a wide_range of ph although there are many programs for predicting pk a values of protein ionizable residues such as mcce uhbd propka h which are based on various methods to the best of our knowledge there is no pk a prediction web sever that provides pk a calculations for rnas and dnas bases as well here we developed a new pk a web_server that implements the following features i calculates pk a values for the protein rna and single_stranded ii protonates the structure at userspecified ph according to calculated pk a iii provides the option of various force_field amber charmm parse gromos iv calculates electrostatic free_energy components with the gaussian dielectric_function without defining molecular_surface and v provides different hydrogen conformations the web_server is implemented in delphipka program and built on the supercomputer cluster to take advantage of mpi parallelization which improves the computation speed up to times
