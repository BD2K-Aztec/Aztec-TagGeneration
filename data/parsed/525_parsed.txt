assessing the functional coherence of gene_sets with metrics based on the gene_ontology graph motivation the results of initial analyses for many high_throughput commonly take the form of gene or protein_sets and one of the ensuing tasks is to evaluate the functional coherence of these sets the study of gene_set function most commonly makes use of controlled_vocabulary in the form of ontology annotations for a given gene_set the statistical_significance of observing these annotations or enrichment may be tested using a number of methods instead of testing for significance of individual terms this study is concerned with the task of assessing the global functional coherence of gene_sets for which novel metrics and statistical_methods have been devised results the metrics of this study are based on the topological_properties of graphs comprised of genes and their gene_ontology a novel aspect of these methods is that both the enrichment of annotations and the relationships among annotations are considered when determining the significance of functional coherence we applied our methods to perform analyses on an existing database and on microarray experimental_results here we demonstrated that our approach is highly discriminative in terms of differentiating coherent gene_sets from random ones and that it provides biologically sensible evaluations in microarray_analysis we further used examples to show the utility of graph visualization as a tool for studying the functional coherence of gene_sets availability the implementation is provided as a freely accessiblefor a gene_set the functional coherence is a measure of the strength of the relatedness of the functions associated with the genes which can be used to differentiate a set of genes performing coherently related functions from ones consisting of randomly grouped genes it is commonly evaluated by analyzing the genes functional_annotations which are almost invariably in the form of the controlled_vocabulary from the gene_ontology go the vocabulary terms are organized as a graph with concepts ranging from very general to very specific to whom correspondence should be addressed they are used to annotate gene_products by a variety of methods including human curation based on evidence from the literature the annotations capture what is known about the biology functional coherence can be reflected in two aspects first whether genes share similar functions or whether they participate in the same biological_processes for example if a sufficient number of genes from a set are annotated with a common go term the annotation is considered to be enriched and therefore the genes are deemed functionally coherent second whether the distinct functions are related the relationship between functional_annotations can be either semantic or biological in nature for example if a gene is annotated with the term regulation of apoptosis and another one is labeled with the term induction of apoptosis their functions can be considered coherent because the terms are semantically alike alternatively annotations can be semantically distinct e g apoptosis and electron_transport yet their co occurrence in a gene_set can be biologically_meaningful if many genes in the set participate in both processes ideally a measure of functional coherence should take the above aspects into account during evaluation to date a method unifying the enrichment and relatedness aspects of functional coherence remains to be developed the first aspect of functional coherence evaluating go term enrichment is usually performed by various count based_methods that evaluate the probability of observing a go term in a set by random chanceto determine if an individual term is overrepresented in a gene_set the widely used count based_methods are based on the hypergeometric_distribution or other similar probabilistic_models the merits and limitations of this family of methods are well documented since the objective of count based_methods is focused on individual terms directly utilizing their results e g p values to assess overall coherence encounters the following difficulties i schemes ad_hoc or sophisticated need to be devised in order to combine the results of individual_tests into a unified measure ii the relationships among the terms are ignored by treating each annotation independently and iii multiple testing potentially leads to false_positives results thus a less reliable unified measure the second aspect evaluating the relatedness among distinct annotations has been investigated in several studies that utilized the directed_acyclic dag representation of the go a number of studies have used the ontology graph_structure in the context of functional_analyses however the specific purpose or information used often differs from the methods proposed in this study making a direct comparison between methods less meaningful one theme is to find the representative summary term s utilizing the graphpage i i i the main goal of this study was to introduce functional coherence metrics with high levels of discriminative_power based on the currently available go annotations moreover the method was intentionally developed independent of data types that are used to generate the gene_set of interest goi two graph_based metrics k s and l were developed where the former measures the enrichment of functional_annotations and the latter summarizes the relatedness of the annotations furthermore k rs was devised so that both aspects of functional coherence can be evaluated with a unified metric in addition to quantitative evaluation we have also provided tools to visualize go steiner trees as a means to further assess the results by inspecting how genes and annotations are organized rather than solely relying on p values in the real_world application the metrics returned biologically sensible calls the advantages of these metrics include but are not necessarily limited to the following i by incorporating semantic and biological_relationships in the evaluation our methods treat genes_annotated with semantically close go terms as functionally_similar ii providing an global evaluation method for proteins gene_sets rather than treating each function_annotation of genes as independent and iii addressing the multiple_testing by reducing the number of tests however like all go based evaluation methods the metrics are dependent on how well genes are annotated therefore the utilities of the metrics are limited when considering species that have less comprehensive annotations and the metrics may reflect potential annotation biases from the databases this is likely to hold true for localized_areas of the gograph as well the discriminative_power of the graph_based metrics may be attributed to the following factors first the methods capture the key_properties that differentiate coherent gene_sets from random onesgo terms in a functionally coherent gene_set are more likely to be enriched and their functions are more closely_related semantically and biologically in addition to the semantic relationships considered our metrics further take into account the relationships among go terms that co annotate genes which leads to a better performance second through a sampling_approach our method accurately estimates the distribution of network statistics of the randomly grouped gene_sets which is directly relevant to the task at handdetermining if an arbitrary gene_set consists of randomly grouped genes
