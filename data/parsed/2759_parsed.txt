genome_analysis lpmerge an r package for merging genetic_maps by linear_programming consensus genetic_maps constructed from multiple_populations are an important resource for both basic_and including genome_wide genome sequence_assembly and studies of evolution the lpmerge software uses linear_programming to efficiently minimize the mean absolute error between the consensus map and the linkage_maps from each population this minimization is performed subject to linear inequality constraints that ensure the ordering of the markers in the linkage_maps is preserved when marker order is inconsistent between linkage_maps a minimum set of ordinal constraints is deleted to resolve the conflicts availability_and lpmerge is on cran at http cran r project org_web lpmerge broadly speaking two types of strategies have been used to construct genetic_maps across multiple_populations one is to minimize an objective_function based on the observed recombination frequencies between markers analogous to the strategy used for linkage mapping in a single population examples of this approach include the software_packages joinmap and multipoint the second strategy is to work directly with the component linkage_maps instead of the underlying recombination frequencies which can lead to significant_gains in computational_efficiency without compromising map accuracy this second strategy is used by the software_package mergemap which has been used in several different species identified a weakness in mergemap and proposed an alternative algorithm for merging linkage_maps based on linear_programming lp which was incorporated into an r package called dagger the accuracy of the lp algorithm was validated on simulated_data and in comparison with mergemap using real barley data was found to have lower mean squared error on a genome_wide basis a significant limitation of dagger was that it required the component linkage_maps to have a consistent marker order in practice the linkage_maps from different populations often have ordering conflicts even when there is a single physical order because of genotyping_errors and statistical errors arising from the use of small_populations another weakness of dagger was that the length of the consensus genetic_map was shrunken compared with the original linkage_maps both of these limitations have been overcome to create a new r package called lpmerge which is available on cran the lp algorithm has been reformulated without graph_theory to eliminate shrinkage of the consensus map and a new algorithm for resolving ordinal conflicts between linkage_maps has been added the objectives of this applications note are to describe these modifications and to illustrate the performance of the conflict_resolution algorithm
