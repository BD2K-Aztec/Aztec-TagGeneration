alpha centauri assessing novel centromeric repeat sequence_variation with long_read downloaded from motivation long arrays of near identical tandem_repeats are a common_feature of centromeric and subtelomeric regions in complex genomes these sequences present a source of repeat structure diversity that is commonly ignored by standard genomic_tools unlike reads shorter than the underlying repeat structure that rely on indirect inference methods e g assembly long_reads allow direct inference of satellite higher_order repeat structure to automate characterization of local centromeric tandem_repeat sequence_variation we have designed alpha centauri alpha satellite centromeric automated repeat identification that takes_advantage of pacific bioscience long_reads from whole_genome sequencing_datasets by operating on reads prior to assembly our approach provides a more comprehensive set of repeat structure variants and is not impacted by rearrangements or sequence underrepresentation due to misassembly results we demonstrate the utility of alpha centauri in characterizing repeat structure for alpha satellite containing reads in the hydatidiform_mole chm haploid like genome the pipeline is designed to report local repeat organization summaries for each read thereby monitoring rearrangements in repeat_units shifts in repeat orientation and sites of array transition into non satellite dna typically defined by transposable_element insertion we validate the method by showing consistency with existing centromere high order repeat references alpha centauri can in principle run on any sequence_data offering a method to generate a sequence repeat resolution that could be readily performed using consensus_sequences available for other satellite families in genomes without high_quality reference assemblies availability_and documentation and source_code for alpha centauri are freely_available atcentromeres and other heterochromatic_regions in most complex genomes are enriched with long arrays of near identical tandem_repeats known as satellite_dnas which challenge standard assembly efforts and are vastly underrepresented in genomic studies local arrangements of the fundamental repeat_unit or monomers within each satellite array are commonly organized into multi monomeric repeating_units or higher_order repeats hors these sites are observed to be highly_variable in copy_number and repeat structure providing a new and largely_uncharacterized source of sequence_variation to study in the context of sequence_evolution and biomedical_research previous_efforts to characterize repeat variants from whole_genome wgs_data relied on predictions made by short_read assembly or k_mer frequency although useful in predicting the most common repeat_unit organizations in a given genome such strategies are not designed to efficiently survey local rearrangement of repeat patterns involving variant sequence organization between adjacent repeats precise sites of inversion in arrays and transition boundaries with non satellite dna that may interrupt an array in contrast long_read analysis where a complete repeating_unit can be observed in its entirety more than once enables direct characterization of these events without assembly based_inference to automate the survey of repeat variants in quality assessed long_read datasets we developed alpha centauri alpha satellite centromeric automated repeat identification a bioinformatics pipeline for evaluating local hor structure across long_read wgs datasets when provided with long_read data and a training_dataset of repeat_units from a satellite family of interest alphacentauri is designed to predict hor patterns based on clustering discrete repeat_units on each read in doing so the user is provided with characterization of hor structure on the read defined either as regular or containing the same ordering of near identical monomers or irregular that is containing a rearrangement inversion or discontinuous spacing in monomers when compared to other hors on the same read further regions of the read that do not contain an identifiable repeat_unit are flagged to go through a secondary analysis using repbase libraries to label sites of characterized repeat insertions we demonstrate the utility of alpha centauri on wgs_data from a hydatiform mole genome chm using a collection of previously_characterized bp monomers from an at rich human centromeric satellite family known as alpha satellite
