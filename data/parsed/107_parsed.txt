data_and active_learning based information structure analysis of full scientific_articles and two applications for biomedical literature_review motivation techniques that are capable of automatically analyzing the information structure of scientific_articles could be highly useful for improving information access to biomedical_literature however most existing_approaches rely on supervised machine_learning ml and substantial labeled data that are expensive to develop and apply to different sub fields of biomedicine recent research shows that minimal supervision is sufficient for fairly accurate information structure analysis of biomedical abstracts however is it realistic for full articles given their high linguistic and informational complexity we introduce and release a novel corpus of biomedical articles annotated according to the argumentative zoning az scheme and investigate active_learning with one of the most widely used ml models support_vector svm on this corpus additionally we introduce two novel applications that use az to support real_life literature_review in biomedicine via question answering and summarization results we show that active_learning with svm trained on labeled sentences of the corpus performs surprisingly well with the accuracy of just lower than fully supervised_learning in our question answering task biomedical_researchers find relevant_information significantly_faster from az annotated than unannotated articles in the summarization task sentences extracted from particular zones are significantly more similar to gold_standard summaries than those extracted from particular sections of full articles these results demonstrate that active_learning of full articles information structure is indeed realistic and the accuracy is high enough to support real_life literature_review in biomedicine availability the annotated corpus our az classifier and the two novel applications are available attechniques that can help biomedical_scientists access information in the rapidly_growing body of biomedical_literature are much needed especially those capable of automatically identifying specific types of information in literature e g information related to the methods or results used in different studies can be particularly helpful we focus on techniques that aim to identify the discourse or information structure of scientific documents because such techniques have yielded promising results and have proved to benefit important tasks such as information_extraction summarization and scientific literature_review however most existing_approaches use fully supervised machine_learning ml which requires a large body of annotated data that is difficult and costly to obtain this limits the applicability of the approaches to different domains and tasks in biomedicine a more practical approach would use only minimal supervision for the learning_process a recent experiment shows that active_learning using only a small amount of labeled data can identify the information structure of biomedical abstracts reliably however most scientific tasks require access to full_text instead full articles are considerably more complex linguistically and in terms of information structure than abstracts for example their sentences tend to be longer and their structure more complex than in abstracts including for example more frequent use of coordination negation passive and anaphora the information provided is richer and the categories of information more numerous and less evenly_distributed than in abstracts see also our analysis in section as a result information structure analysis has proved more challenging for full articles than for abstracts we will investigate whether despite these challenges weakly supervised_learning could be used to identify the information structure of full text biomedical articles with useful accuracy we focus on argumentative zoning az a scheme that describes the rhetorical progression in scientific text because it has been successfully_applied to various disciplines and tasks however as none of the az annotated full text corpora were publicly_available we developed our own corpus including biomedical articles consisting of sentences and words we use active learninga method that aims to reduce the cost of annotation by iteratively selecting the most informative instances to be labeledfor learning az of biomedical articles in our new corpus active_learning was used for az of biomedical abstracts earlier byand it has been applied to various text classification tasks e g achieving performances close to that of fully supervised_learning in this study we investigate its performance with one of the most widely used ml modelssupport vector machines svm in comparison with the related work on biomedical abstracts we deal with the complexity of full articles by performing a more detailed linguistic analysis from sentence splitting to feature_extraction by making use of features that take context information into account and by introducing a wider_range of active learning_strategies e g query bycommittee trained on labeled sentences of the corpus our method yields impressive accuracy of on full articles just lower than that of fully supervised_learning in addition we introduce two novel applications where the idea is to use az to support real_life literature_review in biomedicine we apply them to the area of cancer risk_assessment and use them for taskbased evaluation of our az approach the first application focuses on question answering we investigate whether biomedical_researchers find relevant_information faster from az annotated than from unannotated full articles the results show that the az annotations accelerate the process by making literature_review considerably faster the second application focuses on customized summarization we use the application to create customized summaries for the conclusions of full articles as many biomedical_scientists are particularly interested in these the results show that sentences extracted from the conclusion zone are significantly more similar to gold_standard summaries with higher rouge f score than those extracted from the discussion section of articles in sum our investigation shows that active_learning can yield highly_accurate results for az of full_text and that its performance is high enough to benefit real_life tasks in biomedicine we make our az annotated corpus available with this article together with our novel applications so that they can benefit further research in this area where publicly_available resources are scarce
