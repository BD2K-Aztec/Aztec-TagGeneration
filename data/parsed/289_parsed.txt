sequence_analysis analyzing marginal cases in differential shotgun_proteomics we present an approach to statistically pinpoint differentially_expressed that have quantitation values near the quantitation threshold and are not identified in all replicates marginal cases our method uses a bayesian strategy to combine parametric statistics with an empirical distribution built from the reproducibility quality of the technical_replicates availability the software is freely_available for academic use atshotgun proteomics describes a large_scale approach to analyzing complex_peptide i e mixtures originating from biological_fluids cell_lysates etc briefly the strategy is to perform protein_digestion followed by peptide chromatographic_separation online with tandem_mass ms for protein identification the study of complex_mixtures is challenging in itself because peptides are under sampled during data_acquisition by mass_spectrometry the combined nature of sample complexity data_acquisition methodologies and under sampling is bound to generate considerable experimental variation indeed one may expect to observe some additional uniquely identified proteins when comparing two technical_replicates of a complex_mixture as we demonstrate below this variation is largely due to peptide ions whose relative quantitation values lie near the detection threshold and therefore do not appear in all technical_replicates marginal cases one of the goals of proteomics is to distinguish between various states of a biological system according to protein expression differences by directly applying common statistical_approaches to pinpoint differentially_expressed without taking the necessary precautions that are inherently related to technicaleach of supplementary figures a b and c shows a venn_diagram vd of identified proteins from b and b appearing in at least one at least two and all three replicates respectively supplementary figures a and b show vds comparing uniquely identified proteins among the technical_replicates from b and b respectively both supplementary figures and corroborate the great variability claimed by the model described in section has been implemented as part of the patternlab for proteomics suite results on the biological_states to which section refers are shown in supplementary tables i and ii respectively to verify differential_expression in state b relative to state b and conversely i e reversing the roles of the two states in the discussion of section clearly proteins that are more reproducible appear in more replicates yield lower p values the resulting algorithm was also incorporated into patternlabs area proportional vd module the user can now choose between generating vds by filtering proteins that appear in at least a certain number of replicates or by using the new approach through a user specified p value the new option can be used to eliminate proteins that cannot be claimed to be statistically differentially_expressed supplementaryshows a vd that considers a p value cutoff of for the two biological_states of section instead of the replicate cutoff criterion used in supplementary
