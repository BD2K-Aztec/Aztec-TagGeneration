genome_analysis dealing with sparse_data in predicting outcomes of hiv combination_therapies motivation as there exists no cure or vaccine for the infection_with hiv the standard approach to treating hiv patients is to repeatedly administer different combinations of several antiretroviral_drugs because of the large number of possible drug_combinations manually finding a successful regimen becomes practically impossible this presents a major_challenge for hiv treatment the application of machine_learning for predicting virological responses to potential_therapies is a possible approach to solving this problem however due to evolving trends in treating hiv patients the available clinical datasets have a highly unbalanced representation which might negatively_affect the usefulness of derived statistical_models results this article_presents an approach that tackles the problem of predicting virological_response to combination_therapies by learning a separate logistic regression_model for each therapy the models are fitted by using not only the data from the target therapy but also the information from similar therapies for this purpose we introduce and evaluate two different measures of therapy similarity the models are also able to incorporate phenotypic knowledge on the therapy outcomes through a gaussian prior with our approach we balance the uneven therapy representation in the datasets and produce higher quality models for therapies with very few training samples according to the results from the computational_experiments our therapy similarity model performs significantly better than training separate_models for each therapy by using solely their examples furthermore the models performance is as good as an approach that encodes therapy information in the input feature_space with the advantage of delivering better results for therapies with very few training samples availability code of the efficient logistic_regression is available fromthe human_immunodeficiency hiv targets the human immune system and leads to the acquired_immunodeficiency aids that has a high mortality_rate being a disease that to whom correspondence should be addressed claimed more than million lives since its discovery in aids is highly ranked on the chart of most destructive world epidemics currently there is no vaccine against hiv and there is no way of ridding hiv patients of the virus therapy administration to patients is hampered by the high evolutionary_dynamics of the virus which eventually escapes to resistance against any drug_therapy in order to prolong the time for which a therapy is effective combinations of drugs are administered to patients according to the who unaids who more than million people were infected and approximately million people were receiving_antiretroviral at the end of since every therapy eventually fails finding a successful regimen remains_a for hiv treatment whenever a therapy regimen fails a physician decides on a new regimen based on the presence of a set of resistance relevant mutations in the viral strands sampled from the patients blood_serum the large number of available drugs renders the number of potential therapy combinations too large for manual assessment thus in recent_years statistical_models for therapy outcome_prediction have been developed on the basis of clinical data these data comprise samples of many different drug combination_therapies taken from many patients over a couple of decades different therapies are represented in different abundance of samples while for some therapies many samples exist for others there are very few furthermore due to the large number of possible combination_therapies and the introduction of new antiretroviral_agents for many combinations no samples are available at all in a medical setting we strive for every therapy to be effective thus it is important to improve the quality of the prediction on these difficult to assess therapies that have very few training samples the work we present in this article is inspired by the uneven therapy representation in the clinical datasets we propose a method that tackles the problem of predicting the outcome of hiv drug combination_therapies as follows a separate model is trained for each distinct therapy combination by using not only the samples from the target therapy but also the available samples from similar therapies with appropriate sample weights in order to quantify therapy similarity we introduce two different similarity_measures the drugs kernel and the groups additivity kernel utilizing knowledge from similar therapies is particulary important for the therapy models that have very few or no examples in the available dataset since we learn separate_models for each drug_combination in order to provide efficient model_fitting and model_selection we choose the trust region newton method for training linear logistic_regression that takes_advantage of the sparsity of the data furthermore our method has the facility of integrating prior_knowledge on therapy outcomes through a gaussian prior
