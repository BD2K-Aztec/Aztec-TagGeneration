data_and rnacommender genome_wide recommendation of rna protein interactions motivation information about rna protein interactions is a vital prerequisite to tackle the dissection of rna regulatory_processes despite the recent_advances of the experimental_techniques the currently available rna interactome involves a small portion of the known rna_binding the importance of determining rna protein interactions coupled with the scarcity of the available information calls for in silico prediction of such interactions results we present rnacommender a recommender system capable of suggesting rna_targets to unexplored rna_binding by propagating the available interaction information taking_into the protein domain_composition and the rna predicted_secondary our results show that rnacommender is able to successfully suggest rna interactors for rna_binding using little or no interaction evidence rnacommender was tested on a large dataset of human rbp rna interactions showing a good ranking performance average auc roc of and significant_enrichment of correct recommendations for of the tested rbps rnacommender can be a valid tool to assist researchers in identifying potential interacting candidates for the majority of rbps with uncharacterised binding_preferences availability_and the software is freely_available rnacommender post_transcriptional is mediated by interactions between transcripts and regulatory_molecules mainly rnabinding proteins rbps and non_coding ncrnas creating ribonucleoprotein_complexes rnps rbps are one of the most numerous protein classes crucial in driving multiple complex mechanisms from splicing to translation many proteins with previously_unsuspected rnabinding properties are still being discovered increasing the range of rna interactors each rbp binds to a population of transcripts with diverse affinity and specificity recognizing rna_targets by elements of sequence or structure rbps often exert versatile roles in multiple cellular_compartments working in context with other rbps or regulatory_molecules many of the rules underlying this complexity are still unknown information about rna protein interactions is a vital prerequisite to tackle the dissection of rna regulatory_processes from an experimental point_of this field witnessed great advances initially rna protein interactions were determined with lowthroughput experimental_techniques testing the interaction of a single rbp with a single transcript the development of high_throughput techniques such as cross_linking and immunoprecipitation clip coupled with deep_sequencing allowed to identify in a in this work we proposed rnacommender a tool for rna protein interaction recommendation by representing rnas and proteins with features extracted from rna_secondary and protein_domains and combining them with existing interaction information we enabled the recommendation of targets for rbps with little or no experimental_evidence of interaction we validated rnacommender on a large dataset of human rbp rna interactions showing an overall good ranking performance average auc roc of and a significant_enrichment in correct targets in the top predictions for of the tested rbps considering the successful results obtained by rnacommender we also recommended rna_targets to rbps with low_throughput evidence from and completely unknown_proteins from the recommendations are available as supplementary data surely the complexity of rna regulation requires further efforts to optimise the predictions but our tool can be a valid companion to assist experimental research especially for the majority of rbps whose interactors have not yet been experimentally_identified in future work we will address the integration of the interactions suggested by rnacommender with other tools to provide a more robust and comprehensive analytical pipeline in particular we plan to localise the interaction sites within the rnas leveraging graphprot models and to integrate interaction predictions within the ptrcombiner system in order to improve the identification of groups of rbps binding similar sets of targets
