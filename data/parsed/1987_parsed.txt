genome_analysis gene_set is severely biased when applied to genome_wide data motivation dna_methylation is an epigenetic mark that can stably repress gene_expression because of its biological and clinical_significance several methods have been developed to compare genome_wide patterns of methylation between groups of samples the application of gene_set to identify relevant groups of genes that are enriched for differentially_methylated genes is often a major component of the analysis of these data this can be used for example to identify processes or pathways that are perturbed in disease development we show that gene_set as it is typically applied to genome_wide assays is severely biased as a result of differences in the numbers of cpg_sites associated with different classes of genes and gene_promoters results we demonstrate this bias using published_data from a study of differential cpg_island in lung_cancer and a dataset we generated to study methylation changes in patients with long_standing ulcerative_colitis we show that several of the gene_sets that seem enriched would also be identified with randomized data we suggest two existing_approaches that can be adapted to correct the bias accounting for the bias in the lung_cancer and ulcerative_colitis data_sets provides novel biological_insights into the role of methylation in cancer development and chronic_inflammation respectively our results have significant implications for many previous genome_wide studies that have drawn conclusions on the basis of such strongly biased analysis microarrays and high_throughput are frequently used to assess the methylation status of cpg_sites and cpg islands genome_wide array platforms for this purpose have been developed by agilent illumina and nimblegen and several high_throughput based_methods have also been developed such as genome_wide bisulphate sequencing medipseq and help seq gene_set gsa is frequently used to discover meaningful biological patterns from lists of genes generated from highthroughput experiments including genome_wide studies the objective is typically to identify similarities between the genes with respect to annotations available from sources such as the gene_ontology go or kyoto_encyclopedia kegg popular tools for this purpose include gostats and david a significant result for a gene_set is interpreted as evidence that the corresponding biological_function or process is affected in the experimental_condition or treatment a key assumption of gsa methods is that all genes have a priori the same probability of appearing in the list if this is not true that is if certain classes of genes are more likely to appear in the list regardless of the treatments or conditions being investigated this has the potential to cause misleading_results from gsa the application of gsa to lists of genes found to be differentially_expressed between groups of samples using rna_seq is known to be affected by such a bias this is because there is more power to detect changes in expression for genes with higher numbers of mapped sequence_reads consequently longer and more highly_expressed which tend to have more mapped_reads are more likely to be identified as differentially_expressed the lengths and expression levels of genes frequently differ between gene_sets resulting in some gene_sets wrongly appearing to be enriched among the differentially_expressed a method to correct this bias has already been developed however the application of gsa is not restricted to the results of highthroughput gene_expression the same approach is used for many other high_throughput experiments a similar issue has also been highlighted in chip_seq when distal binding_sites are included in the analysis in this case gsa may be confounded when genes in different gene_sets are represented by different proportions of the genome developed great a tool that can take account of these differences by using a binomial_test over a user_defined set of genomic_regions however great is not suitable for analysis of methylation data as it cannot differentiate between to whom correspondence should be addressed one gene in a set with many highly differentially_methylated or many genes in the same set with one highly differentially_methylated cpg_site each this distinction is important in studies of dna_methylation because there are many cases where methylation of only one cpg_site has been shown to perturb expression for example hence great has not been applied to data of this type here we focus on the application of gsa to the results of high_throughput dna_methylation experiments we show that gsa as it is typically applied to dna_methylation data is severely biased and show that methods that have previously been applied to rna_seq can be adapted to correct this bias
