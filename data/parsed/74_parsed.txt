a cod based reduction algorithm for designing stationary_control on boolean_networks motivation gene_regulatory serve as models from which to derive therapeutic intervention_strategies in particular stationary_control over time that shift the probability mass of the steady_state distribution ssd away from states associated with undesirable phenotypes derivation of control policies is hindered by the high_dimensional state spaces associated with gene_regulatory hence network reduction is a fundamental issue for intervention results the network model that has been most used for the study of intervention in gene_regulatory is the probabilistic boolean_network pbn which is a collection of constituent boolean_networks bns with perturbation in this article we propose an algorithm that reduces a bn with perturbation designs a control policy on the reduced network and then induces that policy to the original network the coefficient of determination cod is used to choose a gene for deletion and a reduction mapping is used to rewire the remaining genes this cod reduction procedure is used to construct a reduced network then either the previously_proposed mean first passage time mfpt or ssd stationary control policy is designed on the reduced network and these policies are induced to the original network the efficacy of the overall algorithm is demonstrated on networks of genes or less where it is possible to compare the steady_state shifts of the induced and original policies because the latter can be derived and by applying it to a gene gastrointestinal network where it is shown that there is substantial beneficial steady_state shift a key objective for modeling gene_regulatory is to derive intervention_strategies for beneficially altering cell to whom correspondence should be addressed dynamics to address the issue of changing the long_run behavior stochastic control has been employed to find stationary_control that affect a networks steady_state distribution ssd however owing to the inherent computational_complexity of optimal_control methods it is often infeasible to design optimal_control policies for large_networks a possible approach to complexity reduction in the finite horizon model is to use a discrete linear_model however we do not wish to be constrained to a finite horizon or a linear_model we proceed in the nonlinear case with network_dynamics described by a markov_chain even restricting ourselves to the boolean model where gene states are binary and if there are n genes in the network then there are n states and the transition probability matrix is of size n n given this level of complexity even approximation via re inforcement learning and greedy control methods are quite restricted in the size of networks they can handle for instance rather than doing a full optimization relative to some objective_function and facing the curse of dimensionality associated with dynamic_programming greedy methods utilize statistical characteristics of the network including mean first passage times mfpt and the ssd but these still require manipulating the transition probability matrix which effectively limits their use to not more that gene_networks using our current workstation computing environment this article takes the approach of reducing the size of the network designing a control policy on the reduced network and from this inducing a control policy on the full network it is motivated by a previously_proposed network reduction algorithm that removes genes in such a way that the deleted gene induces a specific collapsing of pairs of states from the state_space of the original network a more detailed discussion about the reduction mapping from that article and its comparison to the current proposed algorithm for designing stationary_control is provided in the supplementary_material while other reduction algorithms have been developed to obtain reduced models for boolean or probabilistic boolean_networks pbns to maintain either the structural consistency or the dynamical_behavior of the original network the specific intent in this article is to find a reduction strategypage we have carried_out several simulations to study the performance of the cod reduce algorithm
