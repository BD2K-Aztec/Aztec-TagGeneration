boolean approach to signalling_pathway modelling in hgf induced keratinocyte_migration motivation cell_migration is a complex process that is controlled through the time sequential feedback regulation of protein signalling and gene_regulation based on prior_knowledge and own experimental_data we developed a large_scale dynamic_network describing the onset and maintenance of hepatocyte_growth induced migration of primary human_keratinocytes we applied boolean logic to capture the qualitative behaviour as well as short_and dynamics of the complex signalling network involved in this process comprising protein signalling gene_regulation and autocrine feedback results a boolean model has been compiled from time resolved transcriptome_data and literature mining incorporating the main pathways involved in migration from initial stimulation to phenotype progress steady_state analysis under different inhibition and stimulation conditions of known key molecules reproduces existing data and predicts novel interactions based on our own experiments model_simulations highlight for the first time the necessity of a temporal_sequence of initial transient met receptor met proto_oncogene hepatocyte_growth receptor and subsequent continuous epidermal_growth integrin signalling to trigger and sustain migration by autocrine signalling that is integrated through the focal_adhesion protein we predicted in silico and verified in vitro that long_term cell_migration is stopped if any of the two feedback_loops are inhibited cell_migration and wound_healing are complex_cellular that involve keratinocytes fibroblasts blood_vessels and inflammatory_cells keratinocyte_migration plays an important role in re epithelialization and wound_healing which is a multistep cellular_process by the the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors to whom correspondence should be addressed coordination of extra and intracellular signals the precise regulation of cell_migration in its temporal_sequence activation and de activation is crucial for tissue_homeostasis in its aberrant form it can lead to scar_formation and has critical implications to cancer metastasis_formation different growth_factors such as hepatocyte_growth hgf epidermal_growth egf transforming_growth tgf keratinocyte_growth kgf and fibroblast_growth fgf that activate and regulate cell_migration have been extensively_studied in many cell_types these growth_factors have been found to overlap with mitogen_activated mapk_pathways hgf interacts and activates met receptor to induce context dependent several cellular_processes such as proliferation cell movement or morphogenic differentiation herein we focus on hgf induced migration of primary normal human_keratinocytes nhk although there is vast literature concerning hgf induced keratinocyte_migration and met receptor dynamics the dynamic interplay of initial met receptor regulation and subsequent autocrine regulation that initiate sustain and control cell_migration remain_poorly based on time resolved transcriptome_data of nhk after hgf stimulation we have previously inferred a gene regulatory model describing the decision_process of nhk cells towards migration from the model analysis it was evident that several pathways coordinate their action to initiate and sustain cell_migration upon initial hgf stimulation migration is started through the ap system and maintained after met receptor internalization by autocrine signalling through egf_receptor egfr and urokinase_plasminogen surface receptor upar the model predicted qualitatively how the temporal_sequence of transient met receptor_activation and subsequent long_term egf_receptor activity sustained the migratory phenotype however as the model was based on transcriptome_data alone there was no mechanistic explanation of the observed processes a model combining transcriptome_data with mechanistic protein signalling has been missing so_far a major_obstacle in building such a model lies in the different time scales involved in the process of cell_migration in general the transcriptome response changes over several hours while protein signalling_pathways become active within minutes upon receptorof the hgf induced keratinocyte_migration nodes are connected by directed edges where black and red connections denote activating and inhibitory_interactions respectively red nodes represent transcriptionally_regulated proteins yellow nodes are endpoints of the network and gates are denoted by blue dots and or gates are found where more than one edge connects to single_node dashed edges denote interactions that have not been considered when calculating the steady_state and are shown for completeness stimulation capturing all necessary and sufficient events on the protein signalling level including kinetic_parameters is close to impossible by current biological technology to link our prior transcriptome based model with protein signalling_pathways we present a boolean_network of hgfinduced keratinocyte_migration the boolean approach allows to derive important functional properties and predictions without the need for detailed quantitative kinetic_data and parameters in the past the approach has been successfully_applied for diverse systems such as gene_regulatory models of floral morphogenesis mammalian cell_cycle egfr signalling or apoptosis to our knowledge this is the first model for hgf induced keratinocyte_migration that incorporates protein signalling gene_regulation and autocrine feedback following cellular_dynamics from initial stimulation to the execution of the phenotype to obtain the dynamical behaviour reproducing literature knowledge and our own experimental_data we include several time scales in the model mimicking the fast activation of downstream_signalling of met mapk_erk and p jnk pathways as well as the slow transcriptome response and subsequent autocrine activation of egfr and upa receptors all of which are necessary to sustain cell_migration after met receptor internalization specifically from a logical steady_state analysis we show that priming of the hgf met receptor system is necessary for continued autocrine regulation i
