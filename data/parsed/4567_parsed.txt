the anisotropic network model web_server at anm the anisotropic network model anm is one of the simplest yet powerful_tools for exploring protein dynamics its main utility is to predict and visualize the collective motions of large complexes and assemblies near their equilibrium structures the anm server introduced by us in helped making this tool more accessible to non sophisticated users we now provide a new version anm which allows inclusion of nucleic_acids and ligands in the network model and thus enables the investigation of the collective motions of proteindna rna and ligand systems the new version offers the flexibility of defining the system nodes and the interaction types and cutoffs it also includes extensive improvements in hardware software and graphical interfaces availability_and anm is available at http anm csb the last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of studies that explore biomolecular systems dynamics using coarsegrained normal_mode prompted by the introduction and establishment of elastic network models enms enms are efficient and accurate frameworks for robust predictions of cooperative often functional movements under equilibrium conditions more recently the low_frequency modes predicted by enms were further shown to be useful in applications that extend beyond equilibrium motions such as efficient sampling of conformational_space mapping of trajectories between known states structure refinement and molecular_docking see e g a series of web_servers have been developed to assist in the evaluation of normal_modes either at atomic_level e g movies nomad ref and nmsim or at a coarse_grained level often using enms e g elnmo webnm ignm ad enm http enm lobos nih gov and promode elastic among enms the anisotropic network model anm and similar residue based spring and node models introduced years_ago have found wide_applications in molecular and structural_biology due to their simplicity yet proved successful for predicting the directions of large_scale functional motions in accord with experimental_observations despite the simple theory behind the model applying the code and exploring the results require some knowledge in command_line scripting and molecular_graphics the anm server we introduced in was also intended to fill this gap for users with little background in computational_biology it essentially allowed exploration of the dynamics in one button clickupon inputting the name of the protein_data pdb_file or coordinate files in pdb format of the structure of interest nine years later we now present an improved version anm of the server which includes alongside with hardware and software upgrades significant_improvement in the functionality and capabilities of the site in particular the extension from proteinsonly to biomolecular complexes and assemblies with dna rna and ligands
