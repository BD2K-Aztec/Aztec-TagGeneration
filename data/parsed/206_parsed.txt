alignbucket a tool to speed up 'all against all' protein sequence_alignments optimizing length constraints motivation the next_generation era requires reliable fast and efficient approaches for the accurate annotation of the ever increasing number of biological_sequences and their variations transfer of annotation upon similarity_search is a standard approach the procedure of all against all protein comparison is a preliminary step of different available methods that annotate sequences based on information already present in databases given the actual volume of sequences methods are necessary to pre process data to reduce the time of sequence comparison results we present an algorithm that optimizes the partition of a large_volume of sequences the whole database into sets where sequence_length values in residues are constrained depending on a bounded minimal and expected alignment coverage the idea is to optimally group protein_sequences according to their length and then computing the all against all sequence_alignments among sequences that fall in a selected length range we describe a mathematically optimal_solution and we show that our method leads to a fold speed up in real_world cases availability_and the software is available for downloading atall against all sequence_alignments in protein datasets are routinely performed with programs such as blast or dynamic_programming approaches by this sequences group into subsets of sequence_identity values that are important in several applications including transfer of structural and functional features between protein_sequences for details see www uniprot org program and www ebi ac uk goa electronicannotationmethods proteins that share at least some of sequence_identity may overlap in their threedimensional structures while proteins_sharing at least some of sequence_identity are likely to share also similar functions it is also important to consider the relative length of the pairwise aligned sequences before transferring annotations multidomain_proteins are less functionally conserved than single domain ones and methods based on transfer of function after homology_search can group proteins with different functions in the same cluster therefore both sequence_identity values and the percentage of overlapping positions over the alignment_length coverage were constrained in developing methods for annotation problems evolutionary_studies include alignments in the early_stage of their workflow v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com as well as different computational_methods to speed up computation considering the computational_cost the all against all similarity_search is an extremely demanding process recently in problems related to evolutionary_studies showed that by considering subsequence level homology the speed of the allagainst all alignment process could be increased by a factor of four while maintaining the possibility of retrieving homologous_sequences on the same line of research here we present an algorithm that can speed up the computational time of the similarity_search by constraining the expected alignment coverage
