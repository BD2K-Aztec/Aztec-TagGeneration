genome_analysis an integrative approach to understanding the combinatorial histone code at functional_elements the rapid advancement of genomic technology has revealed the enormous complexity and combinatorial nature of chro matin modifications to facilitate interpretation of the combinatorial nature of chromatin we have developed a novel method to integrate all chromatin datasets into distinct nucleosome types nucleosome alphabet we have applied this approach to saccharomyces cerevi siae generating a nucleosome alphabet which forms chromatin motifs when mapped back to the genome by applying novel chroma tin alignment and global word search approaches we have defined distinctive chromatin motifs for introns origins of replication trnas antisense_transcripts double_strand hotspots and dnase hypersensitive_sites and can distinguish genes by expression_level we have also uncovered strong associations between transcription_factor binding and specific types of nucleosomes our results demonstrate the uses and functionality of defining a chromatin alphabet and provide a unique and novel framework for exploring chromatin architecture the dna of all eukaryotic_organisms is organized and structured into chromatin a nucleoprotein complex through which genetic_material is structured and manoeuvred to elicit cellular_processes such as transcription cellular division differentiation and dna_repair the core component of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome which is composed of base_pairs of dna wrapped around a histone_octamer of h a h b h and h the amino and carboxyl termini of histones are susceptible to an enormous_number of post_translational covalent_modifications of which distinct modifications have currently been identified these modifications have been proposed to function by directly altering the intrinsic chromatin_structure and or by presenting or alternatively binding of chromatin modifying complexes chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip in combination with high_throughput ngs and microarrays chip_seq and chip_chip has been used to measure the occupancy of specific histone_modifications and histone variants at a genomic_scale for saccharomyces_cerevisiae a broad_spectrum of histone_modifications including but not limited to h k ac h k ac and h_k have been investigated with low_resolution bp microarrays higher_resolution bp microarrays have been used to interrogate the location of modifications such as h_k h r me a and h k ac chipseq has recently been used to map h a z h bk ub h_k and h_k in addition to chip micrococcal_nuclease mnase digestion assays have been used to map nucleosome_positioning and occupancy at near bp resolution across the yeast_genome the analysis of these datasets has been instrumental in expanding our understanding of chromatins regulatory potential however each of these genome_wide datasets is only a small portion of an extremely_complex system emerging evidence suggests that chromatin_modifications function in a combinatorial code that extends across several neighbouring nucleosomes it is therefore advantageous to examine the pattern and spacing of nucleosomes with their histone variants and modifications i e the chromatin architecture of genomic functional_elements we have integrated numerous genomic_datasets and identified the dominant nucleosome types nucleosome alphabet by their post_translational and histone variants our nucleosome alphabet has allowed us to identify chromatin motifs for genomic functional_elements including novel motifs for introns ars consensus_sequences acs trnas dnase hypersensitivity sites dhs double_strand hotspots dsb hotspots and antisense_transcripts we have also identified significant associations between transcription_factor tf_binding and specific types of nucleosomes overall our approach allows us to uncover the shared chromatin architecture across all similar functional_elements and apply traditional sequence_alignment and motif_finding algorithms to chromatin for the first time as high_throughput chromatin data are continually generated through efforts such as the encode and modencode projects it is becoming increasingly important to be able to visualize and understand how these histone_modifications interact with each other encode the importance of the combinatorial nature of chromatin can be seen in the nua complex in human a large multimeric complex that is involved in regulation of transcription cell_cycle and dna_repair this complex has seven chromatin binding_domains including two bromodomains two sant domains two chromodomains and a phd domain these domains could allow this complex to bind simultaneously to histone_tails containing methylated lysines and arginines acetylated lysines as well as deacetylated histone_tails this suggests that the targeting ofb cbf tye ste reb fkh adr gcn rpn fkh aft rcs c cbf abf phd reb swi msn gcn

arrangement of modifications across several nucleosomes and demonstrates the need for studying chromatin architecture across numerous covalent_modifications to address the difficulties_involved in interpreting multidimensional datasets we have implemented a novel method that integrates numerous chromatin datasets across a variety of platforms into a simple chromatin alphabet using our chromatin alphabet we have been able to identify chromatin motifs for functional_regions define tfnucleosome associations and uncover novel chromatin architectures for introns acs trnas dhs dsb hotspots and antisense_transcripts current approaches addressing interpretation of combinatorial covalent_modifications in the human_genome such as chomhmm and seqway show that genome_wide analysis of multiple modifications is feasible the advantage of our approach is the identification of similar functional_elements by their chromatin architecture the eventual development of blast like algorithms and identification of biologically_important chromatin attributes by sequence_alignment as the number of genomewide datasets increases our technique can be readily applied while simultaneously incorporating older datasets from a variety of platforms future applications of our chromatin sequence alphabet will allow for the development of a human chromatin alphabet using the substantial amount of data generated by the encode_project encode
