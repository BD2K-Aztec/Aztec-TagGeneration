data_and extraction of data deposition statements from the literature a method for automatically tracking research results research in the biomedical_domain aims at furthering our knowledge of biological_processes and improving human_health major_contributions toward this goal can be achieved by sharing the results of research_efforts with the community including datasets produced in the course of the research work while such sharing behavior is encouraged by funding_agencies and scientific_journals recent work has shown that the ratio of data_sharing is still modest compared with actual data production for instance found the deposition rate of microarray_data to be for work published in piwowar andshow that data deposition results in increased citation of papers reporting on data production while this to whom correspondence should be addressed should serve as an incentive to deposit data and announce it to the community in a more recent study these same authors show that data deposition is significantly associated with high profile journals and experienced researchers in the course of this work these authors have found the identification of data deposition statements to be a challenging_task that can be addressed using natural_language and machine_learning information about the declaration of data deposition in research_papers can be used in different ways first for data curation databases such as medline use accession_numbers for certain databases as metadata that can be searched with pubmed queries using thefield journals can benefit from such a tool to check whether their data deposition policies are enforced this aspect is also important for researchers looking to re use datasets and build on existing work second for the analysis of emerging_research trends the type of data produced gives indications on current important research topics in a study based on the analysis of medical_subject mesh indexing show that such metadata may be used to predict future_research trends including recommendations of main headings to be added to the mesh thesaurus our longterm research interest is in assessing the value of using deposition statements for predicting future trends of data production the initial step of automatically identifying deposition statements could then lead to an assessment of the need for storage space of incoming data in public_repositories in this study we aim at identifying articles containing statements reporting the deposition of biological data as explained above the study of data deposition has generated a growing interest in the past_few in response to a nature methods editorial describing the deposition of data such as genome_sequence or microarrays as routine used a manually built query to retrieve articles likely to report the production of microarray_data in publications they manually analyzed articles_reporting the production of microarray_data and concluded that only report deposition of microarray_data in the gene_expression geo or other databases piwowar and chapman a further studied the links existing between microarray_data deposition in public_repositories e g geo and arrayexpress and reports of data deposition in the literature they used machine_learning to build a query suitable for retrieving research_articles in pubmed central reporting on data deposition piwowar and chapman b also addressed the classification of articles at the article level for data_sharing in five databases genbank protein databank geo arrayexpress stanford microarray database the authors compared pattern matching versus machine_learning the best results were obtained with a j decision_tree on arrayexpress f measure page choice of features interestingly the difference in performance with and without component tags observed in the cross_validation was greatly magnified on the test_sets both for sentence level and articlelevel classification we think this is due to the more challenging nature of the test data in previous work e g on medline abstract sentence classification structure information has proved to be a useful feature when it is available our position feature was intended to serve as a substitute for structure information but had little impact structure information could be considered for future improvement of the sentence classifier however this information is not trivial to extract from abstracts similar issues with added complexity can be anticipated for full text portability of the method although trained mainly on microarray_data deposition statements the method adapts well to the identification of statements reporting on the deposition of other data such as gene sequences or protein coordinates this is evidenced page we presented a method to automatically identify biological data deposition statements in biomedical_text the method an svm or equivalently nb classifier using crf determined features characterizing data deposition components was able to correctly identify articles containing data deposition statements with fmeasure our analysis shows that deposition statements are scored high for all types of databases and biological data types even those not currently curated in medline this shows the potential impact of our method for literature curation in addition we believe it provides a robust tool for future work assessing the need for storage space of incoming data in public_repositories
