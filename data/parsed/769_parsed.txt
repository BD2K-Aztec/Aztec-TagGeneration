biopartsbuilder a synthetic_biology tool for combinatorial assembly of biological_parts combinatorial assembly of dna elements is an efficient method for building large_scale synthetic_pathways from standardized reusable components these methods are particularly useful because they enable assembly of multiple dna_fragments in one reaction at the cost of requiring that each fragment satisfies design constraints we developed biopartsbuilder as a biologist friendly web_tool to design biological_parts that are compatible with dna combinatorial assembly methods such as golden gate and related methods it retrieves biological_sequences enforces compliance with assembly design standards and provides a fabrication plan for each fragment availability_and biopartsbuilder is accessible at http public biopartsbuilder org and an amazon_web image is available from the aws market place ami id ami acf source_code is released under the mit_license and available for download at https dna_synthesis technologies are improving faster than moores law allowing the synthesis of genes pathways bacterial_genomes eukaryotic_chromosomes and eventually entire eukaryotic_genomes many projects have individual parts as synthetic targets such as promoters coding domains and transcriptional terminators while individual parts can be characterized predicting how parts will operate together remains a challenge rather than building a single construct therefore it can be more efficient to specify multiple alternatives for each part then use massively_parallel synthesis and assembly to generate a combinatorial_library that can be screened for the desired function in particular golden gate assembly is an efficient and effective strategy to assemble combinatorial_libraries however golden gate assembly requires a computationally_challenging design step to create standardized parts that have compatible overhangs lack pre defined restriction_sites and comply with other constraints to streamline the process of designing standardized biological_parts for golden gate assembly we developed biopartsbuilder which retrieves sequence_data from different sources and ensures compliance with design standards that are compatible with combinatorial assembly though there are tools for automated parts retrieval and subsequent primer_design for dna assembly the choices for golden gate assembly are limited compared with existing golden gate designers biopartsbuilder is distributed open_source and freely modified by both academic and commercial users biopartsbuilder also provides a repository system that stores the designed parts and shares data within members associated with the same laboratory biopartsbuilder therefore provides useful new integrated and extendable functionality for the synthetic_biology community
