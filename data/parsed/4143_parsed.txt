scell integrated analysis of single_cell rna_seq of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent_developments in single_cell transcriptomics we present scell an integrated software_tool for quality filtering normalization feature_selection iterative dimensionality_reduction clustering and the estimation of gene_expression gradients from large ensembles of single_cell rna_seq scell is open_source and implemented with an intuitive graphical_interface scripts and protocols for the high_throughput pre_processing of large ensembles of single_cell rna_seq are provided as an additional resource availability_and binary executables for windows macos and linux are available atsingle cell sequencing enables heterogeneity assessments at unprecedented_resolution at a cost comparable to sequencing a sample in bulk hundreds of single_cell datasets can instead be generated we present scell a software_tool to perform outlier filtering to normalize cell_cycle effects to select genes for dimensionality_reduction and to estimate inter sample expression gradients several groups have proposed reconstructing the gene_expression kinetics of developmental_processes from transcriptomics_data by summarizing gene_expression along the backbone of a spanning graph of the samples pca coordinates as single_cell becomes more widely_adopted the large number of available samples makes direct regression of gene_expression on pca coordinates an attractive alternative scell can regress interpolate gene_expression on pca space visualize expression gradients and estimate expression kinetics along minimum spanning trees and minimum weight paths these tools are accessible through an interactive graphical_interface
