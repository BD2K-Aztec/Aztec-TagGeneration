structural_bioinformatics probing the binding_affinity of amyloids to reduce toxicity of oligomers in diabetes motivation amyloids play a role in the degradation of b cells in diabetes patients in particular short amyloid oligomers inject themselves into the membranes of these cells and create pores that disrupt the strictly controlled flow of ions through the membranes this leads to cell_death getting rid of the short oligomers either by a deconstruction process or by elongating them into longer fi brils will reduce this toxicity and allow the b cells to live longer results we develop a computational_method to probe the binding_affinity of amyloid structures and produce an amylin analog that binds to oligomers and extends their length the binding and extension lower toxicity and b cell_death the amylin analog is designed through a parsimonious selection of mutations and is to be administered with the pramlintide drug but not to interact with it the mutations t k l k s h t k produce a stable native_structure strong binding_affinity to oligomers and long fibrils we present an extended mathematical_model for the insulinglucose relationship and demonstrate how affecting the concentration of oligomers with such analog is strictly coupled with insulin_release and b cell fitness availability_and semba the tool to probe the binding_affinity of amyloid_proteins and generate the binding_affinity scoring_matrices and r scores is available at http amyloid cs insulin and amylin molecules are co secreted from b cells in the pancreas to lower the concentration of glucose in the blood some of the amylin misfold into amyloids and do not continue to carry on their normal functions in the body in type_ii these amylin amyloids are observed to form in the extracellular_space surrounding b cells and build up into different sizes some small oligomers and others large fibrils the exact effect of the very large fibril deposits on the progression of diabetes and the inflammation of b cells is not really known however amyloid oligomers have been clearly observed to be toxic while the longer fibrils are non toxic these aggregates inject themselves into cell_membranes and create weakly selective pores that introduce an uncontrolled influx of ions into and out of the cell their short_length allows for ions to pass through them easily unlike fibrils the influx of ions is mainly due to the high concentration_gradient of calcium molecules separating the cytoplasm and extracellular_space this influx disrupts cell coupling impairs insulin_secretion depletes atp depolarizes the membrane and weakens cells inducing_apoptosis upon cell breakdown the oligomers find other live cells to target shows an illustration of amylin oligomers permeating a cell_membrane when too many amylin molecules misfold into amyloids due to insulin_resistance and extreme pressure on the pancreas to secrete insulin the required levels of amylin in the body to modulate gastric_emptying and prevent postprandial spikes in glucose_levels are not met this further complicates the conditions of type_ii patients several injectable amylin analogs have been created in an effort to find a suitable replacement for this lack of the necessary levels of amylin the most promising one pramlintide is an analog containing proline substitutions at positions and and reveals a weak tendency to aggregate pramlintide is an effective amylin replacement agent that acts as a synergetic partner to insulin pramlintide does not enter the cells of the pancreas however it moves through the circulatory system to reach necessary organs and compensates for the lack of sufficient amylin levels although pramlintide has a weaker tendency to aggregate and compensates for amylins lost functions it does not solve the problem of amyloid oligomer toxicity the inhibition of the amyloid production has been studied as a way to elongate cell life in diabetes molecules like rifampicin have been designed to prevent fibril_formation but failed to remove the short toxic oligomers that speed up the death of cells other attempts at designing inhibiting molecules include the red_wine compound resveratrol vanadium complexes polyphenols selenium containing phycocyanin molecules and n methylation of amylin many of these molecules presented strong inhibiting results that lower the rate of oligomerization in vitro and are currently undergoing more experimentation however none of them are at a stage of being produced as a therapeutic_agent in this work we explore a different technique to reduce the toxicity of oligomers instead of inhibiting fibril extension we promote it at a higher rate of amyloid aggregation longer structures are created the higher the rate the lower the concentration of oligomers and the higher the concentration of fibrils we aim to achieve this high aggregation rate by constructing a molecule that when injected into the human_body binds to these short oligomers and extends their length promoting aggregation and forcing them into long nontoxic fibrils a circumspect approach to create such molecule that does not perform unknown and undesirable interactions in the body is to engineer the molecule as an amylin analog with a parsimonious selection of mutations to perform the task we construct this molecule as an analog of high amyloidogenicity to have very strong binding_affinity to the amyloids and to have an extremely_low dissociation rate the low dissociation rate is essential in preventing the emergence of more short oligomers through fibrils breaking up this analog is designed to be administered with the pramlintide drug in a native non amyloid form the analog is engineered to have a low_binding to pramlintide to prevent inducing pramlintide to misfold to conserve structure the analog is designed through a parsimonious selection of mutations moreover we compare the aggregation potential and stability of our top findings with state of the art tools foldx zyggregator pasta and tango to increase confidence in our selection we introduced the method to compute r scores of basm in the methods section and described how they can be used to engineer an injectable amylin analog that binds well to amyloids in the pancreas while preventing pramlintide from misfolding supplementaryshows the r scores that we generated for all the residue positions of amylin amyloid and supplementaryshows the r scores for pramlintides amyloid residues in we solve for the sequence s with optimal binding_affinity to basm b for various a and b values setting a fixed b value and increasing a doesnt drastically change the sequence s suggesting that the residues of s possess a strong binding_affinity to amylin we proceed with sequence s generated by a and b this sequence encompasses a binding_affinity to amylin that is twice as large as the repelling forces to pramlintide
