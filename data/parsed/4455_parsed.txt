structured sparse canonical_correlation for brain imaging_genetics an improved graphnet method downloaded from motivation structured sparse canonical_correlation scca models have been used to identify imaging genetic_associations these models either use group_lasso or graph guided fused_lasso to conduct feature_selection and feature grouping simultaneously the group_lasso based_methods require prior_knowledge to define the groups which limits the capability when prior_knowledge is incomplete or unavailable the graph guided methods overcome this drawback by using the sample correlation to define the constraint however they are sensitive to the sign of the sample correlation which could introduce undesirable bias if the sign is wrongly estimated results we introduce a novel scca model with a new penalty and develop an efficient optimization_algorithm our method has a strong upper_bound for the grouping effect for both positively and negatively_correlated features we show that our method performs better than or equally to three competing scca models on both synthetic and real_data in particular our method identifies stronger canonical correlations and better canonical loading patterns showing its promise for revealing interesting imaging genetic_associations sparse canonical_correlation scca is a powerful bi multivariate_analysis technique it has recently become a popular method in brain imaging_genetics studies to identify bi multivariate associations between single_nucleotide snps and imaging quantitative_traits qts scca was initially proposed byand witten andin the analysis of gene_expression data this first scca model introduced the norm lasso term into the traditional cca model to make both canonical loadings sparse the penalized matrix decomposition pmd technique was used to solve this sparse learning_problem for a group of correlated features lasso tends to randomly select only one feature from the group and often cannot recover all the relevant and correlated features and witten and tibshirani also proposed the fused_lasso based scca which takes_into the spatial_correlation among features thus neighboring features tend to be selected together to help discover regional structures in order to accommodate other types of structures in the data several structured scca methods arise recently we group these scca methods into two kinds according to their distinct regularization terms one kind used the group_lasso penalty and the other kind used the graph networkguided fused_lasso penalty to conduct feature_selection and feature grouping the first kind i e the group_lasso based scca required prior_knowledge to define the group structure incorporated the priori_knowledge into the scca model with a group_lasso regularizer where the same pmd technique was used to identify non overlapping group structure proposed s cca using group_lasso and incorporated both the covariance_matrix information and the priori_knowledge information to discover group level bi multivariate associations the kg scca was an extension of s cca which also employed the group_lasso to constrain one canonical loading this type of scca methods may not be useful when the biological priori_knowledge is incomplete or unavailable of note it is a hard task to provide precise prior_knowledge in real biomedical_studies the second kind of structured scca methods use graph network guided fused_lasso penalties these methods can perform well on any given priori_knowledge in case the prior_knowledge is not available these methods can also work via using the sample correlation to define the graph network constraint proposed sscca using a graph guided fused norm penalty for one canonical loading of the taxa based on their relationship on a phylogenetic_tree proposed a network guided fused_lasso based scca which penalized every pair of features by the norm of u i u j it could be viewed as an extension to the fused_lasso based scca without demanding the features being ordered proposed gn scca which penalizes the norm of u i u j these two scca methods could only handle the positively correlated features proposed an improved network structured scca ns scca by incorporating the sign of the sample correlation within features ns scca penalized the norm of u i signq ij u j to tune a similar weight value for u i and u j if q ij or dissimilar if q ij the aforementioned kg scca employed norm of u i signq ij u j on one canonical loading most of these scca methods used the data_driven correlation as the network constraint while some incorporated prior_knowledge to define the network constraint in the data_driven mode they were dependent on the sign of the pairwise sample correlation to identify the hidden structure pattern unfortunately this can introduce additional estimation bias since the sign of the correlations can be wrongly estimated due to possible graph network misspecification caused by noise we focus on the data_driven mode in this paper we first propose a novel structured penalty using the pairwise difference of absolute_values between features which is an improved graphnet penalty then we introduce our novel structured scca model coupled with an effective scca algorithm i e scca using the absolute value based graphnet agn_scca our contributions are summarized as follows i the new regularizer penalizes the difference between the absolute_values of the coefficients no matter whether their correlations are positive_or thus it could tune both positively and negatively_correlated features to have similar weights despite the correlation signs ii agn_scca could reduce estimation bias due to its independence to the signs of sample correlation and thus has better performance and generalization ability than those methods dependent on sample correlation signs iii we provide a quantitative upper_bound for the grouping effect of agn_scca and prove that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge fast iv on both synthetic and real imaging genetic data agn_scca yields higher or comparable correlation_coefficients and generates more accurate and cleaner patterns than three competing_methods i e l scca cca with lasso flscca cca with fused_lasso and ns scca we have proposed a novel structured regularization term using the pairwise difference between absolute_values of two weights and incorporated it into a scca framework this proposed structured scca model named as agn_scca aims to discover any group or network_structure laying behind the data we have demonstrated that agn_scca has strong upper_bound of grouping effect and have developed an iterative procedure with proven convergence the existing structured scca methods either use the group_lasso or the graph netwrok guided fused_lasso to model the structure information the first type of methods rely on prior_knowledge to define the group structure and the prior_knowledge is sometimes unavailable in real applications the latter type of methods can perform well on any given priori_knowledge in case the prior_knowledge is not available these methods can also work via using the sample correlation to define the graph network constraint however they depend on the sign of sample correlation being defined in advance which could be wrongly estimated due to possible graph network misspecification caused by noise our proposed scca is different from those previously_published ones in the following aspects i agn_scca employs a novel absolute value based graphnet penalty and it does not require to estimate the sign of sample correlation ii the agn_scca could tune positively correlated features as well as negatively_correlated ones to have similar weights despite the correlation signs iii agn_scca has a strong theoretical upper_bound for the grouping effect and the corresponding algorithm is guaranteed to converge fast we have compared agn_scca with three competing scca methods with different penalty functions including l scca flscca and ns scca using both synthetic data and real imaging_genetics data the experimental_results demonstrate the following i for the estimated correlation_coefficients agn_scca obtained the best or comparable results on the synthetic data and significantly_outperformed the competing_methods on the real_data ii for the estimated canonical loadings agn_scca yielded better canonical loading pattern on both synthetic data and real_data especially on the real_data where it produced much cleaner patterns than the competing_methods by discovering a strong association between the apoe snp data and the amyloid accumulation data in an ad study agn_scca demonstrated itself as a promising structured scca method the theoretical convergence and upper_bound of the grouping effect further reveal that agn_scca is of efficiency and effectiveness in identifying meaningful bi multivariate associations in brain imaging_genetics studies in this work we only tested agnthe best value and those that are not significantly_worse t test with p value smaller than are shown in boldface scca while using data_driven covariance_structure as the graph network constraint in the future we will apply the agn_scca model to more general cases and test its performance when priori_knowledge is available
