genetics_and identifying quantitative_trait via group sparse multitask regression and feature_selection an imaging_genetics study of the adni cohort motivation recent_advances in high_throughput and brain imaging_techniques enable new approaches to study the influence of genetic_variation on brain_structures and functions traditional association studies typically employ independent and pairwise univariate_analysis which treats single_nucleotide snps and quantitative_traits qts as isolated units and ignores important underlying interacting relationships between the units new methods are proposed here to overcome_this results taking_into the interlinked structure within and between snps and imaging qts we propose a novel group sparse multi task regression and feature_selection g smurfs method to identify quantitative_trait for multiple disease_relevant qts and apply it to a study in mild_cognitive and alzheimers_disease built upon regression_analysis our model uses a new form of regularization group norm g norm to incorporate the biological group structures among snps induced from their genetic arrangement the new g norm considers the regression_coefficients of all the snps in each group with respect to all the qts together and enforces sparsity at the group level in addition an norm regularization is utilized to couple feature_selection across multiple tasks to make use of the shared underlying mechanism among different brain_regions the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by both clearly improved prediction_performance in empirical evaluations and a compact set of selected snp predictors relevant to the imaging qts imaging_genetics is an emergent transdisciplinary research field where the associations between genetic_variations and imaging measures as quantitative_traits qts or continuous phenotypes are evaluated compared to casecontrol status the qts have increased statistical_power and are closer to the underlying biological etiology of the disease making it easier to identify underlying genes genome_wide gwas have been increasingly performed to correlate high_throughput single_nucleotide snp data to large_scale image data while many studies employed a hypothesis driven approach by making significant reduction in one or both data types some recent_studies examined these associations at the whole_genome entire_brain level pairwise univariate_analysis was typically used in traditional association studies to quickly provide important association information between snps and qts however it treated the snps and the qts as independent and isolated units and therefore the underlying interacting relationships between the units might be lost multivariate_methods to examine joint_effect of multilocus genotype on a single phenotype were studied in general genetic_association as well as several recent imaging genetic_studies this paradigm did not consider the relationship between interlinked brain phenotypes and thus still had limited_power in revealing complex imaging genetic_associations in this work taking_into the interrelated structure within and between snps and qts we propose a new framework for effectively identifying quantitative_trait which addresses the following challenges in imaging_genetics association study first traditional association studies consider all the snps evenly_distributed and assess each snp individually however certain snps are naturally connected via different pathways multiple_snps from one gene often jointly carry out genetic functionalities moreover page
