sequence_analysis identification of transcription_factor from chip_seq at high_resolution motivation chromatin_immunoprecipitation coupled to next_generation chip_seq is widely used to study the in vivo binding_sites of transcription_factors tfs and their regulatory_targets recent improvements to chip_seq such as increased resolution promise deeper insights into transcriptional_regulation yet require novel computational_tools to fully leverage their advantages results to this aim we have developed peakzilla which can identify closely_spaced tf_binding at high_resolution i e resolves individual binding_sites even if spaced closely as we demonstrate using semisynthetic datasets performing chip_seq for the tf twist in drosophila_embryos with different experimental fragment sizes and analyzing chip exo datasets we show that the increased resolution reached by peakzilla is highly_relevant as closely_spaced twist binding_sites are strongly enriched in transcriptional enhancers suggesting agene expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level and achieved through the binding of transcription_factors tfs to genomic regulatory_regions called promoters and enhancers chromatin_immunoprecipitation chipseq is extensively used to determine transcription_factor tfbss genome_wide compared with chip_chip chip_seq has dramatically improved the resolution of the identified tfbss from hundreds to only tens of nucleotides a recent refinement of chip_seq the chip exo method further increases the resolution of chip_seq theoretically to single nucleotides the specific features and strategies of tf chip_seq analysis have been well described by several reviews e g and protocols e g briefly as typically only one of both ends of the immunoprecipitated dna_fragments is sequenced the sequencing_reads or tags result in a bimodal_distribution that is characteristic for true tfbss this distribution is typically used to estimate the average size of the fragments which subsequently allows the prediction of tfbss across the genome many computational_tools have been developed and are successfully used to predict such binding_events however in our experience these tools are not optimized to take advantage of recent methodological improvements which comprise paired_end high sequencing_depth e g on illumina_hiseq systems andmost importantlyan increase in experimental resolution both of conventional chip_seq and of chip exo available tools typically merge closely_spaced read density peaks into large regions which is preferable when analyzing certain chromatin features that mark extended regions e g histone_modifications but means that the ability to distinguish i e resolve individual closely_spaced tfbss is lost high_resolution and precision i e the correct prediction of the tfbss exact locations as measured for example as the distance from the inferred tfbs the reported peak summit to the tfs sequence_motif are crucial when determining individual tfbss e g as promoter and enhancer regions often consist of multiple tfbss for the same tf homotypic tfbss clusters or different tfs thus to fully leverage current chip methodologies toward understanding the structure and function of enhancers the ability to determine multiple closely_spaced tfbss is critical to meet this need we developed a new computational_tool peakzilla which fully exploits the bimodal_distribution of sequence_reads characteristic of true tf binding_events to identify closely adjacent tfbss with high_resolution and precision peakzilla is not meant for the identification of broad enriched regions e g histone_marks for which we recommend using macs or similar programs to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as we evaluate peakzilla by comparing it with three widely used peak_finders of the first generation such as macs quest and cisgenome as well as four methods developed more recently for the detection of high_resolution peaks such as spp sissrs gps and peakranger peakzilla shows superior resolution and precision on conventional chip_seq from saccharomyces_cerevisiae caenorhabditis_elegans drosophila_melanogaster mouse and human and on recent chip exo datasets we also specifically test the resolution limits of each method using semisynthetic chip_seq and show experimentally that peakzilla fully reflects increased experimental resolution by performing chipseq experiments for twist in d melanogaster at normal medium and high_resolution these results suggest that peakzilla is best suited for the identification of tfbss with recent chip methods understanding how combinations of tfs bind to dna to regulate_gene is one of the most pressing questions of todays biology its importance is witnessed by recent community efforts that aim to determine all functional_elements in the genomes of model_organisms and the human e g encode encode_project modencode mouse encode mouse encode the availability of high_throughput at low_cost widely promoted the use of the chipseq methodology and an enormous_number of datasets for different tfs from various species developmental_stages or tissues are becoming available this enables the identification of in vivo binding_sites and thus enhancers that contain multiple binding_sites for a single tf or multiple different tfs while it is widely_accepted that enhancers are characterized by clusters of tf_binding it has remained less clear to what extent each of several clustered tf_binding is bound in vivo yanezyanyanez similarly potential constraints on the relative_distance or orientation of co bound tfs have remained_unclear yet might be crucial to understand_the and to decipher the sequence basis of gene_regulation yanezyanyanez to experimentally address_this it is important to resolve closely_spaced binding_sites and precisely predict their location from chip_seq challenges that current improvements to the chip methodology have started to address e g chip exo however while many computational_tools exist to identify enriched regions peaks from chip data peak_calling many of them are not designed to fully leverage these improvements e g the increased resolution or the vastly increased number of deep sequencing_reads of modern deep_sequencing to meet these challenges especially the need for discovering tfbss at highresolution we have developed a new computational_method peakzilla the importance of high_resolution and precision is also supported by alternative efforts to correctly position predicted tfbss for example by taking the location of enriched sequence_motifs into account although tfbss predicted by peakzilla coincide well with the known sequence_motifs of the respective tfs it is important to note that we chose to predict the tfbs locations from the chip_seq alone without taking sequence_motifs into account it is well established that within tfbss motifs for different tfs can be more highly_enriched in tfbss than motifs for the precipitated tf itself for example the binding_sites of most tfs in the early drosophila embryo are highly_enriched in motifs for the tf zelda such that the zelda motifwhich is sometimes more highly_enriched than the motif of the tf of interestmight bias the correct prediction of the tfbss and possibly hinder the study of relative positioning and orientation of tfbss the combination of maximum experimental resolution and a peak caller like peakzilla thus makes full use of recent chip_seq approaches and will be invaluable for testing hypotheses on how combinatorial tf_binding realizes the developmental blueprint encoded in the regulatory_regions of our genomes indeed closely_spaced twist binding_sites resolved by peakzilla coincided and were strongly enriched in known enhancers corroborating the prevalent model that functional enhancers are characterized by clusters of tfbss the increasing number of chip studies that determine the in vivo binding_sites of tfs at high_resolution will prove invaluable for our understanding of enhancer_function and transcriptional_regulation
