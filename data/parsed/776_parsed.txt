bioruby bioinformatics software for the ruby programming_language the bioruby software toolkit contains a comprehensive set of free development tools and libraries for bioinformatics and molecular_biology written in the ruby programming_language research in molecular_biology depends critically on access to databases and web_services the bioruby project was conceived in to provide easy access to bioinformatics resources through free_and tools and libraries for ruby a dynamic open_source programming_language with a focus on simplicity and productivity www ruby lang org the bioruby software components cover_a of functionality that is comparable to that offered by other bio projects each targeting a different computer programming_language such as bioperl biopython and biojava bioruby software components are written in standard ruby so they run on all operating_systems that support ruby itself including linux os x freebsd solaris and windows with jruby bioruby to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as also can run inside a java virtual_machine jvm allowing interaction with java applications and libraries like cytoscape for visualization both bioruby and ruby are used in bioinformatics for scripting scripting against applications modelling analysis visualization and service integration the web development framework ruby on rails is used to create web_applications and web_services bioruby provides connection functionality for major web_services such as the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg see example in and the togows service which provides a uniform web_service front end for the major bioinformatics databases the bioruby source tree contains over documented classes public methods and unit test assertions source_code is kept under git version control which allows anyone to clone the source tree and start submitting we have found that git substantially lowers the barrier for new people to start contributing to the project in the last years the source tree has gained people tracking changes and people cloned the repository the bioruby project is part of the open bioinformatics foundation which hosts the project website and mailing list and organizes the annual bioinformatics open_source conference together with the other bio projects a number of bioruby features support bio cross project standards such as the biosql relational model for interoperable storage of certain data_objects or their implementation is coordinated across the bio projects including support for the fastq and phyloxml data_exchange formats the bioruby software toolkit provides a broad range of functionality for molecular_biology and easy access to bioinformaticsobject sequence pathway tree bibliography reference_sequence manipulation translation alignment location mapping feature table molecular_weight design sirna restriction_enzyme format genbank embl uniprot kegg pdb medline rebase fasta fastq gff msf abif scf gcg lasergene geo soft gene_ontology tool blast fasta emboss hmmer interproscan genscan blat sim spidey meme clustalw muscle mafft t coffee probcons phylogeny phylip paml phyloxml nexus newick web_service ncbi ebi ddbj kegg togows psort targetp pts sosui tmhmm obda biosql biofetch indexed flat files refer to www bioruby org for an explanation of all acronyms after installing bioruby the bioruby command starts the interactive shell with the bfind command the kegg module database is queried for entries involved in the metabolic cytrate cycle or tricarboxylic_acid the purple and blue colours in input and output reflect two modules in the carbon oxidation pathway the user loads and confirms entries by using flatparse and pathways commands next kegg orthology database ids are fetched and the colours are assigned to enzymes in each module finally kegg generates the coloured image of the cytrate cycle pathway and the image is saved locally resources bioruby is written in ruby a dynamic programming_language with a focus on simplicity and productivity which targets all popular operating_systems and the jvm the bioruby project is an international and vibrant collaborative software initiative that delivers life_science programming resources for those researchers who want to benefit from the productivity features of the ruby language as well as from the larger ruby ecosystem of reusable open_source components
