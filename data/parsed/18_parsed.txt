structural_bioinformatics a bayesian_method for d macromolecular structure inference using class average images from single_particle electron_microscopy motivation electron_cryo can be used to infer d structures of large macromolecules with high_resolution but the large_amounts of data captured necessitate the development of appropriate statistical_models to describe the data generation_process and to perform structure inference we present a new method for performing ab_initio inference of the d structures of macromolecules from single_particle electron_cryo experiments using class average images results we demonstrate this algorithm on one phantom one synthetic dataset and three real experimental_datasets atp_synthase v type atpase and groel structures consistent with the known structures were inferred for all datasets availability the software and source_code for this method is available for download from our website http compbio cs toronto edu cryoem contact single_particle electron_cryo has achieved remarkable success in determining d structures of macromolecules at resolutions close to atomic scales some of the protein_structures recently determined at high resolutions using this modality include bacteriophage at groel at and cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus and rotavirus at these experiments used a large amount of data knowledge of the symmetry of these structures and an approximate initial model of the structure to achieve this high_resolution however successful d inference of asymmetric structures and symmetric structures with unknown symmetries still remains_a in the absence of an initial model in this article we present a general method for creating an initial to whom correspondence should be addressed model typically referred to as ab_initio d inference that can be used to create high_resolution structures before we describe our method we first briefly describe the typical data analysis steps in performing d inference using single_particle images the reader is referred elsewhere for a detailed_review of the various analysis steps in the data_processing pipeline electron_micrographs are electron optic images of the biological_sample recorded on a charge_coupled or on film these images contain projections of hundreds to thousands of copies of the macromolecule in different and unknown orientations which may or may not be uniform over the space of rotations however the projections are convoluted with the point_spread of the microscope and corrupted by noise before a d structure can be estimated these large micrograph images must be preprocessed to select the subsections of the images that correspond to the projections of the individual macromolecules or particles under study extensive research has been conducted on achieving this goal called particle picking using different techniques once these particle images have been extracted d structure_determination may be performed in one of the two main ways depending on the availability of a prior low_resolution model of the macromolecule with an initial model the particle images that have been picked are used to generate a higher_resolution model through a process called refinement to do so the orientations of the noisy particle images with respect to the initial model are first determined and then these orientations are used to generate a high_resolution model several methods have been developed to determine the orientations of particle images with respect to a model in the projection matching technique projections of the model at different orientations are computed and the particle images are matched to these projections to determine their orientation frealign uses a signal_to weighted correlation_coefficient between the fourier_transform of the particle images and the corresponding central slice of the fourier_transform of the d model to determine the orientation of particles maximum likelihood_based procedures have also been developed for aligning particles to multiple d and d references these methods have the added advantage that the refinement of the d references or d models is performed_simultaneously with the alignment we have shown above that our method performs reasonably well in discovering d models from class average images for five different systems here we give insight into our motivations for the choices made in different components of the algorithm and provide some guidance on how ab_initio models may be created for novel systems using our method
