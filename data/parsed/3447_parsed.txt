pathtext a text_mining integrator for biological_pathway visualizations motivation metabolic and signaling_pathways are an increasingly important part of organizing knowledge in systems_biology they serve to integrate collective interpretations of facts scattered throughout literature biologists construct a pathway by reading a large number of articles and interpreting them as a consistent network but most of the models constructed currently lack direct links to those articles biologists who want to check the original_articles have to spend substantial_amounts of time to collect relevant_articles and identify the sections relevant to the pathway furthermore with the scientific_literature expanding by several thousand papers per week keeping a model relevant requires a continuous curation effort in this article we present a system designed to integrate a pathway visualizer text_mining systems and annotation tools into a seamless environment this will enable biologists to freely move between parts of a pathway and relevant sections of articles as well as identify relevant papers from large text bases the system pathtext is developed by systems_biology institute okinawa institute of science and technology national centre for text_mining university of manchester and the university of tokyo and is being used by groups of biologists from these locations contact brian monrovian com the core of systems_biology is the biochemical signaling_network signaling and metabolic_pathways are an increasingly important part of organizing knowledge in systems_biology and are often represented through collective interpretations of facts scattered throughout literature because of the very integrated nature of pathways they require substantial human effort to construct biologists have to read a large number of published_papers interpret them and construct a pathway the curation of a constructed pathway also requires monitoring of recent_publications in order to maintain relevance furthermore since biologists may have different interpretations of the same set of facts a biologist wants to read original papers based on which a pathway is constructed to ensure to whom correspondence should be addressed it is done in a manner consistent with his or her interpretation the biologist would like to see the biological_context stated in original papers from which the constructed pathway abstracts away pathtext http www pathtext org is an integrated environment for combining standards compliant biological pathway_models and original papers relevant to selected parts of the pathway through the use of text_mining tm technology and tools to facilitate the creation of manual annotations unlike existing pathway building platforms such as wikipathways the edinburgh pathway editor and pathcase pathtext brings together the strengths of different tm tools in a unified and extensible framework some of the existing pathway editors offer the functionality of linking parts of a pathway with literature at a very coarse e g pubmed id level perhaps one of the most similar to pathtext in terms of the richness of tm functionality combined with pathway visualization is pathway studio which is a commercial tool for building and analyzing biological_pathways it integrates an automated text processing tool called medscan to extract biological_interactions from scientific_literature using natural_language nlp technology medscan employs a full syntactic parser to analyze the semantic and lexical structure of an english sentence and finds relations between any types of objects including proteins small_molecules protein functional_classes cell processes and diseases pathtext distinguishes itself from other pathway editing tools by providing a seamless combination of advanced tm technologies including deep syntactic analysis of individual sentences medie named_entity and disambiguation of acronyms kleio and real_time co occurrence searches facta it provides a flexible interactive environment which allows a biologist to navigate from pathway visualization to tm to retrieve articles recently_published which are potentially relevant to browse them and to associate them with relevant parts of pathways pathtext has been used by biologists to construct signaling_pathways of more than nodes with links in the following sections we provide the overall architecture of pathtext describe the manual_annotation and tm components describe how they are integrated with the overall system and discuss future_directions page i i i
