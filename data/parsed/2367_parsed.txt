exhibits the ability to both interpolate and extrapolate compound bioactivities to new cell_lines and tissues and although to a lesser extent to dissimilar compounds moreover our approach outperforms previous_models generated on the gdsc dataset finally we determine that in the cases investigated in more detail the predicted drug pathway associations and growth_inhibition patterns are mostly consistent with the experimental_data which also suggests the possibility of identifying genomic markers of drug_sensitivity for novel compounds on novel cell_lines cultured_cell have despite their

patternsmodelling are not new this study represents novelty in the field as to our knowledge it is the first effort to combine large_scale nci anticancer screening data using the nci panel with the available cell_line profiling information including error_bars unlike previous modelling_studies on the nci panel we simultaneously integrated the chemical_information and cell_line profiling data which enables us to predict the growth_inhibition patterns and to inter and extrapolate on the chemical and cell_line domains in addition coupling conformal prediction to the random_forest enabled the definition of ci for the individual predictions we consistently found the highest predictive signals in the gene_expression mirna and protein_abundance data the incorporation of prior_biological by summarizing the gene_expression data at the pathway level did not provide an additional predictive signal interestingly high predictive_power was attained with models trained on gene_expression data from the genes displaying the most variable transcript_levels across the cell_line panel encoding cell_lines with cell_line kernels led in some cases to models with comparable predictive_power to those trained explicitly on the cell_line profiling data although encoding cell_lines with cell_line kernels may be sufficient to model the compound pgi values from the nci panel in our view this would not be the case on datasets comprising highly dissimilar cell_lines in addition we note in particular that the dirac and mlt kernels do not permit us to extrapolate in the cell_line space likely rendering them less useful in those cases the sparseness of the cnv and exome_sequencing may be the reason for the poor model performance and therefore it remains to be seen whether the modelling of cell_line panels with more comprehensive mutational data leads to better predictions a major_challenge to the cell_line sensitivity prediction is the extrapolation of compound bioactivities to novel cell_lines and to structurally_distinct compounds we did not find significant differences in performance between the interpolation and the extrapolation to new cell_lines loco and tissues loto with mean rmse test values in all cases smaller than twice the mean uncertainty value of the bioactivity measurements this observation enables the prediction of compound activities on cancer_cell for which little bioactivity data are currently available however extrapolation is still improved by the presence of cell_lines from the same tissue ontogeny in the training_set given that similar compounds exhibit similar growth_inhibition profiles it was expected that the model performance would considerably decrease when predicting the activity of structurally dissimilar compounds this was indeed the case because mean rmse test values of approximately three times the average experimental uncertainty were obtained when extrapolating in the chemical_space locco although the error in prediction should ideally be close to the experimental uncertainty this performance may still be useful for compound prioritization previous_studies that adding physicochemical descriptors or increasing the bit string length of the morgan fingerprints set to here leads to higher predictive_power when modelling a highly_diverse set of molecules here we did not obtain higher predictive_power when increasing the bit string length when adding physicochemical descriptors to the compound fingerprints or when using morgan fingerprints in binary format our approach displays a higher predictive_ability decrease of cv rmse than the methods previously applied to the gdsc dataset supplementary text and supplementary moreover the application of our approach to the cancer_cell ccle dataset led to statistically validated models displaying r test values of which were comparable to those obtained on the gdsc and nci datasets given that gene_expression for the cell_lines comprised in the ccle and the nci panel are highly_correlated spearmans r s supplementary we suggest that pgm models trained on the nci panel could be applied to the ccle cell_line panel which could identify new purposes for the compounds considered here it is also important to consider how the cell_line sensitivity is quantified for the application of the type of model presented here fallahiapplied a multi parametric_analysis to a dataset comprising the activity of anticancer_drugs on breast_cancer the results of this study indicate that the parameters of the doseresponse curve vary systematically and depend on both the cell_line as well as the drug_class for instance the moa of a drug has a strong influence on drug efficacy e max potency ic and on the steepness of the drug response curve overall this study indicates that parameters other than the potency of the drug response curve should be considered in studies comparing drug activity as they are likely to provide crucial insights into the biology of the cell_lines response to drug treatment and into the drugs moa an additional key aspect is the consistency of the in vitro cell_line sensitivity data a previous study reported a rather low correlation of the cell_line sensitivity data from the ccle and gdsc datasets we found low concordance between the nci and the ccle sensitivity data supplementary and we did not obtain a high correlation between the predictions calculated with a model trained on the nci_data for eight drugs on cell_lines shared by the ccle and the subset of the nci cell_lines considered here actually the rmse values for these predictions against the experimental_data from the ccle and the pic values from the ccle and the pgi from the nci dataset for these eight drugs and cell_lines was comparable namely log_units indicating that high predictive_power cannot be attained given the low concordance of the sensitivity data from these two datasets these results come as no surprise given the different surrogates of cytotoxicity exploited by the assays used to screen the ccle and nci panels namely metabolic_activity and protein_abundance respectively therefore we conclude in accord with haibe that models trained on the nci data_set are likely to fail on sensitivity data measured with a different experimental_procedure e g the ccle or gdsc datasets finally although cultured_cell and primary_tumours differ genetically and d cell_lines cultures do not recapitulate the complex tumour_microenvironment investigating the extent to which gene_expression and other cell_line profiling data can be used to model in vitro cell_line sensitivity can help researchers to develop approaches for the prediction of clinical drug_responses using the genomic_data of tumour_samples
