databases_and the xeno glycomics database xdb a relational_database of qualitative_and pig glycome repertoire in recent_years the improvement of mass_spectrometry based glycomics techniques i e highly_sensitive quantitative and high_throughput analytical_tools has enabled us to obtain a large dataset of glycans here we present a database named xeno glycomics database xdb that contains cell or tissue_specific pig glycomes analyzed with mass_spectrometry based techniques including a comprehensive pig glycan information on chemical_structures mass values types and relative quantities it was designed as a user_friendly web_based interface that allows users to query the database according to pig tissue cell_types or glycan masses this database will contribute in providing qualitative_and information on glycomes characterized from various pig cells organs in xenotransplantation and might eventually provide new targets in the galactosyltransferase gene knock_out pigs era availability the database can be accessed on the web atcell surface carbohydrates can act as ligand_molecules for diverse_biological such as cellcell interaction signal_transduction metastasis and so forth especially in pig to human xenotransplantation the interaction between terminal gal gal gal r antigens onzz pig tissues or cells surfaces and circulating natural human antibodies lead to hyper acute immune_rejection despite the development of galactosyltransferase gene knock_out pigs unidentified non gal antigens remain as possible factors triggering delayed_xenograft thus the comprehensive identification of gal and non gal carbohydrate antigens from pig tissues and cells is essential for successful xenotransplantation during the past_decades several databases have been developed to assist the assignment annotation and interpretation of glycan and glycoconjugates datasets however none of them systematically classify and update the pig glycans according to the specific pig tissues and cells qualitative_and information on the glycan antigens which play_an in immune_rejection is also lacking here we have built up a relational_database xeno glycomics database xdb from specific_pathogen chicago medical_school miniature_pig glycan profiles which have been qualitatively_and characterized by various mass_spectrometry based techniques supplementary data it includes n glycomes from pig kidney endothelial_cells islets corneal_endothelial keratocytes heart and glycosphingolipid derived glycans from pig endothelial_cells and islets the o glycomes from pig kidney endothelial_cells and heart accepted are also included this specialized pig glycome database will offer a new insight into pig to human xenotransplantation as well as into many different areas of biological and biomedical_research
