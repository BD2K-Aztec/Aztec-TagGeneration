genetics_and a novel variational bayes multiple locus z statistic for genome_wide with bayesian_model averaging motivation for many complex_traits including height the majority of variants identified by genome_wide gwas have small effects leaving a significant proportion of the heritable variation unexplained although many penalized multiple_regression methodologies have been proposed to increase the power to detect associations for complex genetic architectures they generally lack mechanisms for false_positive control and diagnostics for model over fitting our methodology is the first penalized multiple regression_approach that explicitly controls type_i and provide model over fitting diagnostics through a novel normally distributed statistic defined for every marker within the gwas based on results from a variational bayes spike regression algorithm results we compare the performance of our method to the lasso and single marker analysis on simulated_data and demonstrate that our approach has superior_performance in terms of power and type_i control in addition using the womens health initiative whi snp health association resource share gwas of african_americans we show that our method has power to detect additional novel associations with body_height these findings replicate by reaching a stringent cutoff of marginal association in a larger cohort availability an r package including an implementation of our variational bayes spike regression vbsr algorithm is available at http kooperberg fhcrc org soft html population_based genome_wide have succeeded in discovering a large number of variants that individually explain a small percentage of heritability for many complex phenotypes for example when considering height in caucasian_populations over loci have been identified which cumulatively explain of the variation whereas the total estimated heritable variation is this missing or dark heritability to whom correspondence should be addressed has many purported causes including additional highly_penetrant or large effect rare alleles epistatic_interactions epigenetic variation or many uncharacterized loci of small effect in the case of height most of the additional loci recently identified are in this latter category and only reach genome_wide significance in studies with hundreds of thousands of subjects in addition predictive_models of height within the framingham_study have demonstrated that a much larger number of loci are likely contributing to variation in height though not all of these loci may reach a stringent genome_wide significance threshold also showed that the estimated heritability ascribed to height can largely be explained through observed common_variants across the genome where common_variants explained of the variation in height within an australian population of european_descent these studies demonstrate an important challenge that while evidence suggests many common_genetic driving phenotypic_variation exist our current methodologies and studies are under powered to map the location of many of these causal_variants the gwas approach of testing individual variants for association with phenotype has succeeded in producing replicable associations this success is largely attributable to both stringent type_i control after accounting for a large number of tests and the systematic correction for confounding_factors such as population_stratification complex phenotypes such as body_height with hundreds of genetic_associations could in theory benefit from a modeling_approach that tests for multiple genetic_variants simultaneously one type of solution to this problem is the use of penalized multiple regression_methods these methods can have greater_power to detect genetic_associations by including all the genetic_variants within the gwas in the model of association penalized_regression consists of estimating the additive genotypic effectsin this model y i is the phenotype x ij is the jth genotype and e i is the residual error for the ith individual penalization of is necessary to prevent model over fitting when millions of variants are being tested with only thousands of samples although each penalized regression_method proposed for gwas can have greater_power than single marker analysis none has demonstrated strict_control of fwer thus precluding their broader application in the field we propose the first penalized_regression methodology based on the variational bayes approach of that is capable of directly controlling the family_wise fwer through a variant level test_statistic z vb that is approximately n distributed under the null_hypothesis similar toand carbonetto and stephens our variational bayes spike regression vbsr approach treats the genetic effects as random with the prior this prior can be thought of as a constraint on similar to best subset selection with p controlling the sparsity of the subset solution we simplify the models proposed by who propose a three component mixture and the approach of carbonetto and stephens who propose a twocomponent mixture by using a two component mixture without the slab component see_supplementary for further details the variant level statistic z vb is derived based on the results of fitting the vbsr model we show that when p this statistic is asymptotically n under the null_hypothesis we then propose a diagnostic statistic log kl to determine the size of the vbsr best subset solution i e p p such that this empirical distribution is approximately n for the vast_majority of genetic_variants within the gwas the main assumptions of this approach are that most genetic_variants are independent of the phenotype of interest their empirical distribution under the null_hypothesis will be n and this distribution will be very sensitive to model over fitting for example if p is tuned to be too large given these conservative assumptions the innovation of this test_statistic is therefore fold not only can we demonstrate that it is possible to generate an approximately n distributed test_statistic within a multi_locus penalized_regression methodology and therefore have much tighter control of the fwer but also it is possible to use the data to suitably tune the penalized_regression methodology to ensure that this approximation is valid the z vb test_statistic provides three major practical advantages over either single marker analysis or alternative multiple locus penalized_regression approaches in the gwas setting first as demonstrated through both simulations as shown in supplementary figs s and s and the analysis of the whi share gwas of height shown in this statistic has greater_power to detect additional replicable loci beyond those that are identifiable by either a standard single marker analysis or the lasso given the phenotype is highly_heritable or the sample_size is sufficiently_large in addition while the increase in power was modest over the single marker analyses in terms of replicated associations we also see that the two associations vbsr identified on chromosome had statistically_significant correlations with the two replicated hits on chromosome the r between rs the replicated association and rs the vbsr association was p and the r between rs the replicated association and rs the vbsr association was p although the physical distance between these associations is large because of the weak statistical dependence vbsr still identifies a signal second the main innovation of the z vb statistic is that it is possible to tune vbsr such that it is approximately n distributed under the null_hypothesis this means that unlike other penalized_regression methodologies it is possible to directly control either the fwer or fdr other multiple locus penalized_regression procedures often rely on cross_validation or information criterion such as aic or bic to choose the appropriate model size and magnitude of their penalty which will not necessarily control the type_i to an arbitrary level as shown infor the lasso we demonstrated the type_i control capability of our method through a wide_range of simulations of either the null_model for independent genotypes the null features in a non null_model with independent genotypes as in or even in a non null_model with linkage_disequilibrium among genotypes as in supplementary third while a few authors have proposed a choice of penalty parameter within penalized regression_methods to asymptotically bound the type_i our approach is unique in that we demonstrate a data_driven choice of the penalty parameter the penalty parameter or alternatively p is an appropriate tuning parameter because it directly determines the evidence necessary for a given genetic_variant to be included in the model by controlling the scale of the posterior_probability of inclusion p j for all genetic_variants the posterior_probability of inclusion for a given variant is an essential aspect of the vbsr model since it determines the effect of a given genetic_variant on the overall model through the expectation e j p j j where p j implies the variant is not in the model and p j implies the variant is in the model and effectively unpenalized in general we always choose such that the empirical distribution of the z vb statistic matches very closely to the expected n null_distribution for the vast_majority of genetic_features i e up to the th_percentile for simulations or between the th and th percentiles in the dataanalysis within the study as shown in supplementary figs s and s therefore not only can we control the type_i to an arbitrary level but also we do not necessarily rely on an asymptotic argument for the choice of to ensure the validity of our choice of penalty parameter finally the vbsr methodology incorporates additional general_features beyond the choice of penalty parameters which are unique and distinguish it from alternative penalized_regression methodologies including other spike and slab approaches this includes the use of bayesian_model averaging to regularize over uncertainty in the space of identified models in addition there is theoretical evidence that spike andslab penalized_regression approaches do not suffer from the possible model_selection inconsistency of the lasso given highly_correlated predictors we see the practical consequences of this fact for m n datasets where the type_i for the lasso seem to be driven by random correlations between causal and null features as shown in even among independently sampled genetic_features finally by defining a test_statistic which is approximated by a n distribution forour vbsr methodology is a novel approach for identifying additional replicable loci within genome_wide that directly addresses the limitations of other penalized multiple_regression methodologies specifically the data_driven choice of penalty to ensure the validity of the distribution of the test_statistic and the use of a penalty with attractive theoretical model_selection properties make this a robust and practical tool for the gwas practitioner interested in identifying additional replicable associations for complex phenotypes with rich genetic architectures
