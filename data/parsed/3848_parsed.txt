genome_analysis quast quality assessment_tool for genome_assemblies limitations of genome sequencing_techniques have led to dozens of assembly algorithms none of which is perfect a number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed but none is yet a recognized benchmark further most existing_methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unse quenced species has not been adequately considered here we present quasta quality assessment_tool for evaluating and comparing genome_assemblies this tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality_metrics quast can evaluate assemblies both with a reference_genome as well as without a reference quast produces many reports summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications in this study we used quast to compare several genome_assemblers on three datasets quast tables and plots for all of them are available in the supplementary_material and interactive versions of these reports are on the quast website modern dna_sequencing cannot produce the complete_sequence of a chromosome instead they generate large_numbers of reads ranging from dozens to thousands of consecutive bases sampled from different parts of the genome genome_assembly software combines the reads into larger regions called contigs however current_sequencing and software face many complications that impede reconstruction of full chromosomes including errors in reads and large repeats in the genome different assembly programs use different heuristic approaches to tackle these challenges resulting in many differences in the contigs they output this leads to the questions of how to assess the quality of an assembly and how to compare different assemblies recently there has been a lot of work on developing comprehensive ways to compare different assemblers plantagora is a web_based aimed at helping scientists view characteristics of the most popular sequencing strategies including sequencing_platforms and assembly software for plant_genomes plantagora has a well designed interface to browse their database of evaluation results researchers may run the plantagora assessment_tool on their own assembly but the results cannot be viewed through the friendly user_interface instead the user has to parse a large log file the assemblathon competition compared de_novo assemblies on evaluation metrics the assemblathon assessment scripts are freely_available but they are highly focused on the genomes used in the competition and normal users cannot easily apply them to other genomes another freely_available genome_assembly assessment_tool is gage in it was used to evaluate several leading genome_assemblers on four datasets gage evaluates a set of metrics including different types of misassembly errors inversions relocations and translocations plantagora and gage can only be used to evaluate assemblies of datasets with a known reference_genome thus they are not suitable for evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced genomes additionally gage can only be run on one dataset at a time therefore to compare multiple assemblers on the same dataset one has to manually combine output from separate gage reports into a table we introduce quast a new assembly_quality assessment_tool quast evaluates a full range of metrics needed by various users however the number of metrics is not so large that it would become difficult_to all of them the interface and visualizations are easy to use representative and informative quast can evaluate assembly_quality even without a reference_genome so that researchers can assess the quality of assemblies of new species that do not yet have a finished reference_genome in addition quast is rather fast and its most time consuming steps are parallelized therefore it can be effectively run on multi core processors see supplementaryfor quasts performance on different genomes many assembly algorithms have been developed for the challenging_problem of genome_assembly from short_reads our new open_access quality assessment_tool quast will help scientists to assess different assembly software to choose the best pipeline for their research and it will help developers of genome_assemblers to improve their software and algorithms
