genvisr genomic visualizations in r visualizing and summarizing data from genomic studies continues to be a challenge here we introduce the genvisr package to addresses this challenge by providing highly customiz able publication quality graphics focused on cohort level genome analyses genvisr provides a rapid and easy to use suite of genomic visualization_tools while maintaining a high degree of flexibility by leveraging the abilities of ggplot and bioconductor the continued development of massively_parallel has led to an exponential_growth in the amount of genomic_data produced this growth has in turn enabled scientists to investigate increasingly_large cohort level genomic_datasets generating intuitive visualizations is a critical component in recognizing patterns and investigating underlying biological_properties in cohorts under study a significant bottleneck exists however between data generation and subsequent visualization and interpretation additionally generating publication quality figures for effective_communication of these data typically requires ad_hoc methods such as manual creation or extensive graphic manipulation with third_party software this process is both time intensive and difficult to automate reproduce further the absence of software supporting multiple species can make this process even more demanding here we present genvisr a bioconductor_package to address_these genvisr provides a user_friendly flexible and comprehensive suite of tools for visualizing complex genomic_data in three categories small variants copy_number and data_quality for multiple species of interest genvisr provides features and functions for many popular genomic visualizations not otherwise available in a single convenient package by leveraging the abilities of ggplot it confers a level of customizability not previously possible virtually any aspect of a plot can be changed simply by adding an additional layer onto the graphical object thus genvisr allows for publication quality figures with a minimal amount of required input and data manipulation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and customizability
