databases_and amass a database for investigating protein_structures motivation modern techniques have produced many sequence_annotation databases and protein_structure portals but these web resources are rarely integrated in ways that permit straightforward exploration of protein functional_residues and their co localization results we have created the amass database which maps d sequence_annotation databases to d protein_structures with an intuitive visualization interface our platform also provides an analysis service that screens mass_spectrometry sequence_data for post_translational that reside in functionally_relevant locations within protein_structures the system is built on the premise that functional_residues such as active_sites cancer mutations and post_translational within proteins may co localize and share_common functions availability_and amass database is implemented with biopython and apache as a freely_available web_server at amassour ability to read the source_code of life has produced large_databases of biological_sequences and analysis of sequence_data has given much insight into how genes and proteins work conservation at the nucleotide or residue_level has unveiled the active_sites in enzymes and important binding_motifs on proteins sequencing of tumors has also unveiled specific site mutations that affect the functions of important_signaling complementing the advances in gene sequencing mass_spectrometry has enabled routine and rapid protein sequencing this technique_enables the high_throughput discovery of protein post_translational ptms such as phosphorylation and acetylation which can dramatically alter biological_function in ways not easily predictable from the genome_sequence these ptms provide yet another layer of complexity that influences biophysical mechanisms at single residues these residue specific annotations will continue to grow in several bioinformatics databases alongside sequence informatics the field of structural_bioinformatics is well established with projects such as the protein_data pdb providing researchers with a large collection of determined protein_structures new projects such as the protein_structure initiative are dramatically increasing the coverage of this dataset by developing high_throughput crystallography techniques as the number of crystallized proteins has increased an opportunity has arisen to unify sequence_annotation data with protein_structure data to gain additional insights into the function of proteins multiple web portals have been designed that offer analysis and visualization of specific functional_residues in proteins much of this work focuses on predicting the possible function of non_synonymous snps these online_databases include snps d snpeffect de polyphen msv d and mutdb these databases focus exclusively on snps but recently new databases have been created to address the new need of characterizing the functions of ptms phospho d curates phosphosites from the phospho elm database and provides jmol jmol an_open viewer for chemical_structures in d www jmol org visualizations of these sites on individual pages another recent project is ptmfunc which extracted nearly phosphorylation acetylation and ubiquitinylation sites from several data_sources they established an impressive analysis_pipeline that attempts to predict the function of these modifications however their database does not permit visualization or query of novel sites while there is clearly a plethora of structure mapping web resources they offer a heterogeneous set of features these databases solely focus on either variants or modifications but we believe that unification of these annotations may allow researchers to gain additional insights some of these tools offer visualizations of single sites on proteins but rarely allow exploration of multiple arbitrary residues at once we believe that a better tool would enable the interactive_exploration of any set of residues simultaneously this would enable investigators to find co localized features across annotation databases that may share allosteric functions such a service would allow users to guess at the big picture of how a protein functions we have developed amass a free resource that brings together multiple_databases the uniprot knowledgebase the catalogue of somatic_mutations in cancer cosmic and the phosphosite database of ptms alongside this aggregation of these sequence level annotations our system matches searched proteins with structures from the pdb structures are to whom correspondence should be addressed visualized with the jmol viewer and sequence annotations can be interactively explored in d by clicking links within the interface with this system users can explore the annotations and physical location of any arbitrary residue the system also permits the upload of mass_spectrometry data to find possible functional_roles of thousands of queried sites by performing a search of annotated neighboring residues because our resource amasses together multiple bioinformatics databases and is rooted in the analysis of mass_spectrometry data we have named our resource amass and it can be accessed at amass db org our platform enables the exploration of proteins in an intuitive manner not possible with existing_tools we hope that amass will grow into a valuable resource for the biomedical research_community and we shall thus have a substantial roadmap of desired features planned for future releases we plan to integrate many more biological_databases to bring together more functional_annotations for example the cosmic database has given us an excellent jumpstart in providing mutational frequencies of single amino_acids however the recent release of full tumor sequencing_data from the cancer_genome hints that much more mutation data can be integrated in the coming_years as sequencing becomes cheaper our analysis system is simplistic as it only considers proximity of co localized features to infer significance our primary_focus for this system was to create an interactive_visualization as we felt that such visualization was not adequately implemented in existing platforms nonetheless existing platforms perform far more sophisticated analysis of the structural consequences of modified sites typically for snps for example polyphen and snps d both offer computerized classification of whether amino_acid changes affect function based on changing biophysical_properties such as side chain hydrophobicity charge or packing adding this deeper level of analysis in the future would improve the utility of our tool the challenge for posttranslational_modifications will be to find appropriate algorithms to assess functional consequences of these novel side_chains we have observed that many proteins in the uniprot database lack comprehensive functional_annotations especially when proteins from less studied species are queried furthermore highly_valuable feature records such as mutagenesis sites tend to be species specific because those annotations arise from academic publications that focused in a single model_organism we plan to address_this in the future by integrating a homology clustering system into amass whereby all homologous_proteins and their associated residue annotations can be visualized in alignments and simultaneously projected onto d structures this improvement poses considerable user_interface design challenges many protein_structures within the pdb have multiple proteins in complex however several distinct structures can be structurally aligned on common shared protein_sequences to elucidate other possible complexes that may exist in vivo for example a structure containing proteins a and b can be structurally aligned with a separate structure consisting of proteins b and c such an alignment may hint how proteins a and c can interact in vivo performing such alignments across all structures may expand the set of possible neighboring features that can be discovered furthermore adopting a technique similar to ptmfunc whereby conserved domains among many distinct proteins are aligned may allow greater generalization to be made for the functions of single sites with the development of amass we have a system that is capable of quickly finding functional neighbors of any queried sites this analysis however is only performed on submission of data or when the user explores a particular residue through the web_interface in the future we plan to implement algorithms that will automatically find clusters of functional_residues in each structure the challenge here is presenting the results in a format that scores and ranks identified clusters by relevance given our developed system and planned features we envision that amass will serve as a valuable_tool to the research_community at large by both enabling the understanding of datasets and the discovery and annotation of unrecognized functional sites of proteins
