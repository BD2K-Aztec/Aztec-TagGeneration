mosaicfinder identification of fused gene_families in sequence_similarity networks motivation gene_fusion is an important evolutionary_process it can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins fused genes have been identified as non transitive patterns of similarity in triplets of genes to be computationally_tractable this approach usually imposes an a priori distinction between a dataset in which fused genes are searched for and a dataset that may have provided genetic_material for fusion this reduces the genetic space in which fusion can be discovered as only a subset of triplets of genes is investigated moreover this approach may have a high false_positive and it does not identify gene_families descending from a common fusion event results we represent similarities between sequences as a network this leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification which we implemented in the python program fusedtriplets furthermore we propose a new characterization of families of fused genes as clique minimal separators of the sequence_similarity network this well studied graph topology provides a robust and fast method of detection well suited for automatic analyses of big datasets we implemented this method in the c program mosaicfinder which additionally uses local_alignments to discard false_positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points the grouping into families will help distinguish sequencing or prediction_errors from real_biological fusions and it will yield additional insight into the function and history of fused genes availability fusedtriplets and mosaicfinder are published under the gpl license and are freely_available with their source_code at this address http sourceforge net_projects mosaicfinder we implemented mosaicfinder and fusedtriplets which we used to compare the detection of composite gene_families with the existing_methods for detecting composite genes as there exists no large manually_curated database of composite genes to use as a test_bed we simulated the evolution of composite genes and composite gene_families to test the accuracy of mosaicfinder we also ran tests on real databases but we have less information on the validity of our or other methods in this context we focused our attention on the number of composite genes detected we proposed a new characterization of families of composite genes as clique minimal separators in sequence_similarity networks and implemented this method into the c program mosaicfinder we showed that on simulated_data mosaicfinder identifies conserved composite gene_families well even if mosaicfinder was not designed to do so it also identifies the evolutionary_conserved fraction of composite genes from divergent families in cases where divergent genes have evolved too much to show similarity to both component families mosaicfinder proves to have a very low false_positive we show that mosaicfinder gives good results quickly with the advantage that genes are grouped into families thus avoiding the extra work of regrouping the composite genes after they are output moreover this information may be visualized as an annotated graph using cytoscape supplementarygives an example according to our results from section mosaicfinder generates few false_positives since in the real_dataset constructed with complete prokaryote genomes mosaicfinder detected the impressive rate of one fusion_gene of genes we can conjecture that in real_data there are in fact many composite genes future work consists in breaking up long cycles with a local approach as long cycles may mask fusion families by connecting component families indirectly supplementary
