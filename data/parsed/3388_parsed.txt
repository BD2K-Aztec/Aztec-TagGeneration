sequence_analysis orman optimal resolution of ambiguous rna_seq multimappings in the presence of novel isoforms motivation rna_seq technology is promising to uncover many novel alternative_splicing gene_fusions and other variations in rna_transcripts for an accurate detection and quantification of transcripts it is important to resolve the mapping ambiguity for those rna_seq that can be mapped to multiple_loci of the reads from mouse rna_seq and of the reads from some plant rna_seq have multiple mapping loci in this study we show how to resolve the mapping ambiguity in the presence of novel transcriptomic events such as exon_skipping and novel indels towards accurate downstream_analysis we introduce orman optimal resolution of multimapping ambiguity of rna_seq which aims to compute the minimum number of potential transcript products for each gene and to assign each multimapping read to one of these transcripts based on the estimated distribution of the region covering the read orman achieves this objective through a combinatorial_optimization formulation which is solved through well known approximation algorithms integer linear programs and heuristics results on a simulated rna_seq dataset including a random subset of transcripts from the ucsc database the performance of several state of the art methods for identifying and quantifying novel transcripts such as cufflinks isolasso and cliiq is significantly_improved through the use of orman furthermore in an experiment using real rna_seq we show that orman is able to resolve multimapping to produce coverage values that are similar to the original distribution even in genes with highly non uniform coverage availability orman is available at http orman sf net contact massively_parallel rna_sequencing rna_seq technologies are replacing microarrays in determining the structure and dynamics of the transcriptome analysis of rna_seq helps to uncover many novel alternative_splicing gene_fusions and other variations in rna_transcripts unfortunately there are many rna_seq that can be mapped to several loci equally well and it is of key importance to resolve their mapping ambiguity in order to perform a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the whole rna_seq there are several mappers that can align rna_seq to a reference_genome or previously known transcript sequences owing to the presence of paralogs and homologous regions within a gene rna_seq mappers typically report a fraction of multireads i e reads that map to multiple_loci on a reference_genome based on tophat mappings on the human_reference of human rna_seq are multireads similarly of mouse and of some plant rna_seq are multireads the presence of multireads complicates the downstream_analysis such as determining alternative_splicing patterns gene_fusions and other variations the common practice for handling multireads is ignoring them in the downstream_analysis this leads to inaccurate estimation of the abundance of expressed transcripts a simple approach for determining the exact genomic location of a multiread is rescue here the initial gene_expression values are calculated based on the unique reads that map to them each multiread is then assigned to the gene with the fraction equal to the ratio between the genes initial expression value and the total expression value of all genes that the multiread maps to a more complex approach based on expected maximization em is designed to handle mapping ambiguity of a read to two or more homologous genesfor the purpose of determining the expression value of each of these genes and not to determine or quantify isoforms finally rsem isoem and ireckon are em methods based on statistical generative_models for sequencing processes to resolve mapping ambiguity to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first four authors should be regarded_as many of the above approaches are designed specially for estimating expression values of known annotated isoforms their performance is highly dependent on the completeness of the isoform database in use furthermore they cannot handle alternative_splicing such as novel exon_skipping alternative donor and acceptor_sites intron_retention and other structural_differences such as insertions_or some recent computational_approaches in particular isolasso cliiq and cufflinks can identify and quantify unknown isoforms and certain types of transcriptomic variations unfortunately neither isolasso nor cliiq takes_into multireads and cufflinks handles multireads through a simple rescue based_approach in this article we show how to resolve the multimapping ambiguity in the presence of novel isoforms involving exon_skipping intron_retention and small_indels towards accurate downstream_analysis to be mathematically precise we introduce the notion of a partial transcripta substring of a potential transcript product of a gene which satisfies certain conditions a formal definition is provided in the next section the objective of our multiread resolution approach orman optimal resolution of multimapping ambiguity of rna_seq is i to compute the minimum number of partial transcripts that cover all the multireads and ii to assign each multiread to one of these partial transcripts such that each partial transcript is covered according to the estimated local distribution we achieve the first objective approximately through a reduction to the standard set cover problem we achieve the second objective through an integer_linear formulation which we handle using available integer_linear ilp solvers such as cplex or through greedy heuristics we describe in this article we evaluate orman on both simulated and real human rna_seq for the first experiment we generate paired_end rna_seq from a random subset of transcripts from the university of california santa_cruz ucsc database with the expression distribution modelled after a real human dataset on this simulated_data we show that the performance of state of the art methods for identifying and quantifying transcripts such as cliiq cufflinks and isolasso is typically improved through the use of our multiread resolution approach notably when combined with isolasso or cliiq orman gives the most accurate and comprehensive novel isoform detection and quantification pipeline available to evaluate orman in a more real_world setting we also design an experiment using real rna_seq from a cancer patient for this experiment we implant artificial genomic repeats into several genes and compare the performance of orman with that of rescue in resolving the multireads mapping to these regions we show that on this dataset the multiread assignment by orman approximates the original distributions quite well with a maximum relative_error of
