workflow metabolomics a collaborative_research infrastructure for computational metabolomics the complex rapidly_evolving of computational metabolomics calls for collabora tive infrastructures where the large_volume of new algorithms for data pre_processing statistical_analysis and annotation can be readily integrated whatever the language evaluated on reference datasets and chained to build ad_hoc workflows for users we have developed workflow metabolomics w m the first fully open_source and collaborative online platform for computational metabolomics w m is a virtual research environment built upon the galaxy web_based technology it enables ergonomic integration exchange and running of individual modules and workflows alternatively the whole w m framework and computational_tools can be downloaded as a virtual_machine for local installation availability_and http workflow metabolomics org homepage enables users to open a private account and access the infrastructure w m is developed and maintained by the french bioinformatics institute ifb and the french metabolomics and fluxomics infrastructure metabohub metabolomics the high_throughput analysis of small_molecules in biological_samples heavily depends on data pre_processing statistical_analysis and chemical and biological annotation which are complex transdisciplinary processes involving both computation and interpretation since analytical technologies and protocols evolve rapidly computational metabolomics is a field of intensive methodological research resulting in a large_volume of proposed algorithms written in various languages making their evaluation by the bioinformatics community including reviewers and their chaining within ad_hoc workflows by experimenters difficult a few user oriented online platforms for metabolomics_data preprocessing and analysis have been described recently including meltdb metaboanalyst and xcms online there is however an v c the author published_by the w m infrastructure enables both experimental users with no specific programming_skills and advanced developers to perform cutting_edge and reproducible computational_analyses from raw_data to metabolite annotation w m can be further extended to integrate external workflows running on desktop platforms e g taverna knime or acquisition instruments the statistical modules from w m can be used to analyse other omics_data or can be combined with existing galaxy workflows e g in transcriptomics thus enabling multi omics analyses in a global systems_biology approach in the coming months modules for nmr_data preprocessing will be integrated into w m and the infrastructure will be connected to metexplore for genome_scale network_analysis w m is therefore an innovative open_source computational vre bridging the data intensive bioinformatics and metabolomics communities
