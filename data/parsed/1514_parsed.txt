easyfrap an interactive easy to use tool for qualitative_and analysis of frap data we present easyfrap a versatile_tool that assists quantitative and qualitative_analysis of fluorescence_recovery frap data functional live_cell imaging_techniques such as fluorescence_recovery frap exploit the properties of fluorescent_proteins coupled with modern microscopy systems and are increasingly used to visualize track and quantify molecules in living_cells like all photobleaching methods frap involves the irreversible bleaching of emitted light from molecules tagged with a fluorescent protein during a typical frap experiment a defined region of interest roi is bleached by a short laser_pulse and the fluorescence recovery in the roi is then monitored by time lapse microscopy analysis of frap data provides information on the kinetic_behavior of the studied molecules such as diffusion and macromolecular interactions a typical frap data_set consists of a number of noisy images_acquired before during and after photobleaching these raw experimental_data must be carefully processed to permit biologically_significant conclusions to be drawn frap data analysis consists of multiple_steps following quantification of fluorescence_intensity in the various rois intensity values are processed to remove noise systematic_bias and artifacts referred to as normalization raw to whom correspondence should be addressed and normalized single_cell curves are visually inspected for quality_assessment and mean values from multiple cells are plotted for qualitative_analysis curve_fitting and parameter extraction permits quantitative analysis this process is usually performed_manually using common spreadsheet software_packages and is time consuming and prone to errors the need for automated analysis has led to the development of new software such as frapcalc http cmci embl de downloads frap analysis virtualfrap and frapanalyser http actinsim uni lu eng downloads frapanalyser however as functional live_cell becomes wide_spread in biology laboratories there is a lack of fast interactive and easy to use tools that do not require access to commercially licensed software and are not computationally_intensive
