addressing false_discoveries in network_inference motivation experimentally_determined gene_regulatory can be enriched by computational inference from high_throughput expression_profiles however the prediction of regulatory_interactions is severely_impaired by indirect and spurious effects particularly for eukaryotes recently published_methods report improved predictions by exploiting the a priori known targets of a regulator its local topology in addition to expression_profiles results we find that methods exploiting known targets show an unexpectedly high rate of false_discoveries this leads to inflated performance_estimates and the prediction of an excessive number of new interactions for regulators with many known targets these issues are hidden from common evaluation and cross_validation setups which is due to simpsons paradox we suggest a confidence_score recalibration method core that reduces the false_discovery and enables a reliable performance estimation conclusions core considerably improves the results of network_inference that exploit known targets predictions then display the biological_process specificity of regulators more correctly and enable the inference of accurate genome_wide regulatory_networks in eukaryotes for yeast we propose a network with more than confident interactions we point out that machine_learning outside of the area of network_inference may be affected as well availability_and results executable code and networks are available via our websitegene regulatory_networks grns consist of interactions of regulators such as transcription_factors tfs that physically bind to specific nucleotide_sequences to regulate the expression of target_genes grns can be experimentally_derived from tf_binding studies such as chromatin immuno precipitationor dnase footprinting a large fraction of the interactions reported by these approaches are not associated with changes in target expression on the other hand expression changes in potential tf targets can be detected from tf knockout profiles this approach however is prone to indirect or spurious effects although the number of conducted tf_binding and tf knockout studies is growing the discovery of novel regulations detected with each additional study decreases thus a combination of experimental_results and computational inference approaches is likely to provide more comprehensive networks many inference methods use expression data exclusively an interaction is predicted if a tf and its putative target are coexpressed such expression based_approaches infer prokaryotic networks successfully however they perform hardly better than random for inference of eukaryotic networks although they can achieve useful results in special cases e g for respiratory genes interactions in eukaryotes are difficult to infer as observable dependencies between the expression of regulator and target are weaker and context dependent one reason is the increased level of complexity and the combinatorial nature of the eukaryotic regulation of transcription the prediction of novel interactions can be improved for prokaryotic and in silico data by exploiting a priori known interactions local topology priors this allows to determine_whether a given tf is active based on the expression of its known targets enabling a more reliable prediction of novel targets de see supplementary section s for an overview on related methods here we investigate whether eukaryotic networks are accurately inferred by methods exploiting topology priors first we demonstrate that many existing performance_evaluations are misleading they are not adequate for local topology methods and overestimate network quality substantially this effect is due to simpsons paradox well known in causal theory second this also strongly influences the quality and composition of inferred networks we develop a simple recalibration strategy and demonstrate how it can be applied for the inference of a confident genome_scale regulatory_network in yeast grns are crucial to understand how regulators like tfs affect their target_genes on the expression_level experimentally_derived networks are typically incomplete as the number of available experiments is limited to complement them computational inference of networks has been introduced we revealed critical aspects but also demonstrated that inference is necessary and feasible in eukaryotes even in well studied eukaryotes such as yeast where publications on experimental tf_binding studies are available current networks are far from complete and benefit from computational predictions we found that only about half of all regulations that induce detectable expression changes active interactions are currently known in addition experimental_techniques are prone to discover regulations without effect on the expression_level we applied computational inference both for the detection of novel active and the pruning of inactive regulations we reported three crucial findings based on the analysis of a wide_spectrum of data_driven inference methods for reviews see de first we demonstrated that methods incorporating experimentally_derived interactions as topology priors possess sufficient predictive_power for the inference of eukaryotic networks methods using expression data alone fail here we also showed that topology priors lead to simpsons paradox distorting prediction and assessment of regulatory_interactions finally we showed how to avoid the occurrence of the paradox generally network_inference that exploit the local topology assign an excessive number of predictions to tfs with many known targets and it has been doubted whether a correction is possible or sensible our analysis revealed that the number of known targets for a regulator is a confounder of regulator target predictions this effect is not detected by commonaddressing false_discoveries in network inferencecross validation routines surprisingly the same performance reported for published network_inference approaches can be achieved by guessing random regulations we developed a core approach wrapping existing_methods and showed that it corrected for both the over estimation of performance and the distortion of the topology toward tfs with many known targets hdp we conducted a comprehensive assessment of methods integrating topology priors and identified methods suitable to derive a corrected accurate yeast regulatory_network of active regulations we describe disadvantages of several methods which we excluded due to prediction_performance or the inadequate scale up for large expression datasets our evaluation suggested that the selected methods detect several types of interactions successfully that are difficult to predict for instance auto regulatory_interactions and the assignment of directions are handled accurately and immediate and indirect interactions could be distinguished we then integrated the predictions from the selected methods to construct a network consisting of half novel and half experimentally_determined regulations this choice was based on our extrapolation of the size of the complete yeast network our final yeast network see availability contains tfs that regulate target_genes via interactions these include many novel and confident hypotheses of regulatory_relationships while we expect less than false_positives in total at the same time we reject more than half of the experimentally_determined interactions as they appear to be without observable regulatory effect to gain an overview of the network we derived modules of target_genes that were jointly regulated by sets of tfs the resulting modular_structure was strikingly simple featuring metaregulations that represent an index for inspecting the expression effects of interactions a thorough literature_review confirmed that the modules and their expression_patterns correspond well to biological_processes such as respiration sulfate energy_metabolism transport stress_response and cell_division we conclude that methods integrating local topology can extend known networks substantially and at a high_reliability even in well studied model_organisms these methods in contrast to those using expression data alone are well suited for the prediction of interactions in yeast and presumably other eukaryotes due to simpsons paradox however their application was more difficult than previously acknowledged and required a correction approach we emphasize that topology structural priors and parameterized models are widely_applied beyond network_inference supplementary section s for an overview and encourage a review of fields that may benefit from confidence recalibration strategies such as core
