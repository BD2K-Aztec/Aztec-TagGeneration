candidate_gene based on spatially mapped gene_expression an application to xlmr motivation the identification of genes involved in specific phenotypes such as human hereditary diseases often requires the time consuming and expensive examination of a large number of positional candidates selected by genome_wide techniques such as linkage_analysis and association studies even considering the positive impact of next_generation the prioritization of these positional candidates may be an important step for disease_gene results here we report a large_scale analysis of spatial i e d gene_expression data from an entire organ the mouse_brain for the purpose of evaluating and ranking positional candidate_genes showing that the spatial gene_expression can be successfully exploited for the prediction of genephenotype associations not only for mouse phenotypes but also for human central_nervous related mendelian_disorders we apply our method to the case of x_linked compare the predictions to the results obtained from a previous large_scale resequencing study of chromosome x and discuss some promising novel candidates individuals belonging to the same species show not only phenotypic variations that influence all biological aspects of the organism in more or less profound ways including physiology metabolic_pathways and development but also susceptibility to diseases in the last years genome_wide techniques such as linkage_analysis and association studies have been very successful in establishing the molecular basis of many phenotypic_traits however these approaches often select loci containing many hundreds of positional candidates the experimental evaluation of which can be time consuming and expensive therefore computational_approaches to disease gene prediction or prioritization can be an important step prior to further empirical analysis in a laboratory in silico disease gene prediction can be based on different types of information such as sequence properties lpez functional_annotation text_mining of biomedical_literature proteinprotein_interactions high_throughput or combinations of these to whom correspondence should be addressed while some of these approaches are clearly biased towards already consolidated knowledge e g the mining of functional_annotations and biomedical_literature others allow for a less biased evaluation of candidate_genes avoiding such a bias that tends to diminish the value of all candidate_genes about which little or nothing is known is a key problem of disease gene prediction methodologies for this reason approaches that rely on or at least include genome_wide high_throughput data like the one proposed in this article are generally preferable the introduction of next_generation is likely to have a significant impact on disease_gene by speeding up the identification of potentially disease_relevant mutations however especially if large sets of positional candidates are involved a high number of sequence_variations can be expected to be found for example found non synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms in a screen of the coding_regions of human genes relevant to cardiovascular_disease endocrinology and neuropsychiatry during a screen of the coding_exons of genes on chromosome x from families for mutations causing x_linked xlmr found mutations in three novel and several known disease genes but could not for most families identify the genetic cause of xlmr despite the identification of a large number of missense and even truncating_mutations these results illustrate that even with the aid of novel technologies candidate evaluation remains a difficult_task thus providing a rationale for the inclusion of computational predictions or prioritizations in the evaluation process high_throughput expression data from microarray_experiments are valuable as a potentially unbiased source of information for comparing the expression_profiles of candidate_genes with those of reference genes known to be directly_or associated to a phenotype this guilt by association approach however has usually been applied to heterogeneous datasets containing samples from multiple tissues and cell_types traditional high_throughput expression data although being highly informative have the shortcoming of carrying only limited spatial_information although samples are usually associated to specific tissues and organs often no detailed d localization of samples within a tissue or organ is recorded this may be a problem especially for tissues or organs characterized by a high degree of spatial_organization such as the central_nervous cns some of the microarray or est expression datasets that have so_far been used for disease gene predictionsee for examplecontain subsets for the brain or the cns that have a somewhat more detailed anatomical and hence in some sense spatial annotation associating the expression data topage i i i taken together our results are very promising demonstrating the value of high_resolution spatial gene_expression data for the purpose of candidate_gene and disease gene prediction we have shown that spatial expression data from the mouse_brain can be successfully used to predict not only genes involved in mouse phenotypes but also genes involved in human cns related_disorders the robustness of our results led us to suggest novel candidates for x_linked unfortunately d expression data remain an exception and many potentially powerful applications such as a hypothetical differential spatial expression of case versus control samples are currently impossible but as our study hopefully illustrates further effort to advance relevant technologies and experimental
