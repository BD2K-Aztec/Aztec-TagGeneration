genome_analysis updtool a tool for detection of iso and heterodisomy in parent_child trios using snp microarrays updtool is a computational_tool for detection and classification of uniparental_disomy upd in trio snp microarray_experiments upds are rare_events of chromosomal malsegregation and describe the condition of two homologous_chromosomes or homolo gous chromosomal segments that were inherited from one parent the occurrence of upd can be of major clinical_relevance though high_throughput molecular screening_techniques are widely used detection of upds and especially the subclassification remains complex we developed updtool to detect and classify upds from snp microarray_data of parentchild trios the algorithm was tested using five positive controls including both iso and heterodisomic segmental upds and trios from the hapmap project as negative controls with updtool we were able to correctly identify all occurrences of non mosaic upd within our positive controls whereas no occurrence of upd was found within our negative controls in addition the chromosomal_breakage points could be determined more precisely than by microsatellite_analysis our results were compared with both the gold_standard microsatellite_analysis and snptrio another program available for upd detection updtool is platform independent light_weight and flexible because of its simple input format updtool may also be used with other high_throughput e g next_generation availability_and updtool executables documentation and examples can be downloaded fromin a normal_diploid karyotype xx or xy respectively each chromosome pair consists of one maternal and one paternal inherited homologue uniparental_disomy upd is characterized by the presence of a chromosome pair or homologous chromosomal segment that was inherited from solely one parent upds can be divided_into maternal and paternal by origin of the homologous_chromosomes further subclassification is based on the information whether both homologous_chromosomes originate from the same isodisomy or both heterodisomy chromosomes of one parent also mixtures of both subtypes combined iso and heterodisomy are possible the mechanisms leading to upd are complex and were discussed in detail in a recent review generally upd can affect each chromosome and the incidence is estimated to be of live_births phenotypes associated with upd owing to either imprinting disturbance or unmasking recessive_mutations have been described for nearly all autosomes the pathogenesis of upd is determined by both epigenetic imprinting e g silverrussell syndrome chr maternal praderwilli syndrome chr maternal beckwithwiedemann syndrome chr paternal and angelman_syndrome chr paternal as well as unmasking of autosomal_recessive diseases e g isodisomy of chromosome in leigh_syndrome the clinical_findings of two of our positive controls with upd were published_previously microsatellite_analysis as well as methylation specific tests as a genomewide screening_tool for upds are laborious expensive and imprecise owing to the limited number of markers that are available per chromosome in contrast the widely_applied highthroughput genotyping technologies such as whole_genome high_density microarrays or next_generation provide hundreds of thousands of genotypes in one experiment owing to homozygosity by descendants microsatellite_analysis as well as upd detection based on genotypes may be of limited informative value in consanguineous_families especially trio experiments are thought to render udp detection possible genotype_information from children and their parents allows detection of inheritance errors also called mendelian errors me causes for unexpected calls can be found not only in genotyping_errors but also in upd regions contrary to upd regions genotyping_errors are evenly_distributed over all chromosomes and occur at a low rate e g in an affymetrix k array yet detection of upd and especially heterodisomic regions as well as further subclassification of upd regions e g paternal maternal is still not routinely carried_out to our knowledge only snptrio a webtool is publicly_available and implements trio information for upd detection among the reasons for the development of updtool to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as were the need for a lightweight and flexible tool with simple input and output file_format that might be used with different genotyping techniques microarrays but also next_generation updtool was implemented as a portable and platform independent software solution for detection of both heteroand isodisomic regions on tab_delimited snp files updtool is a fast lightweight and platform independent tool for detection and classification of upds we were able to detect hetero and isodisomies from maternal and paternal origin present in our positive controls all upd stretches were identified_correctly and breakpoints within a chromosome could be determined more precisely compared with microsatellite_analysis owing to the simple input format updtool may likely be used to analyze snps of other high_throughput platforms moreover updtool is easy to install because it is platform independent and portable updtool currently does not evaluate copy_number datafor this reason cnvs should be ruled_out by another bioinformatic method before upd detection updtool was written in c and we provide a platform independent executable for windows and linux both and bit the only requirement of updtool is an installation of the net or mono framework for generation of images r has to be installed and added to the path environment variable a data converter for the widely used genome_wide human snp_array affymetrix santa clara is provided additionally updtool comes with a tool that enables batch analysis of larger cohorts
