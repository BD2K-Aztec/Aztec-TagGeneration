databases_and orthoinspector software and database updates we previously_developed orthoinspector a package incorporating an original algorithm for the detection of orthology and inpar alogy relations between different species we have added new functionalities to the package while its original algorithm was not modified performing similar orthology predictions we facilitated the prediction of very large_databases thousands of proteomes refurbished its graphical_interface added new visualization_tools for comparative_genomics protein_family analysis and facilitated its deployment in a network environment finally we have released three online_databases of precomputed orthology_relationships availability package and databases are freely_available lbgi fr orthoinspector with all_major high_throughput comparative_analyses functional_annotations or evolutionary_studies involve massive transfers of information between organisms using orthology inference as defined by orthologs are homologous_genes that diverged from an ancestral speciation event while paralogs emerged from a duplication event today it is widely_accepted that orthologs generally share similar functions whereas paralogs can potentially evolve new functions numerous algorithms based on the results of blast_searches were developed to infer orthology relations seefor reviews we previously_developed an orthology inference algorithm also based on blast and implemented it in the orthoinspector oi package our focus was to maintain a balance between sensitivity_and contrary to most other packages oi is not limited to predictions and provides tools for comprehensive mining of large orthology databases nonspecialist use through a desktop graphical_interface and can easily be deployed in a network environment here we describe the main improvements implemented in the second version of the orthoinspector package oi is a package dedicated to the efficient calculation and analysis of orthology data and allows a rapid and intuitive analysis of relationships associated with large clades the oi web_server allows the retrieval of precomputed orthology data from thousands of eukaryote and prokaryote proteomes
