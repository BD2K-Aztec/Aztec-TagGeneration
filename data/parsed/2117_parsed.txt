approximate empirical and multiple testing corrected p values we show in simulation_studies that meaga is more powerful compared to count_based strategies in identifying disease associated functions

between genetic and functional results remains a major theoretical and experimental goal of genetics research depending on the genotyping platform being used loci densities and genomic distribution of the markers in the association analysis might vary one of the challenges in enrichment testing is to select the proper set of background markers genes as null observations to approximate its overlap against the gene_set in question previous_studies have proposed different strategies to approximate the null observations aligator randomly samples markers from the original platform to mimic its empirical marker distribution inrich exhibits a sampling strategy using genomic interval as unit and the sampled intervals are constrained to have similar marker and gene densities as those from the input intervals i e susceptibility_loci each of the sampled null observations from the above approaches would be used to construct empirical distributions for the numbers of overlap with functional gene_sets and used to estimate the statistical_significance of the observed data both of the above count based_approaches enumerate the number of associated genes overlapping with each gene_set and work well in identifying biological_functions or pathways if the platform was designed in genome_wide scale i e most common genetic_markers are well tagged by the genotyped markers recently cost_effective genotyping_platforms such as the immunochip and metabochip containing common and lowfrequency variants have been designed to facilitate the identification of novel association_signals and with the goal to fine map established loci these platforms contain dense markers in the top_ranked loci from previous_studies e g studies in autoimmune_diseases for immunochip studies in metabolic and atherosclerotic cardiovascular traits diseases for metabochip performing functional_enrichment on the signals identified using these customized platforms poses analytical challenges as the pre selected markers are enriched in potential or known susceptibility_loci the potential to identify the correct underlying_biological pathways can be revealed only if sufficient gene_sets overlapping genes from the significant loci are identified to provide enough statistical_power moreover as different studies have identified interactions between genes in disease susceptibility_loci a gene_set approach that incorporates independent information from biological interaction data could thus increase the power to identify functions or pathways crucial to the disease we present here a novel approach called minimum distancebased enrichment_analysis for genetic_association meaga to perform functional pathway enrichment test for results from association studies instead of only enumerating the overlap between genes in the associated regions and genes_annotated in a gene_set i e count_based we use graphical algorithm and incorporates a statistic to measure the closeness between the overlapping genes in steiner tree s identified in a user_defined interaction_database here we demonstrate in simulation_studies that meaga is more powerful than a countbased approach when protein_coding in associated regions tend to be closer with each other in an interaction_network we also applied meaga to the results of a meta_analysis of psoriasis a common inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin disease using immunochip datasets although the original study did not identify any enriched biological_functions among the identified loci meaga is able to reveal associated genes are closer with each other in the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network and are also significantly_enriched in immune_related functions
