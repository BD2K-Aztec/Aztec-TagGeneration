genome_analysis reference free prediction of rearrangement breakpoint reads motivation chromosome rearrangement events are triggered by atypical breaking and rejoining of dna_molecules which are observed in many cancer related_diseases the detection of rearrangement is typically done by using short_reads generated by next_generation ngs and combining the reads with knowledge of a reference_genome because structural_variations and genomes differ from one person to another intermediate comparison via a reference_genome may lead to loss of information results in this article we propose a reference free method for detecting clusters of breakpoints from the chromosomal_rearrangements this is done by directly comparing a set of ngs normal reads with another set that may be rearranged our method slidesort bpr breakpoint reads is based on a fast algorithm for all against all comparisons of short_reads and theoretical_analyses of the number of neighboring reads when applied to a dataset with a sequencing_depth of it finds of the breakpoints correctly with no false_positive reads moreover evaluation on a real prostate_cancer dataset shows that the proposed method predicts more fusion_transcripts correctly than previous_approaches and yet produces fewer false_positive reads to our knowledge this is the first method to detect breakpoint reads without using a reference_genome availability_and the source_code of slidesort bpr can be freely downloaded from https code it has been discovered that cancer_cells include chromosomal_rearrangements which are large_scale modifications of the genome and those modifications are thought to be responsible at least in part for the irregular growth of cancer_cells although it is known that these chromosomal_rearrangements often lead to translocations and fusions of genes it has not yet been determined how the somatic genome rearrangement works at the molecular level a unit of the mosaic_structure of a rearrangement is called a breakpoint a breakpoint can be represented as a pair of genomic_locations that do not appear in the reference_genome but occur in the rearranged genome typical rearrangement events generate single breakpoints including breakage fusion bridge cycles nonhomologous_end and homologous_recombination based repair whereas complex rearrangement events produce multiple breakpoints these rearrangements have been suggested to cause little or no loss of genomic material and are likely to produce functional gene_fusions next_generation ngs_technologies have enabled the analysis of individual_genomes at unprecedented depth with low_cost however these ngs_technologies have created new difficulties in examining cancer_genomes to determine the signatures of breakpoint junctions unambiguously at the sequence level onishi to detect large_scale genomic_variations several tools have been developed for detecting chromosomal_rearrangements from ngs sequences these tools include defuse fusionmap and others for detecting gene_fusions and breakdancer crest and others for detecting structural_variation sv the foundation of these methods is locating breakpoints by mapping the ngs_reads to a reference_genome the human_reference while extraordinarily useful has inherent shortcomings that may hinder the task of characterizing human cancer because it is still incomplete and as the genomes_project and other studies have revealed there are significant numbers of genome differences between individuals complexity also emerges from svs among individuals sv accounts for a larger fraction of the diversity between persons than any other factor this complexity makes_it to map short_reads to the reference_genome and the resulting mismapped or unmapped reads can lead to loss of important information one possible approach for detecting breakpoints from an ngs dataset without knowledge of a reference_genome is to use genome_assembly first and then compare two assembled_genomes to find breakpoints many studies however have to whom correspondence should be addressed suggested difficulties for genome_assembly arising from the variability of genomes and few attempts have been made to detect breakpoints after assembling short_reads to overcome the aforementioned limitations we present a new method slidesort bpr breakpoint reads which detects chromosomal breakpoints by directly comparing two sets of ngs_reads from different kinds of cells without mapping them to a reference_genome and without assembling reads slidesortbpr determines the reads associated to the breakpoints by finding the groups of reads that are unbalanced between two sets of samples this determination is based on a probabilistic_model of the number of similar reads neighborhood reads one might think that finding neighborhood reads by pairwise_comparison is computationally too expensive for a large number of ngs_reads however we have overcome this difficulty by using an efficient algorithm that can enumerate all similar pairs within a given edit_distance in a computational time linear on the number of reads as a result slidesort bpr can efficiently detect the ngs_reads associated with breakpoints between samples from normal cells and samples from cancer_cells in this work we have presented slidesort bpr a tool for performing direct comparisons of reads from different samples without using a reference_genome to our knowledge this is the first method for detecting breakpoint reads without using a reference_genome although a paper was recently_published that tries to detect mutations by direct comparison of ngs_reads computational_experiments indicated that our approach is robust to the presence of repeats in the genome and to a wide_range of sequencing_errors up to in extensive evaluations on simulated_and we showed that slidesort bpr can predict breakpoint reads with high_accuracy
