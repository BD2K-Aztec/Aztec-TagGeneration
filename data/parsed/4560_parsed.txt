tfbstools an r bioconductor_package for transcription_factor analysis the ability to efficiently investigate transcription_factor tfbss genome_wide is central to computational studies of gene_regulation tfbstools is an r bioconductor_package for the analysis and manipulation of tfbss and their associated transcription_factor profile matrices tfbstools provides a toolkit for handling tfbs profile matrices scanning sequences and alignments including whole genomes and querying the jaspar database the functionality of the package can be easily extended to include advanced statistical_analysis data visualization and data_integration availability_and the package is implemented in r and available under gpl license from the bioconductor websitetranscription factor binding_sites tfbss on dna play_a in gene_regulation via their sequence specific interaction with transcription_factor tf proteins most individual tfbss are base_pairs bp wide but are generally located in larger cis regulatory_regions of bp analysis and identification of tfbss is crucial for understanding the regulatory_mechanisms of gene_regulation at present the tfbs analysis functionality in r bioconductor is limited and scattered across multiple packages here we introduce an r package tfbstools which provides a unified and efficiently implemented suite of tfbs analysis tools the package provides a number of functions for manipulating tfbs profile matrices and searching dna_sequence and pairwise_alignments using them we have ported all of the functionality of our popular tfbs perl modules retaining the equivalent class structure where possible and expanded the functionality to provide efficient genome_wide analysis of tfbss our implementation is tightly integrated with the existing bioconductor core packages enabling high performance sequence and interval manipulation a database interface for jaspar jaspar and wrapper function for de_novo motif_discovery software are also provided
