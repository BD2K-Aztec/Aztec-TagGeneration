structural_bioinformatics rnasnoop efficient target prediction for h aca snornas motivation small_nucleolar are an abundant class of non_coding that guide chemical_modifications of rrnas snrnas and some mrnas in the case of many orphan snornas the targeted nucleotides remain_unknown however the box h aca subclass determines uridine residues that are to be converted into pseudouridines via specific complementary binding in a well defined secondary_structure configuration that is outside the scope of common rna co folding algorithms results rnasnoop implements a dynamic_programming that computes thermodynamically optimal h aca rna interactions in an efficient scanning variant complemented by an support_vector svm based machine_learning approach to distinguish true binding_sites from spurious solutions and a system to evaluate comparative information it presents an efficient and reliable tool for the prediction of h aca snorna target_sites we apply rnasnoop to identify the snornas that are responsible for several of the remaining orphan pseudouridine modifications in human rrnas and we assign a target to one of the five orphan h aca snornas in drosophila availability the c source_code of rnasnoop is freely_available atbox h aca snorna facilitates the conversion of uracil to pseudouracil in a specific sequence_context the specificity for a particular target_site is the consequence of the hybridization of snorna and target_rna in most cases a ribosomal_rna the target u is positioned by two specific interactions of the flanking target rna_sequence with the complementary_sequence of the recognition loop of the snorna see the correct secondary to whom correspondence should be addressed structures of snornas are typically hard to predict thus the exact structure of the interior loop and hence the sequence_motifs complementary to the binding_site are unknown we employ here the idea of thermodynamic matchers to determine the energetically optimal structure of an h aca snorna that is bound to a given putative target_sequence the implementation of thermodynamic matchers is not directly applicable however since the snornatarget interaction corresponds to a complex pseudoknot in the conceptual concatenation of snorna and mrna that is beyond the scope of existing rna_folding software the prediction of putative snorna target_sites is an integral part of two programs snogps and fisher that attempt to detect h aca snornas in genomic_dna both programs search for sequence complementarities between a list of possible target_sites and the binding region of the snorna candidate in these models mismatches between the target and the snorna are not allowed furthermore neither program provides information on the energetics of the interaction or the stability of the stems two factors that were recently shown to be important for correctly predicting snornatarget interactions we present here a dynamic_programming named rnasnoop that specifically captures the structure of the snorna target interaction and is optimized for scanning speed the thermodynamic considerations are combined with a machine_learning component to increase the specificity of target predictions which can be improved even further by including comparative information we presented here rnasnoop a tool specifically_designed to predict complex h aca snornarna interactions that are outside the scope of conventional rnarna prediction_tools in contrast with previous tools it uses a dynamic_programming coupled with a nearest_neighbor energy_model to identify putative targets this allows rnasnoop to capture structural andenergetic features essential for correctly predicting snornatarget interactions coupled with a svm classification snoopy achieves good performance ranking first out of confirmed snornamrna interactions in human and excluding all experimentally rejected interactions these good results should however not be overestimated as both the training and test datasets are small and were extracted from only two species the run time of rnasnoop is comparable with that of snogps and scales linearly with the length of the target_sequence together with the improved accuracy this makes rnasnoop not only suitable for target search in rrna and snrna sequences or in specific putative mrna candidates but also for large_scale genome_wide surveys funding european_union under the auspices of the fp synlet and the fp quantomics project in part the austrian genau project regulatory noncoding_rna in part
