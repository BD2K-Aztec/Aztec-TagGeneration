data_and investigating the correlations among the chemical_structures bioactivity profiles and molecular_targets of small_molecules motivation most of the previous data_mining studies based on the nci dataset due to its intrinsic cell based nature can hardly provide insights into the molecular_targets for screened compounds on the other hand the abundant information of the compound target associations in pubchem can offer extensive experimental_evidence of molecular_targets for tested compounds therefore by taking advantages of the data from both public_repositories one may investigate the correlations between the bioactivity profiles of small_molecules from the nci dataset cellular_level and their patterns of interactions with relevant protein targets from pubchem molecular level simultaneously results we investigated a set of small_molecules by providing links among their bioactivity profiles protein targets and chemical_structures hierarchical_clustering of compounds was carried_out based on their bioactivity profiles we found that compounds were clustered into groups with similar mode of actions which strongly correlated with chemical_structures furthermore we observed that compounds similar in bioactivity profiles also shared similar patterns of interactions with relevant protein targets especially when chemical_structures were related the current work presents a new strategy for combining and data_mining the nci dataset and pubchem this analysis shows that bioactivity profile comparison can provide insights into the mode of actions at the molecular level thus will facilitate the knowledge based discovery of novel compounds with desired pharmacological_properties understanding the mechanism of interaction of small_molecules with their macromolecular targets is critical for drug and chemical_probe development the innovation of drug has long been recognized as time consuming and labor_intensive costing on to whom correspondence should be addressed average about million as well as years to bring a new drug to market apart from the challenges in optimizing pharmacokinetic_properties and minimizing toxicities of lead_compounds the lack of publicly_available accessible biomedical assay data may represent another barrier for the success of drug_discovery fortunately this is changing since more public resources are emerging offering new opportunities to chemical_biology researchers for drug_development open_access information rich resources include the protein_data pdb drugbank and kegg to name only a few without a doubt existing public resources as well as new ones will evolve in future with both speed and capacity pubchem is a public repository for the chemical_structures of small_molecules and information of their biological_properties it was launched as a component of the nih molecular libraries roadmap initiative with the aim to discover chemical probes via high_throughput hts of small_molecules it also receives biological property contributions from many other organizations as of march pubchem contains more than million unique compounds among which over have biological assay data for more than molecular_targets including proteins and genes the public accessibility to such assay data is particularly valuable to the community since this kind of critical information needed by drug research is typically held by pharmaceutical_companies the public availability and information rich features altogether make pubchem an extremely_valuable resource for biomedical_research as well as data_mining studies launched by the national_cancer nci the developmental therapeutics program dtp provides in vitro screening for new anticancer_drugs that tested in human tumor cancer_cell often known as the nci dataset this well curated publicly_available dataset has been recognized as a rich resource for studying the mechanism of growth_inhibition for tumor_cells it has also inspired interests for developing and validating data_mining tools bioactivity profiles derived from the nci cell_lines can provide insights into the mode of actions for tested compounds structure_activity sars studies have also been reported for predicting or characterizing the cytotoxicity of thepage
