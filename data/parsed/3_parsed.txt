dspan semiautomated d segmentation classification and analysis of hippocampal dendritic_spine plasticity motivation accurate and effective dendritic_spine segmentation from the dendrites remains as a challenge for current neuroimaging research_community in this article we present a new method dspan for d segmentation classification and analysis of structural plastic changes of hippo campal dendritic_spines a user interactive segmentation_method with convolution kernels is designed to segment the spines from the dendrites formal morphological definitions are presented to describe key attributes related to the shape of segmented spines spines are automatically classified into one of four classes stubby filopodia mushroom and spine head protrusions results the developed method is validated using confocal light microscopy_images of dendritic_spines from dissociated hippocampal cultures for i quantitative analysis of spine morphological changes ii reproducibility analysis for assessment of user independence of the developed software and iii accuracy analysis with respect to the manually labeled ground_truth images and also with respect to the available state of the art the developed method is monitored and used to precisely describe the morphology of individual spines in real_time experiments i e consequent images of the same dendritic fragment availability_and the software and the source_code are available at https sites google com site dspan under open_source for non commercial use neuronal_cells in different brain_regions are covered with dendritic_spines which are small membranous protrusions having a length of around few microns they form the postsynaptic compartment of most excitatory_synapses in the central_nervous dendritic_spine is usually composed of a spine head and a spine neck that connects the spine head to the dendritic shaft more specifically a spine head where the excitatory synapse is located is separated from the parent dendrite by a thin neck isolating the spine cytoplasm from the dendrite spines are likely to play_an in neural_circuits but their exact function is still a matter of debate because of their morphology dendritic_spines are assumed to play a role in electrical and biochemical compartmentalization synaptic_plasticity is essential for brain development and higher brain functions changes in dendritic_spine morphology are believed to associate synaptic_plasticity which seem to be critical for synaptic_function however the understanding of the relationship between the changes in dendritic_spine structure and synapse functions remains inadequate the quantitative contribution of spine morphology to biochemical compartmentalization is still unknown in spite of being a long_standing hypothesis therefore the important question is whether or how much the synaptic_strength may be adjusted through structural changes in spine necks or the complete spine effective solution to this problem is particularly difficult due the complex morphology of the dendritic_spines the problem gets compounded with the limited_resolution of optical microscopic images in many situations the spines are difficult to be segmented from the images of dendritic segments having hundreds of these protrusions identification of true spine boundaries is difficult and time consuming accurate quantitative_analyses of the spines depend on the question how easily and effectively the spines can be segmented from the dendrite recently some researchers have tried to address the earlier issue a patent cooperation treaty pct application presents a method for characterizing one or more neurons comprising dendritic_spines utilizing a grassfire process the technique is particularly efficient for detecting separated spine heads however no detailed_description is provided on how to precisely detect the contours of the spine the work by presents a method for segmentation and analysis of every spine separately using a contour tracing algorithm two points are marked for each spine one at the bottom of the neck and the other at the head the farthest point fp on the spine from the neck then a parameterized contour tracing algorithm detects the spine boundary and the morphological attributes this process_requires extensive user intervention in images with hundreds of spines marking two end_points and choosing appropriate segmentation parameters for every spine is a rigorous job this makes segmentation of dendritic_spines both times consuming and error_prone in one of the recent_developments proposed an advanced d approach for segmentation of the spines however that kind of approach_requires many optimization steps and extensive manual supervision apart from the works mentioned earlier several neuromorphological tracing tools are also available many of these techniques use the commercial reconstruction software neurolucida existing tracing tools like filament

neuron morpho http www southampton ac uk dales morpho etc require extensive manual annotations and parameter selection for automated semiautomated reconstructions for example filament tracer a module of the commercial imaris software incorporates visualization and editing utilities and performs morphometric calculations by fitting the objects from the finite list of shapes such as cone ball and cylinder similarly neuron morpho an open_source tool for semiautomatic digital tracing of neurons from image_stacks generates outline of the neurite or soma by drawing straight_lines across the width of the section none of these applications provides formal morphological definitions of spines some applications like neuronj are developed as imagej plugins and are slow in analyzing images these tools are often applicable on specific types of images like bit grayscale or indexed color images the proposed dspan method significantly_reduces human involvement and allows the operators to quantitatively assess dendritic_spine plasticity users need to mark a specific dendritic segment automatically segment the spines using the designed convolution kernels and finally mark the spines of interest to extract relevant_features with high_accuracy and minimal intervention moreover the proposed dspan method allows morphological_analysis of spines from different type of images including those acquired by super_resolution confocal and wide_field microscopy_images the overall method is divided in two steps i segmentation of the dendritic_spines and ii quantitative assessment of spine morphology in the article we briefly describe the theory behind the developed segmentation_algorithm and highlight the main features of the dspan interface and software architecture the performed experimental_validation is done with respect to the confocal_images of dendritic_spines from dissociated hippocampal cultures finally we conclude with a discussion on open_source software_development limitations and future plans the developed dspan tool is useful in a variety of applications involving large_scale annotation of dendritic_spines for quick and accurate assessment of spine plastic changes there are two specific challenges involved in this process i accurate segmentation of individual spines from the dendritic segment and ii quantitative analysis of spine morphology for effective assessment of dendritic_spines structural changes as discussed before the objective of this work is to demonstrate the efficacy of the dspan tool in annotation of dendritic_spines and to compare its performance with respect to the available tools specifically we have concentrated on the analysis of spine plasticity using the morphological_features presented in the previous section the confocal light microscopy_images of dendritic_spines from dissociated hippocampal cultures have been used for i quantitative analysis of spine morphological changes ii reproducibility analysis for assessment of user independence of the developed software iii accuracy analysis with respect to the ground_truth gt annotations generated by the experimental biologists and also with respect to the available state of the art in the following subsection we first describe the image_acquisition protocol and the image sets used for the experimental_validation then we present the analysis of spine structural changes of the mentioned datasets mutually blind three user reproducibility analysis using the developed dspan software and finally the error analysis with respect to the gt annotations and also with respect to the work by a step_by representation of the segmentation_process over a synthetic dataset by applying the convolution kernel k f k k g a the start p and end q points are marked on a synthetic dataset b the convolution kernel k is first applied on p c and d results of successive application of the convolution kernel k on p and p respectively marked in b e result obtained after iterative application of k on the image stop when q is reached or no further application of the kernel is possible f now the convolution kernel k is first applied on q g result obtained after iterative application of k on the image h the segmented dendrite region r is estimated by intersection of the regions generated by k and k a manual seed point is then placed inside the potential spine region i the spine region is segmented using region_growing from the manual seed and the base pixels are identified following the definition dspan segmentation classification and analysis of dendritic_spine plasticity hippocampi were triturated in plating medium then centrifuged for min at room_temperature at g the resulting cell pellet was suspended in plating medium cells were counted and plated at density cells per mm_diameter coverslip assistent germany coated with mg_ml poly_l sigma and lg ml laminin roche at h after plating medium was exchanged for maintenance medium neurobasal a without phenol_red b supplement penicillin streptomycin mm glutamine lm glutamate lm b mercaptoethanol and cells were kept at cc under a humidified co atmosphere live_cell and chemical long_term cltp stimulation cultured_hippocampal were transfected at days in vitro div with syn gfp plasmid to visualize neuronal morphology live_cell was performed on div prior the imaging the cells were placed in an acquisition chamber with controlled temperature c and stable co concentration dendritic segments decorated with dendritic_spines were imaged at the time before stimulation and then was induced by bath application of a mixture of lm forskolin lm picrotoxin and lm rolipram each dissolved in dmso in maintenance media dendritic segments were imaged at min after cltp induction images were acquired using the carl zeiss lsm confocal_microscope with a c apochromat na water_immersion objective using nm_wavelength argon_laser at transmission at nm pixel resolution a series of z stacks were acquired at lm step in this work we present a new tool for fast and accurate annotation of dendritic_spines from confocal microscopy_images however the dspan method allows determining the morphology of spines from super_resolution and is not limited only to confocal_images please note that the applied confocal imaging_technique provides sufficient resolution to detect the changes of dendritic_spines morphology we also define and extract several morphological_features from the segmented spine images for quantitative assessment of spine structural_plasticity although there are some tools that serve somewhat similar purposes like the one developed by they do not provide theformal morphological definitions to different spine compartments for example there were no formal morphological characterizations to base neck and head of a spine in the prior works there are plenty of biological discussions in contemporary literature but most of them are subjective with respect to digital image_segmentation and analysis we also provide an automatic spine classification_framework based on the features extracted from the segmented spines the proposed spine classification model works on a rulebased decision_tree framework and may be improved further in future versions of the software the performance of the classifier is assessed by comparing the manual annotations from experimental biologists the developed spine segmentation methodology is based on a novel convolution kernel based_approach this methodology is effective in isolating the dendritic segment in between two manually embedded seed points on the image using the d graphical_user of the developed software the spines on either side of the dendritic segment are marked by the user by placing a single inside seed leading to segmentation of the spine from the dendritic segment the morphological_features like area and length of the spine are computed immediately other features like neck length neck width and head width are also estimated for each segmented spine the segmentation and classification steps in the dspan tool are extremely fast and almost instantaneous on a standard desktop computer the segmentation task takes s and the classification of individual spines takes several milliseconds computation time on the desktop computer used in our experiment to assess the efficacy of the developed tool we first analyzed dendritic_spine structural changes with respect to two image datasets before and after cltp we have quantitatively assessed the transitions between the spine categories stubby filopodia mushroom and spine head protrusions the changes in spine area and length are observed over all segmented spines for all nonstubby spines the changes in neck length and neck width values are analyzed we have also assessed the changes in head width in all mushroom type spines please note that the objective of this study is to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed dspan tool and therefore we are not inferring any biological_significance from the experimental_observations for stability and robustness study a three user reproducibility analysis has been performed both qualitative_and analysis show exciting results on the t and t image sets the accuracy analysis is performed with respect to the manually_annotated gt dataset and also with respect to the prior works available in this domain there are still scopes for improvement especially with respect to the design of the user_interface and also with respect to the preprocessing_steps for the image sets the complete work depends on the binarization algorithm applied on the roi marked by the user at this moment we use a global binarization on the complete region this process may sometime inflict noise in the data leading to inappropriate segmentation of the spines we are currently working on that issue and hope to improve the same in the upcoming version of the software the basic software architecture along with a representative screenshot supplementary is discussed in supplementary and also in the user_manual finally on the availability of the developed software we would like to mention that the complete open_source platform independent package is available at https sites google com site dspan for non commercial use by the research_community
