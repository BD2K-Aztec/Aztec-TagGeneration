gene_expression module based prediction approach for robust inter_study predictions in microarray_data motivation traditional genomic prediction_models based on individual genes suffer from low reproducibility across microarray_studies due to the lack of robustness to expression measurement noise and gene missingness when they are matched across platforms it is common that some of the genes in the prediction model established in a training study cannot be matched to another test study because a different platform is applied the failure of inter_study predictions has severely hindered the clinical_applications of microarray to overcome the drawbacks of traditional gene based prediction gbp models we propose a module based prediction mbp strategy via unsupervised gene clustering results k_means is used to group genes sharing similar expression_profiles into gene_modules and small modules are merged into their nearest_neighbors conventional univariate or multivariate feature_selection procedure is applied and a representative gene from each selected module is identified to construct the final prediction model as a result the prediction model is portable to any test study as long as partial genes in each module exist in the test study we demonstrate that k means cluster sizes generally follow a multinomial distribution and the failure probability of inter_study prediction due to missing genes is diminished by merging small_clusters into their nearest_neighbors by simulation and applications of real_datasets in inter_study predictions we show that the proposed mbp provides slightly_improved accuracy while is considerably more robust than traditional gbp microarray_technology is a promising methodology for predicting prognosis and response to treatment for cancer patients however a stable prediction model requires features selected from a large training_dataset since microarray_analyses and clinical_trials are expensive as well as time and effort intensive to validate information and to predict patient_outcomes from individual studies it is crucial to utilize accumulated inter_study data for over a decade microarray_data have been accumulated from different array technologies or different versions within technologies performed on similar clinical samples however to use a dataset or integrated datasets from one platform to build a model that robustly and accurately_predicts clinical_characteristics of a new dataset or a new sample from another platform remains a challenge although current automated microarray assay systems have made microarray methodology straightforward accurate use of genomic_information from microarray_analysis to classify patients or to predict patient prognosis is not trivial to effectively predict clinical_outcomes by genomic_data requires careful data preprocessing gene_selection and model construction based on training data the constructed model is then validated on independent test data currently many prediction_models have been developed and crossvalidated within the single study used for the model construction as a result the developed prediction_models are usually underrepresented or over fitted due to a lack of heterogeneity of sampling and do not account for cross_platform problems when training data and test data are generated from different microarray_platforms and protocols traditional prediction_methods have used a gene based gbp approach in which individual genes are selected as model components a common cross_platform problem encountered with such methods involves issues of gene missingness or gene mismatching frequently genes in the prediction model based on training data cannot be found in the test data which is termed as gene missingness in this article occasionally genes matched across platforms may contain errors i e gene mismatching the need for inter_study prediction across different platforms is commonly_encountered supplementary concept of gbp versue mbp methods a the gbp method selects individual genes from training samples to construct a prediction model and uses the model to predict new samples b the mbp method performs gene clustering a priori to form gene_modules and uses these modules to construct a prediction model color figure shown in supplementary for example suppose a pilot_study has been performed in an old affymetrix u platform and an effective prediction model has been constructed the test site of another medical_center may apply another commercial system such as agilent or illumina platforms or the original medical_center may migrate to a newer u system many genes in the old training study may not be found in the new test study current cross_platform gene prediction_methods use only those genes common to both training and test datasets there are two main drawbacks to this gbp approach one drawback is that the prediction model must be reconstructed with each new test_dataset thus the model cannot be created independently of the test data and the model elements must be adjusted every time different platforms of test data are used for prediction supplementary a second drawback involves the potential loss of important information by ignoring the genes in the training_dataset that are not found in the test_dataset important information from the training_set may be lost as a result the prediction_accuracy of gbp methods is unstable further instability arises because these methods are sensitive to noise in expression measurements we propose a module based prediction mbp strategy to overcome these aforementioned drawbacks in mbp groups of genes sharing similar expression_patterns rather than individual genes are used as the basic elements of the prediction model such an approach borrows information from genes similarity when genes are absent in test_sets by overcoming expression measurement noise and avoiding the problem of missing genes across platforms the mbp method is hypothesized to yield robust predictions completely_independent of information from the test data recently several similar approaches such as metagene supergene and gene pathway module methods which used unsupervised gene_cluster or supervised gene pathway_information instead of individual gene information as predictors have been reported and successfully_applied in microarray prediction however unlike the mbp method proposed here these methods mostly focus on improving prediction_accuracy rather than on the robustness issue in inter_study gene prediction models constructed by most of these methods are still inevitably voided by gene missingness or expression measurement noise in the test study in this article we will explore properties of the mbp strategy and compare them to those of the gbp approach we will show by simulation and applications to real microarray_datasets that mbp is more robust to gene missingness and expression measurement noise while not sacrificing prediction_accuracy we evaluate univariate gene module filter selection in three popular classification methods including k nearest_neighbor knn linear_discriminant lda and support_vector svm we also investigate an embedded method prediction analysis of microarray pam and a multivariate gene module selection method r svm conceptually the module based_approach can generally be applied to extend any existing classification_method an ideal prediction model should be highly_accurate robust and simple for clinical_utility to pursue these standards we developed the mbp method which takes_advantage of information from genes sharing similar expression_patterns the results of the current study show that the prediction_accuracies of the mbp method are slightly better than those of the gbp method in both within study and inter_study predictions furthermore the mbp method is superior to the gbp method in being robust to gene missingness and to experimental_noise the results show great_potential for mbp to improve inter_study prediction in microarray_studies and enhance the application of this technology to clinical practice in the literature it has been shown that multiple completely different prediction_models may generate equally_high prediction_accuracy for example the well known gene_signature to predict breast_cancer patient_survival was first proposed vant other investigators derived an additional six classifiers that performed as well as the gene_signature using the same dataset also disparity in using different gene_signatures to predict similar outcomes in different studies has been reported it is important to allow reasonable inter_study prediction validations in relevant published_studies the stability of the mbp method observed in the present study is the result of grouping genes sharing a similar expression pattern and selecting a gene that can represent the group of genes it has been postulated that using a cluster average would yield a higher prediction_accuracy under certain conditions although the mbp method only slightly outperforms the gbp method in prediction_accuracy the prediction robustness of mbp remains its major advantage the clinical_utility of a genomic prediction model relies heavily on the models simplicity and reproducibility recent cross_platform analyses used intersection genes across datasets an approach that required information from all datasets involved in the analysis this approach is appropriate for meta_analysis of biomarker_detection but is inadequate for crossplatform prediction there are two elements needed for a prediction i a selected gene_signature and ii a prediction model when the construction of a prediction model requires the common genes of training and test studies the selected prediction signature must be readjusted whenever a different platform of the test study is applied making it inconvenient to validate and for clinical use furthermore loss of training data information by including only intersection genes to build the prediction model makes this approach less desirable mbp is a natural solution to these hurdles a lack of reproducibility hinders the application of genomic prediction_models many factors may affect model reproducibility the mbp method focuses on two factors to increase model reproducibility gene missingness and experimental_noise the robustness of the mbp method toward missing genes was provided by grouped decision in modules and the rare probability of model failure is controlled by merging small modules to nearest modules in our algorithm the robustness of the method regarding expression measurement noise was assessed by testing on the luo dataset although the mbp method was robust to added noise the pattern of noise added may not adequately represent experimental variations in real_data further study will focus on evaluating real_data or introducing variation other than gaussian_noise in addition to demonstrating the clinical_applicability of mbp this study demonstrated some novel approaches in the algorithm first this is the first time that cluster sizes generated by k means are demonstrated to consistently follow a multinomial distribution and a cluster merging procedure is proposed to avoid model_prediction failure due to gene missingness second we used a representative gene with the closest summed distance to all other genes within a module similar to sample median concept in estimating mean parameter to summarize the module information which is an actual gene with better annotation and interpretation rather than using a pseudo gene such as eigen gene or averaged gene vector used in many methods although we do not have enough evidence to prove or argue the superiority of adopting median representative genes this procedure is conceptually more robust to accidental noises and has better interpretability third mbp reduced redundant gene features by summarizing similar gene_expression within each module diminishing gene collinearity and adding a novel technique for data reduction one limitation of the mbp method is the lack of correlation and interpretation of each module to known biological_pathways further investigation will be made to integrate pathways from biological_databases as supervised modules to improve the performance proper normalization across studies is another key to successful interstudy predictions our recent_publication has discussed the issue of genewise normalization in addition to commonly practiced sample wise normalization mbp proposed in this article focuses on robust inter_study prediction from another angle and can potentially be combined with these advanced normalization_methods to enhance prediction_accuracy recently deep sequencing_technology is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping analysis of methylation patterns identification of transcription_factor and quantification of gene_expression the digital quantification is far more precise than microarray although its widespread applicability is still now limited by its high_cost as the price goes down in the near future we expect increased popularity of this technology our proposed mbp method can be extended to analyze deep sequencing_data where the feature dimensionality is even higher than microarray_data the fast algorithm of k_means and the advantage of rapidly reducing dimensionality by gene_modules make mbp a perfect tool for such type of extremely high_throughput technology
