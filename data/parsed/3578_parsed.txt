sequence_analysis pipipes a set of pipelines for pirna and transposon analysis via small rna_seq rna_seq degradome and cage seq chip_seq and genomic_dna motivation piwi_interacting pirnas nt small silencing rnas repress transposon expression in the metazoan germ_line thereby protecting the genome although high_throughput has made it possible to examine the genome and transcriptome at unprecedented_resolution extracting useful information from giga bytes of sequencing_data still requires substantial computational skills additionally researchers may analyze and interpret the same data differently generating results that are difficult to reconcile to address_these we developed a coordinated set of pipelines pipipes to analyze pirna and transposon derived rnas from a variety of high_throughput libraries including small_rna rna degradome or methyl guanosine cap_analysis cage chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip and genomic dna_seq pipipes can also produce figures and tables suitable for publication by facilitating data analysis pipipes provides an opportunity to standardize computational_methods in the pirna field pirnas a class of nt_long small silencing rnas suppress transposon expression in the metazoan germ_line and in some animals the adjacent gonadal somatic_cells by preventing transposition the pirna pathway ensures that genetic_information passes faithfully to the next generation disruption of the pirna pathway typically leads to transposon mobilization double_stranded and sterility high_throughput have been widely deployed in the study of pirnas small rna_seq reveals the identity and abundance of pirnas rna_seq detects and quantifies mrna and transposon transcripts degradome seq also termed race seq detects the cleavage products of piwi proteins guided by pirnas chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq detects chromatin_modifications directed by pirnas or transcription_factor binding_events that regulate pirna precursor or target transcription and genomic_dna detects new transposition events caused by transposons that escape pirna repression or background differences between experimental strains and the assembled genome correctly extracting biological_knowledge from such voluminous data requires significant computational expertise and effort the repetitive nature of transposon sequences lays another layer of complexity moreover different laboratories use diverse methods to analyze and interpret data e g the way of treating reads that map to multiple_locations in a reference_genome to provide a standardized set of tools to analyze these diverse data types we developed pipipes a collection of integrated pipelines for small rna_seq rna_seq degradome and cap_analysis seq cage seq chip_seq and genome seq analyses
