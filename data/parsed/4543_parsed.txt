genome_analysis tedna a transposable_element de_novo assembler motivation recent_technological are allowing many laboratories to sequence their research organisms available de_novo as semblers leave repetitive portions of the genome poorly assembled some genomes contain high proportions of transposable_elements and transposable_elements appear to be a major force behind diversity and adaptation few de_novo assemblers for transposable_elements exist and most have either been designed for small_genomes or reads results in this article we present a new transposable_element de_novo assembler tedna which assembles a set of transposable_elements directly from the reads tedna uses illumina paired_end the most widely used sequencing_technology for de_novo and forms full_length transposable_elements availability_and tedna is available at http urgi versailles inra fr tools tedna under the gplv_license it is written in c and only requires the sparsehash package freely_available under the new bsd_license tedna can be used on standard computers with limited ram resources although it may also use large memory for better results most of the code is parallelized and thus ready for large infrastructures most laboratories can now afford sequencing a genome and several de_novo whole genome_assemblers such as velvet are available to assemble even larger genomes however these assemblers usually do not assemble the transposable_elements current_algorithms cannot correctly assemble highly repeated_sequences on the other hand transposable_elements can comprise of a genome and their role in the evolution of the host_genome has been often underlined although assembling the copies i e the traces of transposable_elements scattered along the genome often strongly mutated is usually impossible assembling the transposable_elements a model of the first element that invaded the genome reconstructed from the observable copies is a simpler task several de_novo transposable_elements assemblers have been presented so_far but most have been designed for small_genomes or assume that the technology have been used only repeatexplorer currently exploits illumina_reads here we present a new tool that reads illumina paired_end arguably the most widely used sequencing_technology for de_novo and provides a list of repeated elements a transposable_element de_novo assembler is somewhat different from a genome assembler it assembles sequences from multiple copies which have evolved through time a transposable_elements assembler should thus correctly handle polymorphism including long insertions_and basically every copy gives a hint about what the transposable_element should be but only the comparison with other copiesand the construction of a consensusmay help building the transposable_element as such de_bruijn used by many assemblers seem wellfitted for this purpose a k_mer of a copy may be part of the consensus transposable_element whereas other parts of the copy may not transposable_elements may thus be assembled as a set of highly repeated k_mers tedna is the first tool that uses a de_bruijn for transposable_element assembly implementation details are given in supplementary_material
