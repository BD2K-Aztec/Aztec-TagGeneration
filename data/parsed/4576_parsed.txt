the biological connection markup_language a sbgn compliant format for visualization filtering and analysis of biological_pathways motivation many models and analysis of signaling_pathways have been proposed however neither of them takes_into that a biological_pathway is not a fixed system but instead it depends on the organism tissue and cell_type as well as on physiological pathological and experimental_conditions results the biological connection markup_language bcml is a format to describe annotate and visualize pathways bcml is able to store multiple information permitting a selective view of the pathway as it exists and or behave in specific organisms tissues and cells furthermore bcml can be automatically converted into data_formats suitable for analysis and into a fully sbgn compliant graphical_representation making it an important tool that can be used by both computational_biologists and wet_lab scientists availability_and the xml schema and the bcml software_suite are freely_available under the lgpl for download at http bcml dc atlas net they are implemented_in and supported on ms windows linux and os x contact in a famous commentary regarding systems_biology yury lazebnik using the analogy between biological_pathways and electronic circuits proposed the use of standard_procedures through which even a biologistwithout any specific knowledgecould fix a radio one of the most challenging goals of modern biology is to decipher and describe the complexity of cell systems and what lazebnik pointed_out is that without the integration of knowledge coming from different fields of science the efforts of reverse_engineering the cell are destined to fail recently research on system biology has been characterized by an increasing number of efforts to define common languages for sharing_information in multidisciplinary areas with the aim to develop tools to describe accurate_models run effective simulations visualize analyze and integrate high_throughput data networks defined on studies about the interactions_occurring within cell macromolecules are key_elements for this research existing biological_networks can be classified into four categories depending on the nature of their nodes and their interactions metabolic_pathways molecular_interactions gene_regulatory and signaling_pathways there are many public resources which store and share representations of these networks including kegg reactome biocarta www biocarta org pathway_commons www pathwaycommons org and wikipathways yet currently there is no gold_standard on how biological_pathways should be represented this shortcoming affects particularly signaling_pathways without solid consistent and unambiguous representations hypotheses and analyses based on them are affected by an inability to do any proper computational_analysis in the worst_case and a loss of power in the best case furthermore a proper representation of a pathway is important to enable efficient knowledge_management and integration of data coming from multiple sources recent efforts on the representation of pathways have followed two main trends a proper graphical_representation and a machine_readable format on the basis of the existence and the use of graphical and machinereadable formats pathway representations can be classified into three categories static providing a non modifiable graphical_representation semi dynamic representing information not only as a graphical map but also using a corresponding machinereadable format which is not however strongly interconnected with the graph dynamic where the graphical_representation format depends directly on the underlying data model and thus any modification in the latter can be immediately translated to the former at the time of writing all pathway representations stored in public_databases are either static or semi dynamic the most recent example of a pure graphical_representation is the system biology graphical notation sbgn page
