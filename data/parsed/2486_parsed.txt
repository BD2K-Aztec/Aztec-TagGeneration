genome_analysis insights into structural_variations and genome_rearrangements in prokaryotic_genomes structural_variations svs are genomic_rearrangements that affect fairly_large fragments of dna most of the svs such as inversions deletions and translocations have been largely studied in context of genetic_diseases in eukaryotes however recent_studies demonstrate that genome_rearrangements can also have profound impact on pro karyotic genomes leading to altered cell phenotype in contrast to single_nucleotide svs provide a much deeper insight into organization of bacterial_genomes at a much better resolution svs can confer change in gene_copy creation of new genes altered gene_expression and many other functional consequences high_throughput have now made it possible to explore svs at a much refined resolution in bacterial_genomes through this review we aim to highlight the importance of the less explored field of svs in prokaryotic_genomes and their impact we also discuss its potential_applicability in the emerging fields of synthetic_biology and genome_engineering where targeted svs could serve to create sophisticated and accurate genome_editing the sequencing of a large number of prokaryotic_genomes and sequence comparison of closely_related have unraveled a large repertoire of genomic_variations a large number of studies focusing on variations in prokaryotic_genomes have been majorly concentrated on single_nucleotide and small insertiondeletion events it is now being increasingly_recognized that in addition to single_nucleotide other types of variations that include large genomic_rearrangements are not infrequent in bacterial_genomes among the different types of genetic_variations found in genomes structural_variants have remained the most difficult to identify and interpret structural_variations svs encompass a fairly_large piece of dna and can emerge as a result of different cellular_mechanisms such as dna_recombination replication and dna_repair svs introduce variability in gene_copy position orientation and in several cases combinations of these events the mechanisms of sv formation appears to be similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes b but svs have not been widely explored and studied in prokaryotic_genomes as compared with eukaryotes the comprehensive assessment of svs has been a challenge largely due to the underlying complex mechanisms that gives rise to them accurate and precise identification of svs would require prediction of three features namely copy content and structure over the years several approaches have been developed to detect and characterize svs some of the classical_methods include arraycgh array_comparative and single_nucleotide snp_arrays which have been extensively reviewed earlier arraycgh is based on hybridizing fluorescently_labeled sample with normal dna immobilized on a glass_surface and analyzing hybridization ratios snp_arrays on the other hand use single sample per array and measure the intensities of the probe signals on the basis of single base difference the major understanding on the genomic landscape of svs was facilitated by the availability of sequencing_technologies coupled with computational algorithms to map and identify svs at a much higher_resolution in sequencing based_approaches paired_end generated with an approximate insert_size are mapped onto the reference_genome the pairs mapping at a distance substantially different from expected length or in altered orientation are nominated as structural_variants svs identified by means of sequencing_data offer a strong advantage of detecting breakpoints i e sequence boundaries where an sv begins and ends which can further aid to unravel the functional impact of a variant and the mechanisms that created it though the high_throughput have significantly contributed to the understanding of the repertoire of svs in prokaryotic_genomes the problem of sv_detection has always remained challenging as none of the methods can appropriately address the complexity of repetitive_regions found in genomes it is widely believed that the svs arise as a by product of illegitimate recombination_events homologous_recombination and also by imprecise non homologous repair_mechanism to whom correspondence should be addressed during aberrant dna_replication to repair broken replication_forks apart from being the focus of evolutionary_analysis the phenotypic implications of svs in bacterial_genomes have also been deciphered which are discussed in detail in the later part of the manuscript in this review we provide a comprehensive_overview of the present understanding of svs in general and in the context of prokaryotic_genomes we briefly describe the various types of svs discuss their probable molecular_mechanisms of formation advances in the development of tools and techniques to detect svs and also their phenotypic consequences in context of prokaryotic_genomes we also discuss currently used methodologies of next_generation ngs and analysis algorithms which could provide a comprehensive and high_resolution map of svs and how they could be extensively used for understanding biological_phenomena of strain variability and evolution we also describe their potential applications in the emerging fields of synthetic_biology and genome_engineering
