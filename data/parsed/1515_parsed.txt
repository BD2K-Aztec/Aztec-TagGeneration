easy retrieval of single amino_acid polymorphisms and phenotype information using swissvar the swissvar portal provides access to a comprehensive collection of single amino_acid polymorphisms and diseases in the uniprotkb_swiss database via a unique search_engine in particular it gives direct access to the newly improved swiss_prot variant pages the key strength of this portal is that it provides a possibility to query for similar diseases as well as the underlying protein products and the molecular_details of each variant in the context of the recently_proposed molecular view on diseases the swissvar portal should be in a unique position to provide_valuable for researchers and to advance research in this area availability the swissvar portal is available at www expasy org swissvarhuman variation data is one of the most valuable information originating from the human_genome hgp the current challenge is how to optimally exploit this data to better understand disease association and accelerate the pace towards personalized treatments indeed there are still numerous unanswered_questions on the exact relationship between genetic_variations phenotypes and diseases a plethora of databases or prediction_tools exist among the databases only few are central databases covering mutations on all genes they are mostly genecentric with little information related to the proteome the disease and phenotype information are also currently unstructured making specific queries difficult this is a pity particularly in the context of the recently_proposed molecular view on diseases which emphasizes the relationship between the disease phenotypic networks and the underlying protein interaction or functional_networks indeed the possibility to query for similar diseases as well as the underlying protein products and the molecular_details of each variant might prove extremely useful for researchers to study a particular family of disorders or to formulate hypotheses for further research to whom correspondence should be addressed in this article we present the swissvar portal www expasy org swissvar which provides access to a comprehensive collection of single amino_acid polymorphisms saps and diseases in the uniprotkb_swiss knowledgebase via a unique search_engine this represents nearly diseases and human protein variations release in addition swissvar gives direct access to the newly improved swiss_prot variant pages that are widely cited by the community but can not be queried up to now with the completion of the human_proteome the uniprotkb swissprot database has a complete collection of human proteins with increasingly detailed functional_annotation the swissvar portal gives access to this wealth of data by further providing the possibility to gather proteins variants related to similar diseases and allowing queries on variants using a range of sequence and structural_parameters further improvement of the portal and the information content is planned first data coverage the current saps coverage is clearly not exhaustive however as a partner of the gen phen consortium www gen phen org it is anticipated that data related to saps from consortium members will be made visible via uniprotkb and the swiss_prot variants pages as such the swissvar portal will continue to gain its value as the amount of data grows second disease terminology phenotype information the portal currently relies on mesh classification that offers a reasonably broad coverage of diseases including genetic_diseases the classification is nevertheless not entirely based on phenotypic similarities incorporating comprehensive structured phenotype information could enhance the disease query new resources such as human phenotype ontology are currently being studied for this purpose finally it is planned that pathway_information will be incorporated in the near future to allow seamless_integration and search between diseases phenotypes pathways and detailed sequence and structural_information of the variants in summary the swissvar portal provides a unique environment and search facility to investigate the relationship between human variants and phenotypes with a particular focus on human_proteome to the knowledge of the authors no online servers offer this kind of search possibilities that directly link molecular_details of saps to disease classification the current application also illustrates our ongoing effort in bridging biological and medical_information the swissvar portal can be accessed via www expasy org swissvar
