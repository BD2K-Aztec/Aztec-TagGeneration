sequence_analysis boulder alignment editor ale a web_based rna alignment_tool the explosion of interest in non_coding together with improvements in rna x_ray has led to a rapid increase in rna_structures at atomic_resolution from in to in the success of whole_genome has led to an explosive_growth of unaligned homologous_sequences consequently there is a compelling and urgent need for user_friendly tools for producing structure informed rna alignments most alignment software considers the primary sequence alone some specialized alignment software can also include watsoncrick base_pairs but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data therefore we have developed the boulder alignment editor ale which is a web_based rna alignment editor designed for editing and assessing alignments using structural_information some features of boulderale include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment based on isostericity of watsoncrick and non watsoncrick base_pairs along with the collapsing horizontally and vertically of the alignment while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment the rnaalignment ontology provides several key recommendations that are essential for the development of a user_friendly editor of alignments of a few dozen to a few hundred sequences consisting of a few hundred base_pairs these are i the incorporation of concepts introduced by the rna ontology in particular the leontiswesthof classification system for nonwatsoncrick base_pairs which are the building_blocks of tertiary motifs ii the annotation of specific regions within the structures e g the p helix of rnase p which can be used to support alternative notions of correspondence sequence level versus structure level including homology and iii the ability to perform both horizontal_and collapsing of the alignment allowing the user to focus on specific sequences or on specific regions of the alignment several additional considerations that are especially useful for curating large_databases of structured rnas such as rfam the rnase p database and the trna database are i the functionality to dynamically score an alignmentplotted this workflow is illustrated in finally features can be mapped onto the alignment and boulderale allows the alignment to be vertically or horizontally collapsed to focus the users attention on specific taxa or regions of the sequence in practice it is often useful to do this iteratively cleaning up a particular region of the alignment in each of several closely_related groups of sequences then aligning the groups of sequences to each other to reveal higher_level correspondences that rely more on structure than on sequence
