genetics_and inferring rare_disease risk_variants based on exact probabilities of sharing by multiple affected relatives motivation family based designs are regaining popularity for gen_omic sequencing studies because they provide a way to test co segregation with disease of variants that are too rare in the population to be tested individually in a conventional casecontrol study results where only a few affected subjects per family are sequenced the probability that any variant would be shared by all affected relativesgiven it occurred in any one family memberpro vides evidence against the null_hypothesis of a complete absence of linkage and association a p value can be obtained as the sum of the probabilities of sharing events as or more extreme in one or more families we generalize an existing closed form expression for exact sharing probabilities to more than two relatives per family when pedigree founders are related we show that an approximation of sharing probabilities based on empirical estimates of kinship among founders obtained from genome_wide marker data is accurate for low levels of kinship we also propose a more generally_applicable approach based on monte_carlo we applied this method to a study of multiplex_families with apparent non syndromic forms of oral_clefts from four distinct populations with whole exome sequences available for two or three affected_members per family the rare single_nucleotide rs in adamts shared by affected relatives in three indian families achieved significance after correcting for multiple_comparisons p availability_and source_code of the r package rvsharing are freely_available for download at http cran r project org_web rvsharing index html the advent_of of whole exomes and even whole genomes opens the possibility of detecting rare_variants rvs including those unique to a family and alleles up to a frequency of in a population impacting human_health the first successful applications of exome_sequencing have been with rare mendelian traits a common study_design to discover highly_penetrant causal_variants that are rare in families where previous genotyping has not been performed is to sequence the exome or increasingly the whole_genome of two or three affected subjects and focus on novel variants predicted to be functional and shared by all sequenced family_members as likely causal_variants contrary to monogenic mendelian traits considerable genetic_heterogeneity must be expected with complex_diseases familial forms of numerous common complex_diseases are caused by rvs supporting the hypothesis that rvs may explain a part of the so_called missing_heritability of these diseases although the extent of the contribution of rvs to complex disease heritability is an ongoing_debate in a family where cases cluster there is a high_probability that multiple affected_members carry the same rare_disease predisposing variant if such a variant exists and its penetrance is high this gives an advantage to family samples over the samples of unrelated_individuals where disease_causing rvs may be seen only once or twice among tens_of of subjects as with mendelian_disorders it has initially been proposed to use the rv sharing_information to filter out rvs not shared in at least one family for variants sufficiently rare so copies in the sequenced relatives are almost certainly identical by descent ibd the probability that an rv independent of the disease and detected in at least one sequenced subject would not be shared by other sequenced relatives who are affected was computed byto quantify the effectiveness of what they call the concordance filter in discarding irrelevant rvs we adopt the view that the probability that an rv would to whom correspondence should be addressed be shared by all affected relatives in a familygiven it occurs in any one of themcomputed disregarding the disease phenotype can be used to quantify evidence against the null_hypothesis of absence of linkage and association to the disease and therefore establish that the rv may predispose to disease we emphasize that rv sharing probabilities are not the same as ibd_sharing probabilities a parentoffspring pair carries dna from three distinct chromosomes at any locus one the parent and offspring share ibd one in the parent and one in the offspring the probability they share one allele ibd is hence equal to however a rv seen in one of the two relatives is present on only one of the three chromosomes the probability that this chromosome is the one shared ibd is so parentoffspring pairs are informative for rv sharing analysis whereas they are uninformative for ibd_sharing based linkage_analysis for more distant relationships rv sharing probabilities remain smaller than ibd_sharing probabilities as explained in section this information can be combined across all the families where the rv is seen if more than one occurs mathematical expressions generalizing sharing probabilities to more than two relatives per family are given in the section this approach for calculating sharing probabilities does not require knowledge of the actual variant allele_frequency in the population and only assumes there is no identity by state ibs without ibd among sequenced family_members we illustrate that these calculated sharing probabilities are good approximations of the true ibs sharing probabilities for allele_frequencies up to and also explore the power of the test based on these probabilities to detect disease_susceptibility rvs using relative pairs under genetic_heterogeneity models in addition to variant rarity the known pedigree must be correct in particular all founders are unrelated to insure a variant is introduced only once in the family cryptic relatedness can often be detected from dense marker genotype data when founders of a known pedigree are related an rv may be introduced more than once leading to greater actual sharing probabilities than the value computed based on the known pedigree and to an overstatement of the evidence against the null we examine the impact of unknown relationships and propose to approximate the sharing probability using kinship coefficients among founders estimated empirically from genome_wide marker data on family_members the validity of the approximation is evaluated in a simulation of small_populations we then apply the rv sharing probability computation to a whole_exome study of multiplex_families with apparent non syndromic forms of oral_clefts from four distinct populations oral_clefts are the most common craniofacial malformations representing a good example of a genetically_heterogeneous with at least a dozen different genes previously_identified as genetic risk_factors via genome_wide in this article we propose using the probability of sharing of an rv by affected subjects under the null_hypothesis of complete absence of linkage and association between an rv and disease status to build evidence against this null_hypothesis in the context of exome_sequencing of complex_diseases in family samples this approach will be successful at finding rvs with high_penetrance for diseases where such variants are involved we have presented formulas to compute exact probabilities of sharing of an rv by any number of affected subjects in arbitrary non inbred pedigrees under the assumption the variant is sufficiently rare to be introduced only once in the pedigree generalizing a previous formula applicable to two affected subjects it is important to stress that more information is extracted in this approach from each family than in the case of testing for linkage alone because we require the rv in question and not any allele to be shared this is most easily illustrated with two relatives of degree d for which the probability of sharing an allele ibd is d while the rv sharing probability is d the ratio p pwill tend to as d tends to infinity so rv sharing is more informative for making inference on a particular rv in families where the rv is seen our power study indicated moderate to good power to detect highly_penetrant variants with a small number of families where the variant is observed power declines as the relative_risk decreases but if several rvs are involved in a heterogeneous disease the probability of finding at least one would remain good even if power is low first cousin pairs provided more power than second cousin and parentoffspring pairs under genetic_heterogeneity and dominant effect of the variant the model most compatible with rvs causing disease in unilineally related subjects the assumption that a rv is sufficiently rare for being almost certainly ibd among relatives is crucial to the validity of the rv sharing probabilities we recommend performing an analysis of sensitivity to this assumption for any potential finding as we have done for the two hits in the oral_clefts study a potential pitfall with rv sharing probabilities based on a known pedigree structure is the possibility of cryptic relatedness among founders that would make the actual null sharing probability greater than the one computed here we have developed an adjustment to rv sharing probabilities based on estimates of the kinship coefficients among founders of known pedigrees under the assumption of equal kinship coefficients for all pairs of founders our simulation_study on a pedigree whose founders were drawn from larger pedigrees representing small_populations showed the approximation is accurate when the mean kinship coefficient among founders of the known pedigree is no greater than the kinship coefficient of second cousins once removed but will underestimate rv sharing probabilities with closer relationships the simulation_study also revealed an accurate approximation can be achieved using monte_carlo sampling with a reasonable number of draws for sharing probabilities of the order of an important aspect of our adjustment for unknown relationships is to be based solely on estimated kinship between founders and not require an estimate of the rv frequency in the population from which the pedigree founders were drawn we have proposed a formula to estimate mean kinship among founders based on the kinship estimates between sequenced subjects a number of methods can be used to estimate kinship coefficients from genome_wide genotype data and an appraisal of these methods is beyond the scope of this article because our approximation_method requires only a mean kinship coefficient between founders variation in the length of genome shared by pairs of subjects is smoothed by averaging using a population average instead of the true average over the founder pairs of the pedigree had a moderate impact on the error in our simulation_study for this work we have implemented the formulas to compute our numerical approximation of the rv sharing probability allowing for relatedness among founders and assess the sensitivity to allele_frequency specifically for the family structures shown_inand supplementaryand reported in supplementary table s developing an implementation of these formulas to general pedigree structures remains_challenging however these checks of the analysis assumptions can also be performed by monte_carlo implemented in the rvsharing r package in our extension of the rv sharing probability to more than two subjects we considered only the probability that all affected sequenced subjects share the rv this is appropriate for three affected subjects sequenced in a pedigree as in the oral cleft study where causal rvs not shared by all sequenced subjects are indistinguishable from benign rvs however it is too stringent a requirement when larger numbers of affected subjects from large multiplex_families are sequenced given the intrafamilial heterogeneity in disease causes typical of complex_traits at the same time with n sequenced subjects in a family the event that n or n affected subjects out of n share an rv is itself evidence against the null_hypothesis the computation of the probability of such events in pedigrees of arbitrary structure will require further work non affected family_members may also be included in future sequencing studies while sequencing non affected family_members has been used to exclude private benign variation in studies of mendelian traits this risks excluding causal_variants showing incomplete_penetrance in studies of complex_traits an affected only analysis of rv sharing protects against unaffected carriers reducing evidence for a variant in the same way as it does in linkage_analysis sequence_data on non affected family_members in particular subjects marrying into the pedigree will still be useful in narrowing down the number of founders that could have introduced a given rv in the pedigree and refine these rv sharing probabilities the methods and analyses presented are limited to considering a single rv at a time our results illustrate how with a few families it is possible to obtain substantial evidence of cosegregation between a rv and disease yet rare causal_variants found in a single family were not considered in our analysis of these multiplex cleft families because individual families provide limited information a combined analysis of multiple rvs from the same functional_unit typically the same gene will be needed to detect significant rv sharing at that level various issues still need to be resolved to implement such analysis in particular dealing with multiple rvs within the same family this will be the object of future work
