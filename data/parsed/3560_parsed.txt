sequence_analysis pico inplace inversions between human and chimpanzee motivation there have been several studies on the micro inversions between human and chimpanzee but there are large discrepancies among their results furthermore all of them rely on alignment procedures or existing alignment results to identify inversions however the core alignment procedures do not take very small inversions into consideration therefore their analyses cannot find inversions that are too small to be detected by a classic aligner we call such inversions pico inversions results we re analyzed humanchimpanzee alignment from the ucsc_genome for micro inplace inversions and screened for pico inplace inversions using a likelihood_ratio we report that the quantity of inplace inversions between human and chimpanzee is substantially greater than what had previously been discovered we also present the software_tool picoinversionminer to detect pico inplace inversions between closely_related availability software_tools scripts and result data are available atan inversion is a genomic rearrangement where a piece of dna is replaced by its reverse complement and re inserted into the genome when the reversed dna piece is re inserted at its original site it is called an inplace inversion very large inversions can be observed under a microscope reported nine such largescale inversions between human and chimpanzee submicroscopic inversions are discovered by sequence analyses and are called microinversions their sizes range from dozens to millions of bases most studies focusing on micro inversions rely on genomic alignments therefore the shortest detectable micro inversion is limited by the shortest significant alignment we call the inversions that are too small to be detected by a genomic aligner pico inversions there has not been any explicit study on pico inversions their existence and prevalence have been unknown characterization of inversions has been useful in any aspects of biomedical_research suggested that very large inversions might have been responsible for a speed up of the speciation of human and chimpanzee there is also evidence that inversions are related to some diseases and may suppress recombination there have been reports of inversion polymorphism in human_genomes indicating that inversion is an important feature of intraspecies genomic_structure breakpoints defined by inversions have been used extensively in genome comparison and ancestral_genome reconstruction used inversions to reconstruct a phylogenetic species_tree as a new approach to supplement the traditional phylogenetic_analysis based on substitutions alone we observed that some spurious alignments in multispecies alignments are caused by undetected inversions discovering such inversions and correcting their alignments can improve alignment_quality which in turn can improve the accuracy of downstream data analysis based on alignments although human and chimpanzee are the most closely_related the studies on micro inversions between them showed large discrepancies the earliest result reported putative inversions and later it was found that the majority of these were artifacts reported inversions and the refined method ofidentified a similar number of inversions however only of inversions were consistent in these studies reported inversions among which could be clearly characterized these discrepancies indicate that identifying inversions is difficult even for closely_related the problem is even more difficult for more distantly_related because of greater sequence_divergence higher frequency of inversions and higher likelihood that the inversions are nested all these studies rely on alignments produced by blastz now updated to lastz though the methodology remains largely the same which is used by major comparative_genomic resources such as the ucsc_genome hereafter referred to as the browser below we illustrate some limitations of blastz in aligning inversions as these observations will guide us in looking for missing micro inversions in the whole_genome alignment by examining this typical genomic aligner we argue that there exist pico inversions that are not detectable by the existing alignment tools briefly blastz aligns two sequences that are soft masked where repetitive_sequences are distinguished from non repetitive ones blastz starts by collecting hits between two non repetitive_sequences using a seed of a certain pattern then extends them dot plot illustration of a missing inversion in a repeat region the black and grey colors indicate non repeat and repeat sequences respectively the black and grey diagonal lines are alignments from the browser the gaps are insertion s in human and or deletion s in chimpanzee gaplessly in both directions and finally extends them further while allowing gaps to form alignment blocks once there is an alignment between non repetitive_sequences it behaves as an anchor and extends into the flanking_regions where repetitive_sequences can be aligned however some orthologous repeats cannot be aligned due to large indels that block the alignment extension from the anchor in the alignments in non repeat regions extend into repeats as indicated by the gray diagonal lines but there is no alignment on the browser between human positions hg chr b and e the corresponding locations in chimpanzee are pantro chr b and e the dotted diagonal line is a missing alignment due to the big gaps blocking the alignment extension a long_run of unsequenced positions which is not rare in the chimpanzee assembly has the same effect as a big gap to obtain the alignments of inversions one sequence is aligned to the reverse complement of the other since there are fewer orthologous non repetitive_sequences on the reverse strand assuming the majority of the sequence is not inverted there are fewer alignment anchors to extend into repeat regions therefore it is more difficult to align inversions in genomic_regions with repeats again in the dotted antidiagonal line shows a missing inversion discovered in our study in this example when aligning human sequence with the reverse complement of chimpanzee sequence there is no hit because hits are only collected between non repetitive_sequences and therefore there is no alignment even after blastz correctly produces an inversion as an alignment block it may be screened out in a post_processing step such as chainnet at the browser since chain net gives preference to a long alignment block when an inversion is surrounded by strong alignments its flanking alignments may be so strong that they compensate for the low score produced by the misalignment in the middle and the real inversion is discarded showed an example where an inversion of bases was screened out in chain net and spurious alignment was presented where the inversion was supposed to be indels in alignments can be as small as just one base since the gapped extension step in the alignment procedure is done via a dynamic_programming model which explicitly accounts for gaps as short as one base however inversions do not enjoy such special treatment in the computational_model it was pointed_out that rearrangements may happen at all scales but small rearrangements are not detected by the alignment because the aligner is not designed to handle such small rearrangements the shortest inversion found in large_scale alignments is determined by the alignment significance score threshold together with other alignment parameters for example an alignment match has a score of or by default in blastz and the default alignment significance score threshold is assuming that there is no gap or mismatch in an alignment the shortest significant alignment is around bases this tells us that the shortest inversion that is detectable by blastz and thereafter chain net is also around this size one cannot just simply decrease the alignment significance score threshold to find the shorter inversions because it will produce a large number of spurious alignments here we present an approach to detect pico inplace inversions between human and chimpanzee since there are large discrepancies among previous_studies on micro inversions we conduct our own analysis on micro inversions and apply several rules to ensure accuracy of our discoveries since our goal of identifying microinversions is to help study pico inplace inversions we restrict our analysis to micro inplace inversions after we obtain microinversions we have an initial under estimate of the inversion rate between human and chimpanzee we look for pico inversions starting from this initial rate and update it once we obtain convincing pico inversions after several rounds of updating this rate stabilizes and gives us a more accurate estimate on the number of inplaceinversions between two genomes the pipeline of detecting picoinplace inversions is implemented in picoinversionminer we use out group information to preliminarily verify the pico inversions between human and chimpanzee detected by this tool and use simulations to systematically evaluate the tool we used hg pantro chain net alignment from the browser to detect both micro and pico inplace inversions between human and chimpanzee here we present the results and analyze the basic_characteristics of these inversions for micro inversions we compared our result with the result of for pico inversions we conducted a preliminary verification based on out group information shows the counts of different types of micro inplaceinversions between human and chimpanzee we see that the counts depend on the threshold of the distance from the inversion to its flanking alignment blocks the shorter the distance threshold themore significant evidence that the inversion is inplace note that because type_iii inversions are the ones found inside alignment blocks they are all surrounded by nearby alignments from the same alignment block therefore the counts of type_iii inversions are the same for different distance thresholds we take the value of to compute the initia p inv since this count is the most consistent with what was reported in shows the length_distribution of micro inplace inversions that are shorter than bases it is obvious from the plot that shorter inversions have higher_frequencies in general which also implies the existence and prevalence of pico inversions we performed a preliminary comparison of these inversions with the of of the inversions detected by were converted from hg to hg by liftover from the browser assume two inversions from two studies are consistent if their human sequences overlap among the result of inversions are consistent with the type i inversions with the type_ii inversions and none with the type_iii inversions therefore about of inversions fromare found in our study we took a closer look at the rest that were not found in our study among these inversions human sequences are aligned in hg pantro chain net with of their lengths and inversions human sequences are aligned to the positive strand of chimpanzee in hg pantro chain net this indicates that the discrepancies on these inversions are largely due to the assembly and alignment differences the remaining inversions are not reported in our study either because there are nearby rearrangements and the inversions are determined not to be inplace in our study or because their pips are which is a criterion of orthologous alignment specified in section
