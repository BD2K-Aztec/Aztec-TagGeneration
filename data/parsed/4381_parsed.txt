sequence_analysis spolpred rapid and accurate prediction of mycobacterium_tuberculosis spoligotypes from short genomic_sequences spoligotyping is a well established genotyping technique based on the presence of unique dna_sequences in mycobacterium_tuberculosis mtb the causal_agent of tuberculosis disease tb although advances in sequencing_technologies are leading to whole_genome bacterial characterization tens_of of isolates have been spoligotyped giving a global view of mtb strain diversity to bridge the gap we have developed spolpred a software to predict the spoligotype from raw sequence_reads our approach is compared with experimentally and de_novo determined strain types in a set of mtb isolates in silico and experimental_results are identical for almost all isolates however spolpred detected five experimentally false spoligotypes and was more accurate and faster than the assembling strategy application of spolpred to an additional seven isolates with no laboratory data led to types that clustered with identical experimental types in a phylogenetic_analysis using single_nucleotide our results demonstrate the usefulness of the tool and its role in revealing experimental limitations availability_and spolpred is written in c and is available from www pathogenseq org spolpred tuberculosis is an infectious_disease caused by bacterium of the mycobacterium_tuberculosis mtb complex genotyping techniques based on the presence of repetitive_elements conserved_sequences or loci with variable numbers of tandem_repeats have been standardized allowing the comparison of isolates between laboratories and regions worldwide the popular spoligotyping approach exploits the polymorphism at the direct repeat dr locus of mtb it is based on the polymerase_chain pcr_amplification of short unique_sequences termed spacers found between well conserved bp drs and the subsequent hybridization of the products onto a membrane with oligonucleotides complementary to each spacer since strains vary in the occurrence of particular spacers each sample produces a distinctive spot pattern which is then translated into a numerical code of digits known as octal code the web_based database sitvitweb contains shared types or spoligotype international types sits found among clinical_isolates subsequently grouped into a list of lineages sublineages which normally show a geographic_distribution in silico genotyping approaches are required to bridge the gap between experimental and high_throughput leading to the development of spolpred a software to predict the spoligotype from raw sequence_reads coverage nevertheless processed reads per unit of time remained_constant reads per minute spolpred inferred sit numbers matched the experimental ones for samples the resulting octal codes from both in silico approaches were identical for of the samples with experimental_results see supplementary table s for detailed results in the remaining two isolates de_novo failed to detect spacer which happens to fall between contiguous assembled_contigs the overall five non matched in silico and experiment results were due to the increased in silico sensitivity of the detection of spacer in the five samples and additionally spacer in one sample when the original hybridization blots were checked an irregular signal distribution for spacer across all samples was noted some signals were either too faint or just not detectable to be manually assigned as being present although predicted spoligotypes remained_unchanged for samples and the other three and which had octal codes not previously_reported in the sitvitweb database were re assigned to different spoligotypes interestingly these three isolates are consistently clustered in the snp based dendogram i e within a clade of samples having the same experimental type similarly all samples with no laboratory data were clustered with isolates of the same predicted spoligotype although snps and other genetic_variation derived from sequencing_projects are likely to become the markers of choice due to their discriminatory_power pcr genotyping techniques are still widely_employed in this regard spolpred will enable the complementary comparison of computationally inferred spoligotypes with laboratory results currently the tedious parameter_optimization and computational requirements for de_novo are important constraints only spoligotypes could be accurately inferred using the de_novo strategy implemented the region in the dr locus harbouring spacer does not seem to be reconstructed in two genomes resulting in an incorrect type classification importantly in those five samples for which spolpred and experimental patterns differ predicted octal codes were exactly the same when using both computational_approaches furthermore the newly assigned spoligotypes namely isolates and in are clustered with other isolates having coincident experimental and in silico predicted lineages the absent sequence responsible for the discrepancies observed namely spacer was the same across all five problematic isolates the ambiguous distinction of this spacer has been reported and explained in terms of the presence of a nt deletion adjacent to the amplified sequence van which would not allow a proper primer hybridization other ambiguities caused by the insertion of is copies in the dr region have also been reported as demonstrated the software can be employed to accurately and quickly confirm experimentally_determined spoligotypes infer them from sequenced isolates with no laboratory data and reveal unexpected cases of wrongly assigned types other causes of tb misclassification such as laboratory cross_contamination pcr contamination or ambiguous hybridization patterns could also be clarified with the amount of sequence_data increasingly growing software like spolpred will be useful additions to pipelines used to infer tb e g miru_vntr and other bacterial_strain types e g mlst typing and ultimately assist with disease control
