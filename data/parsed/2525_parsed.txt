gene_expression integrative mixture of experts to combine clinical factors and gene markers motivation microarrays are being increasingly used in cancer research to better characterize and classify tumors by selecting marker_genes however as very few of these genes have been validated as predictive_biomarkers so_far it is mostly conventional clinical and pathological_factors that are being used as prognostic_indicators of clinical course combining clinical data with gene_expression data may add valuable information but it is a challenging_task due to their categorical versus continuous characteristics we have further developed the mixture of experts me methodology a promising approach to tackle complex non linear problems several variants are proposed in integrative me as well as the inclusion of various gene_selection methods to select a hybrid signature results we show on three cancer studies that prediction_accuracy can be improved when combining both types of variables furthermore the selected genes were found to be of high relevance and can be considered as potential biomarkers for the prognostic selection of cancer_therapy availability integrative me is implemented in the r package integrativeme http cran r project org in clinical cancer studies the primary treatment of localized cancer is either complete tumor_excision with or without radiotherapy the addition of systemic adjuvant_therapies such as chemotherapy or hormonal treatment has been shown to increase the chance of long_term but also to increase side_effects and costs strong prognostic_factors are therefore needed to predict more accurately the disease outcome as this would help physicians make treatment_decisions various clinical or pathological_factors have been evaluated as prognosis factors for example the treatment of primary breast_cancer is often based on factors such as age lymph_node tumors size among others and also cell biological estrogen_receptor although these factors provide to whom correspondence should be addressed valuable information about the risk of recurrence they are generally considered not to be sufficient to predict individual patient_outcomes and determine an individual patients need for systemic adjuvant_therapy in some cases for example patients with the same clinical parameters can have different clinical_courses dna microarray_based technology is seen as a great_potential to gain new insight into cell_biology and biological_pathways this technology has been mostly used to further delineate cancer subgroups or to identify candidate_genes for cancer_prognosis and therapeutic_targeting however even though the identified gene_signature was promising e g the gene_signature from vant the clinical_applications resulting from microarray statistical analyzes remain somewhat limited this might be due to the complex and noisy nature of microarray_data utilizing both clinical factors and genetic_markers may add complementary information and may lead to a more accurate prognostic another reason to combine both types of variables is purely economical indeed if the combination of clinical factors and a small number of biomarkers would suffice to either i improve the prognostic prediction or ii reduce the number of biomarkers while performing as good as when using a bigger set of genes alone this would imply major cost cutting in biomarkers driven clinical treatments to this end a first step would be to select a combined signature of both gene_expressions and clinical factors which would be used in an appropriate statistical methodology then the last step would be to assess if the selected genes can be considered as potential biomarkers for the clinic the combination of both markers is a challenging_task for two reasons first both types of variables do not measure the same entity while microarray_data are homogeneous as the expression levels of genes or transcripts are measured clinical_variables are heterogeneous in their nature as they can measure the age of the patient but also the size of the tumor or the gender second most clinical_variables are of a categorical type or are discretized by the physician whereas microarray_data are continuous data developing an appropriate methodology that can handle both types of variables thus raises some statistical challenges related work few methodologies have been proposed so_far to combine clinical factors and gene_expression to improve cancer_prognosis in a general framework proposed conditional inference trees to deal with various types of variables closer to our focus of application several authors analyzed the vantwe have presented a method to combine categorical clinical factors and continuous gene_expression variables in a hybrid signature we have shown that the gene selection_step did yield important biological_insights into the cancer studies these genes should be investigated further to validate them as potential biomarkers the me methodology was improved by proposing different gating networks function to combine clinical factors and gene_expression in addition three different gene_selection procedures were proposed that improved the prognosis prediction_accuracy on three cancer studies we also investigated the gain in accuracy when selecting clinical_variables based on the outcome status the accuracy was improved for the independent gating function in integrative me but in general we showed that the location model sufficed to give good results as the number of clinical_variables was small furthermore we showed that sensitivity_and criteria were generally improved with integrative me therefore both types of variables should not be neglected or separately analyzed indeed although microarray_data can help uncover new features into cancer cell_biology cancer_prognosis cannot solely rely on microarray_data without taking_into the clinical_characteristics of the patients conversely clinical factors have valuable information about the risk of recurrence but they lack accuracy to determine the need of systemic adjuvant_therapy the availability of larger_scale involving the records of a larger number of clinical_variables will undoubtedly allow better improvements in the prediction_accuracy as we will be able to select disease specific clinical_variables that are more closely_related to the cancer study
