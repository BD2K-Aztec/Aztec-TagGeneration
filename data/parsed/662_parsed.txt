systems_biology basylica a tool for automatic processing of a bacterial live_cell array live_cell array lca technology allows the acquisition of high_resolution time course profiles of bacterial gene_expression by the systematic_assessment of fluorescence in living_cells carrying either transcriptional or translational fluorescent protein fusion however the direct estimation of promoter_activities by time dependent derivation of the fluorescence datasets generates high levels of noise here we present basylica a user_friendly open_source interface and database dedicated to the automatic storage and standardized treatment of lca data data_quality reports are generated automatically growth_rates and promoter_activities are calculated by tunable discrete kalman filters that can be set to incorporate data from biological_replicates significantly_reducing the impact of noise measurement in activity estimations availability the basylica software and the related documentation are available atdespite recent_developments in transcriptomic technologies direct rna_sequencing and tiling_array approaches require tedious sample preparations for this reason they are not suitable for transcriptional high_resolution time courses that require one microarray and or messenger_rna mrna extraction per timepoint an alternative approach is to measure the transcriptional_activity of promoters using reporter_genes in the last decade fluorescent_proteins in particular green_fluorescent gfp have become widely used major advances have come from the characterization and development of fast folding gfp monomer variants fluorescent reporters allow the high_temporal measurement of promoter_activity in living_cells live_cell array lca technology involves the generation of a large collection of strains that harbour transcriptional fusions with fast folding fluorescent_proteins and monitoring their accumulation under the appropriate conditions the promoter_activity profiles of up to individual gfp fusions in cells grown in microtiter_plates can be obtained at once at very high_resolution by determining the difference in fluorescence levels at successive timepoints promoter_activation or deactivation can be easily detected by an increase or a decrease in the fluorescence accumulation rate this high_throughput technology was proven to be an accurate and versatile method of determining gene_expression in escherichia_coli promoters subjected to a glucose lactose diauxic shift experiment we previously described the development of the plasmid pbasysbioii constructed within the framework of the eu funded basysbio systems_biology program http www basysbio eu for use in the lca analysis of gene_expression in bacillus_subtilis however no tools have been developed to facilitate the analysis of the quickly growing bacterial lca datasets here we report the development of a user_friendly software basylica for the storage and analysis of lca data basylica is dedicated to wet_lab biologists for the analysis of large_amounts of lca data in microplates as a proof_of we produced and analysed lca data for several promoters using b subtilis as a model bacterium and the newly_developed pbasysbioii plasmid see supplementary_information
