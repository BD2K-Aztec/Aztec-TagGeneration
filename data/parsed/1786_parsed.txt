structural_bioinformatics fast protein_fragment similarity scoring using a binet cauchy kernel motivation meaningful scores to assess protein_structure similarity are essential to decipher protein_structure and sequence_evolution the mining of the increasing number of protein_structures requires fast and accurate similarity_measures with statistical_significance whereas numerous approaches have been proposed for protein_domains as a whole the focus is progressively moving to a more local_level of structure analysis for which similarity measurement still remains without any satisfactory answer results we introduce a new score based on binetcauchy kernel it is normalized and bounded between maximal similarity that implies exactly the same conformations for protein fragmentsand mirror_image conformations the unrelated conformations having a null mean score this allows for the search of both similar and mirror conformations in addition such score addresses two major_issue of the widely used root_mean rmsd first it achieves length independent statistics even for short fragments second it shows better performance in the discrimination of medium range rmsd values being simpler and faster to compute than the rmsd it also provides the means for large_scale mining of protein_structures availability_and the computer software implementing the score is available at http bioserv rpbs univ paris diderot fr bcscore when analyzing biological_processes similarity_measures and statistical_significance are one of the major means we have to establish relationships and infer models underlying observations in the field of protein_structure the matter of quantifying similarity between two structures is a long_standing objective as it is an essential key to decipher protein sequencestructurefunction relationships and further to classify them protein similarity_search can be performed at a global and a local_level whole structure comparisons provide general information about protein classification and protein functions at a more local_level fragment comparison and identification has become a key_step for protein_structure analysis annotation and modeling fragment similarities reveal functionally_important similar structural_motifs may indicate function preservation in remote_homologs and more generally recurring fragments may be used as building_blocks to the construction of de_novo models of protein_structures scores used to quantify the d similarity are essential components at both global and local levels a considerable amount of approaches has been developed for complete protein comparisons such as ssap dali ce mammoth or tm_align to cite some however progress in modeling and in the analysis of the significance of local differences in homologous_proteins stresses the necessity to focus on smaller structure sizes yet none of the above scores used for structural_alignment seems well adapted to the large_scale comparison of short protein_fragments first speed is of the essence for large_scale structure mining and structural_alignment may require heavy computations second a crucial and difficult question remains that of the statistical_significance of the scores applied to short fragments the root_mean rmsd has been one of the first measures introduced this long used criterion also has well known flaws among which rmsd dependence on the alignment_length possibly large values between homologous_proteins and above all a poor classification_performance for medium range rmsd values small rmsd values imply correct similarity but large rmsd values can hardly be related or not to the absence of similarity numerous studies have attempted to overcome_these such as maiorov and crippen and many others since among these the unitvector rms distance urms has been reported to be rather length independent and insensitive to local structural dissimilarities for sufficiently_long structures the tm_score has been designed to be rather insensitive to small structural deviations it is also normalized to be length insensitive but its design was clearly focusing on sufficiently_large proteins amino_acids here we introduce a new fast and accurate scoring_scheme for fragment mining contrarily to the rmsd fragment superimposition is not required this new measure is based on a binetcauchy kernel bc score this kernel has already been applied in unrelated context in particular to the difficult problem of clustering video sequences and to the discrimination of an individual or a group of individuals in a video sequence in the context of protein_structure comparison the bc score can be seen as a shape similarity_score corresponding to a correlation score between fragment shapes hence it is normalized and its values range from measuring perfect shape anti similarity one fragment is the mirror_image of the second one to indicating perfect similarity up to a linear deformation the bc score has several interesting_properties in particular it is independent to any rotation of the structures and consequently its computation does not involve a prior superimposition of the structures it is also fast and simple to computethe score only requires the computation of matrix determinants therefore it is especially well adapted to perform large_scale protein mining and is designed to compare short protein_fragments in this article we simply assess a new gapless approach of structure similarity and we do not study the optimal structural_alignment based on the bc score after introducing the principle of the bc kernel we review some of its important mathematical properties we then present a statistical_analysis of the scores and we finally assess the sensitivity_and in the context of large_scale fragment mining with a comparison with the rmsd we also apply the bc score to symmetry detection in proteins
