data_and ddn a cabig analytical tool for differential_network differential dependency network ddn is a cabig cancer biomedical_informatics grid analytical tool for detecting and visualizing statistically_significant topological changes in transcriptional_networks representing two biological conditions developed under cabig s in silico research_centers of excellence isrce program ddn enables differential_network and provides an alternative way for defining network biomarkers predictive of phenotypes ddn also serves as a useful systems_biology tool for users across biomedical research_communities to infer how genetic epigenetic or environment variables may affect biological_networks and clinical_phenotypes besides the standalone java_application we have also developed a cytoscape plug in cytoddn to integrate network_analysis and visualization seamlessly availability the java and matlab_source can be downloaded at the authors web sitegene regulatory_networks are context specific and dynamic in nature under different conditions different regulatory_components and mechanisms are activated leading to rewired regulatory_network and topological changes accurate detection of the topological changes in transcriptional_networks between disease and normal conditions or under different stages of cell development would be of great biological_importance for example a deviation from normal regulatory network_topology may reveal the mechanism of pathogenesis and the genes that undergo the most network topological changes may serve as biomarkers or drug_targets to whom correspondence should be addressed we developed the differential dependency network ddn method to detect statistically_significant topological changes in transcriptional_networks between two conditions and to infer most likely mechanistic network markers ddn aims to detect and learn from gene_expression data the rewiring of the underlying biological_network triggered by outside stimuli or different conditions we use local dependency models to characterize the regulatory dependencies of genes in the network and represent them as local network_structures local dependency models decompose the entire network into a series of local networks which serve as the basic elements of the network for statistical_testing unlike other dependency models that consider only pairwise relationships or binding triples the local dependency models select the number of dependent_variables automatically by the lasso method and thereby learn the local network_structures subsequently permutation_tests are performed on the local dependency models under two conditions and p values are assigned to each of the local structures the permutation_test on individual local structures assures the statistical_significance of the detected network topological changes so that only genes that exhibit network topological changes between two conditions above a given significance_level will be identified lastly the extracted subnetworks showing significant topological changes are visualized using cytoscape ddn is an open_source differential_network and network marker identification tool developed through the cabig in silico research_centers of excellence isrce effort and is freely_available to the cancer and broader biomedical research_communities as a cabig adopted data analytic tool ddn will be integrated into georgetown database of cancer g doc and offers users across the cancer and broader biomedical research_communities a unique yet effective network_analysis tool for differential pathway network_inference to harness the powerful visualization capability of cytoscape we have also developed a cytoscape plug in cytoddn to streamline the network_analysis and visualization here we applied ddn and cytoddn to four case studies specifically selected from diverse biological settings to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability
