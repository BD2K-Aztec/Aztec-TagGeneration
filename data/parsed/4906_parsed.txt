weighted mutual_information analysis substantially improves domain based functional network models_motivation functional proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks elucidate molecular_pathways complex phenotypes including those of human_diseases extrapolation of domaindo main interactions ddis from known ppis is a major domain based method for inferring functional ppi_networks however the protein domain is a functional_unit of the protein therefore we should be able to effectively infer functional interactions between proteins based on the co occurrence of domains results here we present a method for inferring accurate functional ppis based on the similarity of domain_composition between proteins by weighted mutual_information mi that assigned different weights to the domains based on their genome_wide frequencies weighted mi outperforms other domain based network_inference and is highly_predictive for pathways as well as phenotypes a genome_scale human functional network determined by our method reveals numerous communities that are significantly associated with known pathways and diseases domain based functional_networks may therefore have potential applications in mapping domain to pathway or domain to phenotype associations availability_and source_code for calculating weighted mutual_information based on the domain profile matrix is available from www netbiolab org w wmi proteins are major functional molecules that conduct cellular_processes interactions between proteins are important for understanding_the of complex_traits including diseases for example network based analysis has recently gained popularity in interpreting data from genome_wide gwas and whole_exome wes for human_diseases such as cancer mutation and pathway analysis working group of the international cancer although a large number of proteinprotein_interactions ppis have been mapped via experimental detection of physical_interactions between proteins in silico methods are still useful for inferring functional ppis because proteins may work cooperatively without physical_interaction interactions between proteins are typically mediated by domain domain interactions ddis thus protein_domains can be used to infer ppis indeed frequently observed domain pairs between interacting_proteins have been identified as powerful predictors of ppis these observations have motivated the systematic extraction of ddis from known ppis and extrapolation to new ppis many algorithms have been developed to extractppis as well as to infer new ppis based on these ddis which have been collected into meta databases functional ppis can also be inferred from shared domains between proteins because protein_domains are structural functional and evolutionary units of proteins in addition because proteins evolved through gene_duplication recombination fusion and fission towards specific functions there exist limited rules for domain combination however the presence of shared domains between proteins may not be a sufficient model of functional ppis for example a dna_binding exists in most transcription_factors which regulate many different biological_processes thus such a shared domain between two proteins may not be a strong indicator of their functional association with the same pathway therefore we do not expect the prediction of functional ppis based on domain sharing to be effective there exists a need for a method to infer functional_associations between proteins based on domain co occurrence in this study we propose a method to infer ppis based on domain occurrence any protein can be represented by a domain profile which is a vector reflecting the presence_or of domains functional_associations between proteins are then measured by the similarity between their domain profiles unlike ddi based_inference of ppis this approach does not require prior_knowledge of the ppis from which the ddis are extracted in addition to measure domain profile similarity with higher functional_relevance we wanted to account for unequal distribution of functional information content across profiles and domains mutual_information mi differentially compares profile information based on their entropy we hypothesized that rarer domains tended to be involved in more specific pathways therefore in addition to traditional mi we tested a weighted mi method that assigned different weights to domains based on their genome_wide frequencies here we demonstrate that weighted mi outperforms traditional mi in the inference of functional ppis based on domain profile similarity in both yeast and human we also found that domain profile similarity by weighted mi constructs substantially improved functional_networks compared to those based on ddis our domain based network inference_method constructed highly_predictive functional_networks for complex phenotypes such as human_diseases finally we observed that communities of our domain based network are significantly associated with known pathways or diseases implicating a potential application of domain based functional_networks in mapping associations between domains and pathways diseases the protein domain is a widely_accepted functional_unit of proteins thus domains can be expected to convey_information about the pathways and phenotypes proteins are involved in however the use of domains to predict these pathways and phenotypes based on domain occurrence remains_limited many domains are associated with multiple pathways that are involved in distinct physiological_processes therefore domain occurrence may not be a sufficient indicator of domain involvement in specific pathways or phenotypes furthermore some domains appear to be basic components of a large number of proteins therefore domain based pathway modelling has been challenging in this study we demonstrated the feasibility of constructing highly_predictive functional ppi_networks for pathways and diseases using an information_theory approach with differential weights across domains however despite superior accuracy ppi_networks by weighted mi exhibit smaller genome_coverage than those derived by simple domain sharing which indicates that many domains are general_purpose components of proteins that do not indicate any specific pathways these observations suggest that we may be able to use domain based networks to distinguish domains involved in specific pathways from those that participate in general processes this enables more reliable pathway prediction based on domain information although we demonstrated the utility of weighted mi to construct domain based functional ppi for yeast and human in this study the same method can be easily applied to other organisms and may potentially benefit relatively lesser understood organisms for which only protein_sequences with electronic annotation of domains are available we also demonstrated that human domain based network communities tend to be associated with pathways and diseases suggesting a potential application for domain based functional_networks in mapping domain to pathway and domain to disease associations although we have made vast progress in in silico models to identify associated pathways and diseases for genes models using domainsand do lite terms b for each community are listed along with their significance scores as indicators remain are less developed given that the domain is a more fundamental functional_unit of proteins pathway or disease annotation for each domain would be more relevant to the genome therefore significant efforts have been invested into the manual_curation of relationships between domains and pathways such as interpro go we anticipate that the development of an automatic mapper of domains to gobp terms will accelerate this manual_curation project in addition the prediction of domain to disease associations will provide new insights into the analysis of disease specific genomics data such as disease associated snps and mutations which potentially opens new routes to understanding_the of human_diseases in the future
