a novel method for discovering local spatial clusters of genomic_regions with functional_relationships from dna contact_maps motivation the three_dimensional structure of genomes makes it possible for genomic_regions not adjacent in the primary sequence to be spatially proximal these dna_contacts have been found to be related to various molecular activities previous methods for analyzing dna contact maps_obtained from hi c experiments have largely focused on studying individual interactions forming spatial clusters composed of contiguous blocks of genomic_locations or classifying these clusters into general_categories based on some global properties of the contact_maps results here we describe a novel computational_method that can flexibly identify small_clusters of spatially proximal genomic_regions based on their local contact patterns using simulated_data that highly resemble hi c data obtained from real genome structures we demonstrate that our method identifies spatial clusters that are more compact than methods previously used for clustering genomic_regions based on dna contact_maps the clusters identified by our method enable us to confirm functionally_related genomic_regions previously_reported to be spatially proximal in different species we further show that each genomic_region can be assigned a numeric affinity value that indicates its degree of participation in each local cluster and these affinity values correlate quantitatively with dnase_i gene_expression super enhancer activities and repli cation timing in a cell_type specific_manner we also show that these cluster affinity values can precisely define boundaries of reported topologically_associating and further define local sub domains within each domain availability_and the source_code of bnmf and tutorials on how to use the software to extract local clusters from contact_maps are available atalthough genomes are commonly depicted as a linear sequence of base_pairs they actually contain complex three_dimensional d structures there has long been an interest in identifying biologically_meaningful territories from these structures fluorescence_in fish has provided insights into genome_organization by visualizing individual pairs of spatially interacting genomic_regions but it has limited_resolution and cannot be scaled up to study a large number of interacting regions at the same time these limitations have been overcome by high_throughput experimental methods that can probe interacting regions genome_wide by means of crosslinking and deep_sequencing such as chia_pet hi c and tcc each sequencing read produced provides information about two interacting regions the whole set of reads is summarized by a contact_map in the form of a square matrix where the whole_genome is binned into contiguous genomic_locations with each bin v c the author published_by
