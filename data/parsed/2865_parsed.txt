memo multi experiment mixture_model analysis of censored_data downloaded from motivation the statistical_analysis of single_cell data is a challenge in cell_biological tailored statistical_models and computational_methods are required to resolve the subpopulation structure i e to correctly identify and characterize subpopulations these approaches also support the unraveling of sources of cell to cell variability finite mixture_models have shown promise but the available approaches are ill suited to the simultaneous consideration of data from multiple experimental_conditions and to censored_data the prevalence and relevance of single_cell data and the lack of suitable computational analytics make automated methods that are able to deal with the requirements posed by these data necessary results we present memo a flexible mixture modeling framework that enables the simultaneous automated analysis of censored and uncensored data acquired under multiple experimental_conditions memo is based on maximum_likelihood inference and allows for testing competing_hypotheses memo can be applied to a variety of different single_cell data types we demonstrate the advantages of memo by analyzing right and interval censored single_cell microscopy data our results show that an examination of censoring and the simultaneous consideration of different experimental_conditions are necessary to reveal biologically_meaningful subpopulation structures memo allows for a stringent analysis of single_cell data and enables researchers to avoid misinterpretation of censored_data therefore memo is a valuable asset for all fields that infer the characteristics of populations by looking at single individuals such as cell_biology and medicine availability_and memo is implemented in matlab and freely_available via github https github com memo toolbox memo contactscell to cell variability is omnipresent in biological_systems clonal populations can show quantitative differences in gene_expression and qualitatively distinct cellular_phenotypes and subpopulations the magnitude and nature of variability within a population can differ significantly depending on the system under consideration accurate quantification relies on sophisticated statistical_models which have to be tailored to the characteristics of the measurement_technique one characteristic of experimental_data whose importance is often underestimated is censoring most experimental devices provide censored_data due to limited_resolution or experimental constraints see_supplementary section s left and right censored_data provide upper and lower bounds respectively while interval censored_data provide an interval for a quantity of interest a quantity of interest might be the time to an event if the event_occurs before the start of the observation the time to the event is left censored accordingly the time to an event is right censored if the event does not occur during the observation or if a mutually_exclusive event_occurs before these censoring events may also be randomly_distributed if the system is observed at discrete time points only the time interval in which the event_occurs is known in concentration measurements censoring can occur due to detection_limits or limited_resolution if the quantity of interest can only be detected above a certain detection_limit this limit provides an upper_bound for quantities below leading to left censored_data similarly saturation effects of the detection method lead to right censoring where the saturation threshold serves as a lower_bound for quantities above limited_resolution naturally leads to interval censoring for example limited time resolution in single_cell microscopy experiments is due to phototoxicity and photobleaching requiring long inter observation intervals to avoid stress statistical_models accounting for censoring are well established a suitable framework is provided by mixture modeling while most mixture modeling_approaches do not account for censoring others consider selected types of censoring see_supplementary section s unfortunately the latter do not provide a comprehensive easily_accessible framework therefore such models are infrequently applied in a biological_context which entails certain risks in the presence of mutually_exclusive competing biological_events for example disregarding right censoring can result in an incorrect interpretation of experimental_data such as correlations between actually uncorrelated data hence there is a need for simpleto use computational_methods to analyze censored population data besides censoring another challenge for computational_analysis methods of single_cell data is the integration of data from multiple experimental_conditions e g different strengths of stimuli or multiple sampling_times after an intervention on the biological system at hand or multiple technical and biological_replicates established approaches use a two step procedure for this purpose first individual samples are described independently with finite mixture_models thereafter matching based_methods are applied to link the different samples e g to decide upon the appearance of identical subpopulations these methods rely on similarity between distributions under different conditions in the case of large changes in the corresponding distribution between experimental_conditions matching methods are not able to map the populations to address this shortcoming a joint clustering and matching jcm approach has been introduced jcm allows for a more rigorous matching across samples and the consideration of intersample variability for that purpose a template model is fitted to the pooled_samples and the individual samples are modeled as instances of this template by adding random effect terms to the template parameters this approach is well suited for analyzing the size of different distinct_subpopulations in different samples however in case of small changes due to altered experimental_conditions the subpopulation structure remains difficult to quantify furthermore the template is constructed without considering inter sample variability and a rigorous comparison of different biological_hypotheses is not straight_forward in order to cope with these challenges we introduce memo a multi experiment mixture modeling framework which is able to analyze samples from different experimental_conditions simultaneously can account for censoring and compares competing model hypotheses memo uses maximum_likelihood inference to determine the subpopulation structure and properties of heterogeneous_cell memo is implemented in matlab and freely_available via github https github com memo toolbox memo we expect that memo can be used for a broad_spectrum of univariate censored single_cell data e g facs cytof qpcr and timelapse microscopy data the data should as for other statistical_analysis methods be appropriately preprocessed and the interesting dimension can be determined using dimension_reduction methods see e g in this study we evaluate our method using simulated and experimental_data in particular we analyze time to event single_cell microscopy data from multiple yeast_strains these cells were observed at discrete time points and only for a certain duration hence the data are interval and right censored we found that in contrast to navenave approaches memo inferred the correct subpopulation structure for cases in which it was known in addition for more complex datasets containing multiple experimental_conditions memo revealed the existence of subpopulations for certain strains some of which inherit the phenotypic_properties of wild_type cells we demonstrate that memo even enables testing of competing_hypotheses about underlying_molecular of the phenotype in a second application on single_cell protein level data we demonstrate how mechanistic_information can be integrated in memo overall our results demonstrate the additional benefit of a multi experiment modeling framework and the importance of accounting for censoring independent of how little it might be mixture modeling of single_cell data is receiving increasing attention due to a rising_number and several software_packages are available flame and flowclust enable gaussian t and skew t mixture modeling of flow_cytometry data and can also be used for other data types in these implementations multiple samples are handled using metaclustering or distribution matching jcm improves upon that by constructing template models and matching the individual samples to the template models this approach even allows for the consideration of inter sample variability at least in the matching step however jcm does not facilitate an automatic matching of subpopulations across different experimental_conditions and like all other methods does currently not incorporate hypothesis_testing methods furthermore these packages do not account for censoring which might lead to misinterpretations in this study we show that disregarding censoring generally results in an overestimation of the number of subpopulations in case of interval censoring the severity depends on the ratio of censoring interval and inter cell variability multi experiment mixture modeling using memo enables accurate reconstruction of subpopulation structures and properties from interval left and right censored_data inter sample variability can be modeled using sample specific scaling and offset parameters by simultaneously analyzing multiple experiments memo facilitates the comparison of different regulatory_mechanisms thus mixture modeling is no longer restricted to data analysis but also allows to formulate and compare hypotheses how subpopulations are linked across different experimental_conditions as demonstrated memo can also be combined with mechanistic modeling_approaches furthermore the characterization of experiment dependent subpopulations is improved since variability quantification is enriched by the entire dataset from multiple experiments the results of memo can be used for subsequent modeling applications to a broad range of data types e g single_cell time lapse section and single_cell protein level snapshot data section are possible the approach can also be used in medical studies where patients are not observed continuously or may drop out from the study the current_implementation of memo supports analytical functions to link experimental_conditions these functions encode hypotheses and can be derived from measurement data or mechanistic_models such as for example ordinary_differential ode constrained mixture_models ode mm as described in ode mms use mechanistic_models of single cell_behavior and subpopulation structure to integrate data collected under different experimental_conditions and could be used to reconstruct differences between subpopulations memo provides an extension to ode mm as censored_data can be studied and knowledge about the signaling_pathway is not required this renders memo more flexible and easier to use for explorative data analysis the mechanistic modeling of single_cell snapshot data using memo demonstrated its flexibility concerning the data types and established that causal_relations can be extracted furthermore it revealed that parameter_estimates using different data resolutions are consistent for the inference of model_parameters memo uses a maximumlikelihood method along with efficient gradient based optimization expectation_maximization em algorithms suitable for multi experiment mixture_models with censored_data could reduce the computation time further and add to the robustness existing em methods for censored_data lee and scott will have to be extended to a multi experiment setting model selection_criteria implemented in memo could be complemented by deviance information criteria and bayesian model_selection memo is currently restricted to the analysis of censored and uncensored univariate data an extension of memo to truncated and multivariate_data is possible the latter poses however several challenges among other the evaluation of the likelihood for censored_data requires the calculation of multivariate integrals which is already computationally_intensive for the bivariate case potential_solutions might be provided by sparse grids see and references therein as the analysis of multivariate_data is currently not possible with memo memo needs to be combined with preprocessing and dimension_reduction approaches moreover depending on the experimental_setup prior to analysis the data may have to be corrected for experimental biases that mask the biological population_structure to facilitate the biological_interpretation of the results a hierarchical view on cell_populations should be incorporated in memo we also note that a full exploitation of the possibilities of memo requires some expertise in the biological system this concerns the choice of the number of subpopulations to start with and in particular the generation of hypotheses on the relations between different experimental_conditions furthermore the user must provide_reasonable parameter bounds for the optimization procedure in this sense memo is an advanced tool that is not fully_automatic nevertheless its modular concept and the symbolic programming make memos basic functionality intuitively accessible in summary we introduced a computational_method for the efficient and integrated analysis of censored_data that allows for rigorous hypothesis_testing the implementation of this method memo can facilitate the coherent and reliable analysis of single_cell data across experimental platforms such standardized analysis_pipelines are essential in the age of single_cell data
