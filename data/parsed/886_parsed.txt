cclasso correlation inference for compositional data through lasso motivation direct analysis of microbial_communities in the environment and human_body has become more convenient and reliable owing to the advancements of high_throughput sequencing_techniques for s rrna gene_profiling inferring the correlation relationship among members of microbial_communities is of fundamental_importance for genomic survey study traditional pearson correlation_analysis treating the observed data as absolute abundances of the microbes may lead to spurious_results because the data only represent relative_abundances special_care and appropriate methods are required prior to correlation_analysis for these compositional data results in this article we first discuss the correlation definition of latent_variables for compos itional data we then propose a novel method called cclasso based on least_squares with penalty to infer the correlation network for latent_variables of compositional data from metagenomic_data an effective alternating direction algorithm from augmented lagrangian method is used to solve the optimization_problem the simulation_results show that cclasso outperforms_existing e g sparcc in edge recovery for compositional data it also compares well with sparcc in estimating correlation network of microbe species from the human_microbiome availability_and cclasso is open_source and freely_available from https github com huayingfang cclasso under gnu lgpl v microbes play_an in the environment and human_life bacteria and archaea have been found in extreme_conditions such as deep_sea vents with high temperatures and rocks of boreholes beneath the earths surface the microorganisms affect environments where they exist and vice_versa it is estimated that there are about times microbe cells inhabiting our human_body than human cells microbes affect the human_life on our food health and medicine the way in which microbes affect the human_health remains_largely analysis of the human_microbiome may help us better understand our own genome the increasing quality and reducing cost of sequencing technologies_provide great opportunity to analyze the microbe communities through sequencing this represents a great_improvement over traditional microbe studies which are hindered by several v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com doi bioinformatics btv although compositional data arise naturally in many practical problems researchers are generally more interested in the latent_variables that underlie these data for example in genomic survey studies it is of great interest to infer the dependency among different bacteria from the observed relative_abundance instead of the absolute abundance of the bacteria therefore there is a need to infer the correlation_matrix among the latent_variables for the compositional data in this article we have proposed a novel method to infer the correlations among the latent_variables for compositional data we use the sparse assumption to help estimate the correlation_matrix of latent_variables through solving the constant sum constraint problem the simulation_results show that cclasso has better performance than sparcc the only available method in the literature that we are aware of that attempts to solve this problem from a latent_variable viewpoint for the hmp data cclasso has similar consistent accuracy and reproducibilities as sparcc but from the shuffled hmp datasets we find that sparcc always gives some nonzero estimations though cclasso performs better than sparcc in simulation_studies it has similar difficulties as sparcc such as reliable component fraction estimation and only linear relation explained we adopt the simple pseudo count to avoid components for hmp datasets there are other normalization_methods that accounts for under sampling such asintroduced a methodology to assess differential abundance in sparse high_throughput microbial marker gene survey data recently proposed a poisson multivariate_normal hierarchical_model to learn direct_interactions removing confounding predictors effect from metagenomics sequencing_experiments the assumption ofis similar to cclasso from the latent model view but the essential difference between them is the compositional assumption future work will concentrate on improvement of the components estimation accounting for under sampling and exploring nonlinear relationships among microbes
