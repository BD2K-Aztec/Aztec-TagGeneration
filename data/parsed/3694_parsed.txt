genome_analysis prime a method for characterization and evaluation of pleiotropic regions from multiple genome_wide the concept of pleiotropy was proposed a century_ago though up to now there have been insufficient efforts to design robust statistics and software aimed at visualizing and evaluating pleiotropy at a regional_level the pleiotropic region identification method prime was developed to evaluate potentially pleiotropic loci based upon data from multiple genome_wide gwas methods we first provide a software_tool to systematically identify and characterize genomic_regions where low association p values are observed with multiple_traits we use the term pleiotropy index to denote the number of traits with low association p values at a particular genomic_region for gwas assumed to be uncorrelated we adopted the binomial_distribution to approximate the statistical_significance of the pleiotropy index for gwas conducted on traits with known correlation_coefficients simulations are performed to derive the statistical_distribution of the pleiotropy index under the null_hypothesis of no genotypephenotype association for six hematologic and three blood_pressure traits where full gwas results were available from the cohorts for heart and aging_research in genomic epidemiology charge consortium we estimated the trait correlations and applied the simulation approach to examine genomic_regions with statistical_evidence of pleiotropy we then applied the approximation approach to explore gwas summarized in the national_human nhgri gwas catalog results by simulation we identified pleiotropic regions including sh b and brap q for hematologic and blood_pressure traits by approximation we confirmed the genome_wide significant pleiotropy of these two regions based on the gwas catalog data together with an exploration on other regions which highlights the fto gckr and abo regions availability_and the perl and r scripts are available at http www framinghamheartstudy org research gwas pleiotropictool html pleiotropy describes the effect of a single genetic region on multiple phenotypic_traits the concept of pleiotropy was first defined a century_ago as one mutation resulting in multiple distinct phenotypes among the proposed_mechanisms the genetic region may encode a product that is used by multiple cell_types or it may have a signaling function affecting multiple_targets or the traits under study may themselves be highly interrelated at a physiological level pleiotropic genes have been shown in other species to affect environmental adaptation and tend to reside in central node positions in proteinprotein_interaction the identification and characterization of pleiotropic genes and regions offers a unique window into the complexities of biological molecular_interaction and may potentially indicate evidence for epistasis the presence and impact of pleiotropy in genome data for normal human characteristics and human disease traits merits_further but thus far the efforts at statistical development are insufficient methods and software for analyzing multivariate phenotypes have been proposed however the available methods such as those by all require use of individual_level phenotype data and thus cannot be used to study pleiotropy using only existing summarized genome_wide gwas results the method ofcan be used on existing summarized gwas results however this method only considers single_nucleotide snp level but not region level pleiotropy a novel analytic approach was recently demonstrated to examine pleiotropic genes in psychiatric phenotypes the current abundance of gwas results provides an unprecedented opportunity to fully examine this phenomenon in a systematic manner we previously analyzed results across gwas articles_published from through creating a comprehensive database of snp phenotype associations at a significance_level of this study highlighted potential pleiotropic regions presenting the densest regions of associations from gwas polymorphisms associated with multiple_traits in genes including apoe and the mhc region were identified as well as novel candidates pigu rapgef col a and oas that were subsequently replicated in otherpage prime does not rely on prespecified methods for genomic_region grouping such as gene boundaries or physical position bins instead association p values for individual snps and ld between snps are used to define genomic_regions where multiple_traits show significant association with snps since pairwise ld r among snps is a key_determinant of the width of a region we used plink to precalculate ld based on the hapmap ii iii samples from the ceu utah residents with ancestry from northern and western_europe and tsi toscans in italy populations we did not use the ld data downloadable from hapmap website because it calculates ld only for snps up to kb apart to capture long_range haplotype_blocks we include ld for snps up to kb apart of note the ld threshold chosen by investigators will not only affect the physical boundaries of a putative pleiotropic region but also the statistical_significance of the estimated p t for the sh b and brap regions if a ld threshold of r rather than is used only one large region instead of two separate ones will be identified this change of ld threshold will further complicate the choice of as the threshold for evaluating genome_wide significance since the total number of independent regions across the genome would be different when high_ld is defined as r instead of furthermore with a p s threshold of instead of prespecified the same sh b region is noted with a pleiotropy index of but the simulated p t would not have reached a genome_wide significant threshold from a statistical_testing perspective higher values of pleiotropy index under less stringent p s thresholds tend to result in a less significant p t on the other hand a highly stringent p s threshold will pose technical_challenges for simulation we performed million simulations i e in an attempt to simulate the distribution for p s up to however as supplementaryshows despite the high number of simulations we still did not observe a pleiotropy index when p s thresholds of and were used therefore an exact p t could not be specified other than p t we suggest a p s of which corresponds to the significance threshold currently used by the gwas catalog currently the direction of association effect is not considered for computing the pleiotropy index studies have suggested there may be biologically_plausible mechanisms for different effect directions even among closely related_phenotypes for the approximation approach we make the assumption that traits are not correlated when traits studied in separate gwas scans are not truly uncorrelated the distribution of the pleiotropy index deviates from the binomial_distribution with higher proportions of correlated_traits leading to greater deviations as the correlation_coefficient increases the expected pleiotropy index increases and therefore is more likely at any given significant p t to achieve larger values of the pleiotropy index see supplementary for the two charge gwas five common cohorts contributed to a total of six cohorts for both gwas with the degree of sample overlap for these two gwas being however a high degree of sample overlap alone does not imply that there will be high correlation for quantitative_traits e g between mean corpuscular hemoglobin and systolic_blood for the charge traits and between hdl and ldl for the global lipids traits supplementary for dichotomous traits illustrated by the wtccc data the use of a common control dataset generates an explicit overlap of phenotypic measurement therefore leading to some degree of correlation among gwas results for the seven traits from to supplementary the highest correlation of between type_diabetes and rheumatoid_arthritis could also indicate common pathways for auto immune_diseases supplementary for both quantitative and qualitative traits under the null_hypothesis of no genotypephenotype association for each individual gwas even identically ascertained phenotypes will not yield trait correlation given no sample overlap the finding of the fto region highlights how care must be taken in interpretation of conclusions on pleiotropy since the commonly associated traits for the fto region include many weight_related measures or for type_diabetes although a few of the association_signals in the gckr region are for similar serum_lipids and glucose measures as well there are distinct traits such as hematologic traits serum_uric and c_reactive the significant test_statistic in the case of fto may be flagging either pleiotropy or further independent_replication for adiposity traits while the case of gckr may reflect classic pleiotropy for similar but not identical traits suspected pleiotropy could be due to independent effects or through a chain of mediation the identification of mediation can still provide useful biological_information a recent study on the genetics of fto provides the first direct evidence that increased fto expression causes obesity in mice mice with increased fto expression on a high_fat develop glucose_intolerance the causal mechanism of fto on human phenotypes warrants further gene_expression studies the null_hypothesis of no genotypephenotype association for each individual gwas has been used as a basis for our simulation and approximation approaches which could be invalid when traits with strong association with particular genomic_regions have been well established and extensively replicated deriving the distribution under the alternative will depend on many variables number of associated loci strength of association with each trait etc and could require a markedly different approach we compared the power between our method and that of ferreira and purcell and found that their method is slightly more powerful under scenarios with various association p value thresholds and type_i however our tool and method can be rapidly applied to summary gwas results together with other features including visualization in summary we have developed a computational_tool and statistical_method to systematically identify characterize and evaluate pleiotropic regions prime can be downloaded and run on local machines without uploading potentially sensitive gwas data to public servers the scripts are designed in a user_friendly manner so that all customizable parameters can be specified in an interface script which calls subsequent scripts that require no user manipulation the availability of prime may encourage sharing of more detailed gwas data in a secure manner within collaborating groups in order to conduct discovery of potential pleiotropic regions we anticipate that fine_mapping and re sequencing will enable a page
