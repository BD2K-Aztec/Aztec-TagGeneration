genome_analysis multi factor data_normalization enables the detection of copy_number in amplicon sequencing_data because of its low_cost amplicon_sequencing also known as ultra deep targeted_sequencing is now becoming widely used in oncology for detection of actionable mutations i e mutations influencing cell sensitivity to targeted_therapies amplicon_sequencing is based on the polymerase_chain of the regions of interest a process that considerably distorts the information on copy_numbers initially present in the tumor dna therefore additional experiments such as single_nucleotide snp or comparative_genomic cgh arrays often complement ampli con sequencing in clinics to identify copy_number of genes whose amplification or deletion has direct consequences on the efficacy of a particular cancer treatment so_far there has been no proven method to extract the information on gene copy_number based solely on amplicon_sequencing results here we present oncocnv a method that includes a multi factor normalization and annotation technique enabling the detection of large copy_number changes from amplicon sequencing_data we validated our approach on high and low amplicon density datasets and demonstrated that oncocnv can achieve a precision comparable with that of array_cgh techniques in detecting copy_number thus oncocnv applied on amplicon sequencing_data would make the use of additional array_cgh or snp_array experiments unnecessary availability_and the emergence of the amplicon_sequencing technique which followed whole_exome wes promises a revolution in cancer_diagnostics and treatment amplicon_sequencing consists of the polymerase_chain pcr_amplification of a limited number of the genomic_regions of interest amplicons followed by high_throughput supplementary each amplicon often coincides with an exon exons longer than the typical length of pcr reaction_products may be covered by two or more amplicons supplementary although relatively expensive exome_sequencing consists of indepth sequencing of nearly all the coding_exons the amplicon_sequencing technique aims at sequencing a limited number of genes from several dozen to several thousand exons at an extremely low_cost the genes included in a panel of amplicon_sequencing actionable genes are genes that are often altered in different cancer_types and for whose alterations targeted_therapies have been established or are in clinical development for instance the targetrich tm crx kit from kailos genetics assays such cancer_related as braf egfr flt jak kit kras pik_ca pten tp and vegfa the ampliseq tm cancer panel from life technologies targets regions of interest in well characterized oncogenes_and some actionable genes often undergo point_mutation or exon deletions e g alk braf whereas others undergo amplification in copy_number e g mycn erbb because of the exceedingly_high read_coverage of amplicon sequencing_data there is no methodological issue in the identification of point_mutations and small_insertions indels however how to reliably detect copy_number changes in particular gene_deletions and amplifications in amplicon sequencing_data is still open to discussion here we focus on the identification of copy_number cnas also known as large copy_number changes cnvs of the actionable genes targeted by amplicon_sequencing although there are several algorithms to detect cnas in exome_sequencing it is questionable as to whether the same approaches can be efficient when applied to amplicon sequencing_data first to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work amplicon_sequencing targets fewer regions and thus provides less information than exome sequencing_datasets exons versus exons consequently data_normalization can be less effective on amplicon sequencing_data second because of the different protocols used for library_preparation amplicon sequencing_data can have various biases importantly while for exome sequencing_experiments an effort has been made to uniform exon coverage amplicon sequencing_technology emphasizes extremely_high depth of coverage with less regard to coverage homogeneity here we provide a solution to the challenging question of extracting cnas from amplicon sequencing_data by i defining a method to normalize read_coverage with a small set of normal control samples and ii assigning statistical_significance to putative cnas resulting from the segmentation of normalized profiles we validated the proposed method on a a high amplicon density dataset of eight tumor_samples for which array_comparative array_cgh profiles were available b a high amplicon density dataset of erbb positive ovarian_cancer and c a low amplicon density dataset of tumors coupled with single_nucleotide snp_array we show that the results obtained from the oncocnv method compare favorably with the results obtained from adtex and nextgene http www softgenetics com nextgene html which are respectively public_domain and commercial software_designed to detect_cnvs in whole exome_sequencing we proposed a method to analyze amplicon sequencing_data to be used to detect cnas involving at least several exons our method oncocnv demonstrated a high_accuracy of cna predictions for the samples for which we had the results of array_cgh analysis as gold_standard oncocnv significantly_outperformed methods developed for exome_sequencing analysis this is because of the extensive normalization strategy which includes normalization for the gc_content amplicon length via loess correction and other technology specific_biases via pca of the control samples an important advantage of oncocnv is the refinement of breakpoints falling initially within a gene i e after the segmentation of nrc profiles oncocnv reanalyzes the nrcs upstream and downstream of the putative breakpoint and decides whether intragenic breakpoint has indeed taken place and that it is not the result of inaccurate segmentation supplementary in our dataset we observed samples e g controls and supplementary where a large fraction of amplicons for both have zero or extremely_low rcs we would like to point out that oncocnv is able to detect such artifacts and analyze cnas correctly in the corresponding samples the prediction of gains_and by oncocnv includes information on average log nrc in addition it estimates possible copy_numbers this estimate is based on the assumption that the tumor sample genome is diploid and that the sample is not contaminated by normal cells we are aware that this assumption might be far from being true however we prefer to provide an estimate of the probable copy_number to allow the user to distinguish between gains and amplifications and between one and two allele losses the question of predicting the exact copy_number cannot be solved by using copy_number profiles alone the assessment of b allele_frequencies provides a possible solution we did not use this solution in oncocnv because of the high dispersion of b allele_frequencies in the amplicon sequencing_data data not shown cnas detected by oncocnv and by other software whose algorithm is based only on the analysis of copy_number profile are relative to the evaluated zero level for instance if we measure the copy_numbers of only a pair of genes we will not be able to see a gain or loss if this happens simultaneously in both genes thus to properly estimate the zero level many genes should be included in the targeted gene_panel as we expected we detected a fall in the cna detection_accuracy for samples that were highly_contaminated by normal cells in this situation the noise in measurements is comparable with the expected difference between measurements in the case of one copy gain or loss as our approach does not use information about b allele_frequencies certain combinations of normal contamination and tumor ploidy significantly_impair the efficiency of the technique this is especially true when there are a small number of measurements amplicons per gene we would like to point out that oncocnv does not detect one amplicon amplifications deletions we believe the noise in current amplicon based_technologies does not allow detection of such cnvs with high certainty however there are methods such as contra which predict the cnvs of single amplicon regions we do not position oncocnv as a tool for exome_sequencing analysis unlike many exome_sequencing analysis tools oncocnv does not take into account b allele_frequencies because of this limitation oncocnv is not able to evaluate the level of the contamination by normal cells or improve the accuracy of cna calling by simultaneously processing copy_number and b allele_frequency profiles our analysis of biases intrinsic to amplicon_sequencing revealed two factors_influencing the rcs amplicon length and gc_content as loess correction is possible only for the amplicon sizes frequently present in the dataset from to bp in our case we advise using as narrow a range of amplicon lengths as possible in the future_design of amplicon regions similarly for the gc_content normalization the cna prediction may be inaccurate for amplicons with extremely_high or low gc_content this is especially true in the case when all amplicon regions within a gene usually overlapping with exons have an extremely_high or low gc_content for such genes we advise designing additional amplicons in the intronic_regions with moderate gc_content if it is planned to completely bypass array_cgh or a similar technique to predict the copy_number of the targeted_regions
