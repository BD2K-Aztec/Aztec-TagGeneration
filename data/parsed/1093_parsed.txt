structural_bioinformatics comprehensive large_scale assessment of intrinsic protein disorder motivation intrinsically_disordered are key for the function of numerous proteins due to the difficulties in experimental disorder characterization many computational predictors have been developed with various disorder flavors their performance is generally measured on small sets mainly from experimentally solved structures e g protein_data pdb chains mobidb has only recently started to collect disorder annotations from multiple experimental_structures results mobidb annotates disorder for uniprot sequences allowing us to conduct the first large_scale assessment of fast disorder predictors on different sequences with x_ray in addition to a comprehensive ranking of predictors this analysis produced the following interesting observations i the predictors cluster according to their disorder definition with a consensus giving more confidence ii previous assessments appear over reliant on data annotated at the pdb chain level and performance is lower on entire uniprot sequences iii long disordered_regions are harder to predict iv depending on the structural and functional types of the proteins differences in prediction_performance of up to are observed availability the datasets are available from web_site at url the rigid structure of proteins has been considered the determinant of function for many years recently an alternative view is emerging with respect to non folding regions suggesting a reassessment of the structure to function paradigm flexible segments lacking a unique native_structure known as intrinsic disordered_regions are widespread in nature especially in eukaryotic_organisms these regions have been shown to play_important in various biological_processes such as cell_signaling or regulation dna_binding and molecular_recognition their malleable properties allow multiple binding_partners with the flexible region often becoming folded on binding despite an emerging consensus regarding their existence there is no single definition of disorder as a result various flavors of disorder have been proposed these disorder flavors have become diverse with some based on amino_acid flexibility and functional_roles coupled with conservation perhaps the simplest flavor distinction is the length of a disordered region separated into short and long long regions seem to behave differently and are difficult in structural_determination causing them to be underrepresented in the protein_data pdb the pdb contains structural_information from x_ray and nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy which can be used indirectly to study disorder a plethora of computational predictors have also appeared with special efforts to capture different flavors available methods can be broadly divided_into three classes biophysical machine_learning and consensus based biophysical_methods derive pseudoenergy functions from residue pairings in rigid structures i e non disorder to recognize sequence_regions with high_energy as disordered machine_learning especially neural_networks has been widely used to predict protein disorder many are tuned for the disorder style used in the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp where the goal is to detect missing residues in the x_ray crystal others attempting to move away from this disorder style measure some form of protein_backbone flexibility for example espritz can predict mobile nmr regions and disembl loops regions with high b factor high_flexibility the most recent disorder predictor category uses a consensus of various to whom correspondence should be addressed
