sc atmd a tool for integration of the figure_of with cluster_analysis for gene_expression data standard and consensus clustering analysis tool for microarray_data sc atmd is a matlab implemented application specifically_designed for the exploration of microarray_gene via clustering implementation of two versions of the clustering validation method figure_of allows for performance_comparisons between different clustering_algorithms and tailors the cluster_analysis process to the varying characteristics of each dataset along with standard clustering_algorithms this application also offers a consensus clustering method that can generate reproducible clusters across replicate experiments or different clustering_algorithms this application was designed specifically for the analysis of gene_expression data but may be used with any numerical_data as long as it is in the right format availability sc atmd may be freely downloaded fromtodays technological_advancements have provided researchers with an abundance of information especially in the field of molecular_biology high_throughput such as microarrays are capable of generating overwhelming amounts of biological data due to the large_scale of these datasets non computational_analysis is unrealistic therefore new computational_tools and techniques are needed for the efficient organization and analysis of these data clustering is an important exploratory tool that aids in the analysis and organization of biological data by dividing the dataset into smaller more manageable groups based on a chosen definition of similarity many freely_available applications such as the cluster and tree view program suite hierarchical_clustering explorer v and multiexperiment viewer v implement several standard clustering techniques with a multitude of options however selection of the most appropriate method for each dataset can be difficult and clustering_results from standard clustering_algorithms are not always reproducible across replicate experiments to whom correspondence should be addressed to aid users in the selection of clustering options sc atmd integrates two versions of the figure_of fom with standard clustering techniques this creates a virtually seamless process that tailors the clustering analysis according to the individual characteristics of each dataset sc atmd also implements consensus clustering to address the issue of cluster reproducibility consensus clustering has the ability to identify robust clusters across multiple clustering_algorithms and or replicate experiments other features of sc atmd include portable tab_delimited output_files the customization of figures with access to a variety of image file_formats and implementation of a cluster mapping routine which is a novel technique that defines one clustering solution in terms of another sc atmd was designed to aid scientific researchers in the analysis of microarray_data and has already proven to be an invaluable tool in this area currently sc atmd is being used in the analysis of several large time course microarray_experiments including the study of phenylpropanoid signaling in arabidopsis_thaliana the early effects of osteoarthritis and the process of dendritic_cell sc atmd has also proven to be an effective_teaching tool with its user_friendly graphical_user gui and intuitive output that is easy for students to understand
