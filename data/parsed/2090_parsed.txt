systems_biology going from where to why interpretable prediction of protein subcellular_localization motivation protein subcellular_localization is pivotal in understanding a proteins function computational_prediction of subcellular_localization has become a viable alternative to experimental_approaches while current machine_learning based_methods yield good prediction_accuracy most of them suffer from two key_problems lack of interpretability and dealing with multiple_locations results we present yloc a novel method for predicting protein subcellular_localization that addresses these issues due to its simple architecture yloc can identify the relevant_features of a protein_sequence contributing to its subcellular_localization e g localization signals or motifs relevant to protein sorting we present several example applications where yloc identifies the sequence_features responsible for protein_localization and thus reveals not only to which location a protein is transported to but also why it is transported there yloc also provides a confidence estimate for the prediction thus the user can decide what level of error is acceptable for a prediction due to a probabilistic_approach and the use of several thousands of dual targeted proteins yloc is able to predict multiple_locations per protein yloc was benchmarked using several independent datasets for protein subcellular_localization and performs on par with other state of the art predictors disregarding low_confidence predictions yloc can achieve prediction_accuracies of over moreover we show that yloc is able to reliably_predict multiple_locations and outperforms the best predictors in this area availability www multiloc org yloc contact subcellular protein_localization is a key process in many eukaryotic_cells and hence a major research_topic in biology after being synthesized proteins are transported into different compartments depending on their molecular role within the cell some proteins are even transported to multiple sites protein_localization is often mediated by sorting signals or sorting patches however the process of protein sorting is not fully understood yet the subcellular_localization of a protein is highly_correlated with its function and is to whom correspondence should be addressed thus used to draw_conclusions about its cellular role interaction_partners and function in biological_processes during the past_decade huge number of novel proteins were discovered in the context of large_scale sequencing_projects unfortunately for a majority of these proteins their subcellular_localization is unknown and experimentally determining the localization of a protein is expensive_and computational_prediction that predict subcellular_localization from the amino_acid represent an attractive alternative to experimental methods over the past_few numerous prediction_methods have been developed we distinguish between sequence and annotation based_methods sequence_based predictors make use of sequence coded sorting signals amino_acid information or even both information_sources annotation based predictors use information about functional_domains and motifs proteinprotein_interaction homologous_proteins annotated gene_ontology go terms and textual information from swiss_prot keywords or pubmed_abstracts since proteins with sufficiently_similar protein_sequences are usually located in the same compartment missing annotation_information might also be transferred from close homologues annotation based predictors often show higher accuracies than pure sequence_based predictors although they are less robust for novel proteins without known close homologues hybrid prediction_approaches take advantage of both information_sources although there is an evidence that more than one third of all eukaryotic_proteins are transported to multiple compartments multiple targeting of proteins has only rarely been considered by prediction_methods as one of the first groups introduced a method for multiple localization prediction based on about multiple localized proteins more recent predictors such as wolf psort understanding protein subcellular_localization is crucial for functional_annotation of proteins in contrast to many prediction_methods predictions made by yloc are highly interpretable yloc explains why a prediction was made and shows which particular attributes contributed most and in which direction explaining why a subcellular_localization prediction was made clearly influences the trust in the results a user might find a prediction reasonable but might also find attributes indicating a different localization that are more convincing to him in addition a users can identify properties of their proteins that are typical or atypical for a certain cell organelle thus yloc can be helpful to understand the localization of novel proteins that have not been annotated before our benchmark results suggest that using complex computational_models is less important than using highly discriminating features with different biological background when considering only proteins that can be predicted with a certain confidence_score the prediction_performance increases considerably we believe that a confidence estimate is of great interest since it increases the trust in prediction results when predicting proteins from multiple_locations yloc yields often better prediction quality than current state of theart predictors moreover ylocs flexible probability transformation allows predicting novel location combinations that are not part of the training data we showed several examples where yloc predicted experimentally_validated changes of localization sites and known sorting signals caused by mutations this is a key_step toward understanding subcellular_localization processes without conducting expensive experiments however single_amino that will not change important physiochemical_properties are not likely to cause a change of the predicted location in the future we hope to increase both performance and interpretability of yloc by integrating further biologically relevant_features improvement will rely on traditional biology and computational_biology proceeding hand in hand discovering novel protein sorting signals can improve the performance of yloc whereas an improved predictor can help biologists to elucidate the localization of novel proteins since we applied yloc successfully on proteins with alternative isoforms that differ in localization it seems promising to include alternative transcription and translation sites as features for yloc in addition qualitative distribution data of multiply targeted proteins will help to improve the prediction
