gene_expression cagexplorer an r package for the analysis and visualization of promoter dynamics across multiple experiments alternate promoter usage is an important molecular_mechanism for generating rna and protein diversity cap analysis gene_expression cage is a powerful approach for revealing the multiplicity of transcription_start tss events across experiments and conditions an understanding of the dynamics of tss choice across these conditions requires both sensitive quantification and comparative visu_alization we have developed cagexplorer an r package to detect and visualize changes in the use of specific tss in wider promoter_regions in the context of changes in overall gene_expression when comparing different cage samples these changes provide insight into the modification of transcript_isoform generation and regulatory_network alterations associated with cell_types and conditions cagexplorer is based on the fantom and mpromdb promoter set definitions but can also work with user supplied regions the package compares multiple cage libraries simultaneously supplementary_materials describe methods in detail and a vignette demonstrates a workflow with a real_data example availability_and the package is freely_available under the mit_license from cran http cran r project org_web cagexplorer it has been predicted that the majority of human genes have multiple promoters the differential use of transcription_start tsss in alternative promoters is a complementary mechanism to alternate splicing for the generation of rna diversity that is now becoming better understood tissuespecific tss usage has been identified in mammalian_genomes and alternate tss usage has been identified in cancers when compared with normal cells implying that promoter specific transcription coupled with gene_expression exists as hallmarks of cell state the profound impact of switches in transcript_isoform production is well recognized for its role in regulation cap analysis gene_expression cage captures sequences and maps capped rna tags in addition to being a platform for measuring gene_expression it has more importantly provided molecular_biologists with enhanced resolution of gene_regulation by revealing the precise locations of transcription_initiation events cage data have recently become more plentiful thanks to the recent encode and fantom forrest a r r publications analysis of tss choice provides insight into the variation of transcription_factor binding epigenetic_modifications and regulatory_network activation between different cell_types although cage allows for the identification of individual tss it is more convenient to group clusters of tsss detected in close_vicinity into promoter_regions this makes cage an attractive platform for de_novo promoter identification the relative transcription occurring at tsss among alternative promoters of a gene is termed promoter composition pc we describe cagexplorer an r package that conveniently summarizes visualizes and ranks changes in pc also called promoter switching genome_wide across different samples the dynamics of differential pc is especially intriguing when this phenomenon leads to changes in the abundance of different transcript_isoforms or protein products within the cell_population under study highlights the conceptual difference between pc and differential_gene four samples ad are evaluated at four color_coded promoter_regions located near or within a gene total gene_expression measured as mapped tags per million sequenced following optional library normalization with edger is obtained by summing the number of tags that map to the union of the gene region all four promoters including the regions between them and dividing by effective library size pc is measured as a proportion vector a and b have no change in pc but the gene is differentially_expressed a and c have no differential_gene but there is differential pc finally a and d demonstrate both differential_gene and differential pc existing bioinformatics_tools that analyze count_data from sequencing_technologies treat genes as elementary indivisible units and usually measure differences in expression via a contrast between two groups of samples examples_include edger to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com and cuffdiff for differential_gene and transcription analysis respectively unlike these tools cagexplorer treats genes as multiunit blocks composed of promoter subunits and compares their relative expression within the gene across samples it is not restricted to the analysis of contrasts between pairs of experiments but rather is designed to scale to any number of experiments for simultaneous comparison we present cagexplorer the r package that addresses the important task of detecting changes in pc in cage experiments the method is scalable to any number of conditions and or promoter_regions for simultaneous comparison the method is flexible and can be applied to any experiment that produces tag counts grouped by classification factors in which the detection of switching or changes in composition is of interest e g gene_expression switching within gene_sets pathway activity switching within regulatory and molecular_networks isoform and exon switching using rna_seq to use this software for any of the aforementioned applications the user need only to change the genomic_region definitions from promoter_regions to other regions of interest
