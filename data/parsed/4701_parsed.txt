genome_analysis totalrecaller improved accuracy and performance via integrated alignment and base_calling motivation currently re sequencing_approaches use multiple modules serially to interpret raw_sequencing from next_generation while remaining oblivious to the genomic_information until the final alignment step such approaches fail to exploit the full information from both raw_sequencing and the reference_genome that can yield better quality sequence_reads snp calls variant detection as well as an alignment at the best possible location in the reference_genome thus there is a need for novel reference guided bioinformatics algorithms for interpreting analog signals representing sequences of the bases a c g t while simultaneously aligning possible sequence_reads to a source reference_genome whenever available results here we propose a new base_calling algorithm totalre caller to achieve improved_performance a linear error_model for the raw intensity data and burrowswheeler_transform bwt based alignment are combined utilizing a bayesian score function which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic_locations using an efficient branch and bound approach the algorithm has been implemented in soft and hardware field_programmable fpga to achieve real_time performance empirical results on real high_throughput illumina data were used to evaluate totalrecallers performance relative to its peersbustard bayescall ibis and rolexabased on several criteria particularly those important in clinical and scientific applications namely it was evaluated for i its base_calling speed and throughput ii its read accuracy and iii its specificity and sensitivity in variant_calling recent_advances in sequencing_technology continue to introduce novel and diverse high_throughput dna sequencing_platforms such as illumina these innovations promise to revolutionize biological biomedical and translational_research by rapidly transferring genomics breakthroughs from the byte banks to bedside for any large_scale genomic_sequencing effort aiming to fulfill these goals to whom correspondence should be addressed an important and rate_limiting initial step involves base_calling which is now assuming an even more critical role especially for these new next and next next_generation when the source genome references are available the sequencereads obtained by the base caller is next subjected to alignment followed by variant caller procedures successivelyalthough in principle all three steps could be carried_out in one integrated step while promising improvements in accuracy computational_complexity data storage and transmission base_calling takes the vector analog time series of signals generated by the sequencing_machines as input and produces a base by base digitized estimate of the underlying dna_sequence that is most likely to have given rise to those signals although the next_generation listed above have reduced the cost and increased the throughput these platforms pose new challenges for base_calling as their technology is based on either relatively small number of unsynchronized molecules e g illumina life_science ion_torrent solid or single_molecules with weak signal e g pacific_biosciences oxford nanopore helicos life technologies as a consequence these platforms are not only error_prone they also corrupt signals in the data by non stationary errors and generate much shorter reads than what is needed for both proper alignment and sequence_assembly as well as what used to be routinely possible with the traditional sanger sequencers motivated by such challenges novel base_calling frameworks have been proposed to deal with many unknown sources of noise in these data these methods have already demonstrated that considerable improvement both in quality and read_length is possible through sophisticated signal_processing methods such as statistical_learning supervised_learning and support_vector svm and model_based and information_theory however in doing so these methods also expose base_calling to several other limitations i over fitting parametric_models e g alta cyclic ibis bayescall rolexa are likely to suffer from overfitting to the in sample data and thus are unlikely to be very robust in dealing with varying out of sample datasets even from the same sequencing_platforms ii computational_cost in a preprocessing_step all base callers must learn the error_model in the training data in order to build a classifier that then corrects the errors in the signal this preprocessing_step can be very time consuming as in the case of bayescall alta cyclic and ibis and may require a cluster computer facility as in the case of alta cyclic thus preventing them from real_time base_calling as would be neededtraining phase since a subclass of these base callers e g alta cyclic ibis needs a training phase using a library of correct reads they require both a secondary basecaller and a sequence aligner to get started with the training library on the contrary this concern has been somewhat alleviated in the newer base callers e g bustard bayescall which estimate their parameters solely from intensity files iv technology dependent many base callers e g alta cyclic ibis and bayescall use a detailed parametric model to describe the signal distortion as a function of successive cycles such models require and hard wire specific knowledge of the underlying sequencing_technology into the algorithm thus making it harder to customize the base caller to support other platforms currently a major application of the next_generation is in re sequencing e g dnaseq dna_sequencing with known reference source genome rnaseq mrna sequencing with known gene isoforms chipseq chromatin_immunoprecipitation with known binding_sites despite the obvious centrality of alignment in these applications traditional base callers have avoided performing alignment until the end of the base_calling process in fact the typical pipeline for a re sequencing_process traditionally consists of two sequential steps base_calling each single base of the read is called according to the intensity signal and error profiles alignment sequence_reads are aligned to a reference_genome because the base_calling process is error_prone and because correct alignment to the reference_genome is non trivial high coverage is required in order to reduce the errors in re sequencing and recover the true full dna_sequence to perform the alignment to the reference_genome the standard smithwaterman approach or some variations of it may seem appropriate note that the smith_waterman was developed in the context of homology analysis is based on dynamic_programming and thus requires its score function for evaluating the alignment_quality to satisfy the principle of optimality this algorithm as well as others in this framework starting with needlemanwunsch is based on certain markovian stationarity assumptions that give rise to additive and affine score functions which while fine in the context of evolutionary_analysis are not necessarily valid in the alignment applications for current and future sequencing_technologies even worse smithwaterman or needlemanwunsch algorithms are considered too impractical computationally and are only used for local_alignment after few plausible initial seed locations are determined using blast or bwt like heuristic aligners thus adding to the false_negatives motivated by the limitations of current base callers and the challenges of re sequencing we have designed a new basecaller totalrecaller which attempts to ameliorate the problems discussed above and significantly_improves the quality of reads by injecting knowledge of the reference_genome into the base_calling step in this article we present a framework with its theoretical underpinnings that replaces the typical sequential re sequencing protocol into a combined pipeline that has the ability to concurrently perform base_calling alignment and snp_detection it is important to the statistics for high and low_intensity levels depicted with their means and sds for four channelsone for each base b a c g t shown clockwise a high_intensity level with a value above a threshold in one of the channels indicates that this base should be called at a given cycle a low_intensity level below threshold in a channel means that this base should not be called at a given cycle in a good set of intensities it is expected that one channel is higher than a threshold while all other three are lower than it the panels depict that in later cycles the low and high_intensities become increasingly indistinguishable which causes erroneous base_calling for distal positions emphasize that since base_calling and alignment in totalrecaller are performed_concurrently with the help of a reference_genome the generated_reads could be biased toward the available genome for this purpose the trade_off analysis between snps sensitivity_and is also addressed in the article while for illustrative purposes this article specifically addresses base_calling for the illumina_platform our method is in principle applicable to any other sequencing_technology adaptation to a different sequencing_platform only requires redesigned score functions encapsulating error_correction and alignmentand thus accommodating the different features and error profiles of the variant system in a technology agnostic manner including the base caller introduced in this article currently there are six base callers for illumina sequencing_machines totalrecaller bustard illumina alta cyclic bayescall ibis max in the following we compare the performance of these base callers according to the same metrics that have been used in the literature namely base_calling error_rate alignment rate and base_calling speed since totalrecaller utilizes a reference_genome for base_calling base_calling statistics from datasets of three different organisms with reference_genomes of varying qualities were analyzed furthermore basecalling results of totalrecaller are presented with different weights on reference alignment with respect to intensity information finally we conclude this section with detailed statistics on totalrecallers snp sensitivity_and as they would be the most important in many clinical_applications this article introduces a new base caller totalrecaller which opens_new for reducing errors significantly in
