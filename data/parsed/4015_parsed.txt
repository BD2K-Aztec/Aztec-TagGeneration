rinq reference based indexing for network queries we consider the problem of similarity queries in biological_network databases given a database of networks similarity query returns all the database networks whose similarity i e alignment score to a given query network is at least a specified similarity cutoff value alignment of two networks is a very costly operation which makes exhaustive comparison of all the database networks with a query impractical to tackle this problem we develop a novel indexing method named rinq reference based indexing for biological_network queries our method uses a set of reference networks to eliminate a large portion of the database quickly for each query a reference network is a small biological_network we precompute and store the alignments of all the references with all the database networks when our database is queried we align the query network with all the reference networks using these alignments we calculate a lower_bound and an approximate upper_bound to the alignment score of each database network with the query network with the help of upper and lower bounds we eliminate the majority of the database networks without aligning them to the query network we also quickly identify a small portion of these as guaranteed to be similar to the query we perform pairwise_alignment only for the remaining networks we also propose a supervised method to pick references that have a large chance of filtering the unpromising database networks extensive experimental evaluation suggests that i our method reduced the running time of a single query on a database of around networks from over days to only h ii our method outperformed the state of the art method closure tree and saga by a factor of three or more and iii our method successfully identified statistically and biologically_significant relationships across networks and organisms contact with the advances in biotechnology and high_throughput computing the amount of data_describing the interactions among molecules has increased_greatly in recent_years depending on the types of interactions these data are expressed through various models such as metabolic gene regulatory or protein_interaction the term pathway is also used in the literature to describe a part of them in this article we will use the term biological_network to describe a collection of these interactions understanding biological_networks has been one of the main goals of biological_sciences as they contain key information regarding to whom correspondence should be addressed how organisms work to achieve_this biological_networks are analyzed in a number of ways one of them comparisonbased analysis identifies similar parts of two biological_networks by aligning them such analysis has been successfully used for finding functional_annotations identifying drug_targets reconstructing metabolic_networks from newly sequenced_genome and building phylogenetic_trees aligning two biological_networks is a computationally challenging_problem existing_methods often map this problem to subgraph isomorphism problem for this problem there are no known polynomial time algorithms which guarantee to produce the optimal alignment a number of methods aim to find approximate or heuristic results in practical time however they still require a significant amount of time computational difficulty of biological network_alignment becomes apparent when we need to align a query network with a database of biological_networks to test this we downloaded networks from kegg these networks had genes i e nodes and edges we aligned the networks in the dataset with a set of query networks using the qnet algorithm each of these query networks had seven nodes average processing time for a single query network was over days on a single processor the same experiment for eight node queries took more than a week for a single query network in this article we aim to align a query network with a database of networks efficiently formal definition of our problem is as follows problem definition assume that we have a database of n biological however there has been a limited number of studies on similarity_searches in network databases although these methods work well for specific types of network databases they are not well suited for biological_network databases which is the problem considered in this article this is mainly because they often use an overly simplified similarity measure for network_alignment when used with costly biological network_alignment tools the time complexity of these indexing methods become impractical we elaborate on previous_works in section
