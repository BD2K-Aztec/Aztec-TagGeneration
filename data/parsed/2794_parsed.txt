mapping ancestral_genomes with massive gene loss a matrix sandwich problem motivation ancestral_genomes provide a better way to understand the structural_evolution of genomes than the simple comparison of extant genomes most ancestral_genome reconstruction methods rely on universal markers that is homologous families of dna_segments present in exactly one exemplar in every considered species complex histories of genes or other markers undergoing duplications and losses are rarely taken into account it follows that some ancestors are inaccessible by these methods such as the protomonocotyledon whose evolution involved massive gene loss following a whole_genome results we propose a mapping_approach based on the combinatorial notion of sandwich consecutive ones matrix which explicitly takes gene losses into account we introduce combinatorial optimization_problems related to this concept and propose a heuristic solver and a lower_bound on the optimal_solution we use these results to propose a configuration for the proto chromosomes of the monocot ancestor and study the accuracy of this configuration we also use our method to reconstruct the ancestral boreoeutherian genomes which illustrates that the framework we propose is not specific to plant paleogenomics but is adapted to reconstruct any ancestral_genome from extant genomes with heterogeneous marker content availability upon request to the authors contact haris mapping ancestral_genomes consists in ordering ancestral markers into chromosomes according to the organization of the descendants of these markers in sequenced extant genomes in the absence of a good model for genome structural_evolution mapping_techniques for ancestral_genomes introduced by have given the most reliable ancestral configurations on animals yeast or plant_genomes and even on a wide eukaryote dataset these works also raised new methodological_issues and stimulated a recent stream of algorithmic studies related to genome_mapping to whom correspondence should be addressed which had taken the back seat with the development of massive genome_sequencing the general principle of ancestral genome_mapping is i define ancestral_genome markers constructed either from homologous gene_families or from aligned chromosome segments ii infer from the structure of extant genomes a collection of relations between ancestral markers which are believed to be ancestral and iii assemble this collection into an ancestral_genome the relations between ancestral markers can take several forms such as adjacency or distance between pairs of markers or contiguity synteny of a subset of markers for example the combinatorial nature of these relations defines the abstract representation of the ancestral_genome from totally ordered protochromosomal segments to contiguous ancestral regions and ancestral linkage_groups up to now most published_methods require unique and universal ancestral markers that is each ancestral marker has exactly one descendant in every considered extant genome this constraint common to many genomemapping methods and genome rearrangement studies results in general in more tractable algorithmic problems for the assembly phase recently several works tried to account for the possibly complex history of markers by integrating whole_genome and gene loss either at the level of ancestral markers definition or in the whole mapping_process allowing duplicated markers arising from a whole_genome or genes with duplications and losses in these works either a backbone of universal makers is used or only adjacencies between genes were considered it means that gene loss is neglected and is expected to produce a reasonable amount of noise in the assembly phase the above assumptions are not appropriate anymore if there is a highly_heterogeneous marker content within the extant descendants considered to reconstruct an ancestral_genome for example in the early monocotyledon evolution a whole_genome is believed to have occurred followed by numerous gene losses representing
