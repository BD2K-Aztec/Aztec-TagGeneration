systems_biology enhanced flowtype rchyoptimyx a bioconductor pipeline for discovery in high_dimensional cytometry data we present a significantly_improved version of the flowtype and rchyoptimyx bioconductor based pipeline that is both times_faster and can accommodate multiple levels of biomarker expression for up to markers with these improvements the pipeline is positioned to be an integral part of data analysis for high_throughput experiments on high_dimensional single_cell assay platforms including flow_cytometry mass_cytometry and single_cell rt_qpcr availability flowtype and rchyoptimyx are distributed under the artistic license through bioconductor flow_cytometry has undergone a chromatic explosion over the past_decade and can now measure markers at once for each of hundreds of thousands of individual cells since then mass_cytometry has enabled measurement of markers cell whereas single_cell multiplexed rt_qpcr can measure messenger_rnas cell the growth in high_throughput single_cell data continues to outpace development of corresponding bioinformatics techniques to answer this challenge we previously_developed flowtype and rchyoptimyx flowtype uses partitioning of cells either manually or by clustering into positive_or for each marker to enumerate all cell_types in a sample e g rchyoptimyx measures the importance of these cell_types by correlating their abundance to external outcomes such as disease_state or patient_survival and distills the identified phenotypes to their simplest possible form these packages have been used to identify several novel cell_populations correlated with hiv outcome more recently this pipeline has been used to evaluate standardized immunological panels to optimize lymphoma diagnosis and to analyze a range of other clinical data unpublished_data however the higher dimensionality of data produced by mass_cytometry generates up to possible cell_types with an even greater number up to for single_cell qpcr these magnitudes are beyond the capabilities of flowtype and rchyoptimyx furthermore flowtype and rchyoptimyx have thus far only treated cells as being either positive_or for a marker in practice many biomarkers can have a range of expression levels such as dim and bright in this application note we detail architectural improvements to flowtype and rchyoptimyx to overcome_these
