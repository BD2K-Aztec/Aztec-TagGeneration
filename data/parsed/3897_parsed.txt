databases_and rcellminer exploring molecular_profiles and drug response of the nci cell_lines in r purpose the rcellminer r package provides a wide_range of functionality to help r users access and explore molecular_profiling and drug response data for the nci the package enables flexible programmatic_access to cellminers unparalleled breadth of nci_data including gene_and copy_number whole exome mutations as well as activity data for k compounds with information on their structure mechanism of action and repeat screens functions are available to easily visualize compound structures activity patterns and molecular feature profiles additionally embedded r shiny applications allow interactive data exploration availability_and rcellminer is compatible with r and above on windows mac os x and linux the package documentation tutorials and shiny based applications are available through bioconductor http www bioconductor org_packages rcellminer ongoing updates will occur according to the bioconductor release schedule with new cellminer data the package is free_and lgpl the rcellminer r package is designed to allow r users to explore molecular_profiling and drug response data on the nci rcellminer complements the online cellminer tools with ones that can be run locally to enhance access to the cellminer data we anticipate that these tools will allow researchers to build powerful analyses of the nci_data we showcase some possibilities with the embedded r shiny applications allowing quick exploration of the available data we plan to extend this r package to include additional compound data made available by dtp and other molecular_profiling data for the nci from assays conducted by the developmental therapeutics branch of the nci and other groups with its extensive data and flexible underlying functionality rcellminer will make the nci accessible to a larger segment of the community enabling development of novel analyses it additionally provides useful guidance for organizing data from other cell_line pharmacogenomic databases as r packages
