systems_biology static network_structure can be used to model the phenotypic_effects of perturbations in regulatory_networks motivation biological_processes are dynamic whereas the networks that depict them are typically static quantitative modeling using differential_equations or logic_based functions can offer quantitative predictions of the behavior of biological_systems but they require detailed experimental_characterization of interaction kinetics which is typically unavailable to determine to what extent complex biological_processes can be modeled and analyzed using only the static structure of the network i e the direction and sign of the edges we attempt to predict the phenotypic effect of perturbations in biological_networks from the static network_structure results we analyzed three networks from different sources the egfr mapk and pi_k network from a detailed_experimental study the tnf regulatory_network from the string database and a large network of all nci curated pathways from the protein interaction_database altogether we predicted the effect of perturbations e g by one or two drugs on target_proteins genes in up to of the cases an algorithm that used only the static structure of the network correctly_predicted whether any given protein gene is upregulated or downregulated as a result of perturbations of other proteins genes conclusion while quantitative modeling requires detailed experimental_data and heavy computations which limit its scalability for large_networks a wiring based_approach can use available data from pathway and interaction_databases and may be scalable these results lay the foundations for a large_scale approach of predicting phenotypes based on the schematic structure of networks analysis of regulatory_networks has been used to explore the molecular_mechanisms biological_processes and to identify new regulatory_modules network based modeling tools are often used to account for the difference between healthy and diseased cells they have also been used to predict the effect of perturbations e g inhibiting one protein gene or more on other proteins genes in the network for example ruths et_al successfully predicted changes in protein levels in the mapk akt signaling_network in breast_tumor in response to perturbation of two genes a wide_variety of methods have been developed to analyze regulatory_networks and provide predictions at different levels of detail the input for these methods ranges from quantitative kinetic_parameters such as reaction_rates to logical constraints defining the interactions e g and or relationships continuous methods such as ordinary_differential odes model the rate of change of each component in the network and provide detailed quantitative information regarding the networks dynamics however odes require comprehensive_knowledge of kinetic_parameters which are unknown for most networks and therefore their applicability is limited alternatively in discrete logic_based models each component in the network has a discrete level which is determined at every time step through a logical function two main methods in this category are boolean_networks and petri_nets both have been used to model regulatory_networks and proven useful for gaining mechanistic_insights and for predicting phenotypes such approaches do not depend on quantitative data but rather on the structure of the network along with a set of logical constraints although the low_resolution of logic_based models imposes limitations on their predictive_power they are applicable to systems that could not be modeled with odes owing to lack of kinetic_information high_throughput are being used extensively to identify physical and functional_relationships between proteins and genes on a large_scale these data are often deposited in interaction_databases such as intact biogrid and string pathway_databases such as kegg and the pathway interaction_database pid which are manually_curated also rely on these data they are typically represented by schematic diagrams with no quantitative_parameters or logical constraints consequently continuous models or logic_based models are not applicable to most of the available interaction data and to most known networks to whom correspondence should be addressed despite this limitation these data have previously been used to gain insight and suggest novel molecular_mechanisms for example ideker et_al used binary proteinprotein and protein_dna to generate mechanistic hypotheses that explain experimental expression data this work was later extended and used to infer regulatory_pathways from subsets of candidate_genes using a literature derived network of biological_relationships more recently an elegant method applying edge consistency in directed and signed networks was used to infer causal perturbations although the representation of biological_networks as schematic diagrams is widespread it is clearly a harsh oversimplification of reality and can only give a partial view of the real chain of events however as a large portion of physical and functional interaction data are available only at this level of abstraction it is important to explore to what extent these networks capture the complexity of biological_processes to this end we devised a simple_algorithm for modeling regulatory_networks based on their schematic wiring alone in particular given a regulatory_network that depicts known pairwise relationships within a biological_process this algorithm predicts for each protein gene whether it will be upregulated downregulated or will remain_unchanged if one or more of the proteins genes in the network is perturbed e g inhibited by a drug to determine the effect of a perturbation of one protein gene on another protein gene in the network all the paths between them are assessed we tested this approach on three different networks from three independent sources for which experimental perturbation data were available first we attempted to predict the effect of drug perturbations on a relatively small but carefully constructed protein signaling_network that originated in a detailed_experimental study by this study also included a comprehensive set of drug perturbations and their experimental readouts that were used to validate our predictions next we tested a small gene_regulatory derived from string finally we predicted the effect of drug perturbations on a large network of hundreds of nodes including all the national_cancer nci curated pathways available in the protein interaction_database the experimental drug perturbation data used to evaluate our predictions for the two last networks were gleaned from microarray_data from the connectivity_map cmap project our approach was able to correctly predict between and of experimental readouts depending on the quality of the pairwise data that were used to construct the network this shows that the network_structure itself captures a significant part of the dynamic_behavior of the network we compare our approach with a method proposed by who used network_structure to predict the effect of perturbations where the paths between the perturbed node and the readout are consistent our method provides correct predictions in many cases where the previous method could not be applied e g when there are multiple contradicting paths which in some networks constitute of the cases finally our analysis demonstrates how it is possible to integrate data from a variety of databases and repositories such as high_throughput microarray_experiments drug_target information and interaction_databases to create a useful platform to predict and evaluate the effect of perturbations in the cell
