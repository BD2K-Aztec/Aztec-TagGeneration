gene_expression bicoverlapper visual_analysis for gene_expression motivation systems_biology demands the use of several point of views to get a more comprehensive understanding of biological_problems this usually leads to take into account different data regarding the problem at hand but it also has to do with using different perspectives of the same data this multifaceted aspect of systems_biology often requires the use of several tools and it is often hard to get a seamless_integration of all of them which would help the analyst to have an interactive discourse with the data results focusing on expression_profiling bicoverlapper visualizes the most relevant aspects of the analysis including expression data profiling analysis results and functional_annotation it also integrates several state of the art numerical_methods such as differential_expression gene_set or biclustering availability_and bicoverlapper is available at bicoverlapper focused on the visualization of complex gene_expression analysis results coming from biclustering_algorithms based on venn like diagrams and overlapping visualization layers it successfully conveyed biclusters with the use of bicoverlapper by the authors and thirdparty users several new requirements arose and it has evolved to support other analysis techniques and additional steps of the analysis process similar evolutions have occurred on other tools on the field for example expander has extended microarray_data analysis with relational and functional information hierarchical_clustering explorer although originally designed for general use added new methods for bioinformatics_analysis treeview is developing toward a new version that will address highthroughtput biology needs see https www princeton edu abarysh treeview to involve biology specialists on bioinformatics analyses we need simpler and highly interactive tools for example was generated only by clicking two menu options and selecting one visual item and gene condition labels on a process that takes not more than min see supplementary video at http vis usal es bicoverlapper docs tour mp underneath this requires the seamless connection of different to whom correspondence should be addressed this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits noncommercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com steps expression data loading computation of distribution statistics three differential_expression for up and downregulation gene_annotation retrieval and the visualization of four interactive representations provides a considerable amount of information about the experiment first parallel coordinates indicate with boxplots that the data are normalized although probably skewed towards upregulation second differential_expression groups displayed as venn diagrams present a large overlap for genes upregulated at mid and early timepoints with respect to late timepoints these intersecting genes have a clear pattern under heatmap and parallel coordinates and include nine genes related to the gene_ontology go terms oxidationreduction process and five related to fatty_acid bicoverlapper is a simple to use highly visual and interactive tool for gene_expression analysis easily and without programming knowledge the user can have an overall view of several expression aspects from raw_data to analysis results and functional_annotations this may significantly reduce the analysis time and improve the analytical discourse with the data for the future we are working on the support of high_throughput data especially rna_seq and a comprehensive report and image generation each cell_cycle is divided_into three time intervals early mid and late differential_expression for every combination of such intervals is computed and visualized as overlapping groups thirty six genes high regulated at early and mid intervals have been selected intersection between early_versus and mid versus late groups at the bottom left their expression_profiles are shown in parallel coordinates and heatmap visualizations finally the functional_annotations stacked by term are shown as a word cloud indicating for example that of the genes are related to metabolic and oxidationreduction processes
