using kernelized partial canonical_correlation to study directly coupled side_chains and allostery in small g proteins motivation inferring structural dependencies among a proteins side_chains helps us understand their coupled motions it is known that coupled fluctuations can reveal pathways of communication used for information propagation in a molecule side chain conformations are commonly represented by multivariate angular variables but existing partial_correlation methods that can be applied to this inference task are not capable of handling multivariate angular data we propose a novel method to infer direct couplings from this type of data and show that this method is useful for identifying functional_regions and their interactions in allosteric proteins results we developed a novel extension of canonical_correlation cca which we call kernelized partial cca or simply kpcca and used it to infer direct couplings between side_chains while disentangling these couplings from indirect ones using the conformational information and fluctuations of the inactive structure alone for allosteric proteins in the ras and other ras like families our method identified allosterically important residues not only as strongly coupled ones but also in densely_connected regions of the interaction graph formed by the inferred couplings our results were in good agreement with other empirical_findings by studying distinct members of the ras rho and rab sub families we show further that kpcca was capable of inferring common allosteric characteristics in the small g protein super family availability_and https github com lsgh ismb predicting allosteric regions in proteins and understanding their interaction mechanisms are challenging problems in bioinformatics it is common to mainly identify backbone motions responsible for the allosteric behaviour of proteins however recent_studies have not only highlighted the commonly neglected role of side chain fluctuations in information_transmission within a molecule but also emphasized the presence of allostery in proteins with minimal backbone motions moreover recent_discoveries by x_ray reveal that alternate side chain conformations are more prevalent than previously_thought these findings further accentuate the importance of a thorough study of the role played by side_chains in allostery intrinsic networks of correlated residues are known to play_an in the propagation of information during an allosteric event identifying networks of directly coupled allosteric residues is thus of crucial importance for understanding the allosteric mechanism and interaction paths in a molecule common correlation based analyses however cannot disentangle causal or direct correlations from transitive or indirect ones to this effect the statistical concept of partial_correlation a conditional dependence measure between two variables given all other variables is more appropriate for inferring direct couplings existing_methods based on the partial_correlation such as the graphical lasso glasso on the other hand often assume that the data are generated from a multivariate_normal distributionalthoughwe have proposed a novel extension of cca namely kpcca to quantify direct correlations between multidimensional angular data existing_methods for inferring direct correlations do not handle data of this type which are common in structural_bioinformatics where side chain conformations of proteins are characterized by a number of dihedral_angles using information about side chain fluctuations in the inactive structure alone we are able to identify common allosterically crucial regions e g switch i and switch ii in the ras rho and rab sub families of small g proteins residues in these allosteric regions appear in the strongest couplings inferred by our method and in the densest regions of the corresponding interaction graph furthermore allosteric_sites and binding_sites are connected x for a h ras b rac c sec red glasso with bias correction blue kpcca without bias correction the kpcca does not show significant bias towards residues with more rotamer alternatives in fact the average number of rotamers is lower for the kpcca than for the glasso in general d interaction graphs for rheb using the top couplings the same number as identified by the crn residues in switch i switch ii and the phosphate binding_loop p loop are coloured yellow blue and orange respectively the p loop residues are connected to the switches in the crn crucial couplings emerge at higher positions in the ranked_list of the kpcca a than in that of the glasso b kernelized partial canonical_correlation and allostery in small g proteins i in these graphs which may explain the mechanism with which allostery occurs in these proteins our analytic framework is modular in principle ensembles generated by other techniques such as mc and or md can be used as well but currently they are much less efficient for instance in one of our test cases rap a pdb id kao residues scwrl took about second to generate a structure whereas an mc method in rosetta like that described by took as much as seconds hence for an ensemble of size our current method took about hours but an mc method would have taken hours almost a full week for a single protein in future_studies our proposed analytic framework can be extended to include backbone dihedral_angles as well this will allow us to study allosteric behaviours of all protein types even those that may undergo drastic backbone motions the method also can be applied to other problems in the bioinformatics e g for revealing the hot_spot in proteinprotein_interactions by using only the fluctuation information of the unbound protein
