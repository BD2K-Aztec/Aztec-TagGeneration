sequence_analysis 'location location location' a spatial approach for rare_variant and an application to a study on non syndromic cleft_lip with or without cleft_palate motivation for the analysis of rare_variants in sequence_data numerous approaches have been suggested fixed and flexible threshold approaches collapse the rare_variant information of a genomic_region into a test_statistic with reduced dimensionality alternatively the rare_variant information can be combined in statistical frameworks that are based on suitable regression_models machine_learning etc although the existing_approaches provide powerful tests that can incorporate information on allele_frequencies and prior_biological differences in the spatial clustering of rare_variants between cases and controls cannot be incorporated based on the assumption that dele terious variants and protective variants cluster or occur in different parts of the genomic_region of interest we propose a testing_strategy for rare_variants that builds on spatial cluster methodology and that guides the identification of the biological relevant segments of the region our approach does not require any assumption about the directions of the genetic effects results in simulation_studies we assess the power of the clustering approach and compare it with existing methodology our simulation_results suggest that the clustering approach for rare_variants is well powered even in situations that are ideal for standard methods the efficiency of our spatial clustering approach is not affected by the presence of rare_variants that have opposite effect_size directions an application to a sequencing study for non syndromic cleft_lip with or without cleft_palate nscl p demonstrates its practical relevance the proposed testing_strategy is applied to a genomic_region on chromosome q that was implicated in nscl p etiology in a previous genome_wide and its results are compared with standard_approaches availability source_code for the implementation in r will be provided online currently the r implementation only supports genotype data we currently are working on an extension for vcf files in the search for disease susceptibility_loci dsls genome_wide gwas have been a successful instrument for the identification of replicable genetic_associations they can interrogate almost the entire_human for genetic_associations in gwas a large set of common_variants i e snps with high minor_allele is genotyped and tested for genetic_association with the phenotype of interest the snps that are genotyped on the panel of the gwas snp_chips are typically selected so that they are strongly correlated with the snps that are not genotyped enabling the indirect association testing of the untyped snps however for most complex_diseases the gwas association_signals are only able to explain a small fraction of the overall heritability that is predicted by classical heritability analysis one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that many of the genetic_associations that are detected by gwas are caused by multiple rare dsls i e minor_allele of that are in proximity to one of the gwas snps because common_variants are poor proxies for rare loci in association analysis or are not in linkage_disequilibrium at all with rare disease_causing it is difficult to identify and characterize rare dsls in gwas data by recording all genetic_loci of the region high_throughput sequencing_data contain the required information to address the rare_variant hypothesis genomic_regions that harbor disease_causing can be pinpointed and characterized consequently the arrival of high_throughput sequencing_data for genetic_studies of complex_diseases poses a unique research opportunity for the localization of dsls at the same time it constitutes a statistical challenge because the majority of the loci that are recorded by high_throughput are rare classical single locus tests for genetic_association e g amitrage trend_test do not provide sufficient power for the underlying analysis questions collapsing methods have been suggested to address this problem using either a flexible or fixed thresholds for the minor_allele of the loci that will be to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons

dataset on non syndromic cleft_lip with or without cleft palatewe applied the discussed approach to a sequencing study on non syndromic cleft_lip with or without cleft_palate nscl p the dataset was generated by a follow_up sequencing of cases and controls in gremlin grem a candidate_gene located in a genomic_region at q that was identified as a suggestive nscl p locus in a gwas by grem is coding for a known antagonist of the bone_morphogenic bmp bmp has been shown to regulate mammalian palatogenesis and has been reported to be associated with orofacial clefting in humans the follow_up sequencing of both and utr as well as coding_regions grem resulted in a discovery of variants with an maf between and depicts the spatial distribution of the detected rare_variants maf with an maf range of for cases and controls although the discovered rare_variants in controls are rather equally_distributed on the chromosome it can be seen for the groups of cases that four rare_variants tend to cluster for our proposed distance based_approach dbm we select two different maf cutoffs and and compared them with the other methods cmc rb price and mb shows the p values of our derived distance based test_statistic dbm compared with the other outlined collapsing and weighting methods for all compared methods the p values are based on permutations it can be seen that our newly_introduced measure dbm finds a highly_significant association of the sequenced q region at both defined upper maf cutoffs whereas the other methods cmc price mb rb skat and c alpha fail to detect a significant association at a significance_level before the application of our method to real_data one should perform simulation_studies to determine a suitable window_size as for the other mentioned rare_variant tests given the sample_size and the assumption of the disease parameters i e prevalence effect_size etc for the application of our variant position based test the window_size should be chosen according to the spatial distribution of the variants on the chromosome so that variant clusters are not separated so_far existing statistical methodology for association analysis has ignored the physical locations of the variants in this communication we have proposed a class of methods to test the association of rare_variants to a dichotomous trait that incorporates the underlying spatial distribution structure of the rare_variants our method is based on statistical clustering methodology instead of collapsing or combing the genotypes of rare_variants in the genomic_region of interest our test_statistic takes advantages of physical distances locations of the alleles at the rare_variant loci and detects rare_variant patterns that are different between cases and controls as a result we obtain a new class of association tests for rare_variant that can aid the localization of the biological relevant segments in the analyzed genomic_region as for any rare_variant approach subpopulation specific patterns in the variant distribution can bias the analysis results of our test_statistic although the findings of mathieson and mcvean suggest that reasonable amounts of subpopulation specific variant distributions do not severely affect the existing rare_variant approaches careful qc of the data i e detection of population_substructure and outlier removal accordingly is mandatory before the application of our approach one approach here could be to apply our testing_strategy to known null regions i e regions without any genetic effects and compare the performance of the test_statistic in these regions with the genomic_region of interest the detection of population_substructure is especially important if samples from other studies or sources such as the genome_project are included in the analysis to increase the statistical_power it is important to note however that our method is best suited for high_coverage data to detect and test the spatial_structure of variants snp data that were obtained from gwas snp_chips because of the pre defined snp locations on such chips offer only limited information on the spatial distribution of variants in a genomic_region moreover the presented method also has limitations in testing aggregated but positional unconnected genome_regions like non coding_regions for now we focus on a very intuitive test_statistic that compares the two distance distributions between cases and controls using a ansaribradley test_statistic currently we are working on an extension of the approach that allows the integration of covariates in the test_statistic and to generalizations to quantitative_traits
