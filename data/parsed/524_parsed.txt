genetics_and assessing statistical_significance in multivariable genome_wide motivation although genome_wide gwas genotype a very large number of single_nucleotide snps the data are often analyzed one snp at a time the low predictive_power of single snps coupled with the high significance threshold needed to correct for multiple testing greatly decreases the power of gwas results we propose a procedure in which all the snps are analyzed in a multiple generalized_linear and we show its use for extremely high_dimensional our method yields p values for assessing significance of single snps or groups of snps while controlling for all other snps and the family_wise fwer thus our method tests whether or not a snp carries any additional information about the phenotype beyond that available by all the other snps this rules out spurious correlations between phenotypes and snps that can arise from marginal methods because the spuriously correlated snp merely happens to be correlated with the truly causal snp in addition the method offers a data_driven approach to identifying and refining groups of snps that jointly contain informative signals about the phenotype we demonstrate the value of our method by applying it to the seven diseases analyzed by the wellcome_trust wtccc we show in particular that our method is also capable of finding significant snps that were not identified in the original wtccc study but were replicated in other independent studies availability_and reproducibility of our research is supported by the open_source bioconductor_package hiergwas genome_wide gwas have enjoyed increasing success and popularity in recent_years due mostly to the thousands of genetic_variants found to be significantly associated with complex_traits the two common designs are case_control which look for associations between snps and disease and population_based studies which focus on finding associations between snps and continuous traits the larger goal of these studies is to function as hypothesis generating machines resulting in sets of loci that require further analysis thus gwas are an important first step in the gene identification process the findings from these studies provide preliminary genetic_information which need additional analysis and follow_up experiments to be validated however many studies have found only a few common_snps per trait and these snps have generally low predictive_power explaining only a small percentage of the variance often snps are tested individually for association with the phenotype using the armitage trend_test because genome_wide analyze hundreds of thousands or even millions of markers the multiple testing issue is resolved by applying a stringent significance thresholdmost commonly to the p values this method is successful only if the study is well powered such that the associations are strong enough to pass the stringent threshold however even if that is the case this type of analysis has several limitations which have been addressed in the literature here we focus on two of them first single snps tend to have small effect_sizes we can increase the explanatory_power by looking at the joint_effect of multiple_snps second when we test a snp individually we ignore the effects of all other snps if we analyze marginally two sufficiently correlated snps out of which only one is causal for the disease both may show an association this leads to higher false_positive joint modeling of all snps is challenging since in most gwas the number of snps is much larger than the number of samples the data cannot be analyzed using standard multivariable approaches an established method in the field is the genome_wide complex_trait gcta which is based on linear_mixed and enables some joint analysis of snps it allows for statistical significance_tests of single snps as fixed_effects while all snps other than the considered single snp are built into the model as a simultaneous random effect we would classify the obtained statistical_significance of the snps as a hybrid between marginal with only one or a few snps as fixed_effects and joint since all the snps are in the model modeling it also enables to assess the combined effect of all snps which quantifies the heritable component of phenotype variation explained jointly by all the genotyped snps another solution to the high_dimensionality of the problem is the use of penalized_regression which constrains the magnitude of the regression_coefficients and allows them to be estimated the two most widely used penalization methods are the lasso and ridge_regression the lasso penalizes the sum of the absolute_values of the regression_coefficients it is a sparse estimator meaning that it sets some regression_coefficients to zero while keeping others non zero ridge_regression penalizes the sum of squared regression_coefficients but it does not reduce the number of parameters in the model init has been shown in the context of gwas that penalization decreases the false_positive and increases the probability of detecting the causal_snps there are several papers which consider a joint analysis methods which apply a penalized model include the bayesian_lasso a twostage procedure using single regression followed by a lasso selection stability_selection in the context of gwas the so_called isis iterative sure independence screening combined with stability_selection to select significant snps a combination of lasso and linear_mixed lasso for screening or ridge_regression none of the proposals compute p values for snps aims to control the type_i the approaches using stability_selection aim to control the expected number of false_positive selections meinshausen and b hlmann whilecontrols the false_discovery fdr our goal is to construct valid p values for snps in a joint multiple generalized_linear together with a computationally_efficient and powerful way to address the issue of massive multiple statistical_hypothesis the problem is challenging due to the complex setting with hundreds of thousands of snps our method relies on a hierarchical procedure from mandozzi and b hlmann which we apply here for the first time to gwas with very high_dimensional it provides p values for multiple joint regression modeling of snps in high_dimensional settings we compute p values not only for individual snps but also for groups of snps the idea is to adapt to the strength of the signal present in the data if the signal is too weak or the snps exhibit too high correlation we might still detect a significant group of snps instead of single snp markers additionally we compute the explained_variance for every such group in a high_dimensional generalized_linear we demonstrate our method on the wtccc data the wellcome_trust case control due to the fact that strong associations have been found for some phenotypes in this dataset and many of their findings have been replicated in subsequent studies however our methods advantages are also evident for phenotypes with weak associations for biologically distant phenotypic_traits the goal is rather to find regions of the genome that are strongly associated with the phenotype our proposed method makes it statistically and computationally possible to assess the significance of the parameters in a multiple generalized_linear for large_scale gwas problems with millions of snp markers the interpretation of the parameters in a multiple generalized_linear is markedly different from marginal association and also from gcta in fact under some assumptions we can link the joint multiple linear_model to causal_inference see section thus it as an important step to perform the statistical_inference in a multiple generalized_linear
