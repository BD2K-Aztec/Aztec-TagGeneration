grip a computational_tool to simulate transcription_factor binding in prokaryotes motivation transcription_factors tfs are proteins that regulate gene activity by binding to specific sites on the dna understanding the way these molecules locate their target_site is of great_importance in understanding gene_regulation we developed a comprehensive computational_model of this process and estimated the model_parameters in n r zabet and b adryan submitted for publication results grip gene_regulation in prokaryotes is a highly versatile implementation of this model and simulates the search_process in a computationally_efficient way this program aims to provide researchers in the field with a flexible and highly customizable simulation framework its features include representation of dna_sequence tfs and the interaction between tfs and the dna facilitated diffusion_mechanism or between various tfs cooperative behaviour the software will record both information on the dynamics associated with the search_process locations of molecules and also steady_state results affinity landscape occupancy bias and collision hotspots availability http logic it is well established now that transcription_factor tf find their target_site through facilitated diffusion a combination between d random_walk on the dna and d diffusion in the cytoplasm once bound to the dna tfs perform three main types of movements i sliding ii hopping and iii jumping the first two mechanisms sliding and hopping assume that the tf performs small movements on the dna without releasing into the cytoplasm whereas the third assumes a d diffusion in the cytoplasm before rebinding with few exceptions most of the theoretical efforts have been invested into analytical_solutions of the facilitated diffusion_mechanism if one wants to consider real dna_sequences and dynamic crowding on the dna mobile roadblocks then this rules out analytical_solutions computational_methods and in particular stochastic_simulations overcome_these and to whom correspondence should be addressed provide a more accurate mechanistic representation of the underling biological_process in particular these type of stochastic_simulations can be used to answer question related to how tfs perform the search_process for example one could investigate whether molecules prefer to hop or to slide and what is the contribution of these two alternative movements on the dna to the overall d random_walk in a crowded environment building on the comprehensive model constructed in n r zabet and b adryan submitted for publication we developed grip gene_regulation in prokaryotes a program that allows stochastic_simulation of the search_process of tfs for their target_sites on the dna the analyzed systems can be large for example escherichia coli k has a mbp genome and there are dna_binding agents to produce results within relative short time previous software had to either rely on coarse grain models or to consider small subsystems grip represents a new and efficient implementation of the tf search_process which considers a highly_detailed model of d diffusion and at the same time it simulates at least times_faster than previous software consequently by allowing genome_wide stochastic_simulations of a highly_detailed model of facilitated diffusion grip can highlight possible biases in the results where the level of details was insufficient coarse grain models or the size of the analyzed system was too small a few studies such as das and kolomeisky addressed the problem of facilitated diffusion through simulations focusing on the d diffusion rather than the d case the d diffusion is time and resource consuming especially for simulations at the genome level vanshowed that the model based on the zerodimensional chemical master_equation can reliably represent the rate at which tfs associate non specifically with the dna as long as the model takes_into that once a molecule unbinds from the dna it has a high_probability of fast rebinding in close_proximity this suggests that there is no need to simulate the d diffusion explicitly but rather have this replaced by a simple arrival rate and ensuring that the model incorporates the fast rebinding probability in the unbinding rate a strategy which we also adopt grip is a highly versatile program which comes with both command_line and graphical_user furthermore being written in java the software can be run on any machine where the java runtime environment or higher is installed the program takes as input a parameters file which can specify among many other parameters three additional data_files namely i the dna_sequence file from a fasta file ii tf file a csv file with tf specific characteristics and optionally iii tf cooperativity file a csv file note that if either the dna_sequence file or the tf file are not provided then the simulator can randomly generate that data dna_sequence or tf species once started the simulation runs until the time in the cell reaches a predefined stop time or until all target_sites are reached if the stop time is set to as output the simulator can print information on i the position of tf molecules on the dna or proportion of bound molecules to the dna ii computed affinity landscapes for each tf species iii measured occupancy bias for each tf species iv statistical_information related to tf species such as residence time sliding lengths actual sliding lengths binding_events etc v simulation speed vi stored sliding lengths for each species and vii statistics on collisions total number total number per species and hot_spots on dna grip can simulate s of e coli k and laci using biologically_plausible parameters between h and h depending on the simulation parameters the machine on which the simulation is run and even on the interface of the application gui or command_line which means that one can simulate up to min of a bacterial cell within a month for details see_supplementary
