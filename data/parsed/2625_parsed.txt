gene_expression jsplice a high performance method for accurate prediction of alternative_splicing and its application to large_scale renal_cancer transcriptome_data motivation alternative_splicing represents a prime mechanism of post_transcriptional whose misregulation is associated with a broad range of human_diseases despite the vast availability of transcriptome_data from different cell_types and diseases bioinformatics based surveys of alternative_splicing patterns remain a major_challenge due to limited availability of analytical_tools that combine high_accuracy and rapidity results we describe here a novel junction centric method jsplice that enables de_novo extraction of alternative_splicing from rna sequencing_data with high_accuracy reliability and speed application to clear_cell renal_carcinoma ccrcc cell_lines and ccrcc patients revealed experimentally validatable alternative_splicing changes and signatures able to prognosticate ccrcc outcome in the aggregate our results propose jsplice as a key analytic tool for the derivation of cell context dependent alternative_splicing patterns from large_scale rna sequencing_datasets availability_and jsplice is a standalone python application freely_available atalternative splicing a mechanism unknown more than years_ago is now regarded a major contributor to transcriptome and proteome diversity it is estimated that in human of multi exon genes undergo alternative_splicing underscoring the importance of this posttranscriptional mechanism in the regulation of gene_expression indeed many key_biological and disease_states involve profound alternative_splicing pattern changes nowadays technological_advances in rna_sequencing rna_seq are yielding data at an enormous scale and allow for genome_wide analysis of alternative_splicing patterns from patient data however the availability of in silico tools able to reliably interrogate alternative_splicing from rna_seq remains_limited for example transcript based_approaches such as cuffdiff allow for reconstruction of the complete transcriptome but are limited in their accuracy of extracted events exon based_approaches such as dexseq provide more reliable results but due to their focus on a subset of events yield only partial information in addition both of these approaches suffer from scalability issues hindering the analysis of large_scale datasets hence there is pressing need to expand methodologies for fast and accurate analysis of alternative_splicing patterns over the past_few an increased ability to align split_reads to the genome and greater sequencing_depths raised the status of junction readsreads that span exonexon junctionsto an independent and reliable source of information to the contrary of other reads they permit a precise localization of exon boundaries and allow testing whether two exons exist consecutively within a transcript an essential step for the detection of alternative_splicing an increasing number of methods such as diffsplice miso juncbase or splicingcompass are including junction reads in their analysis but only fewe g spanki and rmats consider them as the primary source of information here we present jsplice a junction centric method to identify differentially_expressed alternative_splicing at the exon level unlike spanki and rmats which rely on databases of splicing_events jsplice performs a de_novo reconstruction of all possible alternative_splicing based on junction positions allowing thus detection of simple and complex alternative_splicing even in poorly_annotated genomes distinctive to other currently applied methods jsplice does not assess_the of the observed changes in expression between two groups of samples rather it relies on a set of user_defined thresholds to select and rank alternative_splicing changes by the amplitude the performance of jsplice vis_a other splicing analysis software_tools was rigorously assessed on simulated_and and shows a greatly_enhanced sensitivity_and also application of jsplice to rna sequencing_datasets derived from human clear_cell ccrcc cell_lines and patient tumors identified validatable alternative_splicing our work suggests that jsplice is a highly_reliable and accurate method with remarkably_low execution times making it greatly suitable for routine large_scale analysis of rna_seq recent_studies concur that most if not all of human multi exon genes yield multiple splice_isoforms through alternative_splicing alternative_splicing is also highly context dependent and promotes an enormous diversification of gene function that dictates tissue_differentiation development and when misregulated disease development with transcriptomes of different tissues and disease_states becoming readily available through the application of high_throughput analytical_methods to distinguish and quantify mrna isoforms hold the potential for an unbiased and thorough insight into alternative_splicing however data analysis is not trivial and as a result the development of software for fast reliable and ultimately routine detection of alternative_splicing lags currently behind the sequencing capabilities the development of jsplice described here provides an important advance as it provides a method of unmatched specificity sensitivity and rapidity for the analysis of as events key_elements that currently hinder the comprehensive analysis of large_scale experiments thus jsplice is highly suitable for reliable analysis of alternative_splicing in largescale transcriptome_data application of jsplice on rna_seq of renal_carcinoma cells and human ccrcc tissues revealed novel validatable vhl and renal_cancer dependent alternative_splicing substantiating the value of jsplice as an analytical tool for genome_wide analysis of as events jsplice relies on a novel junction based definition of alternative_splicing modules that allows for a rapid detection of alternative_splicing simple or complex without having to rely on a predefined set of transcripts such as implemented in rmats or miso the concept of asms confers generality while keeping complexity at a low_level but the associated software diffsplice suffers from high execution time and low accuracy another key feature of jsplice is its entirely different method for the assessment of differential_expression that is to focus on expression fold_change instead of modeling biological and technical variations models of read_count distribution are necessary to estimate transcript_abundance for a given experiment and to assess_the of the change however a simple fold_change threshold as implemented in jsplice seems in practice sufficient to detect large splicing changes in comparisons of experiments supporting that argument recently pointed_out that a fold_change measurement is sufficient to identify differential_expression of genes of note as the complexity of an asm increases so does the number of pairwise_comparisons which increases the possibility of identifying a false_positive in this specific state jsplice may potentially overreport complex asm variability between replicates is inherent to biological_experiments and in the context of our simulations affected all tested methods nonetheless jsplice aims at ranking splicing_events by the amplitude of the change in order to provide a list of validatable genes for experimental biologists in that respect the larger changes are potentially the most relevant ones and jsplice showed a better accuracy than dexseq and rmats in detecting those additionally we demonstrated that the use of a different read_aligner different parameters or a different rnasequencing setup did not impact jsplices high_specificity application of jsplice to detect alternative_splicing in renal_carcinoma cells as a function of pvhl status identified alternative_splicing in myo dnmt b nedd l and tmcc since loss of vhl represents a signature lesion in human ccrcc it is attractive to consider that one or more of these changes in alternative_splicing contribute in part to renal carcinogenesis myosin vi myo whose alternative_splicing event was identified by jsplice in both cell_lines experiment and tcga data moves d events identified by jsplice are outlined in orange splice_graphs with alternative exons in gray were inferred from ucsc annotations jsplice and its application to renal cancertoward the minus end of actin_filaments and is involved in the transport of vesicles and organelles the three exons that we found alternatively_spliced in renal_carcinoma cells encode a fragment referred to as long insert located in the cargo binding tail of myosin vi thus the presence of the long insert may affect motor cargo interactions it may also confer preferential expression in polarized cells such as kidney cells as the long isoform of myosin vi is more abundant in pvhl proficient renal_carcinoma cells and in healthy_tissue compared to tumor it is conceivable that a myosin vi switch from the long to the short isoform may contribute to the loss of polarization of transformed kidney cells dnmt b is implicated in chromatin methylation and has been previously shown to be differentially spliced in multiple_cancer also the alternative exon identified in this study has been previously shown to discriminate between pluripotent and differentiated_cells gopalakrishna pillai and iverson thus pvhldependent changes in dnmt b splicing may be added to the growing list of chromatin modifying enzymes functionally altered in human ccrcc nedd l has been shown to regulate tgf_beta signaling and its gene_expression has been associated with several cancers however the reported alternative_splicing event has not been explored tmcc is the least studied of the four genes identified in the jsplice analysis in renal_carcinoma cells in a recent study it has been shown to anchor in the endoplasmic_reticulum er to regulate er membrane_organization and the attachment of ribosomes to the er the short isoform identified in this study would encode only the c terminal transmembrane_domain and create a loss of function it has been previously_reported that splicing_events are not necessarily specific to one cancer type but rather that common splicing signatures exist consistent with this notion our jsplice analysis of rna_seq from human ccrcc obtained from the tcga archive unveiled potentially generic alternative_splicing in syk previously shown to occur in breast_and and mknk found in breast lung and colon_cancers in the case of mknk we observed a highly_significant correlation between the relative expression of the mknk isoforms and patient outcome given the very encouraging reports on the recent development of orally available small_molecule splicing modifiers for the treatment of spinal_muscular it will be exciting to explore the possibility of targeting mknk alternative_splicing as a line of therapy in cancer as analysis of large_scale patient data such as provided by the tcga is currently unachievable with other software such as dexseq or rmats their long execution time or their inability to use read_counts as inputs renders them impractical for large_scale analyses in that respect jsplice offers a convenient and fast solution as a consequence a pan cancer analysis of alternative_splicing in patient data is now feasible and may reveal potential splicing signatures suitable for diagnostic and therapeutic_applications
