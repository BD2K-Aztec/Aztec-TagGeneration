structural_bioinformatics specificity and affinity quantification of protein_protein motivation most biological_processes are mediated by the protein_protein determination of the proteinprotein structures and insight into their interactions are vital to understand the mechanisms of protein functions currently compared with the isolated protein_structures only a small fraction of proteinprotein structures are experimentally solved therefore the computational docking methods play_an in predicting the structures and interactions of proteinprotein_complexes the scoring_function of proteinprotein_interactions is the key responsible for the accuracy of the computational docking previous scoring_functions were mostly developed by optimizing the binding_affinity which determines the stability of the proteinprotein_complex but they are often lack of the consideration of specificity which determines the discrimination of native protein protein complex against competitive ones results we developed a scoring_function named as spa pp spe cificity and affinity of the proteinprotein_interactions by incorporating both the specificity and affinity into the optimization strategy the testing results and comparisons with other scoring_functions show that spa pp performs remarkably on both predictions of binding pose and binding_affinity thus spa pp is a promising quantification of proteinprotein_interactions which can be implemented into the protein_docking tools and applied for the predictions of proteinprotein structure and affinity availability the algorithm is implemented in c language and the code can be downloaded fromproteins often function only when they are assembled into complexes the formation of highly_efficient and specific protein_complexes particularly proteinprotein_complexes is a fundamental_process in the cell the structures of the proteinprotein_complexes are the principal_components of a systems level description of genome_wide protein networks which rely on the coordinated and tightly_regulated activities of interacting_proteins the proteinprotein_interactions play_a in various mechanisms of protein functions and become attractive targets_for thus determination of the proteinprotein structures and insights into their interactions are increasingly important in the post genomic era although the individual protein_structures are increasingly well determined protein assemblies are still poorly represented in the protein_data this is because the experimental determination of assembly compositions and structures generally requires the combination of a number of the experimental_techniques and theoretical approaches to maximize completeness accuracy and resolution as an alternative computational docking approaches provide a practical mean to predict the structures of multi protein assemblies starting from the individual components computational docking procedure usually incorporates two steps initial sampling of the configurational space of the interacting_proteins to generate docking poses and pose scoring to select the putative native or nearnative proteinprotein conformations comparative_assessment of the current proteinprotein_docking and scoring approaches shows that efficient sampling strategies may generate the library of poses including the native or near native poses however the scoring_function often fails to discriminate the native or nearnative poses against other non native poses and can not always produce reliable estimation of the binding_affinity of the complex suggesting there is substantial room for the improvement of the scoring_functions the development strategies of previous scoring_functions for proteinprotein_docking whether physicsbased empirical or knowledge based mainly focus on the prediction of binding_affinity or free_energy which determines the stability of the complex however high_affinity does not guarantee high_specificity which is controlled by either partner binding to other proteins discriminatively the development strategies of previous scoring_functions are often lack of the to whom correspondence should be addressed considerations of the specificity which is the discrimination of the specific native proteinprotein_complex against the competitive ones according to the boltzman distribution p expf kt the equilibrium population is exponentially dependent on the binding_free a gap in binding_free or affinity will lead to significant population discrimination between the specific complex and alternative ones as such introducing the consideration of specificity into the computational_design of proteinprotein_interactions has achieve a few successful applications these work designed interactions that seek to stabilize the desired structures and also destabilize the competitive structures as the specificity related interactions lie in the binding patches constituting the interface of the complex malod thus to develop a scoring_function the strategy should satisfy the requirement that the stability of the specific complex is maximized whereas the stability of competing complexes is minimized which can guarantee both the stability and the specificity for the specific complex the conventional definition of specificity is the preference of a protein ligand specifically binding to a protein receptor over other competitive alternatives the definition is clear although in practice the quantification of the conventional specificity still remains_challenging the conventional specificity requires comparison of the affinities of all the different protein receptors with the same protein ligand this makes the practical quantification of the specificity impossible as the receptor universe is huge and the information is often incomplete on the competitive alternatives to circumvent the challenge we have proposed a novel concept named as intrinsic specificity which had been successfully_applied in the receptorligand where the ligand is small_molecule and the receptor is the protein system here we apply the concept to the proteinprotein system the intrinsic specificity refers to the preference in affinity of a protein ligand_binding to its protein receptor with a preferred pose over other poses imagining the n and c terminus of multiple protein receptors is linked together resulting in an effective single large receptor then the conventional specificity can be transformed to the intrinsic specificity that a ligand binds to the large receptor covering the whole universe of proteins with a preferred pose over other poses the equivalence of conventional specificity and intrinsic specificity is under the assumption that the protein receptor is sufficiently_large to represent the whole universe of proteins and their interfaces in reality there is only finite number of protein_folds in nature thus the protein receptor may not need to be infinitely large to represent the whole universe of proteins a reasonable size of protein surface may provide a few of the diversified interfacial interactions presumably formed by the whole universe of proteins the process of proteinprotein binding can be physically quantified and visualized as a funnel like energy_landscape towards the native binding state with local roughness along the binding paths the native_conformation of the complex is the conformation with the lowest binding_energy the energies of the conformation ensemble follow a statistical gaussian like distribution according to the theory of energy_landscape the intrinsic specificity ratio isr e ein this work we developed a scoring_function for proteinprotein_interactions named as spa pp the development strategy of spa pp takes_into of both specificity and affinity of proteinprotein binding it represents a significant advance over the previous investigations on proteinprotein binding_interactions and scoring_functions which only focused on affinity for development also we used the largest set of high_quality proteinprotein structures so_far for training the scoring_function it makes spa pp independent on the training_set and more general for applications the remarkable performance of spa pp was validated by testing the ability on the predictions of native pose and binding_affinity the success of spa pp demonstrates that the specificity is critical to the proteinprotein_interactions and necessary to be incorporated to the scoring_function and the computational_design of the proteinprotein_interactions spapp is a kind of statistical pair potentials which are discrete potentials dependent on the distances between the interacting atom pairs the statistical pair potentials incorporate multiple energy_terms such as van_der electrostatic_interactions and hydrophobic_interactions into one potential energy term therefore the computational docking procedure with spa pp could cost less computational time if spa pp is implemented into the sampling and ranking of proteinprotein binding is statistical_significance p the predicted affinity is obtained by scaling the binding scores with a linear equation y which is a fitting equation based on the experimental affinities
