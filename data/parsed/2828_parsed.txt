mcscanx transposed detecting transposed gene_duplications based on multiple colinearity scans gene_duplication occurs via different modes such as seg mental and single gene_duplications transposed gene_duplication a specific form of single gene_duplication copies a gene from an ancestral chromosomal location to a novel location mcscanx is a toolkit for detection and evolutionary_analysis of gene colinearity we have developed mcscanx transposed a software_package to detect transposed gene_duplications that occurred within different epochs based on execution of mcscanx within and between related genomes mcscanx transposed can be also used for integrative_analysis of gene_duplication modes for a genome and to annotate a gene_family of interest with gene_duplication modes availability mcscanx transposed is freely_available atgene duplication is a primary mechanism for increasing genetic complexity and diversity it has long been known that gene_duplication occurs via different modes large_scale gene_duplications including whole_genome wgd and segmental_duplication have occurred in different eukaryotic lineages such as fungi plants and vertebrates single gene_duplications also widespread in eukaryotic_genomes by mechanisms_include local tandem or proximal duplication which creates two nearby duplicated_genes and transposed duplication which copies a gene from an ancestral location to a novel transposed location via either dna or rna based mechanisms different modes of gene_duplication may contribute differentially to the evolution of specific lineages the retention of duplicated_genes following different modes of gene_duplication is biased for example in arabidopsis_thaliana following wgds genes related to transcription_factors protein_kinases and ribosomal_proteins were preferentially retained local duplicates are enriched for genes that encode membrane_proteins and function in abiotic_and gene_families such as f box mads_box nbslrr and defensins are more likely to have transposed than others moreover different modes of gene_duplication often show distinct evolutionary consequences de smet and van in rodents transposed duplications show higher degrees of asymmetric sequence_divergence than local duplications in a thaliana duplicated_genes retained from single gene_duplications especially transposed duplication are more likely to show rewiring of gene_networks than those retained from wgds arabidopsis interactome mapping consortium to study the evolutionary_dynamics of duplicated_genes it is helpful to investigate gene_duplication modes duplicated_genes originating from wgd and segmental_duplication can be obtained by using software for detection of gene colinearity homologous_genes are in corresponding chromosomal_regions and conserved orders however to our knowledge automated tools for detecting transposed gene_duplications are not available transposed duplications in a genome and the epochs during which they occurred can be inferred based on colinearity conservation within and between related genomes mcscan is an algorithm to scan genomes to identify colinear homologs and duplicated chromosomal_regions mcscanx is a toolkit for colinearity detection based on an adjusted mcscan i e mcscanx algorithm and evolutionary_analyses of identified colinearity here we present mcscanx transposed a software_package based on execution of mcscanx within and between related genomes for detecting transposed gene_duplications which occurred within different epochs as well as integrative_analysis of gene_duplication modes or the java se development kit and libpng should be pre installed respectively the user is advised to read the readme txt file that provides detailed instructions on input file_formats and command_line options
