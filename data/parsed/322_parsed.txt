genome_analysis an empirical_bayes mixture_model for snp_detection in pooled sequencing_data detecting single_nucleotide snp in pooled_sequencing is more challenging than in individual sequen_cing because of sampling variations across pools to effectively differentiate snp signal from sequencing_error appropriate estimation of the sequencing_error is necessary in this article we propose an empirical_bayes mixture ebm model for snp_detection and allele frequency_estimation in pooled_sequencing results the proposed model reliably learns the error_distribution by pooling information across pools and genomic positions in addition the proposed ebm model builds in characteristics unique to the pooled_sequencing boosting the sensitivity of snp_detection for large_scale inference in snp_detection the ebm model provides a flexible and robust way for estimation and control of local_false we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through simulation_studies application recent_advances ngs_technologies have significantly_reduced the cost and time involved in sequencing the human_genome in hundreds_or of individuals the resulting comprehensive genomic_analyses will provide_powerful for discovering the genetic_variations underlying complex phenotypic_traits ngs holds the promise of revolutionizing genetic_studies due to its ability to detect rare_variants that are not observed in array based genome_wide gwas the importance of rare_variants underlying complex_diseases has been discussed in a number of recent_articles it is believed that rare_variants account for a significant proportion of genetic heritability missed by previous gwas although the cost of ngs has dropped dramatically over the past_few it is still prohibitively_expensive to sequence individual genome at a sufficient read_depth an alternative approach to reduce the cost of sample_preparation and sequencing is to pool genomic_dna from multiple_individuals and sequence the pooled_dna samples the feasibility of pooled sequencing has been demonstrated in several studies used pooled sequencing to identify causal rare_variants in candidate_genes of type i diabetes when analyzing ngs_data the first step is to identify polymorphic_sites in the genomic_regions a number of computational_methods have been developed to identify singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps in individual sequenced samples these methods use sequencing and mapping quality_scores to distinguish true snps from sequencing and mapping errors some methods utilize cross sample information to estimate sequencing_error at each genomic_position in addition incorporation of pedigree_information and linkage_disequilibrium ld has been demonstrated to significantly improve snp_calling accuracy in individual sequencing methods for individual sequencing do not directly apply to snp_calling in pooled sequencing characteristics unique to pooled sequencing make snp_calling more challenging than in individual sequencing first because of sampling_variation the frequency of a variant allele will vary across the pools allele_frequency in a pool is a function of the population allele_frequency and pool size number of individuals in a pool in cases in which there exists a rare_variant with small_pool size the presence of the variant allele will be sporadic across pools in contrast in individual sequencing the variant allele_frequency for a diploid sample is or variation of allele_frequency across pools makes_it to differentiate the true snp signal from sequencing_error second external_information such as pedigree and ld_information is not available in pooled sequencing third because of the small number of pools it is almost impossible to get a good estimate of the sequencing_error using only cross pool information therefore sophisticated methods are needed to call snps in pooled sequencing recently several snp_calling methods designed for pooled sequencing have been reported snpseeker derived from large deviation theory requires negative control data to estimate error_model crisp comprehensive read analysis for identification of single_nucleotide from pooled sequencing models allele counts across multiple pools using contingency_tables it uses fishers_exact to detect uneven distributions of variant reads across pools and then uses chernoff bound to compute an upper_bound on the p value of the overabundance of alternate alleles within each to whom correspondence should be addressed pool against the sequencing_error this method builds on the assumption that the presence of a rare_variant in a pool is likely to cause excess variant reads compared with the other pools such an assumption does not hold for less rare or common_variant and is questionable when the pool size is large consequently crisp is not effective for detection of less rare and common_snps as an alternative approach snver models variant reads in a single pool using a binomialbinomial model and combines p values from multiple pools to identify snps because it is difficult to simultaneously estimate the population allele_frequency and sequencing_error using the binomialbinomial model snver arbitrarily specifies the sequencing_error to be for all positions as we show in the simulation_studies inaccurate specification of sequencing_error will lead to high_false and low sensitivity in this article we introduce an empirical_bayes mixture ebm model for detecting snps in pooled_sequencing in contrast to the existing_methods that detect snps one at a time the ebm model learns error_distribution by pooling information across multiple pools and genomic positions it is well known that the sequencing_error at each position is highly_reproducible across samples or pools cross sample information in individual sequencing has been gathered to estimate sequencing_error however in pooled sequencing direct estimation sequencing_error has not been explored due to the small number of pools available and the variations of allele_frequency across pools additional information is needed to obtain a good estimate of the sequencing_error in pooled sequencing using the ebm model data across genomic positions can be pooled to learn the error_distribution since the density of a snp is estimated to be approximately of bases leveraging the information from a large number of null positions will allow fairly accurate estimation of the error_distribution the fundamental idea of pooling information to estimate null_distribution in empirical_bayes methods has been applied to genomic_data since the advent of microarray_analysis extended efrons empirical_bayes method to detect snps in individual sequencing in this article different from previous methods we propose an ebm model that builds in characteristics unique to pooled sequencing for snp_detection the ebm model blurs the line between hypothesis_testing and parameter_estimation in addition to snp_detection the proposed method_produces empirical_bayes shrinkage estimation of allele_frequency allele frequency_estimation is important for downstream_analyses such as association studies or population genetic_analysis yet it is left unexplored by the current snp_detection methods in the ebm model snp_detection and allele frequency_estimation are nicely integrated in the following sections we will present mathematical formulation of the ebm model and demonstrate its performance through simulation_studies and a real_data application
