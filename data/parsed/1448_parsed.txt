structural_bioinformatics dman a java tool for analysis of multi well differential scanning fluorimetry experiments differential scanning fluorimetry dsf is a rapid technique that can be used in structural_biology to study protein_ligand we have developed dman a novel tool to analyse multi well plate data obtained in dsf experiments dman is easy to install and provides a user_friendly interface multi well plate layouts can be designed by the user and experimental_data can be annotated and analysed by dman according to the specified plate layout statistical_tests for significance are performed automatically and graphical tools are also provided to assist in data analysis the modular concept of this software will allow easy development of other multi well plate analysis applications in the future availability_and dman is implemented_in to provide a cross_platform compatibility it is freely_available to academic users at http www structuralchemistry org pcsb to download dman users will be asked for their name institution and email address a manual can also be downloaded from this site contact assays in multi well plate formats have become very popular and are frequently employed in laboratories in different disciplines of the life_sciences due to their wide applicability uv_vis absorbance and fluorescence_emission measurements are the most common readouts in such assays in the area of structural_biology differential scanning fluorimetry dsf has established itself as a tool to assess protein_stability in the context of structurefunction studies but most importantly to rapidly_identify low_molecular ligands that bind to the protein of interest due to the relatively low amounts of sample required and the parallel measurement of many conditions on one multi well plate dsf also lends itself as a first line screening method for potential small_molecule ligands in structure based_drug including fragment_based dsf experiments are typically conducted with a real_time pcr instrument where the protein sample is mixed with an additive to be screened and the fluorescence to whom correspondence should be addressed dye sypro orange that shows enhanced fluorescence_emission in hydrophobic environment the dye binds to the exposed hydrophobic_residues of proteins in their unfolded_states and thus serves as a reporter to monitor thermally_induced protein_unfolding analysis software for any instrument acquired data is provided by the manufacturers and shows varying_degrees of convenience and user_friendliness in case of dsf analysis of data from some instruments requires subsequent application of several different software programs therefore making the entire_process rather cumbersome we set out to design a simple to use and portable java_application dman which enables analysis of dsf data on multi well plates with any user chosen layout of replica typically biochemical measurements are done in triplicate in order to prevent instrument biased systematic errors due to non uniform temperature_distribution across the pcr block we prefer to measure replica data on one plate with the individual replica mixtures spread over the plate the java_application reported here can analyse these repetitions given the particular plate layout and perform standard statistical_tests the graphical_user of the stand alone java_application dman possesses four tabbed panels on the first panel input_parameters the user needs to specify the data file and its origin i e instrument type the plate layout provided as an ascii text_file the output_file a title and description of the assay the temperature_range of the experiment and the slope threshold the user can also specify the t m threshold and the outlier cutoff which are used during analysis to evaluate the
