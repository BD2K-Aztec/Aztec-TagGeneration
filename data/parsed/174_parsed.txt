a hidden ising_model for chip_chip data analysis motivation chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip coupled with tiling microarray chip experiments have been used in a wide_range of biological studies such as identification of transcription_factor and investigation of dna_methylation and histone_modification hidden_markov are widely used to model the spatial dependency of chip_chip data however parameter_estimation for these models is typically either heuristic or suboptimal leading to inconsistencies in their applications to overcome_this and to develop an efficient software we propose a hidden ferromagnetic ising_model for chip_chip data analysis results we have developed a simple but powerful bayesian_hierarchical for chip_chip data via a hidden ising_model metropolis within gibbs_sampling algorithm is used to simulate from the posterior_distribution of the model_parameters the proposed model naturally incorporates the spatial dependency of the data and can be used to analyze data with various genomic resolutions and sample_sizes we illustrate the method using three publicly_available datasets and various simulated_datasets and compare it with three closely_related methods namely tilemap hmm tilehmm and bac we find that our method performs as well as tilemap hmm and bac for the high_resolution data from affymetrix platform but significantly_outperforms the other three methods for the low_resolution data from agilent platform compared with the bac method which also involves mcmc simulations our method is computationally much more efficient availability a software called ichip is freely_available atidentification of the sites of interactions between proteins and genomic_dna is one of the most important topics in biological_research the emergence of high_density tiling microarrays has made it possible to create high_resolution global maps of the in vivo interactions between specific proteins and genomes tiling arrays use millions of short oligonucleotide_probes with various resolutions to interrogate genomic_regions of interest chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip chip_analysis has become a powerful technique used to determine the binding_sites of dna_binding to whom correspondence should be addressed proteins at a genome_wide basis it is a challenge to analyze chip_chip data due to the huge amount of probes the small number of replicates and various noises introduced in the experiments the most important feature of chipchip data is the neighboring dependency of the probe intensities quite a few of existing_methods in the literature make efforts to incorporate the dependence_structure of chip_chip data into various statistical_models sliding_window methods may be the most straightforward ones these methods are to test a hypothesis for each probe or region using the statistic that is built based on all the probes information within a sliding_window of certain genomic_distance the test_statistics used are varied for example used wilcoxons rank sum statistics used the moving average of classical t statistics ji andused the moving average of empirical_bayesian t statistics andused the moving average of log ratios since a huge number of tests are performed and the test_statistics are not independent these approaches leave with a difficult problem for multiple_hypothesis adjustment two significant variants of the sliding_window methods are the joint binding deconvolution jbd and the model based deconvolution with the software medichi which fit a local regression for each probe with the nearby probes within a sliding_window used as explanatory_variables and the inference is made based on the fitted regression_coefficients hidden_markov hmms are appealing approaches to model the dependency of chip_chip data however in most of the existing implementations of hmm methods parameter_estimation for the models is typically either ad_hoc or suboptimal for chip_chip data for example estimated the model_parameters using the results from a previous affymetrix snp_array experiments estimated the model_parameters using the baumwelch algorithm used the baumwelch algorithm plus viterbi training to estimate the model_parameters the major_limitation of these algorithms as pointed_out by is that the baumwelch algorithm tends to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood_function and the viterbi training algorithm even fails to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood in some cases therefore the parameter_estimates and followed inference are often suboptimal to the problem markov_random is a natural generation of markov processes in which a space index is used to replace the time index markov_random models are appealing alternative_approaches for chip_chip data because the spacial dependency can be naturally modeled page in this article we have presented a simple but powerful bayesian_hierarchical method to model chip_chip data through a hidden ferromagnetic ising_model this approach naturally takes_into the intrinsic dependency of chip_chip data and can be used to analyze data with various genomic resolutions and sample_sizes we comparatively evaluated our method and three closely_related methods using three real and various simulated_datasets the results showed that our method performed as well as tilemap hmm and bac in terms of sensitivity_and in detecting ipenriched regions for the high_resolution data however our method significantly_outperformed the alternatives for the low_resolution data the results showed that tilehmm did not work consistently it essentially failed for the p nanog and oct data because it was not able to distinguish enriched and non enriched probes see and the regions detected by tilehmm are obviously dominated by false_positives however it worked as well as the three alternative_methods on the simulated highresolution data c and e for the simulated low_resolution data tilehmm had extremely_high false_positive at various posterior_probability cutoffs d and f since all the four methods essentially make efforts to estimate the state enriched or non enriched of each probe ideally it is expected that probelevel posterior_probabilities should be dichotomized either close to for the enriched state or for the non enriched state which can be used as a criterion for evaluating the performance of these methods in terms of dichotomization our method performed the best followed by tilemap hmm and bac and tilehmm performed the worst the three alternative_methods used for comparison in this article are closely_related to the ising_model we use the markov_model is essentially a d ising_model for details see vice_versa the model we proposed can also be treated as a hmm in which the transition_matrix is determined by the interaction_parameter and the emission probabilities are determined by the equation in addition the gaussian intrinsic auto regression_model used bycan also be viewed as a continuous extension of the ising_model since all the four methods basically use the same idea to model chip_chip data why does our method outperform the others for the low_resolution data this could be owed to the way we model the data and the algorithm used for parameter_estimation in our method metropolis within gibbs_sampling algorithm is used to estimate the model_parameters which is known to converge to their target distributions when the number of iterations becomes large
