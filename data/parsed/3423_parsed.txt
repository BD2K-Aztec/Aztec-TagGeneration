data_and parametric bayesian priors and better choice of negative_examples improve protein_function motivation computational_biologists have demonstrated the utility of using machine_learning to predict protein_function from an integration of multiple genome_wide data types yet even the best performing function prediction_algorithms rely on heuristics for important components of the algorithm such as choosing negative_examples proteins without a given function or determining key_parameters the improper choice of negative_examples in particular can hamper the accuracy of protein_function results we present a novel approach for choosing negative_examples using a parameterizable bayesian prior computed from all observed annotation data which also generates priors used during function prediction we incorporate this new method into the genemania function prediction algorithm and demonstrate improved accuracy of our algorithm over current top performing function prediction_methods on the yeast and mouse proteomes across all metrics tested availability code and data are available at http bonneaulab bio the rate of new protein discovery has in recent_years outpaced our ability to annotate and characterize new proteins and proteomes to combat this functional_annotation deficit many groups have successfully turned to computational_techniques attempting to predict the function of proteins to guide experimental_verification specifically there has been a surge of interest in applying machine_learning to the problem of protein_function fp to take advantage of the wealth of biological data available for each protein beyond its sequence such as computationally predicted tertiary_structure which has already been shown to aid fp while traditional approaches to fp mainly involved either homology with limitations of accuracy or manual_curation dependent on rare expertise these new methods present new evaluation and comparative challenges the mousefunc competition pen was organized to test the ability of machine_learning to take advantage of large integrated datasets and provide useful predictions of gene function the validity of integrative approaches to fp was first demonstrated by the works of which respectively used linkage graphs and a bayesian_network to predict function by the time of the mousefunc competition fp methods had become diverse including support_vector random_forests decision_trees and several composite methods but a recurring theme was to use proteinprotein networks of various types to determine function based on guilt by association in such a method genes are represented by nodes in a network with weighted edges defined by a similarity_metric obtained from raw_data often the pearson_correlation of feature_vectors predictions are then formed by propagating information from genes known to have a function through the network to unlabeled genes while providing unprecedented accuracy the methods of the mousefunc competition exposed several general challenges still remaining for the fp problem i choosing a set of high_confidence negative_examples ii using available data to form prior beliefs about the biological_functions of a gene and iii effectively combining disparate data_sources as no comprehensive database of functional negative_examples currently exists and nearly all major machine_learning require a negative class for the training of a classifier the selection of high_confidence negative_examples is especially important for the fp problem in this work we begin to address these challenges by presenting a parameterizable bayesian technique for computing prior functional biases for each gene and a novel method for selecting negative_examples using these biases to apply our method we use the framework of the genemania algorithm one of the highest performing competitors in mousefunc in addition to our new priors and negative_examples we present a framework for tuning our bayesian parameters and other parameters in the original genemania algorithm to facilitate this parameter_tuning we incorporate new optimization techniques that take advantage of the structure to whom correspondence should be addressed of the optimization_problem we also integrate our novel negative_examples into the genemania network combination algorithm that synthesizes heterogeneous data into one affinity network while well established procedures exist for the comparison of machine_learning recent work has exposed and discussed problems that can be introduced into these comparisons by the nature of biological data to mitigate these biases we heed the suggestions of greene and troyanskaya and focus on evaluation with a temporal holdout an evaluation set of annotations obtained later in time than the training data referred to in this article and in the mousefunc competition as the novel evaluation setting we also include one of the few available gold_standard evaluation sets an exhaustive experimental evaluation of the presence of a particular protein_function across an entire_genome obtained from huttenhower et_al our goal is to demonstrate the performance_improvements of our new algorithm over the existing state of the art in a fair apples to apples comparison across several datasets we expect that these comparative results will generalize to other datasets as they become available we have addressed several of the key problems_encountered by protein_function efforts by proposing novel algorithms including a method of choosing negative_examples and a parameterized bayesian methodology for computing prior functional biases from existing annotation data these methods applied using the framework of the genemania algorithm have resulted in a significant performance increase across three large benchmarks we also introduced a new optimization methodology which significantly_decreased computational costs we devised a framework for tuning parameters in a synthetic novel set which added further performance_gain in the novel scenario in mouse but it requires_additional work to be more broadly_applicable to other evaluation scenarios our new swsn network combination algorithm shows even more promise in settings with more extensive negative example information finally we presented a new evaluation metric designed to be easily_interpretable by experimentalists even when averaged over many function categories when comparing performance statistics of different algorithms a difference of a few percentage_points can mean hundreds of new true annotations when applied across all functions for example a increase in topscore would result in new true annotations were an experimentalist to use that metric to guide experiments over the go mf categories in the mouse_genome at the time of mousefunc publication thus we believe the algorithms presented here have the potential to guide experimentalists to a large number of fruitful assays andnote for both algorithms using the sw network combination algorithm negative_examples were chosen according to the sibling technique discussed in section are in general aligned with current biological understanding of how genes are functionally_related to each other through different data types we have shown that our algorithm can perform function prediction through data_integration and guilt by association with substantially more accuracy and efficiency than previously_published algorithms and provided insight into some of the inherent difficulties_encountered by the development and evaluation of protein_function prediction_algorithms
