cemasuite open_source degenerate pcr primer_design the codon equivalent multiple_alignment suite begins conservational analysis for poly merase chain reaction primer_design at the protein level allowing the user to design consensus primers capable of detecting homologous coding_sequences even when low to moderate sequence_information is available this package also condenses the wealth of information associated with multiple_sequence and presents them in an intuitive manner allowing the user to quickly and effectively address degenerate primer_design considerations availability_and https sourceforge net_projects cemasuite in many polymerase_chain pcr applications it is desirable to design pcr_primers which can amplify across similar targeted dna_fragments some examples_include genetic_screening to detect homologous_genes across multiple_organisms and working with highly_variable sequences such as in viral_strains primers can be designed within a conserved_region of the target_sequences in such a way that the annealing properties of the primers remain relatively unchanged across multiple_templates minor variations in the sequences can be accounted for by introducing degenerate positions into the primers however increasing the degeneracy of a primer also increases the likelihood of stable sites outside of the target_region leading to an increased risk of byproduct formation byproduct formation is undesirable in pcr as it can lead to falsetype results by out competing and or having similar product sizes as the amplicon and or additional purification_steps for downstream cloning applications in this work we present cemasuite https sourceforge net pro jects cemasuite an open_source java_based application with the ability to i construct a codon equivalent multiple_alignment cema from a protein multiple_sequence msa file ii generate and score each consensus dna_sequence position using multiple algorithms iii design single degeneracy primer backbones using primer and iv estimate the stability of degenerate_primers on each of the coding_sequences cdss within the cema the goal of cemasuite is to aid in the design of degenerate primer_sets which are robust enough for the assay at hand yet retain as much specificity and product homology as possible cemasuite begins the conservational analysis for primer_design on the protein level where r as opposed to coding_dna where r a cema is generated by obtaining the primary cdss of proteins in an extant msa and expanding each position within the protein msa to the observed codon representing each amino_acid since many primer_design applications can account for positional quality in their objective_functions each position within a consensus_sequence for a cema is scored by one of four algorithms these algorithms are detailed in the user_manual briefly the percent identity algorithm scores each position based on the normalized frequency of the consensus nucleotide identity runs scores positions on identity then adjusts the value based on the number of consecutive completely conserved positions in the locale potential degeneracy scores positions on identity and then adjusts the value based on the potential degeneracy of the consensus codon positions according to one of translation tables the final algorithm runs degeneracy scores values sequentially using logic from each of the three methods described above the location of a primer within a cema is considered to be the region with the least total number of mismatches throughout all sequences for cases where there are equal numbers of mismatches the algorithm returns the index with mismatches occurring mostly on the end simulated hybridization of the primers to each template is performed by iterating through all possible permutations of a degenerate primer and estimating its most stable conformation when bound to the respective location of the template each simulated hybridization event returns a gibbs_free value estimated using nearest_neighbor thermodynamics which is corrected using one of two entropic correction formulas detailed in user_manual because cemasuite begins conservational analysis at the protein level the primers obtained through this application will have a high likelihood of successful amplification even when the templatethat the user would like to flag as likely to fail amplification are highlighted if they possess an individual primer less stable than the user input individual primer warning threshold yellow and or the sum of the stability values of both primers is less stable than the primer_set warning threshold red selective addition of degeneracy via the popup menu is shown in the forward primer input region color version of this figure is available at bioinformatics online cemasuitesequence information is unknown e g pcr_amplification of a novel environmental isolate additionally because actual cds information is used and degeneracy can be added as needed users are free to balance the specificity and sensitivity of a pcr primer_set it is important to note that even though cemasuite incorporates primer functionality the scoring algorithms and output graphics significantly speed up the process of primer_design by inspection for those with moderate primer_design experience we expect cemasuite to be a valuable assay_design tool for applications such as genetic environmental screening working with highly_variable sequences and dna quality_control via pcr an active open_source community dedicated to improving the degenerate pcr primer_design process is the goal of this project and the participation of those whom are interested is encouraged this application is released under public licensing gnu gpl v
