iterative correction of reference nucleotides icorn using second generation sequencing_technology motivation the accuracy of reference_genomes is important for downstream_analysis but a low_error requires expensive manual interrogation of the sequence here we describe a novel algorithm iterative correction of reference nucleotides that iteratively aligns deep coverage of short_sequencing to correct errors in reference genome_sequences and evaluate their accuracy results using plasmodium_falciparum a t content as an extreme example we show that the algorithm is highly_accurate and corrects over errors in the reference_sequence we give examples of its application to numerous other eukaryotic and prokaryotic_genomes and suggest additional applications availability the software is available at http icorn sourceforge netalthough there are now over whole genome_sequences in the public_databases their level of accuracy varies_considerably the aspiration set by the human_genome was for a maximum of one error per kb of finished sequence international human however the true error_rate varies_significantly from this figure depending on the nature of the sequence base_composition repeats etc both in human and in other organisms even to achieve this error_rate expensive manual finishing is required to ensure that each base is covered by at least clones and has a cumulative phred score of at least the gold_standard for quality involves the manual_inspection of each base by an experienced finisher this is a major expense within a genome_project for example nine chromosomes of plasmodium_falciparum were completed at the wellcome_trust sanger institute by the equivalent of approximately seven finishers working for up to years despite this and subsequent efforts since publication as we show here many errors are still present even in genomes described as completed or finished the underlying quality at each base is unknown and the error_rate can be variable genome_wide therefore rapidly fixing errors highlighting regions that are error_prone and quantifying accuracy genome_wide is a priority that will significantly benefit the end_user to whom correspondence should be addressed so_far few methods exist to correct genomic errors automatically there are algorithms to improve base_calling or to detect frameshifts by protein homology or by sequence_analysis new assembly software like mira http www chevreux org projects mira html has also been developed that allows hybrid assemblies with different sequencing_technologies this can both assemble mixed sanger data and improve the homopolymer length errors in technologies using high illumina read_coverage to date however no methods exist that can accurately detect and correct base errors and small_indels in genome_sequences we have developed an algorithm that uses deep coverage of sequence_reads produced using illuminas genome analyser platform mapped iteratively to a reference_genome in a way that allows confident sequence correction to calibrate the ssaha alignment score threshold to detect real base errors but minimize false_positives all calls on a single chromosome at different calling thresholds were manually inspected by an experienced professional finisher this involved interrogating the capillary reads and their quality_scores in a gap database using a ssaha snp score of reflecting a base coverage of resulted in all of the corrections being confirmed this score was subsequently adopted for future analyses we first applied our algorithm to the genome_sequence of p falciparum a reference_sequence whose low complexity results from an extremely biased base_composition g c content the coverage plots show that the amount of mapping reads and perfectly mapping reads increase with each iteration after iterations no new corrections were called we found a total of base errors and indels in the first iteration of the base errors were corrected after the corrections the coverage of more bases pairs increased to at least and additional reads were perfectly mapped for most chromosomes the single base error_detection drops to zero after the fifth iteration supplementary intitially we found sites snp score that appear to be heterozygous in this haploid organism using a cutoff of of calls of an alternative base visual_inspection of the areas in which these heterozygous calls occurred however revealed that the majority were roughly symmetrically distributed around homopolymeric tracts the remainder appears to be strand specific as they only occur in one read direction and are clustered in general in sequences that are rich in t and g bases these calls were not present in the original capillary sequence_data and we believe them to be hitherto unreported systematic errors occurring during illumina_sequencing supplementary ninety_six of the genome is covered by a read_depth of so that we were unable at this level of confidence to correct the remaining of the genome these regions are mostly telomeric and non unique to test the accuracy of our algorithm we randomly introduced approximately one error per kb into the d sequence inserting a total of errors and used the illumina_reads to correct this altered genome using icorn in the first iteration of the errors were found supplementary as the errors were generated randomly they were not clustered page the total number of changes that were rejected because they decreased the total of perfectly mapping reads at that location percent genome covered indicates how many bases are covered at least five times by perfectly mapping reads before and after the correction new mapable reads indicates the additional number of reads that could be mapped by ssaha between the first and last iteration further information can be found in supplementary table s and could be found quickly the random_distribution also explains that of the introduced errors cannot be found as of the genome is not covered sufficiently to be corrected supplementary we further evaluated the performance of icorn by manually inspecting the capillary chromatograms of called errors in chromosomes and of corrected errors was rejected this region comprised a string of as with a g in the middle and was re sequenced following polymerase_chain pcr_amplification this confirmed the presence of the g that had been erroneously corrected by icorn to an a we suspect that this may be due to the fact that polya sequences are over represented in illumina data because of occasional edge_effects on the slide finally we designed an additional pcr_products over regions with correction eighty eight out of pcr_reactions were successful and in no case did the pcr_product sequence disagree with the changes called by icorn we next went on to assess the utility of this approach to correct the homopolymer errors that can occur using technology we applied it to a assembly of reads fragment_size kb from p berghei the contigs from the assembly were corrected with million bp pcrfree paired_end illumina_reads after iterations snps and indels were called shows a typical example where multiple frameshifts due to homopolymer errors are corrected after just two iterations shows similar data from the correction of a assembly of clostridium_difficile using deep illumina coverage in both cases more indels than snps are called due to homopolymer errors finally we applied icorn to a series of other eukaryotic and prokaryotic genome_projects in various stages of completion for finished bacterial_genomes very few or no corrections were made for those in draft assembly it was possible to call a number of errors in relatively few iterations this is presumablybecause bacteria generally have higher_coverage are shorter and have a less complex genome_structure than eukaryotes all errors in yersinia_enterocolitica and streptococcus suis were confirmed by manual_inspection of the trace files here we have shown that iterative mapping of short_reads can correct errors remaining in a reference_genome with great accuracy critical to the success of this approach is the use of two different mapping strategies during the iterations high_quality discrepancies called using ssaha are introduced into the genome and only confirmed if a separate mapping of perfectly aligning_reads along their whole length using snp o matic does not decrease coverage at the altered sites iterative mapping approaches have been used before to derive a consensus genome_sequence from metagenomic sequencing_data but since this derives from aggregated sequences from an unknown number of starting page
