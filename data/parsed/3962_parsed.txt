relating drug protein_interaction with drug side_effects motivation identifying the emergence and underlying_mechanisms of drug side_effects is a challenging_task in the drug_development process this underscores the importance of systemwide approaches for linking different scales of drug_actions namely drug protein interactions molecular_scale and side_effects phenotypic scale toward side effect prediction for uncharacterized drugs results we performed a large_scale analysis to extract correlated sets of targeted proteins and side_effects based on the co occurrence of drugs in protein binding_profiles and side effect profiles using sparse canonical_correlation the analysis of drugs with the two profiles for proteins and side_effects led to the extraction of correlated sets enrichment_analyses using kegg and gene_ontology showed that most of the correlated sets were significantly_enriched with proteins that are involved in the same biological_pathways even if their molecular_functions are different this allowed for a biologically_relevant interpretation regarding the relationship between drug targeted proteins and side_effects the extracted side_effects can be regarded as possible phenotypic outcomes by drugs targeting the proteins that appear in the same correlated set the proposed method is expected to be useful for predicting potential side_effects of new drug_candidate compounds based on their protein binding_profiles supplementary_information datasets and all results are available at http web kuicr kyoto u ac jp supp smizutan target effect availability software is available at the above supplementarypredicting and countering the side_effects of a new drug during its developmental_phase remain_important to the drugs overall commercial success side_effects are responsible for a significant number of cases where premarketed drugs fail during clinical_trials identifying the underlying_mechanisms of side_effects is a challenging_task often because of the drugs pleiotropic_effects on a biological system most drugs are small compounds that target and interact with proteins to induce perturbations in the proteins network this underscores the need of system wide approaches for predicting to whom correspondence should be addressed drug side_effects by linking different scales of drug_actions drug protein interactions molecular_scale and relationships between drugs and side_effects phenotypic scale the most widely used approach to identify possible side_effects for a drug is to use its chemical_structure information based on the observation that drug chemical_structures can direct the ligand promiscuity toward protein targets for example investigated correlations between drug_chemical and side_effects although they do not provide any prediction frameworks for new drug molecules proposed a method to predict the pharmacological_effects of drugs using their chemical_structures they then inferred drug_target but their method cannot be directly applied to the prediction of high_dimensional side effect profiles atias andproposed a method to predict side_effects from chemical_structure data using canonical_correlation cca this work was pioneering in terms of simultaneous prediction of many side_effects proposed a method to relate drug chemical fragments with side_effects using sparse cca scca and used the chemical fragments to predict side effect profiles however these chemical_structure based_methods cannot provide any biological interpretations regarding the underlying_mechanisms at a molecular_interaction level chemically unrelated drugs may present similar side_effects because they happen to share_common off target_proteins on the basis of this observation used side effect similarity of marketed drugs to predict drug pairs with common protein targets identified drug off targets by docking the drug into protein binding_pockets similar to that of its primary target followed by mapping the proteins with the best docking scores to known biological_pathways thus predicting potential side_effects using a similar docking approach searched for correlated pairs of side_effects and biological_pathways these docking based_methods depend heavily on the availability of protein d structures which presents serious limitations as many useful drug_targets are membrane_proteins for which very few structures are available from a system wide viewpoint performed a biological spectra based_approach to investigate the correlation between drug targeted proteins and their side_effects they clustered drugs based on their biological spectra i e their ability to inhibit each of selected proteins and revealed a correlation between the chemical_structures of the corresponding drugs and their biological_activity in terms of protein inhibition profile they further showed that drugs with similar protein inhibition profiles tend to cause similar side_effects however it remains difficult to experimentally determine the link between drug targeted proteins and side_effects in a large_scale datasets in a cost_effective and efficient manner therefore there is a strong incentive to develop computational_approaches for analyzing and predicting drug side_effects in this article we examine the correlation between drugprotein interactions and their side_effects on a large_scale without limiting ourselves to proteins of known d structures we identify correlated sets of proteins and side_effects based on the co occurrence of drugs in protein binding_profiles and in side effect profiles using scca results demonstrate that proteins in the same correlated set tend to be involved in only a few biological_pathways even if their molecular_functions are different we also address that the side_effects in each correlated set present possible outcomes from drug perturbations of corresponding proteins the originality of the proposed method lies in the integration of drugprotein interactions at a molecular_scale and drug side effect relationships at a phenotypic scale performance evaluation showed that this method works better than the case where chemical_structure profiles are used in the scca framework we also conduct a comprehensive side effect prediction for drug molecules stored in drugbank without side effect information and confirm interesting predictions using independent source of information in this article we proposed a novel scca based_approach to relate drug targeted proteins with drug side_effects using a crossvalidation scheme we found that the proposed approach displays better performance than chemical_structure based_methods for the prediction of drug side_effects results suggest that side effect of drugs are more correlated to their mechanism of action rather than to their chemical_structure which presents an interesting result in most drug_discovery projects a therapeutic_target playing a role in a given disease is searched for and once identified the corresponding pathways can be identified the components that are enriched in these pathways provide a list of potential side_effects that one can expect for future drugs acting on the target of interest we constructed a statistical_model for the prediction of side effect profiles from protein binding_profiles primarily because the number of drugs with side effect information is much less than those with targeted protein information indeed it is unlikely in a practical situation that detailed side effect profiles are known for newly arriving drug_candidate molecules one limitation of our proposed method is that targeted protein information is not always obtainable however increasing information regarding proteinligand_interactions is becoming available from various biological_assays thus we envisage scenarios where a drug_candidate moleculesf targeted protein information is available but not side effect information in this context we believe that our proposed method presents itself as a powerful and informative tool for use within the drug_discovery
