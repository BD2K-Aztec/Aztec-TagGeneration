sequence_analysis biovlab mmia ngs microrna mrna integrated analysis using high_throughput it is now well established that micrornas mirnas play_a in regulating gene_expression in a sequence specific_manner and genome_wide efforts are underway to predict known and novel mirna_targets however the integrated mirnamrna analysis remains a major computational challenge requiring powerful informatics systems and bioinformatics expertise results the objective of this study was to modify our widely_recognized web_server for the integrated mrnamirna analysis mmia and its subsequent deployment on the amazon cloud biovlab mmia to be compatible with high_throughput platforms including next_generation ngs_data e g rna_seq we developed a new version called the biovlab mmia ngs deployed on both amazon cloud and on a high performance publicly_available server called maha by using ngs_data and integrating various bio informatics tools and databases biovlab mmia ngs offers several advantages first sequencing_data is more accurate than array based_methods for determining mirna_expression levels second potential novel mirnas can be detected by using various computational_methods for characterizing mirnas third because mirna mediated gene_regulation is due to hybridization of an mirna to its target_mrna sequencing_data can be used to identify many to many relationship between mirnas and target_genes with high_accuracy availability_and http epigenomics snu ac kr biovlab mmia ngs mirnas are small nt single_stranded non_coding that regulate_gene by specific_targeting mechanism to mrna_molecules via complementary_sequence pairing due to their critical implication in post_transcriptional and impact on the developmental_process a number of microrna mirnamrna integrated analysis tools have been developed magia uses mirna mrna expression_profile matrices as input and provides gene_set and mirna_target diana mirextra accepts gene_sets and computationally compares mirna associated motifs mirgator provides pre compiled public resources with browser interface to navigate data however several limitations exist for these and other existing_tools including the following i support only microarray or sequencing_data but not both ii require preprocessing or manual data compiling step iii demand cumbersome installation procedures with interdependent tools and databases iv run on limited computational_resources that are not capable of handling large_datasets here we present the next_generation ngs_data compatible biovlabmmia ngs an updated version of our array based mirna mrna integrated analysis system mrnamirna analysis mmia features workflow in biovlab mmia ngs the integrated analysis workflow begins with extracting differentially and or significantly expressed mirnas demir as in our previous published methodology to identify_mirnas and their expression_level we adopted the mirdeep and the quantifier module measures expression levels based on read_counts quality_control and adaptor clipping processes are performed if necessary significance of expressed mirnas is tested and visualized by deseq based on read_count measures differentially_expressed mrnas genes deg s are extracted by using the tophatcufflinks pipeline with junction aligning based on the rpkm measure statistical_significance is visualized by cummerbund for microarray_data degs and demirs are detected by limma package once degs and demirs are extracted the next step mirnamrna combined analysis is performed for the combined analysis we used mirna_target prediction_algorithms databases targetscan pita mirsvr and pmted as well as negative correlations between mirnas and mrnas to extract degs targeted by demirs gene_set is performed using extracted degs gene_sets are automatically submitted to david to provide functional_annotation and clustering biocarta and kegg_pathways mapping and disease association shows biovlab mmia ngs workflow user_interface biovlab mmia ngs keeps the user_friendly web_based interface for sample information analysis options and parameters and computing nodes to provide extended analysis interface we integrated igv for visualizing the alignment results with zoom in out functionality with annotation tracks and cytoscape for illustrating identified mirnamrna target networks by using jaws igv and cytoscape automatically visualize the results manual installation and data_handling processes are not required a web_page summarizing all the results helps the users to view and further investigate the data
