using k bubble searches to find single_nucleotide in k_mer graphs motivation single_nucleotide snp discovery is an important preliminary for understanding genetic_variation with current sequencing methods we can sample genomes comprehensively snps are found by aligning sequence_reads against longer assembled references de_bruijn are efficient data_structures that can deal with the vast amount of data from modern technologies recent work has shown that the topology of these graphs captures enough information to allow the detection and characterization of genetic_variants offering an alternative to alignment_based such methods rely on depth first walks of the graph to identify closing bifurcations these methods are conservative or generate many false_positive particularly when traversing highly interconnected complex regions of the graph or in regions of very high coverage results we devised an algorithm that calls snps in converted de_bruijn by enumerating k cycles we evaluated the accuracy of predicted snps by comparison with snp lists from alignment_based we tested accuracy of the snp_calling using sequence_data from ecotypes of arabidopsis_thaliana and found that accuracy was high we found that snp_calling was even across the genome and genomic feature_types using sequence_based attributes of the graph to train a decision_tree allowed us to increase accuracy of snp calls further together these results indicate that our algorithm is capable of finding snps accurately in complex sub graphs and potentially comprehensively from whole_genome graphs single_nucleotide snps between genomes of individuals are valuable markers for tracing the genetic_basis of inheritable traits or diseases rapid detection and creation of large_libraries of snps is vital for timely investigation and identification of genes associated with important phenotypes contemporary sequencing_technology can sample genomes comprehensively in only hours with these data snp_detection is typically achieved by aligning_reads to a reference_genome and identifying snps as a difference between consensus and the reference factors such as the need for a reference_sequence and the assumption of a monomorphic sample mean that the consensus approach is limited in organisms for which we lack a reference_genome in outbred diploid samples bulked population data or analysis of v c the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work the k algorithm takes a graph theoretical_approach to identifying topological structures namely k cycles in undirected graphs that can represent snps in sequences input to a donor de_bruijn we have shown that k can be used to generate sets of snps in graphs at high_accuracy in the a thaliana genome which is increased by application of the decision_tree classifier k found snps across all portions of the a thaliana genome without bias towards feature_type or region we did not find that all snps seen in alignment_based using a reference could be detected with this algorithm and in all our experiments we found that around of snps seen by alignment could be predicted the k strategy is therefore a useful algorithm that should find general use in reference free snp_calling strategies in the future
