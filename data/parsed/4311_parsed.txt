snphood investigate quantify and visualise the epigenomic neighbourhood of snps using ngs_data motivation the vast_majority of the many thousands of disease associated single nucleotide poly morphisms snps lie in the non coding part of the genome they are likely to affect regulatory_elements such as enhancers and promoters rather than the function of a protein to understand_the underlying genetic_diseases it is therefore increasingly important to study the effect of a snp on nearby molecular traits such as chromatin or transcription_factor binding results we developed snphood a user_friendly bioconductor r package to investigate quantify and visualise the local epigenetic neighbourhood of a set of snps in terms of chromatin_marks or tf_binding using data from ngs experiments availability_and snphood is publicly_available and maintained as an r bioconductor_package atto date thousands of single_nucleotide snps have been identified in genome_wide gwas to be associated with complex_traits and diseases www genome gov gwastudies the vast_majority of these disease or trait associated snps lie in the non coding part of the genome and are likely to affect regulatory_elements i e enhancers and promoters rather than the function of a protein thus to understand_the underlying complex genetic_traits and diseases it is increasingly important to study the effect of snps on nearby molecular traits such as chromatin or transcription_factor tf_binding current workflows for analysing chip_seq typically involve peak_calling which summarises the signal of each binding event into two numbers enrichment and peak size and usually neglects additional factors like binding shape however when a set of regions of interest roi is already at hande g gwas snps quantitative_trait qtls etc a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the molecular neighbourhood of these regions potentially in combination with genetic or allele specific binding asb analyses will be more suited to investigate the underlying epi genomic regulatory_mechanisms than simply comparing peak sizes currently such analyses are often carried_out by hand using basic ngs tools and genome_browser like interfaces to visualise molecular phenotype data independently for each roi a tool for systematic analysis of the local molecular neighbourhood of roi is currently lacking to fill this gap we developed snphood an r bioconductor_package to investigate quantify and visualise the local epigenetic neighbourhood of roi using chromatin or tf_binding data from ngs experiments it provides a set of tools that are largely complimentary to currently existing software for analysing chip_seq many functionalities of snphood have been used in our recent study to investigate the chromatin environment of h k ac qtls which has led to the conclusion that h k ac qtls lie in the nucleosome free regions and show the same effect across multiple histone_marks and tf_binding in addition snphood supports asb analyses which is a powerful way for looking at the effect of genetic_variants even within small_sample we anticipate that it will be widely used for exploratory and quantitative functional_genomics analysis of snps and other roi using ngs_data
