systems_biology influx s increasing numerical stability and precision for metabolic_flux in isotope labelling experiments motivation the problem of stationary metabolic_flux based on isotope labelling experiments first appeared in the early s and was basically solved in early s several algorithms and software_packages are available for this problem however the generic stochastic algorithms simulated_annealing or evolution algorithms currently used in these software require a lot of time to achieve acceptable precision for deterministic algorithms a common drawback is the lack of convergence stability for ill conditioned systems or when started from a random point results in this article we present a new deterministic algorithm with significantly_increased numerical stability and accuracy of flux estimation compared with commonly used algorithms it requires relatively short cpu time from several seconds to several minutes with a standard pc architecture to estimate fluxes in the central_carbon network of escherichia_coli availability the software_package influx s implementing this algorithm is distributed under an opensource licence at http metasys insa toulouse fr software influx metabolic_flux mfa aims at quantifying the actual rates of biochemical_reactions occurring in living_cells in recent decades mfa has been increasingly used to identify novel metabolic_pathways for indepth understanding of metabolism it is extensively used in biotechnology to improve the metabolic properties of industrially relevant organisms more recently mfa has been successfully integrated with other omics tools transcriptomics proteomics metabolomics etc to obtain novel biological_insights through systems_biology the growing interest in mfa underlines the importance of developing reliable tools the present contribution particularly addresses the need for accurate and stable algorithms for solving to whom correspondence should be addressed the least_squares problem that underlies the calculation of fluxes in mfa in a stationary metabolic system the biochemical_reactions which occur in a cell can be described by the following stoichiometric linear equation where s is mn stoichiometric matrix m rows and n columns correspond to the number of metabolites and reactions respectively v is the vector of all net fluxes each component of the vector v expresses a net_flux i e the net quantity of material converted by a particular reaction per time unit the whole equation system expresses the mass conservation law in the metabolic system at metabolic quasi_steady the intracellular_concentrations of metabolites are kept constant for most metabolic systems the stoichiometry matrix s is underdetermined i e the number of equations m is lower than the number of fluxes n some fluxes can be measured_experimentally this is generally true of input and output fluxes but is usually not enough to allow the calculations of all fluxes in the system the remaining degrees_of so_called free fluxes need additional equations to be calculated this can be achieved using different approaches for example flux_balance fba requires maximization of some linear cost_function like biomass_yield in the approaches using isotope labelling experiments ile discussed in this article additional relationships between fluxes come from the measurement of the labelling patterns or isotopomer distributions of selected metabolites currently these measurements can be made by mass_spectrometry mass isotopomers or by nuclear_magnetic nmr positional isotopomers the mfa ile approach was developed in the s when c radioactive isotopes were used to elucidate fragments of carbon metabolism in rat_liver since the s s a stable_isotope c has preferably been used instead of the radioactive c for many years the equations describing the label distribution in a given metabolic_network and their solution were derived by hand in the early s general mathematical descriptions of the labelling problem were introduced this generalization led to a need to solve algebraic systems of high_dimensions often ill conditioned to find the labelling state of a given metabolic_network this paved the way for the intensive use of applied mathematics in the mfa field introduced a variable change based on the cumomer cumulated isotopomer concept this approach allowed a large non linear system to be decomposed into a cascade of smaller linear problems one per cumomer weight and thus greatly_simplified the computational needs for labelling state calculations a general software exploiting the cumomer approach cflux was then published which provides flux estimation based on all types of labelling data mass and positional isotopomers proposed another variable change based on elementary metabolite unit emu concept the emu framework is based on an efficient decomposition of an atom transition network which identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate the experimental_data without any loss of information this led to a significant reduction in the dimension of the labelling problem as a consequence the computation of labelling variables now requires much less time and memory a software based on emus called openflux is now available a comparable gain in the computation of cumomers was announced by these authors showed that often a highly dimensional linear system describing cumomers of a given weight can be decomposed into series of smaller linear subsystems corresponding to so_called strongly connected components sccs to the best of our knowledge there is currently no publicly_available software exploiting this approach for a more complete review of recent_progress in mfa ile including both experimental and mathematical improvements see the emu and scc concepts led to computational gains by improving the mathematical formulation of the labelling data problem involved in residue calculation another potential source of improvement is the optimization_process i e the iterative process by which the simulated labelling data are fitted to the experimental_data the two stepsi e residue calculation and optimizationof the flux calculation process are independent and can be improved separately it is likely that future software will combine the most efficient solutions for each calculation step here we present an original deterministic algorithm called non linear least_squares with inequality constraints nlsic with its improved optimization_process it solves mfa ile problems with good convergence robustness without sacrificing convergence speed nlsic also enhances the numerical accuracy of a final solution moreover it did not suffer from the local_minima problem in the cases we had at hand we discuss this aspect in the section in this article the performance of the nlsic algorithm is illustrated by solving a mfa ile problem but this algorithm can be advantageously applied to a larger framework of non linear leastsquares problems with inequality constraints the nlsic algorithm is particularly suited to solve constrained least_squares problems with ill conditioned or even rank deficient jacobian we start with the formulation of the mathematical problem in mfa ile we then describe the nlsic algorithm and its practical implementation for flux estimation the influx s software is further validated in the numerical section by comparing its performance to that of several other algorithms available in the widely used cflux software_package for this purpose the different algorithms were applied to publicly_available data from we developed an algorithm for solving nlsic which was used to solve the mfa ile problem in this field it outperformed widely used algorithms such as bfgs donlp or evolution algorithms not only in numerical stability but also in the accuracy of the solution the increased numerical accuracy led us to conclude that a problem of local_minima as often mentioned in the literature dedicated to mfa ile could in some cases be a false problem probably it was lack of precision in convergence which was interpreted as trapping in a local minimum the significantly_improved computer efficiency accuracy and reliability of influx s makes the mfa ile approach more accessible for a wide biological community interested in fluxomics we can reasonably expect that the nlsic algorithm will also provide the same benefits in future mfa ile developments dealing with the dynamics of labelling propagation in metabolically stable networks the software influx s implementing nlsic in the mfa ile context is distributed under opensource licence it has the same general character and input format as cflux software as it can take into account all types of labelling data coming both from ms and nmr
