sharaku an algorithm for aligning and clustering read_mapping of deep_sequencing in non coding rna_processing motivation deep_sequencing of the transcripts of regulatory non coding rna generates footprints of post_transcriptional processes after obtaining sequence_reads the short_reads are mapped to a reference_genome and specific mapping patterns can be detected called read_mapping which are distinct from random non functional degradation patterns these patterns reflect the maturation processes that lead to the production of shorter rna_sequences recent next_generation studies have revealed not only the typical maturation process of mirnas but also the various processing mechanisms of small_rnas derived from trnas and snornas results we developed an algorithm termed sharaku to align two read_mapping of next_generation outputs for non_coding in contrast with previous work sharaku incorporates the primary and secondary sequence structures into an alignment of read_mapping to allow for the detection of common processing_patterns using a benchmark simulated dataset sharaku exhibited superior_performance to previous methods for correctly clustering the read_mapping with respect to end_processing and end_processing from degradation patterns and in detecting similar processing_patterns in deriving the shorter rnas further using experimental_data of small_rna for the common_marmoset brain sharaku succeeded in identifying the significant clusters of read_mapping for similar processing_patterns of small derived rna_families expressed in the brain availability_and the source_code of our program sharaku is available at http www dna bio keio ac jp sharaku and the simulated dataset used in this work is available at the same link accession code the sequence_data from the whole rna_transcripts in the hippocampus of the left brain used in this work is available from the dna databank of japan ddbj sequence_read dra under the accession_number dra since high_throughput allows for deep_sequencing with high_sensitivity rna_sequencing with a next generation sequencer rna_seq can detect not only the complete expression_patterns of transcribed rnas but also fragments derived due to the splicing maturation processing or non functional degradation of the rnas rna_seq studies targeting micrornas mirnas have revealed the existence of many different rna_fragments derived from small_rna species other than microrna providing further proof that derived_rna are not simply random degradation_products but are rather stable entities which might have functional activity the evidence accumulating about shorter sequences or fragments derived from non_coding indicates that post_transcriptional processes are relatively common mechanisms to derive functional smaller molecules from various rna_families such as trnas and snornas for example the so_called trna derived_rna trfs are derived from processing at the or end of mature or precursor trnas these sequences constitute a class of short rnas that are the second most abundant type of rna after mirnas since the discovery of small_rnas derived from trnas a variety of names have been used to refer to similar entities such as trna derived_rna trfs stress_induced small_rnas tirnas and trna derived small_rnas tsrnas their uniform start and stop sites of cleavage in trna together with their nonrandom size property strongly suggest that trfs are derived from trna cleavage in a specific and regulated manner in addition several studies have identified a class of small_fragments derived from snornas called sdrnas some of which may regulate splicing or translation the biological_roles of such sno derived rna and trna derived small_rnas have primarily been investigated in cancer_cells trna derived fragments participate in several types of biological_processes including as signal_molecules in a stress_induced response and as regulators of gene_expression sdrnas can function as mirnas regulators of alternative_splicing and tumor_suppressors and oncogenes the reads for such short derived rnas are relatively abundant i e greater than background_levels in small rna_seq chen and heard pointed_out that these reads are precisely mapped to specific regions of primary_or structures and might contain special motifs or base biases reflecting the involvement of special enzymes involved in their generation hence mapping a large amount of sequence_reads onto a reference_sequence can reveal specific forms of mapping patterns for the maturation process or random_patterns for non functional degradations see a these mapping patterns of rna_seq short_reads constitute the socalled read_mapping see b also pointed_out that the non specific degradation_products include rna_fragments that are rapidly digested by the surveillance machinery from rna_molecules which are defective in processing folding and functions thus it is crucial to reliably_distinguish the true shorter rnas from their non functional degradation_products to clearly identify derived and functional small_rnas and fragments therefore the aim of the present study was to develop a computational_tool for the comprehensive analysis and rapid identification of the post_transcriptional processing_patterns of non_coding based on high_throughput rna_seq the algorithm developed in this study was designed to capture specific forms of read_mapping patterns mapped to specific regions of primary_or structures reflecting the functional activities of enzymes and to distinguish them from non functional degradation_products there are only a few existing_tools to analyze such read_mapping of rna_seq and detect footprints of the post_transcriptional processes or degradations of rnas flaimapper predicts and annotates non coding rna derived fragments by determining the start and stop positions from read_mapping flaimapper can predict mirna boundaries with high_accuracy deepblockalign which our present study takes quite a similar approach to is an alignment based method for alignments of read_mapping to find non coding derived rnas that share similar post_transcriptional processing alps is also alignment based but is not designed for the purpose of identification of short derived_rna blockclust computes a similarity_score between read_mapping to detect similar processing_patterns and cluster read_mapping blockclust includes a high_dimensional feature representation to encode read_mapping and calculates the similarity_scores based on a graph_kernel therefore blockclust does not rely on alignment based techniques and is not designed for the purpose of calculating the alignment of read profiles however all of these methods are computed based only on the information of read_mapping and do not take the rna_sequence and secondary_structure information into account further those methods did not address the reliable distinguishability of processing_patterns from the random degradation constructing an alignment for a pair of biological_sequences such as dna rna and protein_sequences is a fundamental and robust method of sequence_analysis the pairwise_alignment of biological_sequences is achieved according to insertions deletions and match operations so that the two sequences are aligned with the same column length the similarity_score of an alignment is calculated according to the predefined scores for insertions deletions and matches similarly one can define the alignment between a pair of read_mapping see c an alignment of two read_mapping for snord and snord output by sharaku using the small rna_seq for the common_marmoset brain with the annotations of rna sequence_alignment and the predicted_secondary the solid line represents the read coverages of snord and the dashed_line represents the read coverages of snord d schematic illustration of the necessity of incorporating the primary and secondary_structures of rna_sequences into an alignmentin previous work with the deepblockalign algorithm the alignment program was designed to compare and align any read_mapping regardless of the rna family to which they belong the alignment program was also applied to the comparison of read_mapping of the same rna gene across different samples that might be expected to induce different read_mapping this method is effective for the differential_processing analysis of read_mapping of each non coding rna gene in contrast with previous work our primary goal was to detect specific forms among similar read_mapping patterns mapped to specific regions of primary_or structures reflecting the functional activities of enzymes by alignments of read_mapping and to distinguish these from non functional degradation_products we developed a new read_mapping profile alignment program named sharaku which incorporates the primary and secondary_structures of rna_sequences into an alignment of read_mapping this is accomplished in combination with dafs a program for the simultaneous aligning and folding of rna_sequences as a result the most advanced feature of sharaku is that it simultaneously aligns the read_mapping and rna_sequences with the folding rna_secondary since each type of derived_rna is cleaved from its precursor with a specific context of primary sequence and secondary_structure we can expect that the simultaneous alignment of read_mapping with the primary and secondary_structures contributes to precise identifications of the type of derived rnas thus application of sharaku to the mixture of different rna_families would enable the accurate clustering of read_mapping with respect to end_processing or end_processing of each rna family and facilitate the detection of common processing_patterns shared among different rna_families see d note that sharaku was not designed for classification of rna_sequences into different rna_families further sharaku produces an alignment of read_mapping at the nucleotidelevel resolution as c displays in contrast deepblockalign uses blockbuster to generate block groups and aligns any read_mapping at the level of individual blocks and block groups including those in unannotated regions or unknown rna genes on the other hand the current version of sharaku can only be applied to the annotated non coding rna regions several previous_studies have explored the similarities and evolutionary_relationships between snornas and mirna_precursors these similarity features represent molecules involved in the same processing_pathways with a similar set of processing enzymes and the same rnai targets these similarity features are often confirmed based on the conservation of their primary and secondary_structures such as structural_characteristics of typical h aca or c d boxes we hypothesized that in addition to sequence structure conservation determining the similarity among read_mapping might help to identify the functional or processing similarities between snornas and mirna_precursors several previous_studies have explored the similarities and evolutionary_relationships between snornas and mirna_precursors as a result various relationships between snornas and mirnas have been identified from snornas with mirna features to dual_function snomirnas and mirnas with snorna features these similarity features represent molecules involved in the same processing_pathways with a similar set of processing enzymes and the same rnai targets these similarity features are often confirmed based on the conservation of their primary and secondary_structures such as structural_characteristics of typical h aca or c d boxes we hypothesized that in addition to sequence structure conservation determining the similarity among read_mapping might helpwere added to the hybridization chamber and incubated with the blots the membrane was then exposed to a phosphoimager and scanned the largest band appearing at a distance just short of the nt marker indicates the expression of the origin trna from which the short fragment rna was derived sharaku i to identify the functional or processing similarities between snornas and mirna_precursors an interesting small cluster in the clustering tree shown in highlighted with an arrow and asterisk consisted of a mixture of snornas mirnas and trnas in particular we found that the snorna hbii and the mirna let a have quite similar features in their secondary_structures and read_mapping indicating a similar processing mechanism to produce the derived shorter fragments at ends shows these features indeed small derived rnas from hbii were previously_reported to resemble mirnas another interesting cluster is cluster of the end_processing of mirnas the cluster contained two trnas pro tgg trna has the typical mirna like secondary_structure and mirna mirna duplex shown in supporting this result previous work has indicated possible cross_talk between trna derived_rna and the canonical pathway of mirnas thus the alignments and clustering of read_mapping using sharaku can give insight into revealing the common processing_patterns in different families of non_coding and their derived fragments which could help to clarify the processing_pathways and biological_functions of derived_rna one of the merits of sharaku is to calculate the optimal alignment based on not only the pattern of read_mapping but also primary and secondary_structures of rna_sequences since each type of derived_rna is cleaved from its precursor with a specific context of primary sequence and secondary_structure we can expect that the simultaneous alignment of read_mapping with the primary and secondary_structures contributes to precise identifications of the type of derived rnas to combine the pattern of read_mapping and the primary and secondary_structures of rnas a sankoff type algorithm is required to be implemented we implemented sharaku with dafs framework which enabled to efficiently combine the pattern of read_mapping and the primary and secondary_structures of rnas by the dual decomposition technique in the present study we have only dealt with annotated noncoding_rnas however sharaku can also be applied to the alignment and clustering of novel and unannotated regions by employing tools such as blockbuster in order to determine the expressed block regions on the reference_genome that are obtained from rna_seq as non functional degradation_products we only considered the degradation of rna from the end in the simulated dataset therefore performance_evaluations of sharaku to determine the tolerance for the other two classes of rna degradations endonucleases and exonucleases are required these issues will be addressed in our future work and annotations with lines indicating the predicted locations of deriving fragments for a snorna hbii and a mirna let a found in the clusters the line for mirna secondary_structure indicate the predicted locations of the mature mirna the secondary_structures predicted by rnafold and annotations with lines indicating the locations of derived fragments for a trna pro tgg trna and an mirna let b found in the cluster of the end_processing of mirnas the line for mirna secondary_structure indicates the predicted locations of the mature mirna i m tsuchiya et_al with the aim of offering computational_tools for comprehensively analyzing the post_transcriptional processing_patterns of non_coding and detecting their common processing_patterns based on rna_seq we developed a new algorithm called sharaku to align two read_mapping of next_generation data for non_coding sharaku incorporates the primary and secondary_structures of rna_sequences into an alignment of read_mapping by combining with dafs which constructs reliable structural_alignments that maximize the expected_accuracy of a predicted common secondary_structure and its sequence_alignment sharaku could simultaneously align the read_mapping and rna_sequences with information of the folded rna_secondary in an experiment using a simulated dataset sharaku achieved an almost perfect clustering result and exhibited higher accuracy than deepblockalign in an experiment with real_data of small_rna for the common_marmoset brain sharaku succeeded in identifying the five major clusters plus four scattered clusters representing typical processing_patterns this method also revealed some interesting clusters consisting of mixtures of several rna_families that predicted common processing_patterns among different rna_families these results demonstrate that sharaku can be an indispensable tool for analyses of the processing_patterns and functions of regulatory non_coding with deep sequencing_data
