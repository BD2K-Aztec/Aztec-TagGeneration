pirs profile_based illumina pair_end simulator motivation the next generation high_throughput especially from illumina have been widely used in re sequencing and de_novo studies however there is no existing software that can simulate illumina_reads with real error and quality distributions and coverage bias yet which is very useful in relevant software_development and study designing of sequencing_projects results we provide a software_package pirs profile_based illumina pair_end simulator which simulates illumina_reads with empirical base_calling and gc depth profiles trained from real re sequencing_data the error and quality distributions as well as coverage bias patterns of simulated reads using pirs fit the properties of real sequencing_data better than existing simulators in addition pirs also comes with a tool to simulate the heterozygous diploid genomes in recent_years the next generation high_throughput ngs have been widely used for re sequencing and de_novo such as the human genomes_project http www genomes org and the vertebrate genomes_project http genome k soe ucsc edu according to information from genomeweb http www genomeweb com illumina has become dominant in the ngs market by the end of it has been reported that the illumina technology rarely contains insertion and deletion errors but it may produce systematic and sequence specific substitution_errors and coverage bias problems during library_construction and sequencing_process it is thus important to be aware of these characteristics for method development although evaluating software performance on real sequencing_data to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first four authors should be regarded as joint firstis preferred not all evaluations can be conducted on real_data due to the lack of a ground_truth it is frequently more convenient to test the software with simulated_data from a known genome which helps us monitoring every step there are already some simulators that can produce illumina_reads such as maq wgsim from samtools metasim and art of all the existing softwares wgsim only simulates reads with uniform substitution_errors and dummy quality values metasim is designed for simulating metagenomic_data and it supports empirical error profile to generate reads without quality values art simulates illumina_reads with empirical quality profile which determines quality value first and then uses the qualityderived error_rate to randomly generate substitution error maq adopts a first order_markov to model quality distribution of each cycle which generates quality values based on the transition_probabilities and then uses the quality derived error_rate to randomly generate substitution error in this article we present a new illumina pair end pe reads simulator pirs profile_based illumina pair_end simulator which adopts an empirical base_calling profile that is more like the real illumina data moreover it can use a gc_content coverage depth gc depth profile to simulate reads with coverage bias along the genome we also provide a tool to introduce changes substitution insertion deletion and other variations to the genome to facilitate simulation of heterozygous data illumina has introduced eamss filtering in its casava package which masks low quality g rich regions at the end of each read with fixed quality value b it is mainly designed for easier data trimming in general re sequencing analyses but this will slightly influence our profile generation we suggest all quality aware analysis to run casava with no eamss to disable the eamss filtering the current base_calling and indel profiles in pirs focus on the perread cycle properties but do not take the sequence structure specific errors into consideration in illumina_sequencing coverage bias is a complex problem and gc_content is a well studied one of all the influencing_factors we will introduce more types of coverage biases once they are well studied we designed and implemented an effective illumina_reads simulator pirs using empirical profiles to reproduce reads that are more like real illumina data compared with existing simulators which is likely to be very helpful for development of ngs software such as de_novo snp_calling and structural_variation detection the independent profile generating module in pirs grants great freedom to users who can generate new profiles with their own sequencing_data when machine or reagent updates moreover the additional tool for simulating heterozygous genome is especially useful for applications that need heterozygous data
