oxybs estimation of methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine from tandem treated oxidative bisulfite and bisulfite dna the use of sodium_bisulfite bs treatment followed by hybridization to an illumina_infinium beadchip humanmethylation and methylationepic is a common method for interrogating methylcytosine mc at single_nucleotide however standard treatment of dna with bs does not allow disambiguation of mc from an additional cytosine modification hydroxymethylcytosine hmc recently it has been demonstrated that paired bs and oxidative bisulfite oxbs treatment on the same sample followed by hybridization to an infinium microarray permits the differentiation of hmc from mc nevertheless estimation of hmc and mc from tandem treated arrays has been shown to produce irregular estimates of cytosine modifications results we present a novel method using maximum_likelihood to accurately estimate the parameters of unmethylated cytosine c mc and hmc from infinium microarray_data given the signal_intensities from the oxbs and bs replicates availability_and oxybs is an r package available on cran methylcytosine mc is an essential epigenetic mark that controls gene_expression or gene_expression potential mc is the most widely_studied epigenetic mark and assays are available for mapping mc genome_wide at a single_base although whole_genome offers a complete characterization of the epigenome dna_methylation microarray after bisulfite bs treatment has been the most commonly used genome wide_application additional modifications to cytosine that modulate normal gene function have been implicated in disease development indeed the ten_eleven family of proteins has been shown to function as enzymes capable of altering the methylation status of dna by oxidizing mc to hydroxymethylcytosine hmc emerging evidence has suggested that hmc may act both as a transient intermediate in the process of mc demethylation and a functional epigenetic mark that regulates transcription treatment of dna with bs alone is unable to disambiguate hmc from mc a growing appreciation for the role of hmc in biological_processes and disease prompted the addition of an oxidation step prior to bs treatment oxbs that selectively oxidizes hmc to resolve true mc levels paired bs and oxbs treatment on the same samples followed by hybridization to the illumina k array now permits the differentiation of hmc from mc however navenave estimation of hmc via the difference in values between oxbs and bs signals v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com results in some estimates with negative_values and summed cytosine modification triplet estimates unmodified cytosine c mc and hmc that exceed a value of in the context of cytosine modifications negative_values of hmc and triplet sums exceeding do not represent valid biological observations and these inconsistencies may represent artifacts of random assay noise to compare the performance of our proposed oxybs method versus a navenave calculation we analyzed sample data from the oxybs r package paired bs oxbs data from gse and data simulated for true cytosine modification triplets c mc and hmc based on a dirichlet distribution fit to the data in gse first we used the sample data provided in the oxybs cran package cpgs samples and estimated hmc values using a navenave approach hmc betabs betaoxbs and our proposed oxybs algorithm results clearly demonstrate that the navenave method_produces negative_values whereas our proposed method does not next we expanded our analysis to include data from gse a study of glioblastomas and examined the percentage of probes that had negative_values of hmc via navenave calculation shows that the percentage of negative hmc values in the navenave calculation approaches across all across infinium probe type and cpg_island strata top panel and the bottom panel shows the distribution of negative hmc values resulting from the navenave approach we assessed the difference between the true cytosine triplets and observed values obtained from the navenave and proposed oxybs approaches using median absolute deviation mad in addition to the aforementioned navenave approach nave nave hmc betabs betaoxbs we also considered navenave approaches that set hmc to zero when betabs betaoxbs nave nave betaoxbs used as a proxy for mc and nave nave betabs as a proxy for mc all estimations of simulated_data described in supplemental information were stratified by infinium probe type and cpg_island status values for each strata mad was then calculated as the median of the sum of the absolute deviations across c mc and hmc using the simulated values for each strata our proposed oxybs method had the best performance mad is minimized across all strata supplemental notably the results are comparable when betabs betaoxbs and the betaoxbs data is ignored as in nave nave and nave nave supplemental qualitatively identical results were obtained for root meansquared error rmse data not shown estimations of negative_values from paired bs and oxbs arrays likely reflect values of zero for hmc and are technical_artifacts here we demonstrate that operationalizing the negative hmc values from a navenave calculation in a usable manner results in more error than using the oxybs method which enforces appropriate constraints on the data the oxybs tool can readily be applied to both the illumina k and methylationepic arrays as well as sequencing_data withread counts for the four input_data types bs methylated bs unmethylated oxbs methylated and oxbs unmethylated
