sequence_analysis an integrated toolkit for accurate prediction and analysis of cis_regulatory at a genome_scale motivation we present an integrated toolkit bobro for prediction and analysis of cis_regulatory this toolkit can i reliably identify statistically_significant cis_regulatory at a genome_scale ii accurately scan for all motif instances of a query motif in specified gen_omic regions using a novel method for p value estimation iii provide highly_reliable comparisons and clustering of identified motifs which takes into consideration the weak signals from the flanking_regions of the motifs and iv analyze co occurring motifs in the regulatory_regions results we have carried_out systematic comparisons between motif predictions using bobro and the meme package the comparison results on escherichia_coli k genome and the human_genome show that bobro can identify the statistically_significant motifs at a genome_scale more efficiently identify motif instances more accurately and get more reliable motif clusters than meme in addition bobro provides correlational_analyses among the identified motifs to facilitate the inference of joint regulation relationships of transcription_factors availability the source_code of the program is freely_available for noncommercial uses atcomputational identification of conserved cis_regulatory represents an important problem in computational genomics and it can provide a key piece of information for inference of gene_regulation networks in the past three decades numerous tools have been developed to find cis_regulatory in the promoter_regions of given genes and have been successfully_applied to several organisms to generate large_scale regulatory_networks in addition two related problems are also of great interest i motif scanning for additional motif instances across a genome based on known or predicted motifs which needs a reliable measurement for the statistical_significance of the scanned motif instances and high false_positive prediction rates are the main issue with the existing prediction_tools and ii reliability_assessment of the predicted motifs against annotated motifs in motif databases which requires an effective way to compare the predicted motifs with the documented cis_regulatory in the published_literature and databases a number of software_packages have been developed to deal with such issues for example the meme package was originally developed to identify conserved_motifs and now consists of a number of analysis capabilities such as fimo and mast for motif scanning and tomtom for motif comparison these additional capabilities have substantially extended the utility of the meme program although substantial efforts have been invested to study these motif related problems since the mid s they are still largely unsolved especially for genome_scale applications a number of challenging issues persist and await for better solutions including i more effective_ways for reliably assessing_the of the predicted motifs hence possibly overcoming the high false_positive issue ii improved capabilities for evaluating predicted motif instances to decrease the false_positive in motif scanning da and iii improved similarity_measures between two motifs which currently suffer from the inability to effectively deal with sequence_variations in motifs hence leading to low prediction sensitivities we have recently_developed an improved version of our previous tool bobro bobro to address some of these issues seefor the flowchart of bobro compared with bobro the new toolkit has a number of novel capabilities i motif refinement and evaluation based on information extracted from the entire_genome and a phylogenetic_footprinting method ii motif scanning based on a global p value estimation method iii motif comparison and clustering using a novel and effective to whom correspondence should be addressed here we compare bobro with the latest_version of the meme suite a most popular motif_finding and analysis package in terms of their performance on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic_genomes we found that i the predicted motifs by bobro have better motif matching scores and regulon coverage scores rcss than those by meme ii the average f score of bbs on e coli motifs is significantly_higher than that of fimo similar performance results are found in human cis_regulatory versus iii bbc can identify more accurate motif clusters than tomtom in a constructed motif database and iv bba can identify jointly regulating tfs which are supported by the published_literature the computational_complexity the actual computing time and selected parameters of each used program can be found in supplementary table s
