sequence_analysis integrative data analysis indicates an intrinsic disordered domain character of argonaute binding_motifs motivation argonaute interacting wg gw proteins are characterized by the presence of repeated sequence_motifs containing glycine g and tryptophan w the motifs seem to be remarkably adaptive to amino_acid and their sequences show non contiguity our previous approach to the detection of gw domains based on scoring their gross amino_acid allowed annotation of several novel proteins involved in gene_silencing the accumulation of new experimental_data and more advanced applications revealed some deficiency of the algorithm in prediction selectivity additionally w motifs though critical in gene_regulation have not yet been annotated in any available online_resources results we present an improved set of computational_tools allowing efficient management and annotation of w based motifs involved in gene_silencing the new prediction_algorithms provide novel function alities by annotation of the w containing domains at the local sequence_motif level rather than by overall compositional properties this approach represents a significant_improvement over the previous method in terms of prediction sensitivity and selectivity application of the algorithm allowed annotation of a comprehensive list of putative argonaute interacting_proteins across eukaryotes an in depth characterization of the domains properties indicates its intrinsic disordered character in addition we created a knowledge based portal whub that provides access to tools and information on rnai related trypto phan containing motifs availability_and the web_portal and tools are freely_available www comgen pl whub despite the fact that different classes of small_rnas are generated by largely different biogenesis pathways in order to function they associate with argonaute_proteins agos and form the rna_induced risc the guide strand of the srna duplex directs the agos to specific targets on the dna transcriptional gene_silencing or rna post transcription gene_silencing through base complementarity on the target_molecule the ago proteins interact with gw proteins which are characterized by the presence of repeated sequence_motifs containing two amino_acids glycine g and tryptophan w these motifs mediate direct interaction with various ago protein family_members throughout the eukaryotic kingdom most recently it has been shown that some viruses contain polypeptides that mimic host encoded_proteins with wg gw motifs and act as bait for the argonaute to hack into the hosts essential effector of rna_silencing over the years our view of gw proteins has evolved from them being a static platform for clustering of ago proteins to functional_domains composed of short tryptophan containing modules that coordinate vital steps in gene_silencing the extremely divergent sequence variable lengths ranging from to up to aa and number of composing dipeptide wg gw repeats from to up to make the wg gw domain difficult to identify using in silico methods therefore our previous approach was based on scoring gross compositional amino_acid of the sequence rather than plain linear similarity however the more advanced and detailed applications revealed some deficiency of the algorithm in prediction selectivity additionally the initial method did not include identification of the recently described new types of w based motifs referred to here as wmotifs which are involved in interactions with the ccr not complex and mrna translational_repression and deadenylation processes deficiency of a comprehensive resource for functional gw gw proteins in any of the central protein e g uniprot refseq and or specialized domain databases e g pfam interpro as well as quickly accumulating knowledge about the properties of the w based ago ccr not interacting_proteins inspired us to develop new computational_tools to facilitate efficient management and annotation of w motifs the novel prediction approach addresses all the faults of the previous method and provides novel functionalities by annotation of the tryptophan containing domains involved in gene_silencing at the local sequence_motif level rather than by searching for large regions of multiple wg gw motifs we developed whuba knowledge based portal that provides to whom correspondence should be addressed access to all available information on rnai related w containing motifsin order to address the need for a centralized source of information about this structurally and functionally unusual group of proteins the most important aspect of todays digital biology is access to data the increasing amount of information requires new tools and approaches that will allow for fast and accurate information_retrieval and data_mining very often the data are spread across many databases and publications this is evident especially in the case of new and developing subjects of scientific_research that have not yet been completely defined and have not been enclosed by mature tools and resources research on wg gw proteins represents one example of such research enterprisesthe proteins are investigated on local bases in which scientists concentrate on single proteins from particular organisms however the available accumulated knowledge would allow for a more global and synthetic view of this very interesting group of proteins the whub portal is a user oriented and comprehensive approach for collecting all available knowledge on the biology of ago ccr not interacting w motifs we have created an efficient and attractive interface that facilities exploration of up to date information the discovery of new relationships between data records and drawing biologically_relevant conclusions concerning highly_specific w containing motifs the implementation of new computational_tools involving a position based_approach instead of the composition based prediction method resulted in the annotation of new groups of proteins that may interact with argonautes these include among others rrm containing hnrnp proteins and dead_box helicases many promising predictions are already the subject of experimental_verification our methods use the modern information_technologies of machine_learning and move the agoprotein identification process to a new level i e where the user receives a clear functional_classification of a tested sequence instead of a set of score numbers that is difficult_to the annotation results show that the presented computational_approach can distinguish ago binding_sites from other functional w containing motifs e g ccr not despite the high amino_acid similarity between these two types of sequences supplementary this supports the finding byabout the distinct functions of these two w based domains unfortunately the limited number of available ccr not binding_motifs did not allow to build prediction_models for this group of sequences nevertheless we have already implemented all of the functionality into the whub portal but the quality of the predictions may vary as soon as new data are available they will be incorporated into the prediction procedure an in depth analysis of the properties of experimentally_verified and novel predicted proteins allowed for classification of the w based domains into the idd class a fast evolution rate biased amino_acid single amino_acid repetitions and excessive length polymorphism conform well to the characteristics of idds this expands knowledge on this new and intensively investigated group of functional_domains on the other hand it may help in further research on ago ccr not interaction_domains including computational and experimental_approaches
