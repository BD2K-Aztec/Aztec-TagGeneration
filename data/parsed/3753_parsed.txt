structural_bioinformatics protein_stability a single recorded mutation aids in predicting the effects of other mutations in the same amino_acid site motivation accurate prediction of protein_stability is important for understanding the molecular_underpinnings of diseases and for the design of new proteins we introduce a novel approach for the prediction of changes in protein_stability that arise from a single site amino_acid the approach uses available data on mutations occurring in the same position and in other positions our algorithm named pro maya protein mutant stability analyzer combines a collaborative filtering baseline model random_forests regression and a diverse set of features pro maya predicts the stability free_energy difference of mutant versus wild_type denoted as g results we evaluated our algorithm extensively using cross_validation on two previously utilized datasets of single amino_acid and a third validation_set the results indicate that using known g values of mutations at the query position improves the accuracy of g predictions for other mutations in that position the accuracy of our predictions in such cases significantly surpasses that of similar methods achieving e g a pearsons_correlation of and a root_mean of on the validation_set because pro maya uses a diverse set of features including predictions using two other methods it also performs slightly better than other methods in the absence of additional experimental_data on the query positions availability pro maya is freely_available via web_server atunderstanding the mechanisms by which mutations affect protein_stability is important for characterizing disease mechanisms and for protein design hence the energetics of mutants has been studied extensively through experimental and theoretical approaches to whom correspondence should be addressed the methods for predicting the change in a proteins stability g that results from a single amino_acid mutation can be roughly classified according to the types of effective potentials they rely on physical effective potentials pep statistical effective potentials sep and empirical effective potentials eep notably none of these potentials explicitly take into consideration relevant known mutations at the query position pep based_methods use atomic_level representations to capture the underlying physical phenomena affecting protein_stability e g van_der and dihedral torsion_angle these techniques are computationally_demanding and not applicable to large_datasets sep based_methods are based on the inverse boltzmann law which states that probability densities and energies are closely_related quantities hence these methods use datasets of proteins of known structures to calculate conditional_probabilities that certain residues or atoms will appear in different contexts most sep based_methods use pairwise potentials though some studies have employed higher_order potentials for exampleused a fourbody potential sep based_methods are computationally_efficient more robust than pep based_methods to low_resolution protein_structure and are suitable to include known and unknown physical effects methods in the third category eep based use experimental energy data to calibrate the weights of the energy function terms the types of energy_terms used can vary and might be sep pep physicochemically or evolution based_methods for example popmusic utilizes a neural_network algorithm with sep features that couple between the identity of the amino_acid secondary_structure accessibility and the spatial distance between amino_acids conversely foldxs energy function consists of pep energy_terms calibrated using a grid_search method on experimental_data the recently_developed prethermut tool incorporates the energy_terms of foldx and modeller into a random_forests machine regression and has reached impressive_results the use of a machine_learning algorithm enables non energy like terms to be incorporated into the scoring_function for example both i mutant and mupro encode the identities of the wildtype wt and mutant amino_acids in addition to the quantitywe tested pro maya extensively using cross_validation on two datasets and an additional validation dataset and found that it outperformed current methods for the prediction of mutation stability our results demonstrate that the availability of as few as one or two records in the query position improve_the of g values of additional_mutations in that position this improvement is independent of the amino_acid of these records and of the sequence_identity of the query_protein to the training_set thus a systematic alanine_scanning mutagenesis of all the amino_acids in a protein could greatly_increase pro mayas prediction_accuracy for any mutation in the protein the performance of our random_forests prediction scheme on the srpm subset is slightly better than that of the other methods we investigated we attribute the improvement to the use of an inhomogeneous feature_set comprising pep sep and evolutionbased features including predictions by the prethermut and popmusic tools previous prediction_methods in contrast have been based on features of a single type e g only pep pro mayas rmses for mutations in the popmusic db set are consistently lower than those for the potapov db set this is presumably because of the different procedures used for compilation of each dataset popmusic dbs compilation procedure used a weighted_average of the identical mutations occurring in different conditions to calculate the g values that are most likely to occur at physiological_conditions whereas the potapov db compilation procedure gives equal weight to the various conditions at which g values are measured our prediction scheme does not take into account the conditions at which the g was measured thus it assumes that all measurements were taken under the same conditions therefore the popmusic db mutation set which is characterized by more homogenous experimental_conditions is presumably more suitable for our prediction scheme as indicated by the low rmse value to achieve more accurate_predictions we trained the pro maya web_server using the popmusic db set thus the server is best suited for predicting mutations at physiological_conditions pro mayas improved accuracy is facilitated by the use of a baseline estimator that utilizes known g records to determine a position specific baseline g b i model the underlying assumption of pro maya is that the g of a mutation is strongly_dependent properties that are inherent to the amino_acid position in the protein e g solvent_accessibility amino_acid interaction with the environment and secondary_structure thus on average all mutations at the same position are expected to have similar g values therefore the position baseline g which presumably reflects the inherent_properties of the position can roughly model the query mutation to fully model a mutation pro maya also uses a content based model and a mu specific g baseline based model these models describe the mutation outcome attributes e g physicochemical_properties and predict the g shift from the position baseline nevertheless it is expected that mutations with an irregular g that differs much from the position g baseline would be harder to predict by design pro maya is not very suitable as a classifier of whether a mutation would stabilize or destabilize the protein a classifier should be trained to this end cf algorithms have been developed mainly for online electronic commerce applications and are particularly useful for exploiting large_datasets very rapidly to the best of our knowledge their use in biology is quite scarce the success of the cfcb algorithm in this study and the capability of the neighborhood and latent_factor based models to identify biological_properties discussed in the supplementary_material suggest that the cf approach could be applied to additional problems in biology examples_include the identification of deleterious_mutations in single_nucleotide data the detection of true protein_protein in noisy yeast_two and massspectrometry data as well as the prediction of ligand and drug molecules that could bind target_proteins our cfcb algorithm and its integration with the neighborhood and latent_factor based models can be readily adapted to these problems
