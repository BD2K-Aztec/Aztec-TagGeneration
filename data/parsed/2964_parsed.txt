miec svm automated pipeline for protein peptide ligand_interaction prediction motivation miec svm is a structure based method for predicting protein recognition specificity here we present an automated miec svm pipeline providing an integrated and user_friendly workflow for construction and application of the miec svm models this pipeline can handle standard amino_acids and those with post_translational ptms or small_molecules moreover multi threading and support to sun_grid sge are implemented to significantly boost the computational_efficiency availability_and the program is available ataccurate prediction of the binding_specificity of proteins particularly those whose interacting_partners are conformationally flexible remains_a many computational_methods have been developed to meet this challenge and one of them is the miec svm method this method has been successfully_applied to predict the binding_specificity of diverse systems including sh_domains pdz_domains chromodomains and hiv_protease here we present an automated miec svm pipeline that allows users to predict interacting_partners using the existing miec svm models as well as to construct new models for the protein_families of their own interest the miec svm method is a powerful_tool to predict the binding_specificity of proteins the pipeline presented here automates the model training and prediction which will greatly_facilitate the broader application of this method
