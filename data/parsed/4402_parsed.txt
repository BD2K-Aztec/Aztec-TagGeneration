stams string assisted module search for genome_wide and appli cation to autism motivation analyzing genome_wide association data in the context of biological_pathways helps us understand how genetic_variation influences phenotype and increases power to find associations however the utility of pathway based analysis tools is hampered by undercuration and reliance on a distribution of signal across all of the genes in a pathway methods that combine genome_wide association results with genetic_networks to infer the key phenotype modulating subnetworks combat these issues but have primarily been limited to network definitions with yes no labels for gene_gene a recent method ew_dmgwas incorporates a biological_network with weighted edge probability by requiring a secondary phenotype specific expression dataset in this paper we combine an algorithm for weighted edge module searching and a probabilistic interaction_network in order to develop a method stams for recovering modules of genes with strong associations to the phenotype and probable biologic coherence our method builds on ew_dmgwas but does not require a secondary expression dataset and performs better in six test cases results we show that our algorithm improves over ew_dmgwas and standard gene based analysis by measuring precision and recall of each method on separately identified associations in the wellcome_trust rheumatoid_arthritis study stams identified modules were more enriched for separately identified associations than ew_dmgwas stams p value x ew_dmgwas p value we demonstrate that the area under the precision_recall curve is times_higher with stams than ew_dmgwas run on the wellcome_trust type_diabetes data availability stams is implemented as an r package and is freely_available at https simtk org projects stams genome_wide gwas are chronically underpowered because they interrogate millions of positions in the genome in order to overcome the multiple testing burden such analyses require either very large cohorts or a reduced number of tests performed one way to reduce the number of tests is to aggregate the genetic_information from the single_nucleotide snp level to the gene level reducing the number of tests from to however in cases when it is too expensive or impossible to collect a large sample e g a very rare phenotype aggregation to the gene level may not be enough our group and others compared in have shown that aggregating gwas to the pathway level is useful for analyzing underpowered gwas and finding associations between groups of genes and a phenotype these pathway methods provide insights into biological_function the pathway approach has two major shortcomings first our present curation of genes into pathways covers only a small fraction of the genes that we measure second most of the curated pathways are not designed to analyze gwas for instance a metabolism pathway may contain mostly genes with no snps due to stabilizing selection but also one or two genes with significant variation all of the genes are important to the metabolism and so are considered part of the pathway but only a couple have gwas signal in cases like this traditional pathway analysis cannot identify the entire pathway as significantly associated because the noise dilutes the few genes with signal dense module searching originally proposed for expression studies in has become a popular analysis method for analyzing genome_wide measurements by overlaying gene based pvalues on a graph of known biological_interactions and identifying clusters of connected genes that have an enrichment of signal dense module searching isolates clusters of concentrated signal within biologically related genes these clusters range in size from two genes to complete pathway level associations without requiring predefined pathway lists like traditional pathway analysis techniques dense module searching leverages known biological_relationships to aggregate measured information unlike traditional pathway analysis techniques such as gsea or go enrichment dense module searching identifies clusters of biologically related genes that have the most enrichment for signal without requiring distribution of signal across all of the genes in a predefined list several researchers have published improvements to idekers original algorithm proposed a different search technique and made improvements to module scoring including control for multiple testing presented dms a method that uses a greedy search within a local neighborhood and incorporates three different kinds of significance testing to output modules they demonstrate that significant modules in breast_cancer gene_expression data are better predictors of metastasis than individual_markers based on dms built dmgwas the first gwas specific r based tool that allows users to easily incorporate dense module searching into their gwas analysis workflow dmgwas uses a greedy search heuristic that iteratively adds nearby genes to a module if the p value of the considered gene improves the aggregate score by an appreciable amount r and is described further in sections and however all of these methods are limited to searching on a network with yes no edge labels and therefore prone to error due to false_negative or false_positive edges recently_published edge weighted dmgwas ew_dmgwas q allows users to input a co expression matrix in order to weight edges in the input network before module searching this is the first time that edge_weights have been incorporated into dense module searching and allows the user to include information about a the strength of evidence that two genes interact and or b the strength of the interaction itself wang et al demonstrate that the addition of edge_weight information is valuable by comparing ew_dmgwas performance on the gain schizophrenia gwas to both standard dmgwas and giga although phenotypespecific co expression measurements may not be practical in every study and many types of biological_relationships are missed in coexpression analysis of eukaryotes the expansion of the algorithm to incorporate edge_weights improved_performance of their algorithm and creates an opportunity for exploring different kinds of gene_gene weighting_schemes the string database aggregates genegene and protein_protein into a network with edges scored for their confidence string combines information from co expression analysis databases such as mips high_throughput experiments such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation phylogenetic cooccurrence conservation of the genetic neighborhood in prokaryotes and literature co occurrence associations are assigned a confidence_score based on benchmarking groups of associations against kegg_pathways and generally correspond to the probability of finding the linked proteins within the same kegg path although many other networks are available string is notable because it consolidates many important interaction networks has edge confidence_scores based on a probabilistic_framework is very popular with more than citations and is easily usable with r in this paper we present a method stams which incorporates general edge_weights such as those provided by string the search tool from ew_dmgwas and a new significance ranking_method stams allows users to use the edge weighted searching of ew_dmgwas without needing co expression data the resulting modules have high_confidence biological relatedness and strong associations with phenotype by leveraging the biological_relationships in string stams identifies modules that are more highly replicated in independent studies than standard analysis with a gene based p value or ew_dmgwas with a phenotype specific co expression dataset in this paper we show that using the multimodal edge_weights from the string database improves the performance of ew_dmgwas while eliminating the need for a secondary phenotype specific expression dataset we demonstrate this improved_performance in several ways we compare stams performance to ew_dmgwas on two gold_standards genes that were identified in independent studies knowngenes and genes that were individually significant in the full dataset we show that stams demonstrates high_precision and recall on knowngenes and recovers more of the disease genes even with only of the patients as input_data the results from all gwas analysis techniques are dataset dependent we presented results on seven datasets in order to demonstrate the range of stams performance across varying levels of signal in all datasets excluding low signal hypertension stams performs better than ew_dmgwas in two out of five wtccc gwas stams has notably better performance than a gene based test with a bonferroni_correction for t d the recall of stams is better than the recall of vegas with a bonferroni_correction but lower than recall of vegas with an fdr correction in bipolar_disorder and type_diabetes stams has dramatically better precision and recall than either gene based test in ra and coronary_artery the performance of stams and the gene based tests are comparable in bd and t d where stams identified genes that standard analysis techniques missed the genes were found clustered together the improvement of recall by stams shows that the addition of interaction data identifies genes that would otherwise be missed in an underpowered study even though they are true associations the improvement of precision demonstrates that the genes that belong to clusters of biologically related high_scoring genes are more likely to be validated in independent studies than genes that have individual genome_wide significance in a single study when we examine stams and ew_dmgwas precision and recall on the genes that were individually genome_wide significant in the full dataset we predictably see that both methods_fail to recover some of the individually significant hits both methods rely on strong gene_gene to identify modules so neither method detects genes that have strong individual signal but no neighbors with good p values which are detectable by single gene based tests however stams maintains nearly full levels of precision and recall even with fewer patients included as the p values for genes based on patient data become less significant the edge_weights from string remain constant stabilizing stams performance in the reduced power datasets in type_diabetes the strong edge_weights between members of the hla_region allows stams to perform well on only of the patient data performance of stams on the reduced power datasets from rheumatoid_arthritis shows nearly full precision and recall using n cases or more of the patient data these data indicate the utility of stams to rescue important gene_associations that would otherwise be missed due to lack of power finding ways to increase power without requiring larger_sample is mandatory in some cases for instance in some rare drug events and populations researchers have collected every known example and are still underpowered to find associations by demonstrating that stams has high_precision and recall of significant genes even as less and less input_data are used we have demonstrated its utility for identifying candidate_genes in a small gwas when comparing the performance of stams using different types of edges we find that edges created from textmining give the best performance on the knowngenes in four out of the six wtccc phenotypes however stams on the combined score edges outperforms the textmining edges on precision_recall of individually significant genes combined score shown in textmining data not shown we suspect that this is due to the greater number of edges in the combined score set than the textmining set which allows more genes to be identified unlike the knowngenes validation list the individually significant genes may or may not be replicated in other studies many of the edge modalities fusion co expression co occurance neighborhood had poor_performance across phenotypes we were not surprised to learn that these edges based on prokaryotic features or cross_species features were less useful than the edge sets created from eukaryotic protein_protein databases experimental database we tried combining some of the top performing edge modalities into new edge scores but the results were not better than textmining alone we recommend that researchers use the textmining and or combined score edge modalities notably the stams performance correlates with number of edges included in a modality as shown in the best performing edge modalities are the ones that contain the most edges in supplemental we illustrate stams performance as edges are randomly dropped or added to the input graph although performance drops as edges are removed stams performance is not as sensitive to the added edges indicating that it is robust to false_positive gene gene links the utility of the textmining based edges to find replicable results demonstrates the power of natural_language nlp for curating biomedical knowledge the edges currently in string are based on two genes or proteins co occurring in pubmed_abstracts or open_source articles as nlp techniques improve to include sentence parsing and modeling of more complicated gene gene relationships this edge set will get less noisy and identifying modules based on it will improve we should acknowledge that the publications mined could include those about the gwas that we used for validation or candidate_gene studies based on the initial wtccc results these papers may have listed the gwas hits or candidate_genes listed in the abstract thus creating links between the hits in the string database with those links the modules containing the gwas hits are easier to find however given the large corpus of pubmed_abstracts and the normalization calculations in string we suspect that the contamination by publications about our validation_set is very small we improved on the significance testing and module ranking algorithm of ew_dmgwas by considering permutations of node weights over a fixed network_topology with randomly_selected network_topology and connectivity used in permutations as ew_dmgwas does the background scores are almost certainly underestimated since they may not have connecting edges at all by keeping the edges fixed we focus on whether the weights of the nodes in the module are significant although we ranked the modules differently we agree with the authors of ew_dmgwas that selecting the top of modules for further investigation although seemingly arbitrary works well in practice this was demonstrated by our validation against independently associated gwas hits however because there are several ways to measure significance for dense modules we do not rely heavily on the calculated p value with only summary_statistics rather than genotype data the p values_calculated in neither stams nor ew_dmgwas measure how associated the module is with the phenotype instead the current implementations measure how densely clustered the high_scoring genes are in the network in order to get a more complete picture of significance one would have to permute the case control labels on the gwas data and redo the searching under those permutations to create a null_distribution we suggest that users use the p value to rank modules and identify candidate modules for follow_up study through permutation of case control labels or orthogonal biological methods in our application to autism we show that analyzing a commonvariant gwas with stams identifies a module with a known rarevariant association demonstrating the power of stams to converge on true_biological associations rare loss_of in cttnbp also known as cortbp have been associated with autism but have not been reported in common_variant autism gwas to date the module also has overlapping genes with other gene groups presented in the autism literature six of the genes overlap with neocortical development coexpression modules from parikshak et al ppp r c ppp cb are m cttnbp is m tcp and cct a are in m ppp r c is in m additionally pp r a was also classified by hormozdiari et al and as being part of two modules which are enriched for de_novo mrna mutations in autistic probands epilepsy and m extended autism_spectrum and intellectual_disability none of the genes in the module overlap with the copy_number modules identified by the netbag method of gilman et al many of the edges in the identified autism module come from the stripak complex described by goudreault et_al they used an iterative affinity_purification mass_spectrometry approach to characterize the diversity of protein phosphotase a pp a complexes the protein products of ppp r a ppp r b strn ppp r c ppp cb ppp r c cct a and tcp are all components of the stripak assembly stripak interacts with cttnbp which targets the assembly to dendritic_spines and where it regulates dendritic spinogenesis since cttnbp s association with autism may be explained by problems in the regulation of dendritic spinogenesis it follows that mutations in members of the stripak complex which is also part of this process may be associated with autism through the same mechanism stams reveals meaningful association of the stripak complex and this possible mechanism for autism by analyzing the gwas data within its biological_context stams is limited by the underlying search mechanisms presented in ew_dmgwas notably the search is entirely greedy which means that genes with small contributions to the score have no chance of being added to a module even if they provide a link to a higher scoring gene several other dense module searching methods exist which incorporate non greedy searching and the expansion of a non greedy search method to include edge weighting would likely outperform stams in some cases stams like other gene based_methods is also limited by including only snps that are mapped to genes in our application to autism we incorporated snps that are known eqtls for genes into the gene based score but there are still many measured snps for which data are ignored expanding gene definitions to include more intragenic snps may help however some individual snps and genes will remain undiscoverable by stams so we recommend running stams as a complement to snp based and gene based analysis techniques our validation method which uses genes from independent gwas that have snp that meets a cutoff of p value x in the initial replication population is more relaxed than most genome_wide snp significance criteria while x is a reasonable cutoff for a genebased test the results might change with a stricter validation list based on a p value x cutoff which is more typical of a snp study there may be ways to improve these edge sets by making them more phenotype or tissue_specific for instance augmenting the base string edge set with extra edges from phenotype specific co expression data or up weighting edges in string that have phenotype or tissue_specific expression may increase performance with the evaluation framework that we present in this paper one could determine_whether this kind of added information is useful understanding gwas hits in the context of their biological_interactions gives insight into mechanism of action however most dense mod ule searching approaches rely on yes no edge classification which creates errors due to arbitrary cutoffs for edge scores as shown by comparison to their older binary edge algorithm the inclusion of edge_weights into the search algorithm of ew_dmgwas eliminates these errors and makes the algorithm more robust we have shown that using the string confidence_scores along with appropriate changes to score normalization improves the performance of dmgwas even further we provide an r package stams that integrates the stringdb package the ew_dmgwas search function and the stams specific score normalization and allows users to easily perform this analysis on their gene based p values with the edge types of their choosing we are also happy to share our reusable validation and evaluation suite this suite represents the first systematic way to evaluate and compare dense module searching methods and parameter choices across a range of gwas
