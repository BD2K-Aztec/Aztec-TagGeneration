structural_bioinformatics modexplorer an integrated tool for exploring protein_sequence structure and function relationships modexplorer is an integrated tool aimed at exploring the sequence structural and functional_diversity in protein_families useful in homology_modeling and in analyzing protein_families in general it takes as input either the sequence or the structure of a protein and provides alignments with its homologs along with a variety of structural and functional_annotations through an interactive interface the annotations include sequence_conservation similarity_scores ligand dna and rna binding_sites secondary_structure disorder crystallographic_structure resolution and quality_scores of models implied by the alignments to the homologs of known structure modexplorer can be used to analyze sequence and structural conservation among the structures of similar proteins to find structures of homologs solved in different conformational_state or with different ligands and to transfer functional_annotations furthermore if the structure of the query is not known modexplorer can be used to select the modeling templates taking all this information into account and to build a comparative model availability_and freely_available on the web atexploring the sequence structure and function relationships between a protein and its homologs is a powerful strategy to transfer functional_annotations such as for example ligand_binding and or to detect the existence of alternative conformational_states likewise in homology_modeling a thorough survey of all homologs with known structure often can lead to building much better models than obtained by automatically selecting the closest homolog as a template current_tools either provide only a general overview of sequencestructurefunction relationships e g genesilico metaserver or messa or focus on selected aspects such as ligand_binding e g firestar a platform for the in depth integrated analysis of the sequence structure and function relationships is still missing consequently the information contained in remote relationships may be missed or exploited only through tedious procedures here we describe modexplorer a web_server that integrates sequence_analysis and structure comparison with functional_annotations it provides a more complete and detailed view of the sequence structural and functional_diversity within and between protein_families than existing_tools if the structure of the query_protein is not known it permits to select a template for homology_modeling and to automatically build the model
