drug_target interaction prediction from chemical genomic and pharmacological data in an integrated framework motivation in silico prediction of drugtarget_interactions from heterogeneous_biological data is critical in the search for drugs and therapeutic_targets for known diseases such as cancers there is therefore a strong incentive to develop new methods capable of detecting these potential drugtarget_interactions efficiently results in this article we investigate the relationship between the chemical_space the pharmacological space and the topology of drugtarget_interaction and show that drugtarget_interactions are more correlated with pharmacological_effect similarity than with chemical_structure similarity we then develop a new method to predict unknown drugtarget_interactions from chemical genomic and pharmacological data on a large_scale the proposed method consists of two steps i prediction of pharmacological_effects from chemical_structures of given compounds and ii inference of unknown drugtarget_interactions based on the pharmacological_effect similarity in the framework of supervised bipartite_graph inference the originality of the proposed method lies in the prediction of potential pharmacological similarity for any drug_candidate compounds and in the integration of chemical genomic and pharmacological data in a unified_framework in the results we make predictions for four classes of important drugtarget_interactions involving enzymes ion_channels gpcrs and nuclear_receptors our comprehensively predicted drugtarget_interaction enable us to suggest many potential drugtarget_interactions and to increase research productivity toward genomic drug_discovery supplementary_information datasets and all prediction results are available atthe identification of drugtarget_interactions interactions between drugs and target_proteins is a key area in genomic drug_discovery interactions with ligands can modulate the function of many classes of pharmaceutically useful protein targets including enzymes ion_channels g_protein gpcrs and nuclear_receptors owing to the completion of the human_genome and the development of various biotechnologies we are beginning to analyze the genomic space populated by these protein classes at the same time the high_throughput hts of large_scale chemical libraries is enabling us to explore the entire to whom correspondence should be addressed chemical_space of possible compounds however our knowledge about the relationship between the chemical_space and the genomic space is very limited in recent_years the importance of chemical genomics is growing fast to relate the chemical_space with the genomic space the genome_wide detection of compoundprotein interactions is a key issue in chemical genomics research which can lead to identification of new drug leads and therapeutic_targets for known diseases such as cancers although various biological_assays are becoming available experimental determination of compound protein interactions remains_challenging and very expensive even nowadays there is therefore a strong incentive to develop new in silico methods capable of detecting these potential compound protein interactions efficiently traditional computational_approaches are categorized into ligandbased approach and docking approach ligand based_approach like qsar quantitative_structure compares a candidate ligand with the known ligands of a target protein to predict its binding using machine_learning however the performance of the ligandbased approach is poor when the number of known ligands for a target protein of interest decreases the docking is a powerful approach but the docking cannot be applied to proteins whose d structures are unknown this limitation is serious for membrane_proteins for example there are only two gpcrs with d structure information as of writing therefore it is difficult to use the docking on a genome_wide scale recently a variety of statistical_methods have been developed to predict compoundprotein interactions on a genome_wide scale following the spirit of chemical genomics the underlying idea is that similar ligands are likely to interact with similar proteins and the prediction is performed based on compound chemical_structures protein_sequences and the currently known compoundprotein interactions a straightforward statistical_approach is to use binary_classification methods where they take compoundprotein pairs as an input for machine_learning such as neural_network and support_vector svm the other statistical_approach is the distance learning in the framework of supervised bipartite_graph inference another promising approach is to use pharmacological information the use of side effect similarity has been recently_proposed which is based on the assumption that drugs withpage i i i
