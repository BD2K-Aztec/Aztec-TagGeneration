structural_bioinformatics struc the secondary_structure server the defined secondary_structure of proteins method is often considered_the for assignment of secondary_structure from three_dimensional coordinates however there are alternative_methods struc the secondary_structure server has been created as a single point of access for eight different secondary_structure assignment methods it has been designed to enable comparisons between methods for analyzing the secondary_structure content for a single protein it also includes a second functionality compare the protein to enable comparisons of the secondary_structure features from any one method to be made within a collection of nuclear_magnetic models or between the crystal_structures of two different proteins availability http struc cryst in kabsch and sander developed what has become the de facto approach when defining secondary_structure the defined secondary_structure of proteins dssp dssp uses a single hydrogen_bond energy term to assign eight states of secondary_structure sses to three_dimensional coordinates and is arguably the golden_standard for this task although extensively used dssp is not the only tool available and other approaches have been developed which incorporate different means of defining sses it has been suggested that dssp can miss the elucidation of edge strands and has difficulties dealing with low_resolution structures and with structures where only the c trace atoms are reported further methods have been developed including dsspcont stride palsse p sea kaksi stick and xtlsstr the latter created for deriving secondary_structure from threedimensional coordinates to match comparable data determined from circular_dichroism these other methods meet specific needs that are not optimally addressed by dssp all have merit and as such broaden the means by which sses can be identified the aim of the struc server is to provide easy access to the information produced by a variety of these sse assignment tools to whom correspondence should be addressed currently eight methods are available on the server covering all atom approaches such as dssp dsspcont an extension of dssp using more detailed hydrogen_bonding energies and stride vector line segment methods such as stick and palsse and distance angle methods such as p sea kaksi and xtlsstr citation references to each of the methods are provided on the server and we request all users to cite these original_articles the output of each method is presented numerically in the form of total secondary_structure content as well as for individual_residues in a proteins sequence and on a graphical display of the proteins three_dimensional structure using a jmol http www jmol org representation in addition to method comparisons differences within nuclear_magnetic nmr models and between two x_ray structures are possible using the compare the protein feature the struc server provides two functionalities struc which generates sse assignments for protein_structures for up to eight different methods enabling easy analyses of similarities and differences between them and compare the protein which allows comparisons and highlighting of differences between the sses generated within a series of nmr models or between two x_ray structures struc is unique in providing summaries of percentage secondary_structure content for reduced three state data and original sse output assignments where generated the server is freely_available to all users at http struc cryst bbk ac uk
