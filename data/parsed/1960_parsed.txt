gene_expression inference with deep_learning motivation large_scale gene_expression has been widely used to characterize cellular_states in response to various disease conditions genetic_perturbations etc although the cost of whole_genome expression_profiles has been dropping steadily generating a compendium of expression_profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive recognizing that gene_expressions are often highly_correlated researchers from the nih lincs program have developed a cost_effective strategy of profiling only carefully_selected landmark genes and relying on computational_methods to infer the expression of remaining target_genes however the computational approach_adopted by the lincs program is currently based on linear_regression lr limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes results we present a deep_learning method abbreviated as d gex to infer the expression of target_genes from the expression of landmark genes we used the microarray_based gene_expression dataset consisting of k expression_profiles to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods in terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes deep_learning significantly_outperforms lr with relative_improvement a gene wise comparative_analysis shows that deep_learning achieves lower error than lr in of the target_genes we also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent rna_seq based gtex dataset which consists of expression_profiles deep_learning still outperforms lr with relative_improvement and achieves lower error in of the target_genes availability_and d gex is available at https github com uci cbcl d gex a fundamental problem in molecular_biology is to characterize the gene_expression of cells under various biological_states gene_expression has been historically adopted as the tool to capture the gene_expression in cellular_responses to diseases genetic_perturbations and drug_treatments the connectivity_map cmap project was launched to create a large reference collection of such patterns and has discovered small_molecules that are functionally connected using expression pattern matching e g hdac_inhibitors and estrogen_receptor modulators although recent_technological whole_genome gene_expression is still too expensive to be used by typical academic labs to generate a compendium of gene_expression over a large number of conditions such as large chemical libraries genome_wide rnai screening and genetic_perturbations the initial phase of the cmap project produced only genome_wide gene v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com expression_profiles using affymetrix_genechip microarrays despite the large_number across the whole human_genome most of their expression_profiles are known to be highly_correlated systems biologists have leveraged this idea to construct gene_regulatory and to identify regulator and target_genes researchers from the lincs program http www lincsproject org analyzed the gene_expression from the cmap data using principal_component they found that a set of carefully_chosen genes can capture of the information in the cmap data http support lincscloud org hc en us articles the landmark genes motivated by this observation researchers have developed the l luminex bead technology to measure the expression_profiles of these genes called the landmark genes http support lincscloud org hc en us articles the landmark genes with a much lower cost per profile therefore researchers can use the expression signatures of landmark genes to characterize the cellular_states of samples under various experimental_conditions if researchers are interested in the expression of a specific gene other than landmark genes the expression_profiles of the remaining genes called the target_genes can be then computationally inferred based on landmark genes and existing expression_profiles with the l technology the lincs program has generated million gene_expression under a variety of experimental_conditions however computationally inferring the expression_profiles of target_genes based on landmark genes is challenging it is essentially a large_scale multi task machine learning_problem with the target dimension significantly_greater than the feature dimension the lincs program currently adopts linear_regression lr as the inference_method which trains regression_models independently for each target_gene based on the gene_expression geo data while lr is highly scalable it inevitably ignores the nonlinearity within gene_expression that has been observed kernel machines can represent dexterous nonlinear patterns and have been applied to similar problems unfortunately they suffer from poor scalability to growing data size thus a machine_learning enjoying both scalability and rich representability is ideal for large_scale multi task gene_expression inference recent successes in deep_learning on many machine_learning tasks have demonstrated its power in learning hierarchical nonlinear patterns on large_scale datasets deep_learning in general refers to methods that learn a hierarchical representation of the data through multiple_layers of abstraction e g multi_layer feedforward neural_networks a number of new techniques have been developed recently in deep_learning including the deployment of general_purpose computing on graphics_processing new training methodologies such as dropout training and momentum method with these advances deep_learning has achieved state of the art performances on a wide_range both in traditional machine_learning tasks such as computer vision natural_language speech_recognition and in natural science applications such as exotic particles detection protein_structure rna_splicing prediction and pathogenic_variants identification here we present a deep_learning method for gene_expression inference d gex d gex is a multi task multi_layer feedforward neural_network we evaluated the performances of d gex lr with and without different regularizations and k nearest_neighbor knn regression on two types of expression data the microarray_expression from the geo and the rna_seq expression data from the genotype tissue expression gtex project gpu computing was used to accelerate neural_network training so that we were able to evaluate a series of neural_networks with different architectures results on the geo data show that d gex consistently outperforms other methods in terms of prediction_accuracy results on the gtex data further demonstrate d gex combined with the dropout regularization technique achieves the best performance even where training and prediction were performed on datasets obtained from different platforms microarray versus rna_seq such cross platforms generalizability implies the great_potential of d gex to be applied to the lincs program where training and prediction were also done separately on the microarray_data and the l data finally we attempted to explore the internal_structures of the learned neural_networks with two different strategies and tried to interpret the advantages of deep_learning compared with lr we have introduced two types of gene_expression data namely the geo microarray_data and the gtex g rna_seq we have formulated the gene_expression inference as a multi task regression_problem using the geo data for training and both the geo and the gtex data for testing we have also described our deep_learning method d gex and another two methods lr and knn regression to solve the problem next we show the predictive performances of the three methods on both the geo data and the gtex data revealing the complex patterns of gene_expression under numerous biological_states requires both cost_effective profiling tools and powerful inference frameworks while the l platform adopted by the lincs program can efficiently profile the landmark genes the linear_regression based_inference does not fully leverage the nonlinear features within gene_expression to infer the target_genes we presented a deep_learning method for gene_expression inference that significantly_outperforms lr on the geo microarray_data with dropout as regularization our deep_learning method also preserves cross platforms generalizability on the gtex rna_seq in summary deep_learning provides adropout rate the overall error decreasing curves of d gex on gtex te with different dropout_rates the x axis is the training epoch and the y axis is the overall error the overall error of lr is also included for comparison better model than lr for gene_expression inference we believe that it achieves more accurate_predictions for target gene_expressions of the lincs dataset generated from the l platform interpreting the internal representation of deep architectures is notoriously_difficult unlike other machine_learning tasks such as computer vision where we can visualize the learned weights of hidden units as meaningful image patches interpreting the deep architectures learned by biological data requires novel thinking we attempted to interpret the internal_structures of the neural_networks learned from gene_expression data using strategies that were inspired by linear_model yet more systematic studies may require advanced computational frameworks that are specifically_designed for deep_learning unsupervised feature learning methods such as autoencoder and restricted boltzmann machine may provide some insights on this problem in the current setting target_genes were randomly partitioned into multiple sets and each set was trained separately using different gpus due to hardware limitations alternatively we could first cluster target_genes based on their expression_profiles and then partition them accordingly rather than randomly the rationale is that target_genes sharing similar expression_profiles share weights in the context of multi task neural_networks ultimately the solution is to jointly train all target_genes either by using gpus with larger memory such as the more recent nvidia tesla k or by exploiting multi gpu techniques
