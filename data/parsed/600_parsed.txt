automated construction and analysis of the design_space for biochemical_systems motivation our recent work introduced a generic method to construct the design_space of biochemical_systems a representation of the relationships between system parameters environmental_variables and phenotypic behavior in design_space the qualitatively distinct phenotypes of a biochemical system can be identified counted analyzed and compared boundaries in design_space indicate a transition between phenotypic behaviors and can be used to measure a systems tolerance to large changes in parameters moreover the relative_size and arrangement of such phenotypic regions can suggest or confirm global properties of the system results our work here demonstrates that the construction and analysis of design_space can be automated we present a formal description of design_space and a detailed explanation of its construction we also extend the notion to include variable kinetic orders we describe algorithms that automate common steps of design_space construction and analysis introduce new analyses that are made possible by such automation and discuss challenges of implementation and scaling in the end we demonstrate the techniques using software we have created availability the design_space toolbox for matlab is freely_available atwe are awash in a sea of genomic_data since dna_sequencing was first introduced we have witnessed the sequencing of the entire_human and over one thousand prokaryotic_genomes ncbi thanks to next_generation expectations have grown and audacious efforts are underway to sequence one thousand individual human_genomes one thousand plant_genomes and ten thousand vertebrate_genomes genomes kp and genome k projects despite the flood of genomic_data a major unsolved_problem remains relating the known genotypes to phenotypes even at the level of biochemical_systems drawing a connection between genotypic data and system behavior is difficult first we must represent the genotypic data with a model a challenging_task in itself then assuming an adequate model exists its phenotypic_responses must be characterized because the parameters to whom correspondence should be addressed of the model usually vary as with environmental_change or parameter_uncertainty a direct approach would be to empirically sample many parameter combinations and observe the resulting model behavior however the size of the task can quickly grow unreasonable for example parameters each sampled at points imply an astronomical trials and could still miss a point of interest furthermore classification of the behavior is arbitrary each trial may exhibit a slightly different phenotype but without guidance for what constitutes a significant change to address the issues our recent work has demonstrated the generic construction of a system design_space that represents the relationship between system parameters environmental_variables and phenotypic behavior boundaries in design_space are mathematically defined based on inherent_properties of the model and naturally separate qualitatively distinct phenotypes of the system allowing them to be counted and compared the approach has been successfully_applied to various biochemical_systems of interest nevertheless the process of constructing design_space has largely been explained by example here we present a formal description of design_space and its construction for the first time we extend the notion to include variable kinetic orders we then describe algorithms to automatically construct design_space and perform common analyses in the context of design_space we also describe new analyses that are made possible by such automation throughout the description we discuss challenges of implementation and scaling to larger systems in the end we present an implementation of the algorithms in software the design_space toolbox for matlab and demonstrate the software with abstract and biological examples
