systems_biology human protein_protein prediction by a novel sequence_based co evolution method co evolutionary_divergence motivation proteinprotein_interaction ppi plays an important role in understanding gene_functions and many computational ppi prediction_methods have been proposed in recent_years despite the extensive efforts ppi prediction still has much room to improve sequence_based co evolution methods include the substitution_rate method and the mirror tree method which compare sequence substitution_rates and topological_similarity of phylogenetic_trees respectively although they have been used to predict ppi in species with small_genomes like escherichia_coli such methods have not been tested in large_scale proteome like homo_sapiens result in this study we propose a novel sequence_based co evolution method co evolutionary_divergence cd for human ppi prediction built on the basic assumption that protein pairs with similar substitution_rates are likely to interact with each other the cd method converts the evolutionary_information from species of vertebrates into likelihood_ratios and combined them together to infer ppi we showed that the cd method outperformed the mirror tree method in three independent human ppi datasets by a large margin with the arrival of more species genome information generated by next_generation the performance of the cd method can be further improved availability source_code and support are available at http mib stat proteinprotein_interactions ppi regulate many fundamental_cellular one key_step in understanding the function of a protein is to identify its potential interacting_partners ppi identification and prediction have become an important topic in recent decades up to date many experimental methods to identify physical_interaction between two proteins have been proposed including the yeast_two system protein_fragment complementation assay affinity_purification mass_spectrometry protein microarray and fluorescence_resonance the results from these experiments have been deposited in several public_databases for instance hprd dip intact biogrid and mint it has been suggested that there are ppi out of a total of protein pairs in the human_proteome this estimate does not account for the numerous variations owing to post translation modification or alternative_splicing a number of computational_techniques have been proposed to provide either complementary information or supporting evidence to experimental methods for example phylogenetic profile rosetta stone conserved gene neighborhood analyses domain co occurrence and orthology information these methods use domain gene functional pathway co existence information or gene_fusion event in related species to predict ppi sequence_based co evolution is another approach which has been proposed to predict ppi for many years there are two types of methods in this approach the site_specific method and the full sequence method the site_specific method detects sequence mutual changes in binding interfaces of interacting_partners to infer ppi but changes in such regions are hard to detect full sequence methods such as the mirror tree method proposed by pazos compare a distance_matrix between two proteins and use topological_similarity of phylogenetic_trees to predict ppi in addition fraser and his collaborates compared substitution_rates between two proteins and concluded that interacting_proteins evolve at a similar rate however both methods have not been applied to the whole large_scale ppi prediction in vertebrates in this article we introduce a new method to exploit sequence_based co evolution for ppi prediction in the human_proteome our method is based on two basic assumptions first shared selection_pressure may force two interacting_proteins to co evolve together changes in the sequence of one protein may induce appropriate changes in the sequence of its interacting_partner to retain the binding_affinity and maintain biological_functions consequently ppi pairs may have similar substitution_rates second protein interaction is more likely to to whom correspondence should be addressed conserve across related species thus to study human proteins we shall examine their orthologous_proteins in all vertebrates whose genomes are already sequenced based on these two assumptions we define the co evolutionary_divergence cd of a pair of proteins as the absolute value of the substitution_rate difference between two proteins the cd values of interacting_protein are expected to be smaller than those of noninteracting protein pairs therefore we may use cd as a feature to distinguish interacting_protein from non interacting_protein we evaluate the performance of ppi prediction by the cd method and compare it with the mirror tree method by examining three independent ppi datasets we show that cd is a better method for human ppi prediction our cd method used the sequence_based co evolution approach for ppi prediction although this method could rank the likelihood of interaction for a given pair of proteins it did not infer specific features of interaction such as the interacting residues in the interfaces structure based_methods such as protein or domain docking methods emphasize the molecular interface between proteins or domains however the computing load of docking methods is too heavy to be applied for the large_scale prediction in human_genome the cd method might provide a shorter list of candidate protein pairs for applying these methods one class of co evolutionary_models exploiting sequence covariations were used to predict interaction between residues within a protein_sequence for example statistical coupling analysis sca and mutual_information successfully infer residues interactions in pdz protein_family and basic_helix respectively the assumptions of these two methods are similar to the cd method if one protein interacts with the other protein in human their orthologous_proteins in other species are likely to have interactions too the main difference isthat methods like sca focus on the co change between amino_acids whereas the cd method focuses on the rates of amino_acid change between two sequences although methods like sca provide computational_methods to infer the residues interactions within protein_sequence they may be extended to infer residues interactions between protein_sequences we demonstrated that our cd method performed much better than the mirror tree method in three independent datasets of interacting_proteins in human one major difference between the two methods is that the cd method is more sensitive to the absolute_size difference of protein substitution_rates because the mirror tree uses the correlation_coefficient of the sequence substitution_rate profiles across the selected species it is only the relative_size difference in the substitution_rates that matters therefore two protein_families may have considerably different substitution_rates across all branches of the evolution tree whereas their profiles may still have high correlations in such cases they may not form proteinprotein_interactions but are likely to be falsely predicted by the mirror tree method the other difference is the alignment_method used in comparing othologs in the mirror tree method the conserved_regions identified by multiple_alignment across all related species are used to generate the evolutionary profile for correlation_analysis the size of a conserved_region would automatically get smaller when more species are used for alignment this leads to the unfortunate consequence that less information could be used in estimating the rate of substitution between species in the cd method the conserved_regions are identified separately by the pair_wise alignment for each species pair the region sizes are larger and the substitution_rate estimation is more informative the negative correlation between protein substitution_rate and number of interacting_partner may be a potential source of false_negatives in the cd method proteins with many interacting_partners hub protein tend to have lower substitution_rates if a protein only interacts with one such hub protein and has no other interacting_partner its substitution_rate may be higher as a consequence the cd of such protein pairs may have an upward bias to investigate whether the bias is substantial we compare the distribution of cd between ppi involving with hub proteins and not involving with hub proteins supplementary figs s and s although the cd of ppi involved with one hub protein is slightly greater than that of ppi not involving with any hub protein the difference is not significant our cd method used all comparisons between pairs of vertebrates for human ppi prediction an alternative version would be to construct the likelihood_ratio from only the comparisons involving human and other vertebrates however this did not yield a better performance supplementary we also investigated the effect of bin size choice in constructing the likelihood_ratio table as shown in supplementary the performance of our method is nearly unchanged when changing the bin size from to we conclude that the cd method may be a more direct way to combine co evolutionary_information of inter acting protein pair from many species the co evolutionary diver gence method does not use multiple_alignment thus taking less time than the mirror tree method the mirror tree method is limited to those proteins with orthologous across all species under consideration thus when more and more species genomes become available less proteins could be applied in contrast increasing the number of species will provide more information to improve the accuracy of the co evolutionary_divergence method conflict of interest none declared
