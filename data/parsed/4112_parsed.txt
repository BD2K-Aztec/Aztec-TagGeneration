gene_expression samstrt statistical_test for differential_expression in single_cell transcriptome with spike in normalization motivation recent transcriptome_studies have revealed that total transcript numbers vary by cell_type and condition therefore the statistical assumptions for single_cell transcriptome_studies must be revisited samstrt is an extension code for samseq which is a statistical_method for differential_expression to enable spike in normaliza tion and statistical_testing based on the estimated absolute number of transcripts per cell for single_cell methods availability_and samstrt is implemented on r and available in github https github com shka r samstrt unbiased molecular measurements are required to form precise hypotheses on molecular_mechanisms and measurements at single_cell resolution can give detailed snapshots of heterogeneous cell_cultures or tissues recently described single_cell mrna sequencing_technology is one promising method for such purposes however the statistical assumptions in the traditional tests for differential_expression are not necessarily applicable as the total mrna_molecules per cell could be different by cell_types and sensitivity over the experiments is less consistent than in the other methods that use large_amounts of input mrna one possible solution is the addition of a known number of spike in control rna_molecules to each cell_lysate which can be used to normalize and convert read_counts to estimated molecule numbers in the present study we used the single_cell tagged reverse transcription strt method to investigate key_issues for statistical_tests in several control experiments and then implement and demonstrate a new concept for differential_expression test on single_cell transcriptome profiles
