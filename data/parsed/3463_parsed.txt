pathwaysweb a gene pathways api with directional interactions expanded gene_ontology and versioning pathwaysweb is a resource based well documented web system that provides publicly_available information on genes biological_pathways gene_ontology go terms genegene_interaction networks importantly with the directionality of interactions and links to key related pubmed documents the pathwaysweb api simplifies the construction of applications that need to retrieve and interrelate information across multiple pathway related data types from a variety of original data_sources pathwaysbrowser is a companion website that enables users to explore the same integrated pathway data the pathwaysweb system facilitates reproducible analyses by providing access to all versions of the integrated datasets although its go subsystem includes data for mouse pathwaysweb currently focuses on human data however pathways for mouse and many other species can be inferred with a high success_rate from human pathways availability_and pathwaysweb can be accessed via the internet atalthough the inclusion of pathway and gene interaction information into novel bioinformatics_analysis methods is widely expected to result in more powerful and sensitive bioinformatic_analyses we found it surprisingly difficult to assemble a comprehensive database of pathway_information in a form suitable for our requirements specific challenges we faced included bullet finding a single comprehensive source of pathway related data that maintains consistent approved identifiers for genes and biological_pathways across multiple data_sources bullet finding data_sources that provide coordinated snapshots of data from multiple sources at a given time to enable replication of results bullet finding data licensed in a way that would allow us to make our tools freely_available not just to academic_institutions or requiring an additional license agreement for use although many databases and application programming interfaces apis exist for retrieving pathway related data for use in biological_research they provide data that are incomplete use different data identifiers or include databases that are not in sync with one another those incompatibilities make the data difficult to merge furthermore the apis and data_formats change often and without warning many systems have no api and require either the download of an entire database or parsing of web_pages to access the data using an automated system some have severe_limitations as to how much information can be retrieved using a single search because of the issues listed above we have developed the pathwaysweb system to harmonize the data from various sources we ensure that gene identifiers are based on gene symbols approved by the human gene nomenclature_committee hgnc where possible the system presents the combined harmonized data via an integrated web api each set of data loaded from the various sources is made available as an archived version that provides a snapshot of data from all of the sources at one point in time that pattern of organization assists in reproducibility of analyses the system is divided_into two parts i pathwaysweb which provides data in xml or json format for use by automated software systems and ii pathwaysbrowser which provides human friendly access via html pages viewable via standard web_browsers the code base and database are not currently available for download online but arrangements could be made available to provide this data a new version of the data will be added every months
