gene_expression joint analysis of expression_profiles from multiple_cancers improves the identification of microrna gene interactions motivation micrornas mirnas play_a in tumorigenesis and development through their effects on target_genes the characterization of mirnagene interactions will lead to a better understanding of cancer mechanisms many computational_methods have been developed to infer mirna_targets with without expression data micrornas mirnas nt are important non coding small_rnas regulating gene_expression by repressing the translation or degrading target_genes through complementary base_pairing to untranslated_regions utrs of genes they are involved in many cancer related processes such as cell_growth through regulating their target gene_expression esquela considering the importance of mirnas in cancers and that they regulate a large_number deciphering mirna and gene interactions at the genome level can lead to a better understanding of tumorigenesis and development in recent_years many computational_approaches have been developed to predict mirna_targets sequence_based prediction_algorithms build on specific binding rules including sequence complementarity secondary_structure energy conservation and site accessibility to predict mirnagene interactions some representative methods include targetscans targetscan miranda and pictar although these methods provide a list of potential target_genes for each mirna they suffer from a relatively high false_positive because of the complex nature of mirnagene interactions in addition the predictions are static and may not capture those interactions that are specific to certain diseases or conditions to improve sequence_based prediction specificities and identify condition specific interactions efforts have been made to incorporate expression_profiles to study mirna regulatory_mechanisms the basic principle of these methods is that genes regulated by a mirna should exhibit negative expression correlations with the mirna these methods include those based on simple correlation_analysis simple regularized regression_models and bayesian_inference pearson_correlation in the category of simple correlation_analysis is the most straightforward way to study mirnagene interactions however the simplicity of this method usually results in relatively high false_positive lasso_regression in the category of regression_models deals with the high correlation among genes mirnas by providing a sparse solution with a relatively small set of significant mirnagene pairs genmir the first developed and mostly cited method in the category of bayesian_inference uses a bayesian_model with variational inference techniques to find putative pairs from expression data by incorporating the prior information e g sequence_features other methods in the bayesian category to whom correspondence should be addressed either provide a fast solving algorithm for the bayesian_model or assume different priors the methods in all three categories have improved_prediction specificity by combining expression_profile data with sequencebased prediction however expression datasets are in general limited in size to address this limitation most existing_methods concatenate expression_profiles from multiple_diseases into one single dataset for analysis called simple aggregate analysis in the rest of this article the advantages of this approach include the relatively large_sample achieved and the high variability of expression in genes and mirnas among samples because of sample_heterogeneity among diseases which is preferred in interaction studies through aggregation however the presence of disease heterogeneity may dilute interaction signals if the association is only present in one disease and there are also challenges in data_processing and selection overall studies based on samples from one specific disease may be more preferred if sufficient samples are available recent releases of the cancer_genome tcga expression datasets on multiple_tumors such as ovarian_serous cystadenocarcinoma provide the opportunity to study mirnagene interactions individually in each cancer large_sample usually samples heterogeneity among patient samples and high variability of gene mirna_expression in these cancers may significantly improve statistical_power to infer mirnagene interactions the existing simple aggregate methods mentioned earlier in the text e g pearson_correlation lasso and genmir can be used to analyze mirnagene interactions in individual cancers in the tcga datasets however if a large number of mirnagene interactions are shared between different cancers potentially useful information may be lost in cancer specific analysis when interactions are weak in some of these cancers the existing_methods may suffer from signal dilution and non specific prediction when used at aggregated datasets on the other hand these methods may miss interactions shared among diseases if applied to individual cancers therefore it is desirable to develop a method that can identify both disease specific and common interacting mirnagene pairs through joint analysis of multiple_cancers in other areas of computational_biology statistical_methods have been developed for joint analysis of multiple related datasets in the joint analysis of multiple chipchip datasets datta and zhao proposed a log linear_model to infer cooperative_binding among transcription_factors applied a quadratic regression_model to jointly analyze_multiple chip_seq libraries with consideration of the potential covariates in the data developed a hierarchical hidden_markov to incorporate data from both chip_seq and chipchip data to improve the identifications of transcription_factor described a deterministic model_based mm chip to perform meta_analysis by integrating information from cross_platform and betweenlaboratory chipchip or chip_seq presented sparsely correlated hidden_markov to analyze_multiple genome_wide location study datasets based on simultaneous hidden_markov hmm inference in gene_regulatory studies proposed a novel algorithm to infer interspecies disease networks based on the construction and training of intraspecies bayesian_networks to enhance the inference of gene network steele andapplied post learning aggregation methods to study the regulatory_networks by combining multiple microarray_datasets with consensus or meta_analysis bayesian_networks and to improve the inference compared with simple concatenation of datasets several meta_analyses of genome_wide have been performed to increase the power of disease related variant detections in this article we developed a two stage method called mcmg joint analysis of multiple_cancers for microrna gene interactions to identify mirnagene interactions that are either specific to a cancer type or common to several cancers by jointly analyzing expression_profiles from multiple_cancers the probability of interactions is first inferred individually in each cancer from paired mirna and gene_expression data and then jointly analyzed across cancers through an empirical_bayes model because of information_sharing among different but related cancers better characterization of mirnagene pairs can be achieved compared with single cancer analysis or simple aggregate analysis through both simulation_studies and the analyses of tcga datasets we demonstrate the usefulness and power of our method in addition our method can also infer relationships among cancers and incorporate different data types shown in real_data analysis
