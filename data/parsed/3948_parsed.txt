sequence_analysis reference independent comparative_metagenomics using cross assembly crass motivation metagenomes are often characterized by high levels of unknown sequences reads derived from known microorganisms can easily be identified and analyzed using fast homology_search algorithms and a suitable reference_database but the unknown sequences are often ignored in further analyses biasing conclusions nevertheless it is possible to use more data in a comparative meta genomic analysis by creating a cross assembly of all reads i e a single assembly of reads from different samples comparative meta genomics studies the interrelationships between metagenomes from different samples using an assembly algorithm is a fast and intuitive way to link partially homologous reads without requiring a database of reference_sequences results here we introduce crass a novel bioinformatic tool that enables fast simple analysis of cross assembly files yielding distances between all metagenomic sample_pairs and an insightful image displaying the similarities availability_and crass is available as a web_server at http edwards sdsu edu crass and the perl source_code can be downloaded to run as a stand alone command_line the sequencing of environmental_samples has disclosed a universe of novel microbial organisms microbiologists and virologists are sequencing dna and rna from environments ranging from coral_reefs to the human_gut and are discovering previously_unknown microorganisms in all these samples the fraction of unknown sequences can be particularly high in viral metagenomes because i viruses exhibit relatively high_mutation resulting in distant unrecognizable homology and ii this superkingdom has remained poorly explored with relatively few sequences present in the databases these properties hinder the comparison of metagenomic_samples with high percentages up to of unknowns by traditional_methods that map sequencing_reads to known annotated references in addition the abundance and diversity of viruses in natural_systems impede comparisons between metagenomic_datasets especially when comparing relatively short_reads generated by some second generation sequencing_platforms a promising solution is to initially combine the different metagenomes and perform a de_novo of all sequence_reads if applied conservatively to avoid chimerization metagenome_assembly can reliably link reads that are completely unknown to reads that have similarity to annotated sequences the tool phage communities from contig spectra phaccs assesses the biodiversity of uncultured viral communities by mathematically modeling the community_structure using the contig spectrum of metagenome assemblies phage communities from contig spectra was extended to assess cross assemblies in a tool called maxi because they do not rely on a database with reference_sequences these tools provide an approach for comparing complete metagenomes even if they contain a high fraction of unknown sequences here we present crass a novel more direct approach based on the same concept i e using cross assembly of reads from different metagenomes to assess the degree of similarity between the sampled communities thus cross metagenome_assembly enables a sensitive comparison of entities that are shared between samples including viruses with no homology to known sequences unlike previous methods crass calculates a pairwise distance score between metagenomes and creates an insightful image to display these distances graphically moreover a crossassembly combines short_sequencing into longer contigs that may be more suitable for annotation for example downstream_analyses could include sensitive homology_searches rna_structure detection and prediction

licenses by which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work it is expected that metagenomes from a similar environment share a larger fraction of microbial or viral species than metagenomes from different origins these shared metagenomic entities can be reconstructed by cross assembly of the metagenomes and analyzed and visualized using crass the contigs that link two samples cross contigs directly represent the similarity between those samples if most contigs are composed of a mix of reads from different samples then it may be concluded that there are many shared entities among those samples conversely if contigs are predominantly composed of reads from either one of the samples but there are few cross contigs these samples are highly dissimilar in composition determining the interrelationships between metagenomes from different biomes or different time points is important to understand the microbial world around us mapping metagenomic_sequences to a reference_database of known genes is a feasible approach to transfer taxonomical and functional_annotations to sequence_reads however it can limit the amount of data that can be analyzed because the majority of the sequencing_reads in difficult to annotate datasets such as viral metagenomes from biomes other than the human_microbiome lack known homologs a promising alternative is referenceindependent comparative_metagenomics we present crass an intuitive approach for comparative_metagenomics that calculates a similarity signal using shared entities which are identified by cross assembly the tool does in cladograms of nine simulated metagenomes those containing actinobacteria n mostly form a separate cluster from those containing firmicutes n supplementary the length of the separating internal branch is plotted with increasing proteobacteria contamination until the actinobacteria and firmicutes metagenomes no longer form separate clusters and there is no internal branch see_text for details the cladograms created by crass are available in supplementary comparative_metagenomics using cross assembly crass not depend on homology of the sequenced_reads to any known sequence in a reference_database or even on full_length homology of the reads to one another assembly algorithms such as those used to create the ace files required for crass analysis identify shared subsequences long or signature k_mers between reads to assemble them because it relies on a different similarity signal this long k_mer approach is complementary to the use of short k_mer profiles we expect that equations and can be applied for qualitative comparisons between environments because they only take the degree of shared entities cross contigs into account conversely equations and will be more suited for quantitative comparisons because they consider the read_counts as a measure of abundance although limited in scope our current results based on analyses of simulated metagenomic_samples suggest that the distance formula wootters may outperform the other formulas for detecting both qualitative_and signals with similar performance as the comparisons based on dinucleotide odds_ratios nevertheless it is difficult to predict which of the distance formulas presented in this article will be the most suitable for which biological application that is why we have created a user forum at seqanswers available through the crass web_site where we hope that users will share their experiences and any publications that use crass an additional advantage of using cross assembly is that the sequences of biological_entities which are shared between specific samples are simultaneously assembled based on the results obtained using simulated_data supplementary_file we expect that fragment assemblers developed for ests such as mira or specialized metagenome assemblers will be more suitable for cross metagenome_assembly than assemblers like newbler which are optimized for single genome_assembly if the parameters of the assembly program are set to strict values to avoid chimerization tentative taxonomic annotations may be transferred between reads that are linked within one contig we recommend using parameter_settings that the user is comfortable with for metagenomic assembly but it should be noted that the resulting crass cladogram is based on a similarity_score between entire metagenomes which limits the effect of possibly rare chimerical sequences moreover chimerization may be problematic between closely_related but less severe for more distant organisms thus although they will add some noise to the similarity signal chimeras are more likely to link reads from biomes that are already similar alleviating errors in the final cladogram to address the issue of potential chimerization we recommend creating separate cross assemblies and crass cladograms with stringent and permissive assembly parameters which will lead to fewer and more chimerical contigs respectively the resulting cladograms can then be compared to evaluate the effect of chimerization on the cross assembly analysis in general we have seen that the cladogram rarely changes with altered assembly parameters indicating that crass is a robust approach for comparative_metagenomics antarcti c lake summe r h u m a n n a s a l f h u m a n fe c a l n huma n fecal n h u m
