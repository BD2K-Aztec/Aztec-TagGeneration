statistical expression deconvolution from mixed tissue_samples motivation global expression_patterns within cells are used for purposes ranging from the identification of disease_biomarkers to basic understanding of cellular_processes unfortunately tissue_samples used in cancer studies are usually composed of multiple cell_types and the non cancerous portions can significantly affect expression_profiles this severely_limits the conclusions that can be made about the specificity of gene_expression in the cell_type of interest however statistical_analysis can be used to_identify that are related to the biological_question being studied results we propose a statistical_approach to expression deconvolution from mixed tissue_samples in which the proportion of each component cell_type is unknown our method estimates the proportion of each component in a mixed tissue_sample this estimate can be used to provide estimates of gene_expression from each component we demonstrate our technique on xenograft samples from breast_cancer research and publicly_available experimental_datasets found in the national_center gene_expression repository availability r code http www r project org for estimating sample proportions is freely_available to non commercial users and available atin the past_decade gene_expression has demonstrated an amazing potential for identifying disease_biomarkers and improving our understanding of cellular_processes an issue not often discussed is that many biological_samples contain mixtures of cell or tissue_types for example cancer_cells may only constitute part of a biopsy_sample the amount of each mrna detected in a microarray experiment is influenced by the composition of the sample observed changes in gene_expression may simply reflect a change in the distribution of the cell_types in the sample population in breast cancernoticed that the proportion of benign_tissue of biopsy_samples can significantly affect expression_profiles and taking_into this proportion can improve response prediction to whom correspondence should be addressed sample_heterogeneity severely_limits the conclusions that can be made about specificity of gene_expression and may explain in part why the results of numerous gene_expression experiments have failed rigorous validation given a heterogeneous_sample there exist laboratory approaches to separate cells of distinct types laser_capture lcm is a popular technique for isolating regions of a biological_sample that are separated by distances of a few cell widths however the cell_types of interest need to be morphologically_distinct lcm is very time consuming and specialized_equipment is required to obtain a sufficient quantity of biological_material for profiling if the sample of interest is in suspension cell_sorting methods can be used to isolate cells of interest this requires a suitable biomarker for the cell_type of interest the main_drawback of cell_sorting with respect to profiling is that the act of separation itself can alter gene_expression we present a method for deconvoluting expression from a heterogeneous_sample into components that reflect the contributions to the observed expression attributable to each component cell or tissue type the key_component of this method is the estimation from a mixed tissue_sample of the proportion of mrna from a single tissue type estimation is based on specific logarithmic data transformations and theory from differential geometry regarding the radius of curvature we demonstrate our method on several datasets from breast_cancer xenograft studies from both proprietary sources and the national_center ncbi gene_expression geo repository http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo we implemented our procedure for estimating p a in several gene_expression both proprietary and public in which expression data was generated from samples composed of two tissue cell_types some of the samples consist of different cell_types from the same page organism while other samples are a mix of cell_types from different organisms the proportion of each component type is known as the data come from titration series we use these values to assess the accuracy of our estimates
