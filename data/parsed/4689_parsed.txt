topdom database of conservatively located domains and motifs in proteins the topdom databaseoriginally created as a collection of domains and motifs located consistently on the same side of the membranes in a helical transmembrane proteinshas been updated and extended by taking_into consistently localized domains and motifs in globular_proteins too by taking_advantage of the recently_developed cctop algorithm to determine the type of a protein and predict topology in case of transmembrane_proteins and by applying a thorough search for domains and motifs as well as utilizing the most up to date version of all source databases we managed to reach a fold increase in the size of the whole database and a fold increase in the number of transmembrane_proteins availability_and topdom database is available at http topdom enzim hu the webpage utilizes the common apache php and mysql software to provide the user_interface for accessing and searching the database the database itself is generated on a high performance computer contact tusnady gabor ttk mta hu protein_domains can fold independently from other parts of proteins and have distinct functions a function linked to a domain may be important in several processes therefore one domain may appear in different proteins since domains can only be functional in appropriate conditions a particular domain in various proteins should be located in the same environment i e in the same subcellular_location or in organelles which interiors have similar physicalchemical properties identifying those protein_domains that consistently appear in the same location may help the annotation of unknown_proteins with the same or similar domains or the topology prediction of transmembrane_proteins during process of cytosis membranes keep their initial orientation therefore all cellular space can be defined as one of the followings inside cytoplasmic or outside extra cytoplasmic space a detailed_description of the various membranes and their sidedness can be found on the homepage of topdb database http topdb enzim hu here we report the update of the topdom database originally developed for gathering domains consistently located on the same side of tmps the update was performed by extending the examination with globular_proteins and using exhaustive_search for domains and motifs in all proteins either having a precise location relative to the membranes e g the localization mitochondrion is not precise but mitochondrion matrix is or being transmembrane moreover we applied statistical significance_test to select those domains and motifs that are consistently on the same side of the membrane either in tmps or in non tmps
