ulysses accurate detection of low_frequency structural_variations in large insert_size sequencing libraries motivation the detection of structural_variations svs in short range paired_end pe libraries remains_challenging because sv breakpoints can involve large dispersed repeated_sequences or carry inherent complexity hardly resolvable with classical pe sequencing_data in contrast large insert_size sequencing libraries mate_pair provide higher physical coverage of the gen ome and give access to repeat containing regions they can thus theoretically overcome previous limitations as they are becoming routinely accessible nevertheless broad insert_size distributions and high rates of chimerical sequences are usually associated to this type of libraries which makes the accurate annotation of sv challenging results here we present ulysses a tool that achieves drastically higher detection_accuracy than existing_tools both on simulated and real mate_pair sequencing_datasets from the human_genome ulysses achieves high_specificity over the complete spectrum of variants by assessing in a principled manner the statistical_significance of each possible variant duplications deletions translocations insertions and inversions against an explicit model for the generation of experimental_noise this statistical_model proves particularly useful for the detection of low_frequency variants sv_detection performed on a large insert mate_pair library from a breast_cancer sample revealed a high_level of somatic duplications in the tumor and to a lesser extent in the blood_sample as well altogether these results show that ulysses is a valuable_tool for the characterization of somatic_mosaicism in human tissues and in cancer_genomes availability_and ulysses is available atour current understanding of the structural and functional impact of sv onto the biology of genomes has largely benefited from the development of the second generation of dna_sequencing the computational detection of sv has mainly relied on the development of four methodological strategies the read_depth method the split_read method the de_novo and the paired_end method some detection_tools have increased sv_detection specificity and breakpoint resolution by combining several of these detection strategies computational_analyses using these approaches demonstrated that large sv are major contributors to the genomic polymorphism between individuals polymorphic sv were shown to contribute to both common diseases and rare genomic disorders and to alter normal gene function during cancer development new approaches have also started to reveal the quantitative importance of somatic sv in healthy_tissues such as neuron or blood cells however the true level of somatic_mosaicism probably remains underestimated owing to the limitations inherent in classical shortrange pe libraries more sv are now theoretically accessible thanks to the recent development of long_range mate_pair mp libraries in which the two reads can be separated by several kilobases mp libraries present major_advantages over classical pe libraries because large inserts can span over large repeated regions often involved in sv formation and because mp libraries provide for the same number of reads a much higher physical coverage of the genome higher physical coverage triggers the possibility of uncovering sv that are present at low_frequency in mosaic genomes however mp libraries involve a ligation step during the library_construction which generates a large amount of chimerical read_pairs rps making those library prone to higher rates of false_positive sv in addition mp libraries suffer from wide insert_size is distributions which bring additional noise to the detection of deletion and insertion events these limitations explain why currently available sv detection_tools that were developed for short range pe libraries perform badly on mp data here we report a new pem based software called ulysses specifically_designed to detect sv in mp datasets ulysses comprises a sv scoring module which improves sv detection_accuracy in mp libraries our algorithm can annotate the full spectrum of sv including deletions del segmental_duplications dup inversions inv small insertions sins with a size smaller than the library is large_insertions ins reciprocal translocations rts and non reciprocal translocations nrt benchmarks on real mp sequencing_datasets from the human_genome on mp simulated_datasets as well as on a breast_cancer tumor mp library showed that ulysses outperforms three commonly used detection_tools gasvpro and delly for all types of sv and notably for low_frequency structural_variants in mp libraries in addition ulysses is on par with or outperforms the three other tools on pe datasets making it a highly versatile detection tool ulysses uses a pem approach that relies on the identification of groups of discordant rp to detect the full spectrum of sv this strategy also implemented in the three other detection_tools tested here is highly_sensitive but usually lacks specificity when used alone on mp data with wide is distribution and high proportion of chimerical rp to overcome_these we developed in ulysses a scoring module that statistically assesses the genuineness of all candidates sv given an explicit model for the generation of chimerical rp to deal with wide is distribution ulysses evaluates is consistency between rp and filters out groups of rp with inconsistent is to deal with high proportions of chimerical rp up to ulysses uses statistics based on the relative coverage of candidate sv these two parameters automatically adjust to the characteristics of the library such that no manual tuning is required to achieve detection with good accuracy across all types of sv as a result ulysses is the only tool that performs equally well on mp and pe data on a real mp sequencing dataset from the human_genome na ulysses achieves a better sensitivity than the other tools and by several orders_of the best precision ulysses also achieves the highest detection_accuracy on pe datasets showing that globally ulysses outperforms the other tools no matter the type of sequencing library ulysses scoring module brings a major benefit by enabling accurate detection of low coverage variants low coverage sv can correspond to rearrangements occurring in genomic_regions which are difficult to sequence and where the local coverage could dramatically drop some regions were shown to be consistently prone to low coverage alternatively low coverage sv could also result from rearrangements only present in a small subset of the cell_population this is of particular interest when analyzing samples that contain polymorphic somatic_mutations such as cancer samples the analysis of somatic_mosaicism in a breast_tumour sample revealed that ulysses achieves an efficient detection of both germline and somatic dup we also showed that ulysses is able to detect somatic_mosaicism in a blood_sample furthermore recent_insights onto somatic_mosaicism showed that subclonal cell heterogeneity is not restricted to cancer_cells and could be common between cells from a single tissue_sample given such an unsuspected level of somatic genome plasticity the availability of a sv_detection tool like ulysses with high_accuracy for rare sv is of primary importance
