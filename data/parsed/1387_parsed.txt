gene_expression diffusion maps for high_dimensional single_cell analysis of differentiation data motivation single_cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular_differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell_populations analyzing such high_dimensional single_cell data has its own statistical and computational challenges popular multi variate approaches are based on data_normalization followed by dimension_reduction and clustering to identify subgroups however in the case of cellular_differentiation we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages results here we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories we adapt this method to single_cell data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing measurement values which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high_dimensional gene_expression space we expect this output to reflect cell_differentiation trajectories where the data originates from intrinsic diffusion like dynamics starting from a pluripotent stage cells move smoothly within the tran scriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with some stochasticity along their path we demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise e g measurement noise and sampling density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single_cell quantitative_polymerase datasets i e mouse haematopoietic_stem and mouse_embryonic and an rna_seq of human pre implantation embryos we show that diffusion maps perform considerably better than principal_component and are advantageous over other techniques for non linear dimension_reduction such as t distributed stochastic neighbour embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of cells availability_and the matlab_implementation of diffusion maps for single_cell data is available at https www helmholtz muenchen de the advantages of single_cell measurements to various biological research_fields have become obvious in recent_years one example is the stem_cell studies for which population measurements fail to reveal the properties of the heterogeneous_population of cells at various stages of development purifying for a certain cell_type or synchronizing cells is experimentally challenging moreover stem_cell that have been functionally characterized often showheterogeneity in their cellular and molecular_properties to overcome these barriers on the one hand researchers conduct continuous single_cell observation using time lapse microscopy accompanied by single cell_tracking and analysis tools however this approach is still limited as the expression of very few genes typically one to three could be observed on the other hand with the advent of new technologies such as single_cell qpcr or rna_seq and flow or mass_cytometry it is now possible to measure hundreds to thousands of genes from thousands of single cells at different specific experimental time points time course experiments however several single cells measured at the same experimental time point may be at different developmental_stages therefore there is a need for computational_methods which resolve the hidden temporal_order that reflects the ordering of developmental_stages of differentiating cells while differentiation has to be regarded as a non linear continuous_process standard methods used for the analysis of high_dimensional gene_expression data are either based on linear methods such as principal_component pca and independent components analysis ica e g used as part of the monocle algorithm or they use clustering techniques that groups cells according to specific properties hierarchical clustering_methods as used in spade and t sne van_der as used in visne are examples of clustering_methods however as these methods are designed to detect discrete subpopulations they usually do not preserve the continuous trajectories of differentiation data a more recently_proposed algorithm wanderlust incorporates the nonlinearity and continuity concepts but provides a pseudotemporal ordering of cells only if the data comprise a single branch furthermore in gene_expression measurement techniques there is usually a detection_limit at which lower expression levels and nonexpressed genes are all reported at the same value suggested the use of a censoring noise model for pca whereas for the other methods it is unclear how these uncertain or missing_values are to be treated a variety of other manifold learning methods including hessian locally linear embedding hlle and isomap exist in the machine_learning community and are discussed in detail in the discussion and conclusion section here we propose diffusion maps as a tool for analyzing single cell_differentiation data diffusion maps use a distance_metric usually referred to as diffusion distance conceptually relevant to how differentiation data is generated biologically as cells follow noisy diffusion like dynamics in the course of taking several differentiation lineage paths diffusion maps preserve the nonlinear structure of data as a continuum and are robust to noise furthermore with density normalization diffusion maps are resistant to sampling density heterogeneities and can capture rare as well as abundant populations as a non linear dimension_reduction tool diffusion maps can be applied on single_cell omics_data to perform dimension_reduction and ordering of cells along the differentiation path in a single step thus providing insight to the dynamics of differentiation or any other concept with continuous dynamics in this article we bullet propose an adaptation of diffusion maps for the analysis of single_cell data which is less affected by sampling density heterogeneities and addresses the issues relating to missing_values and uncertainties of measurement bullet propose a criterion for selecting the scale parameter in a diffusion map bullet evaluate the performance of the diffusion map and its robustness to noise and density heterogeneities using a toy model that mimics the dynamics of differentiation bullet apply the adapted diffusion map algorithm to two typical qpcr and one rna_seq and show that it captures the differentiation dynamics more accurately than other algorithms in this section we evaluate the performance of the diffusion map on each of the datasets described in the methods section and compare it to the performance of two other dimension_reduction methods pca and t sne data embeddings with several other methods including ica spade kernel pca isomap and hessian locally linear embedding hlle are provided in the supplementary figures s s shows the average dimensionality hdi for balanced toy data red and imbalanced toy data black as a function of log r the balanced set exhibits two maxima the first one arises at the length_scale of the thickness of the differentiation branches which include only a few cells at this r several subpopulations form at the more densely populated stages of the steady_state the second maximum appears at a larger length_scale when several subpopulations become visible to each other and the continuous branches form we picked the r at the second maximum for visualization data visualization at the first maximum is provided in the supplementary for the imbalanced set however due to the high noise_level the first maximum vanished and we only detected one maximum which we then used for the visualization
