homology of smp domains to the tulip superfamily of lipid binding_proteins provides a structural basis for lipid exchange between er and mitochondria mitochondria must uptake some phospholipids from the endoplasmic_reticulum er for the biogenesis of their membranes they convert one of these lipids phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine which can be re exported via the er to all other cellular_membranes the mechanisms_underlying these exchanges between er and mitochondria are poorly_understood recently a complex termed ermitochondria encounter structure ermes was shown to be necessary for phospholipid exchange in budding_yeast however it is unclear whether this complex is merely an inter organelle tether or also the transporter ermes consists of four proteins mdm mdm mmm mdm and mmm three of which contain the uncharacterized smp domain common to a number of eukaryotic membrane associated proteins here we show that the smp domain belongs to the tulip superfamily of lipid hydrophobic ligand binding_domains comprising members of known structure this relationship suggests that the smp domains of the ermes complex mediate lipid exchange between er andmitochondria are organelles of endosymbiotic origin found in virtually all eukaryotic_organisms they are the main generators of adenosine_triphosphate atp the energy currency of the cell additionally they participate in a series of other important processes including apoptosis amino_acid and lipid_metabolism ironsulphur cluster assembly and the regulation of calcium levels within the cell however only a small fraction of the biopolymers required to carry out these functions is synthesized in the mitochondria the rest must be imported from the outside for example they only produce some of the phospholipids that make up their membranes whereas the remainder originates from the endoplasmic_reticulum er interestingly mitochondria not only import phospholipids but also export a particular one phosphatidylethanolamine ptdetn to the er where to whom correspondence should be addressed it is methylated to form the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine mitochondria synthesize ptdetn by decarboxylating phosphatidylserine a phospholipid imported from the er the mechanisms responsible for the influx and efflux of phospholipids are unclear unlike most organelles mitochondria do not exchange phospholipids via vesicular_transport previous_studies that this exchange takes_place via ermitochondria associations more recently identified a complex the ermitochondria encounter structure ermes that acts as a molecular tether between er and mitochondria in saccharomyces_cerevisiae and is required for efficient inter organelle phospholipid exchange however it remained_unclear whether ermes merely tethers these organelles together thereby aligning proteins that carry out the actual transport or also recruits and transfers phospholipids itself ermes comprises four proteins the mitochondrial outer_membrane mdm the putative outer_membrane mdm mmm the er resident mmm and the cytosolic mdm these proteins have also been implicated in other mitochondrial_functions including morphology maintenance and protein_import two of the ermes components mmm and mdm were reported to contain the uncharacterized smp domain synaptotagmin like mitochondrial and lipid binding_proteins which is also present in a number of other eukaryotic membrane associated proteins smp domaincontaining proteins have been classified into four broad groups c domain synaptotagmin like ph domain containing ht pdzk and mitochondrial protein_families the functions of these proteins are poorly_understood the number of structural solutions available to a polypeptide_chain is limited making protein_structures multiply convergent cheng while the combinatorial possibilities in sequence_space are nearly endless for this reason sequence_similarity is considered the primary marker of homology we thus used sensitive sequence_comparisons as implemented in hhpred to find homologs of the smp domain in a database concatenating several complete_genomes with pdb see methods section the search was seeded with the smp domain from mmm the best hits were to other proteins that have previously been described to contain this domain in addition we detected a hitherto_unknown smp domain in the ermes protein mdm this protein has been reported as an
