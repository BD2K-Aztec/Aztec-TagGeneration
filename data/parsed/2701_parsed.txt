lever software_tools for segmentation tracking and lineaging of proliferating_cells downloaded from the analysis of time lapse images showing cells dividing to produce clones of related cells is an important application in biological microscopy imaging at the temporal_resolution required to establish accurate tracking for vertebrate stem or cancer_cells often requires the use of transmitted light or phase_contrast processing these images requires automated_segmentation tracking and lineaging algorithms there is also a need for any errors in the automated processing to be easily_identified and quickly corrected we have developed lever an open_source that combines the automated_image for phase_contrast movies with an easy to use interface for validating the results and correcting any errors new and rapid development of microscope imaging_technologies have enabled biological researchers to focus on the analysis of living_cell behaviors manual_analysis of the data is difficult and time consuming behavioral changes in cells may also be subtle and not easily_identified by a human_observer these challenges necessitate the development of computational_tools cohen lever combines lineage analysis with the segmentation and tracking of individual cells this allows the quantification of individual cellular properties and their changes across generations or between cells of different fate in a twist on the usual processing flow lever uses population information from the lineage tree to refine the segmentation_results informing the number of cells in each connected component of foreground pixels and greatly reducing error_rates winter et_al lever is designed so that errors in the automated results can be easily corrected several tools provide features for lineage identification and analysis but there is a lack of tools that support phase contrast micros copy cellprofiler contains modules for tracking proliferating_cells automatically bray and carpenter the icy bioinformatics platform supports several active_contour algorithms for cell segmentation and tracking de chaumont et_al both icy and cellprofiler focus on fluorescent image data and do not support correction of lineaging or tracking results amat et_al provide a tool for semi_automated lineage analysis of d fluorescent mi croscopy this approach is similar to lever but is designed specifically for d fluorescence_images extensions to lever supporting d and d multichannel fluorescence time lapse images mankowski et_al wait et_al are under active development lever images can be imported using the integrated ome bio formats library linkert et_al or read directly fig a the segmentation preview window allows the user to compare results from several cell detection_algorithms fig b next segmentation_results are associated between frames using multitemporal association tracking mat mat has been effectively applied in a variety of applications chenouard et_al mankowski et_al winter et_al all using the same implementation tracking results are next used to form the lineage tree fig c or the tree can be specified by manually identifying mitosis events fig d
