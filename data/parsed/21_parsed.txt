abc sysbio approximate_bayesian in python with gpu support motivation the growing field of systems_biology has driven demand for flexible tools to model and simulate biological_systems two established problems in the modeling of biological_processes are model_selection and the estimation of associated parameters a number of statistical_approaches both frequentist and bayesian have been proposed to answer_these results here we present a python_package abc sysbio that implements parameter_inference and model_selection for dynamical_systems in an approximate_bayesian abc framework abc sysbio combines three algorithms abc rejection sampler abc smc for parameter_inference and abc smc for model_selection it is designed to work with models written in systems_biology sbml deterministic and stochastic models can be analyzed in abc sysbio in the last decade modeling of biochemical_systems using ordinary and stochastic_differential ode and sde has become increasingly popular as quantitative ideas have begun to pervade the biomolecular sciences inferring model_parameters and ranking alternative_models is necessary in order to gather reliable future predictions about the dynamical_behavior of such systems the problem of parameter_estimation in deterministic systems has been addressed by using local and global non linear optimization_methods as well as maximumlikelihood estimation and within a bayesian_framework an approximate_bayesian abc scheme based on sequential monte_carlo smc has been developed for likelihood free parameter_inference in deterministic and stochastic systems furthermore this approach also allows to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as for model_selection i e evidence_based ranking of alternative_models because in abc methods the evaluation of the likelihood is replaced by simulations the implementation of these methods hides some numerical and technical_problems this includes finding numerically the solution of stiff ode systems or stochastic systems described by sdes or a master_equation this requires a flexible and adaptive implementation of abc methods to address each specific model with its biochemical as well as dynamical problems here we present an extensible python_package abc sysbio which implements approximate_bayesian for parameter_inference and model_selection in deterministic and stochastic models the package supports the standard models exchange format sbml as well as user_defined models written in python in addition graphical processing unit support is provided via pycuda user_defined algorithmic parameters allow for the adaptation and tuning of the inference procedures included in the package to suit each specific dynamical_model note that in contrast to other packages for parameter_inference in a bayesian_framework e g diyabc and biobayes abc sysbio allows for parameter_inference and model_selection of both deterministic and stochastic models its implementation is flexible and user_friendly it supports important model exchange standards and is easily integrated into existing computational_pipelines and systems_biology frameworks through the flexibility of python
