automated annotation and quantification of glycans using liquid_chromatography as a common post_translational protein gly cosylation plays an important role in many biological_processes and it is known to be associated with human_diseases mass_spectrometry ms based glycomic profiling techniques have been developed to measure the abundances of glycans in complex biological_samples and applied to the discovery of putative glycan biomarkers to automate the annotation of glycomic profiles in the liquid_chromatography ms lcms data we present here a user_friendly software_tool multiglycan implemented in c on windows systems we tested multiglycan by using several glycomic profiling datasets acquired using lcms under different preparations and show that multiglycan executes fast and generates robust and reliable results availability multiglycan can be freely downloaded at http darwin informatics indiana edu multiglycan glycosylation is one of the most common post_translational of proteins in which glycans are covalently_linked to the side chain of asn i e n linked glycosylations or ser_thr i e o linked glycosylations residues the alteration of protein_glycosylation is known to be associated with various biological_processes and human_diseases because of high_sensitivity and throughput mass_spectrometry ms is routinely used to identify and quantify glycans derived from a complex biological_sample several studies show that differences in glycomic profiles in both n linked and o linked glycans are observed between disease and healthy human individuals to automate the application of glycomics to the discovery of putative glycan biomarkers several software_tools have been developed to annotate glycans in a mass_spectrum by matching the measured mass to charge values m z of glycans to theoretical_values cartoonist can assign glycans from a list of n glycan candidates derived from glycan synthetic_pathways to peaks in a matrix_assisted time of flight maldi_tof spectrum based on their masses that are calibrated using linear_models glycoworkbench provides an interface for users to draw glycan_structures that can be subsequently used to match the peaks in maldi_tof spectra both cartoonist and glycoworkbench can incorporate fragment_ions from tandem_mass ms_ms to achieve_higher confidence in glycan assignment recent advancement in glycomic profiling techniques incorporate electro spray ionization esi wherein native or derivatized glycans are chromatographically separated using hydrophilic_interaction reversed_phase or porous graphitized_carbon column before online esims analyses enhanced esi sensitivity is observed with derivatization such as permethylation of glycans which can be efficiently separated by reversedphase chromatography glycresoft is a recently_published software_tool for annotation of multiple charged glycan ions in liquid_chromatography lc esims data however glycresoft is limited to only one adduct type and requires previous data_processing using deconvolution software decon ls here we present a new tool multiglycan that can annotate a user_defined list of glycans observed in maldi_tof or lcesims data for malditof multiglycan works by matching experimental isotopic envelopes with the theoretical envelopes of glycans using a mixture_model multiglycan can also account for overlapping glycan isotopic distributions multiglycan esi which we will focus on here links together envelopes using the mass of a specified adduct or multiple including ammonia sodium potassium or other defined by the user adducts simultaneously leading to more confident glycan annotation users can tackle specific glycan targets by providing a selected set of monosaccharide compositions or conduct a blind search of glycans without specifying the compositions the program will report abundances of annotated glycans based on the total ion intensities of the glycan carrying various charges and adducts within consecutive ms scans glycans that are generated by using the synthetic_pathways of n linked glycans in human alternatively users can choose to build their own n or o linked glycan list in a comma separated values csv file for lcesims data after retrieving the ions from the input_data multiglycan matches these ions with a set of glycan masses and adducts from a built in or user_defined list in the final report multiglycan automatically merges the same glycan across consecutive ms scans multiglycan also provides an intuitive quantitation measure each output associated with a glycan is the summation of peaks with and without adducts in the whole isotope envelope in the spectrum and then summed within an elution window these results can be directly used in large_scale glycomics studies multiglycan was tested on six lcms datasets acquired from two n glycan samples released by using u of pngase f flavobacterium meningosepticum from ribonuclease b ribob human_serum glycoproteins hbs and glycoproteins from three cancer_cell respectively for details see in supplementary a dionex ultimate nano lc system dionex sunnyvale ca usa connected to a velos ltq_orbitrap hybrid mass_spectrometer thermo scientific san jose ca usa was used for permethylated n glycan analysis in this study the mass_spectrometer was operated in data dependent acquisition mode with one scan event containing a full scan ms along with a collision_induced ms_ms and another scan event containing a full scan ms m z from to in the analysis of native ribob only ms scans were acquired the complete list of glycan profiling results from ms spectra within datasets used in this analysis can be found in supplementary tables s s the program reports high mannose n glycans for both standard ribob samples as expected four of five known n glycans for the permethylated and three of five for the native sample were reported see supplementary tables s and s respectively multiglycan annotated n glycans in the hbs sample and of them matched the manually_annotated ones from an earlier study supplementary additionally n glycans annotated by multiglycan were confirmed by manual_annotation supplementary the addition of adducts enables more confident assignment to glycan compositions that otherwise are difficult to assign simply using p p m mass error for example in hbs experiment an ion at m z can be matched to two different glycan compositions within p p m viz allowing the correct assignment of hexnac hex dehex to this glycan thus clustering isotopic distributions that are linked by adducts in this manner enables accurate annotation for glycan profiling we compared multiglycan performance with glycoresoft on the hbs and three other cancer cell_line samples in hbs among the glycans that glycoresoft found were confirmed manually that are all contained in the reported glycans by multiglycan supplementaryand supplementary the remaining were not reported in the study conducted by hu and mechref in three cancer cell_line samples multiglycan also identified more glycans than glycoresoft most of which are consistent with manual_annotation also see supplementary tables s s and supplementary figs s s multiglycan allows users to run the analysis directly on the raw file moreover it can handle multiple adducts and any specified glycan list all these features make multiglycan a robust tool ready for high_throughput glycomic data analysis
