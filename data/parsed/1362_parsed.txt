gene_expression detection of differentially_expressed segments in tiling_array data motivation tiling arrays have been a mainstay of unbiased genome_wide transcriptomics over the last decade currently available approaches to identify expressed or differentially_expressed segments in tiling_array data are limited in the recovery of the underlying gene structures and require several parameters that are intensity related or partly dataset specific results we have developed tileshuffle a statistical_approach that identifies transcribed and differentially_expressed segments as significant differences from the background distribution while considering sequence specific affinity biases and cross_hybridization it avoids dataset specific parameters in order to provide better comparability of different tiling_array datasets based on different technologies or array designs tileshuffle detects highly and differentially_expressed segments in biological data with significantly_lower false_discovery under equal sensitivities than commonly used methods also it is clearly superior in the recovery of exonintron structures it further provides window z scores as a normalized and robust measure for visual_inspection availability the r package including documentation and examples is freely_available atduring the last decade tiling arrays have been a mainstay of unbiased transcriptomics e g and continue to contribute to novel findings tiling arrays have recently been applied e g in the discovery of novel long_non to the identification of spatio temporal_patterns of gene_expression to the characterization of the transcriptome in distinct developmental_stages as well as in cell_lines of drosophila_melanogaster and to the identification of a large complement of novel loci with stage_specific in caenorhabditis_elegans high_throughput methods have to whom correspondence should be addressed recently shown distinct advantages over array based_approaches however due to the availability of large tiling_array reference datasets e g from encode and a clear statistical understanding on how to model differential_expression in microarray_data tiling arrays are an important experimental approach in transcriptomics and tiling_array data analysis is a relevant topic in computational_biology one of the most widely used methods in tiling_array expression analysis was introduced by and is implemented in the tiling_array software tas in brief the local expression levels of probes are estimated by calculating the pseudomedian or hodgelehmann estimator over intensities of probes within genomic_distance of bandwidth transcribed segments are collections of expressed probes i e probes with a smoothed intensity above a given threshold with maximal genomic_distance of maxgap and minimal length of minrun tas extends the method of kampa et_al by estimating the significance of differential_expression using a wilcoxon_signed it tests for significant changes of probe intensities among states applied to local windows of given width centered around each probe hence p values for differential_expression are assigned to each probe more recently johnson et_al introduced an approach that models the expected probe behavior it is available in the tool mat originally it was designed to detect regions enriched by chip_chip but has also been applied to detect transcriptional_activity in contrast to tas mat uses a mixture_model to normalize probe intensities by estimating the expected binding_affinity on the basis of the composition and copy_number of their nucleotide_sequence on the corresponding genome to identify differentially_expressed probes the score over all normalized intensities of probes within a local window given by a bandwidth parameter is compared with a null_distribution this distribution is composed of all non overlapping window scores that can be calculated on the same array or the array in a different state during expression or differential_expression respectively hence it uses a two step approach with different background distributions to normalize the probe intensity and assess its significance within a probe centered window in the detection of differentially_expressed segments positive probes are joined if their genomic_distance is below a given maxgap parameter and segments enclosing more than minprobe probes are then reported tileprobe is a variant of mat which models residual probe effects that cannot be explained by the mat model by incorporating publicly_available datasets tileprobe has been successfully_applied to detect enriched motifs in chip_chip tiling_array data but in contrast to mat no application to detect differential_expression has been reported hat uses a hypergeometric_distribution to assess the probability to observe a specific number of probes within a window it is less sensitive but more specific than mat and cannot directly be used to detect differential_expression lastly hmmtiling models probe specific effects by a normal distribution defined for each probe individually compared with a control_group but requires many samples in order to estimate the variance for a probe correctly which may not be available for arbitrary types of tiling arrays gsam is a powerful framework for analyzing differential_response of time series tiling_array data it generalizes sam from a gene centric view to genomic_intervals in an underlying piece wise model under this model the time series is subdivided into logical segments and differential changes are analyzed on each of these segments separately gsam requires replicates which are often not available for whole_genome tiling data another method suitable to detect differential_expression on tiling_array data is tilemap which assesses the significance of each probe by averaging over moderated t statistics within a pre defined window_size propose the averaging of p values instead of test_statistics providing a more flexible framework to evaluate more complicated experimental_designs and to overcome the problem that the length of a sliding_window may not be large enough to assume normal distribution however both methods again require replicates because probe wise expression changes are assessed by hypothesis_tests an hmm based_approach was introduced bythat adaptively models tiling_array data on given annotation and subsequently predicts expression on the genomic_sequence it does not require ad_hoc parameters but is limited to expression analysis and hence cannot predict differential_expression huber and colleagues presented a powerful segmentation approach for tiling_array data which controls for probe specific effects by normalizing probe wise intensities to a reference experiment with genomic_dna recently introduced a wavelet transformation to tiling_array chip_chip data in order to discriminate regions of activity from noisy_data our aim is to use tiling_array data for identifying novel ncrnas which are differentially_expressed in response to critical signaling_pathways or cellular_processes for this purpose a data analysis method is required to i analyze differential_expression in tiling_array data for genome_wide approaches ii allow the latter without using replicate tiling_array experiments due to limitations in the availability of sample material iii identify boundaries of differentially_expressed segments sufficiently precise to allow transcript annotation and iv avoid the use of dataset specific parameters which may hamper analyzing differential_expression between arrays of different experiments in our opinion none of the state of the art methods sufficiently fulfills all these requirements here we present tileshuffle a novel tiling_array analysis approach that identifies transcribed and differentially_expressed segments in terms of significant differences from the background distribution by using a permutation test_statistic significance is assessed on minimal expected transcriptional units rather than on a single_probe level tileshuffle does not require any dataset specific parameters e g intensity related thresholds or parameters concerning collection of expressed probes this is particularly favorable since in common tiling_array experiments neither spike ins to control the false_discovery fdr as in nor sufficiently_large positive_and sets to optimally adjust these ad_hoc parameters might be available we compare tileshuffle to tas and mat in analyzing differential_expression in one human whole_genome tiling_array dataset and one spike in dataset tas is the most widely used tool in tiling_array expression analysis and although mat was originally designed for chip_chip data it was successfully_applied to detect transcriptional_activity all tileshuffle tas and mat do not require replicates to detect differentially_expressed transcripts which is in particular favorable for studies with limited material and costs at the same fdr tileshuffle achieves significantly_higher sensitivities than the other methods also it detects boundaries of differentially_expressed exons with higher_precision than tas and mat most published tiling_array studies have focused on discovery of novel expressed transcripts rather than unbiased detection of differential_expression and the choice of software for the latter task is limited variants of the maxgap minrun algorithm like tas require dataset specific cutoff parameters and mat has been developed for chip_chip data analysis and requires adapted parameters to be applicable to expression tiling_array data both hampers the applicability of these methods in different scenarios without manually inspecting a small set of expected positive regions we have presented tileshuffle a method specifically_designed for expression and differential_expression of tiling_array data it implements a statistical_approach to detect expression or differential_expression in terms of differences from the background distribution that avoids any intensity related parameters tileshuffle reduces the most dominant tiling_array biases using an affinity dependent permutation in conjunction with a windowing approach a related resampling approach has been used by which does however not consider probe affinities and is not applied to detection of differential_expression we compared tileshuffle tas and mat in two different test scenarios in the cell_cycle dataset where a custom array was used for validiation tileshuffle achieved significantly_lower false_discovery under equal sensitivities this test scenario has the advantages of building on a biologically_meaningful experiment with the associated noise in expression signals and transcriptome complexity and of calculating sensitivity_and on a large number of intervals however the custom array data has an fdr itself which is better controlled and significantly_lower than for the tiling_array but still providing a surrogate for a true reference in the second scenario the algorithms are compared using a spike in dataset the differences between the three algorithms are smaller than in the previous scenario tileshuffle however is the only one obtaining sensitivities the spike in experiment has the advantage of a clear definition of positve and negative intervals for calculating sensitivity and specificty however though large for a spikein experiment differentially_expressed elements is a small number compared with the cell_cycle experiment the noise is low the basal expression_level is already high and a fold differential_expression is a strong effect in biological_experiments the scenario is thus rather artificial apart from the rocs tileshuffle clearly outmatches tas and mat in the recovery of transcript structures by identifying the intronexon structure more accurately however tileshuffle fails to detect very short exons because of the windowing approach additionally tileshuffle can incorporate replicate experiments and supports input_data as custom formatted files and hence is not dependent on any technology or tiling_array design and can also be applied to chip_chip data by selecting a larger window_size the required computation time of tileshuffle is considerably_higher than for tas and mat however it is negligible compared with efforts for the genome_wide tiling_array experiment and thus does not constitute a bottleneck in the analysis work flow
