genipe an automated genome_wide imputation pipeline with automatic reporting and statistical_tools genotype_imputation is now commonly performed following genome_wide genotyping experiments imputation increases the density of analyzed genotypes in the dataset enabling fine_mapping across the genome however the process of imputation using the most recent publicly_available reference datasets can require considerable computation power and the management of hundreds of large intermediate files we have developed genipe a complete genome_wide imput ation pipeline which includes automatic reporting imputed data indexing and management and a suite of statistical_tests for imputed data commonly used in genetic_epidemiology sequence_kernel cox_proportional for survival analysis and linear_mixed for repeated_measurements in longitudinal_studies availability_and the genipe package is an open_source python software and is freely_available use cc by nc at https github com pgxcentre genipe documentation and tutorials are available atgenome wide association studies gwas are usually performed on datasets containing over million genetic_markers those markers are typed using high_throughput genotyping_arrays that target a small fraction of all possible genetic_variants imputation is a lowcost and popular statistical_method to infer genotypic information at up to million known genetic_variants including single_nucleotide and insertions_deletions imputation is often used to boost statistical_power and it can be used to infer missing_data and standardize variant sets for meta_analysis large sequencing_projects spanning multiple human populations greatly_increase the availability and quality of public imputation panels but the statistical_methods needed for haplotype_phasing and imputation at the genome_wide level are computationally_intensive in order to streamline this process we have developed a genomewide imputation pipeline that automates all necessary computational steps including quality_control and reporting while providing support for high_performance environments and statistical_tests for imputed data the pipelines documentation provides a typical imputation analysis tutorial along with required files those files includes a dataset of markers genotyped on hapmap samples using the genomes phase reference_panels the dataset was imputed on two different systems a computing server nodes of intelv r xeonv r e cpus ghz g of ram per node using the drmaa api for automatic task submission and a desktop computer intelv r core tm i cpu ghz g of ram using a maximum of simultaneous tasks the pipeline took a total of h on the computing server including a waiting_period of h in queue using a maximum of four simultaneous tasks the pipeline took h to complete on the desktop computer although online imputation pipeline exists e g the michigan imputation server that uses minimac https imputationserver sph umich edu and the sanger imputation service that uses pbwt https imputation sanger ac uk genipe is advantageous for the users who cannot upload genotypic data on an off site server for ethical or legal restrictions also as public servers gain in popularity the high workload can add significant time to the imputation analysis queue time the genipe pipeline can be efficiently executed on a local high_performance server or on a single desktop computer finally genipe provides a unified interface to statistical_analysis packages that did not have existing_tools to automate the use of dosage data e g linear_mixed from statsmodels cox_proportional from lifelines and skat
