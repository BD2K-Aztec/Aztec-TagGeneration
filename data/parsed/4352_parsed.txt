spatial quantification and classification of skin response following perturbation using organotypic skin cultures motivation for a mechanistic_understanding of skin and its response to an induced perturbation systems_biology is gaining_increasing unfortunately quantitative and spatial expression data for skin like for most other tissues are almost not available results integrating organotypic skin cultures whole slide scanning and subsequent image_processing provides bioinformatics with a novel source of spatial expression data we here used this approach to quantitatively describe the effect of treating organotypic skin cultures with sodium_dodecyl in a non corrosive concentration we first measured the differentiation related spatial expression gradient of heat_shock in a time series of up to h secondly a multi_dimensional tissue classifier for predicting skin_irritation was developed based on abstract features of these profiles we obtained a high_specificity of and a sensitivity of compared with manual classification our results demonstrate that the integration of tissue_cultures whole slide scanning and image_processing is well suited for both the standardized data_acquisition for systems biological_tissue models and a highly_robust classification of tissue responses the human_body is shielded against outside influences by the skin exhibiting a carefully regulated equilibrium of cell_proliferation differentiation and cell_death even though this homeostasis guarantees a monthly self_renewal the exposition to harmful substances can lead to severe perturbations of the skin the skin therefore is a main target in toxicity_testing and drug_development systems_biology is gaining_increasing in these areas offering a novel approach to cope with the complexity of the skin as a biological system to whom correspondence should be addressed besides mimicking the physiologic systems processes the potential of respective computational_models lies in the prediction of skin response following e g a chemical_exposure for identifying those system elements and pathways mainly contributing to the observed system response a standardized experimental_setup is necessary on the single_cell level high_content hcs based on cell_lines or strains allows the quantification of phenotypic changes after perturbation by automated fluorescence_microscopy and subsequent image_analysis however approaches addressing individual cells do not reflect the spatial complexity of the human_skin with its stratified organization for example substances applied to the surface of normal_skin have to pass the barrier built by the stratum_corneum and the perturbation induced is buffered by robust homeostatic molecular_networks leading to differentiationdependent expression changes therefore predictions based on these simple single_cell model_assumptions are not necessarily transferable to human_skin according to our best knowledge up to now there is no suitable data_acquisition method for the standardized and automated study of spatial skin response after perturbation recently automated whole slide scanners virtual microscopy became available offering the opportunity to analyze whole tissue_sections in high_throughput thus the combination of whole slide scanners with industrially standardized tissue_cultures could open up a novel way for the systematic characterization of perturbations induced to the human_skin industrially manufactured organotypic skin cultures offer a well organized reproducible spatial morphology and could therefore serve as a standardized source for spatial organized data such full thickness models are composed of epidermal_keratinocytes growing air exposed on a matrix of native collagen_type containing viable fibroblasts a perturbation inflicted upon such a skin tissue_culture will depending on its strength alter tissue_homeostasis hallmarked by a specific spatial gene and proteinexpression we have shown previously how such differentiationdependent protein expression can be measured by quantitative spatial profiles qsps based on automated_image of native skin sections stained by indirect_immunofluorescence we therefore set out to develop a novel data generation pipeline for systems_biology experiments comprised of perturbing a standardized skin tissue_culture histological sectioning immunofluorescence_staining whole slide scanning and automatedfor the quantification of the treatment effect the median of all biomarker profiles for each treatment mode e g h sds was calculated based on these profiles the five presented profile features were determined except for the nucleiintensity which is not extracted from the profiles but directly from the section images shows the change of the starting_point of expression depending on time as well as treatment mode se ranges between sds and none relative_distance the observation that most of the expression changes occurred during relative_distance motivated the definition of the features a and nucleiintensity in the time dependent alterations of the individual expression_profile features observed in sds treated tissue_cultures are compared to none cultures the strongest change is noticeable in the feature a at a treatment duration of h the area increases to fold of the area measured in none cultures but also se drops to of the starting_point in none cultures however we also measured a change in pbs treated cultures comparing sds treated cultures to pbs treated cultures discovers a fold_change in profileexpressionarea at h treatment duration for the classification of single cultures the profiles of all sub images belonging to one culture were averaged based on the resulting median profile the culture features were calculated the feature subset yielding the minimal classification error after translation into the mahalanobis_distance consists of the four features se a se a and a rel the calculated mahalanobis_distance for each culture is shown in the average threshold chosen for classification is illustrated as a horizontal in that diagram the bars of automatically irritated classified cultures are striped and those manually classified by visual_inspection are coloured in red the validation of the classification procedure with the leave one outmethod yielded a classification error of an average specificity of and a sensitivity of compared with manual classification see exemplary roc_curve in we here presented an approach for the quantitative capturing and subsequent classification of tissue response following substanceinduced perturbations the approach comprises standardized skin tissue_cultures whole slide scanning automated image_processing and classification we consider such a system ideally_suited for the quantitative toxicological study of chemicals since chemicals of similar mechanisms of toxicity are expected to show similar phenotypic_effects the endpoints of this method also qualify for classification in contrast to hcs allowing the spatial quantification of molecules in single_cell strains or cultures our approach addresses the question of how a full tissue with its complex structure quantitatively reacts to perturbations besides the spatial layering a skin culture also exhibits a barrier formed by the stratum_corneum that is not present in cell strains substances applied to the surface of normal_skin have to pass this barrier before perturbations can be induced at all common in vitro methods for skin_irritation testing like the mtt dimethylthiazol_yl diphenyltetrazolium_bromide test measure inside a homogenate thus loosing all spatial_information furthermore the irritative effect is correlated to the degree of cellular destruction this makes these methods blind for early and subtle modifications of the tissue before corrosion sets in therefore we here presented an approach based on measuring the spatial and quantitative change of protein expression in intact immunofluorescence stained tissue_sections recording modifications at the protein level guarantees a certain expression stability as not being as transient as mrna_expression changes based on the determined qsps a multi parametrical and automatic classifier was built assigning to each tissue_culture the status irritated or non irritated in our experimental_setting tissue_cultures were treated for different time durations with the standard irritant sds the visual_inspection of the cultures identified a considerable change in hsp_expression premature planar and increased after h of treatment this change is clearly reflected in the qsps when measuring marker intensity against the normalized distance to basal_lamina to quantify such changes in the qsps we presented five different features extracted from the profiles se a se a a rel and nucleiintensity the premature expression is reflected in an early increase of the qsp with se we were able to determine the onset of expression the increase of total expression is manifested in an increase of the qsps integral i e the area below the profile we therefore developed features quantifying the profiles area a se a a rel the determination of se for all modes of treatment revealed that most changes occur between and relative_distance hence the features a and nucleiintensity focus on this part of the qsp the one by one comparison of all features identified a as the feature with the most prominent changes after treatment however the feature subset selection for classification by first translating the multi_dimensional problem into the mahalanobis_distance and then minimizing the classification error in a leave_one validation revealed an optimal subset consisting of se a se a and a rel interestingly the feature nucleiintensity reflecting the translocation of hsp into the nuclei as described in literature did not improve the classification result however also the visual_inspection of the stained_sections did not reveal a noticeable translocation the increase during treatment mainly arises from the general expression increase in the area between and relative_distance based on the selected feature subset we were able to reproduce the manual classification with our automatic classification by the mahalanobis_distance to none cultures we report a specificity of and a sensitivity of compared with the manual classification results based on the visually observed phenotype we therefore conclude that the presented features are well suited for the characterization of the tissues response the classification result in conjunction with the good confidence_intervals of the calculated profiles argues for a well reproducible tissue response we showed that the observed spatial changes could be described by profile features allowing a precise classification this indicates a highly suitable method for a standardized data_acquisition in the context of skin_irritation to further increase the accuracy of our profiling_method a staining unambiguously delineating the epithelium would be preferable to improve tissue segmentation in the presented method thepage
