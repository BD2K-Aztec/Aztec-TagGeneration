incorporating peak grouping information for alignment of multiple liquid_chromatography datasets motivation the combination of liquid_chromatography lc_ms has been widely used for large_scale comparative_studies in systems_biology including proteomics glyco mics and metabolomics in almost all experimental_design it is necessary to compare chromato grams across biological or technical_replicates and across sample groups central to this is the peak alignment step which is one of the most important but challenging preprocessing_steps existing alignment tools do not take into account the structural dependencies between related peaks that coelute and are derived from the same metabolite or peptide we propose a direct matching peak alignment_method for lc_ms data that incorporates related peaks information within each lc_ms run and investigate its effect on alignment performance across runs the groupings of related peaks necessary for our method can be obtained from any peak clustering method and are built into a pair_wise peak similarity_score function the similarity_score matrix produced is used by an approximation algorithm for the weighted matching problem to produce the actual alignment result results we demonstrate that related peak information can improve alignment performance the performance is evaluated on a set of benchmark_datasets where our method performs competitively compared to other popular alignment tools availability the proposed alignment_method has been implemented as a stand alone application in python available for download at http github com joewandy peak grouping alignment liquid_chromatography coupled to mass_spectrometry lc_ms is one of the most widely used techniques in untargeted proteomic and metabolomic_studies in proteomic or metabolomic experiments the input sample to the lc_ms instrument is a complex_mixture of peptides or metabolites compounds in the mixture are separated in time through liquid_chromatography lc and subjected to mass_spectrometry ms analysis the result of this process is a mass chromatogram an intensity surface across the mass to charge ratio m z and retention time rt dimensions from this surface it is possible to extract individual peaks corresponding to ions in the mass_spectrometry in this v c the author published_by we conducted several experiments on the proteomic metabolomic and glycomic datasets each designed to test a different aspect of alignment tools performance details on the parameter optimizations for evaluated tools are provided in the supplementary document
