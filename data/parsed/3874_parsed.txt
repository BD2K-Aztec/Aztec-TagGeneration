genetics_and rapid detection of expanded short_tandem in personal_genomics using hybrid sequencing motivation long expansions of short_tandem strs i e dna_repeats of nt are associated with some genetic_diseases cost efficient high_throughput can quickly produce billions of short_reads that would be useful for uncovering disease associated strs however enumerating strs in short_reads remains_largely because of the difficulty in elucidating strs much longer than bp the typical length of short_reads results we propose ab_initio procedures for sensing and locating long strs promptly by using the frequency distribution of all strs and paired_end information we validated the reproducibility of this method using biological_replicates and used it to locate an str associated with a brain disease sca subsequently we sequenced this str site in sca samples using smrt tm sequen_cing pacific_biosciences determined kb sequences at nucleotide_resolution and revealed that tggaa and taaaatagaa repeat expansions determined the instability of the repeat expansions associated with sca our method could also identify common strs aaag and aaaag repeat expansions which are remarkably expanded at four positions in an sca sample this is the first proposed method for rapidly finding disease associated long strs in personal genomes using hybrid sequen_cing of short and long_reads availability_and our trhist software is available at http trhist many genetic_disorders are caused by or associated with short_tandem strs repetitive_elements of nt regarding the mechanism underlying the phenomenon of repeat expansion unusual structural_features of repeat containing regions that affect cellular replication repair and recombination are thought to induce frequent replication slippage thereby expanding repeats strs have been found in a variety of genomic_regions huntingtons disease is associated with expansion of the triplet_repeat cag n polyglutamine runs in proteins in the coding_region of huntingtin the huntingtons disease collaborative_research where n in normal samples n in intermediate cases n in reduced penetrance and n in full penetrance spinal and bulbar muscular_atrophy is also associated with cag_repeats in one exon in addition to exons strs have been observed in a variety of genomic_regions such as untranslated_regions utrs introns and promoters fragile_x is associated with cgg_repeat in the utr and myotonic_dystrophy type_dm with ctg repeat in the utr in introns spinocerebellar_ataxia sca is associated with attct repeat myotonic_dystrophy type_dm with cctg repeat amyotrophic_lateral frontotemporal_dementia als ftd with ggggcc repeat and sca with ggcctg repeat consequently whole_genome capable of observing non exonic_regions is required to characterize strs peculiar to a personal genome several expanded repeats in rna such as cug ccug cag cgg auucu and uggaa are associated with hereditary diseases and are known to accumulate in nuclear rna foci in which several proteins are sequestrated in the process of foci formation for a review see these rna foci are thought to have a negative effect on host_cells leading to disorders in cellular_pathways to search personal genomes for strs the most cost efficient way would be to resequence an entire personal genome and to collect billions of short_reads of bp in length using available high_throughput sequencers however the infeasibility of obtaining longer_reads at reasonable cost might lead to the failure to detect important strs because expandable repeats associated with diseases can sometimes be quite long e g attct n n in sca and cctg n n in dm and are much longer than bp the typical length of short_reads to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work making the identification and location of long strs in a personal genome non trivial another serious problem is that strs have several variants with many mutations the spontaneous mutation_rate of strs to in the human y chromosome is far higher than the rate of copy_number to and the reported average rate of de_novo single nucleotide variation sd and the ultrahigh mutation_rate of strs is thought to be a major force driving genetic_variation producing a variety of strs with differences often specific to personal genomes therefore detecting various strs by processing billions of short raw_reads is fundamental to the analysis of personal genomes several software programs list strs such as tandem_repeat finder mreps atrhunter imex and t reks for a recent review that compares these programs see however these conventional programs are designed to retrieve strs from nearly complete or draft long genomes and are not intended for processing billions of short_reads in a reasonable amount of time another problem involved in handling short_reads is the difficulty of determining the accurate positions of strs in the genome because reads filled with strs are not included in the genome or often map to multiple_locations the problem is solvable in some cases when a flanking region around an str in a read is long enough to map to a unique position to resolve these special cases gymrek et_al developed the program lobstr which improves the efficiency of this process by selecting candidate_regions harboring strs in the human_genome owing to severe restrictions in potential str regions however we might overlook novel strs hidden in numerous short_reads because known strs associated with diseases are frequently much longer than bp the typical length of short_reads produced by highthroughput sequencers here we propose a new cost efficient method for calculating a comprehensive collection of strs that are longer than short_reads by inspecting the frequency distribution of strs in short_reads to approximate the locations of such strs we use paired_end to facilitate locating the opposite end of the read with the focal str in a pair thereby narrowing down the location of the focal str finally we present a statistical_procedure for selecting strs that are significantly expanded in the case sample here we demonstrate the utility of an ab_initio procedure for sensing locating and sequencing strs that are significantly expanded in the case sample locating candidate str positions select positions where str occurrences are expanded significantly in the case sample in the following manner locate occurrences of each candidate str in both the case and control samples by anchoring paired_end such that one end has a bp occurrence of the str and the other end maps to a unique position group paired_end anchored in a neighborhood within bp the average insert_size of paired_end into one cluster in each cluster generate the frequency distribution of str occurrences according to their lengths ranging from to bp if an str in the cluster is significantly_longer than bp the frequency of bp occurrences in reads denoted by f becomes significantly_greater than the frequencies of those shorter than bp we test this hypothesis statistically by checking if f is an outlier in the frequency distribution with the smirnovgrubbs test we calculate the t score f where and are the mean and standard_deviation of the frequency distribution respectively and obtain the probability p value that the t score exceeds a threshold according to the smirnovgrubbs test for example the p when the t score is we consider million non overlapping regions of length_bp the average insert_size of paired_end in the human_genome we perform multiple_hypothesis using the bonferroni_correction to test if each bp region has a significant str expansion in the case sample at a significance_level of divided by million i e we select positions such that p in the case sample but no bp str occurrences are present in any of the control samples we can relax the condition to consider more candidates with less evidence sequencing candidate str positions smrt tm sequencing of expanded strs is performed using information on the boundaries of individual str positions strs in personal genomes remain largely_uncharacterized we proposed a novel method for listing long approximate strs with mutations in personal genomes using a massive number of short_reads of length_bp here we discuss some situations in which detecting a long expansion of strs specific to disease samples is inherently problematic as genomic_regions of gc_content are difficult to cover with an ample number of illumina_reads our method is unlikely to detect long expansions ofoccurrences in one of sca na na or na for example the arrow in the second lowest row shows that the aaaatagaat repeat is expanded only in sca our ab_initio procedure analyzes this bar chart and selects strs that are significantly abundant in the case sample e g sca but absent in all of the control samples the bar chart is also useful for confirming the abundance of aatgg and aaccct repeats equivalent to the gggtta repeat where the former and latter motifs are known to be enriched in centromeres and telomeres respectively b frequency distributions of the aaaatagaat repeat sca has many bp occurrences whereas no occurrences of length_bp were observed in na na and na supplementary massive numbers of long expansions of these strs can be found in any sample we also presented an ab_initio procedure for detecting significant expansions of strs in case samples that are absent in control samples via comparisons between the frequency distributions of strs in case and control samples we demonstrated the potential_applicability of this method using three publicly_available control samples to exploit this approach however constructing a large_scale database of the frequency distributions of strs collected from a number of control samples is necessary the variety of expanded strs of length kb in disease remains_unexplored also examining whether expansions of strs are more pronounced in germline and somatic_cells would be intriguing thus after locating strs sequencing expanded strs is a promising direction of study for this purpose smrt tm sequencing enables the sequencing dna_fragments averaging kb_long as of using smrt tm sequencing we were able to determine a divergent set of kb str sequences in sca samples showing the instability of str expansions analysis of the stability of str expansionsthe right boundary of the insertion could be identified using paired_end with aaaatagaat repeats at their left ends and uniquely_mapped at their right ends the lower bar illustrates the reference_genome hg with an aaaat repeat b a form of expanded repeat associated with sca samples the values of i j l and m vary in the individual sca samples c we determined the values of i j l and m in sca samples using smrt tm sequencing this shows that of the repeat expansion are tagaa j and taaaa tagaa sizes of the common strs aaag n and aaaag n at four genomic positions in the sca sample and reference_genome note that individual str occurrences are significantly expanded in the sca sample the pcr_primers used for amplifying individual regions and the sequences of amplicons can be found in supplementary rapid detection of expanded short_tandem in germline and somatic_cells of a specific disease might eventually_lead the recognition of a functional role of strs in the near future the typical lengths of short_reads in the majority of commercial sequencers should increase to bases our method is ready to process longer_reads in a straightforward manner furthermore our method was designed so that it could output strs of repeat_units of any length and we presented an illustrative case in which detecting strs of a base repeat_unit from an sca sample was essential our program will serve as a valuable_tool for discovering unknown strs in a variety of diseases even with future advances in sequencing_technology
