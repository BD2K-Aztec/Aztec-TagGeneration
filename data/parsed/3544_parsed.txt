phylogenetic_analysis of multiprobe fluorescence_in data from tumor_cell motivation development and progression of solid_tumors can be attributed to a process of mutations which typically includes changes in the number of copies of genes or genomic_regions although comparisons of cells within single tumors show extensive heterogeneity recurring features of their evolutionary_process may be discerned by comparing multiple regions or cells of a tumor a useful source of data for studying likely progression of individual tumors is fluorescence_in fish which allows one to count copy_numbers of several genes in hundreds of single cells novel algorithms for interpreting such data phylogenetically are needed however to reconstruct likely evolutionary_trajectories from states of single cells and facilitate analysis of tumor evolution results in this article we develop phylogenetic_methods to infer likely models of tumor_progression using fish copy_number data and apply them to a study of fish data from two cancer_types statistical_analyses of topological characteristics of the tree based model provide insights into likely tumor_progression pathways consistent with the prior literature furthermore tree statistics from the resulting phyloge nies can be used as features for prediction_methods this results in improved accuracy relative to unstructured gene_copy data at predicting tumor state and future metastasis availability source_code for software that does fish tree building fishtrees and the data on cervical and breast_cancer examined hererecent studies of genetic_variation in solid_tumors have revealed massive intratumor_heterogeneity in the spectrum of genomic changes within single tumors these observations suggest the importance of understanding cell to cell variability but profiling large_numbers of single cells and building coherent models of their evolution remain challenging problems fluoresence in situ_hybridization fish is a technique that can be used to count the copy_number of dna_probes for specific genes or chromosomal_regions that has proven useful in studying cancer gene gains_and are common in solid_tumors and fish provides a practical and reliable method for monitoring such changes in large_numbers of individual cells from single tumors fish is even more useful when one uses multiple colors to monitor multiple genes simultaneously in this article we developed new methods to model and analyze the progression of copy_number changes as measured by multi color fish our methods include analysis of multiple samples from the same patient typically from different cancer_stages we applied the new methods to published_data on cervical_cancer with four gene_probes and breast_cancer with eight gene_probes the data for each sample are presented as a matrix where each column is one of the probes and each row is a cell_count pattern of four probe counts such as or eight counts for breast_cancer and the number of cells matching that pattern a normal cell has the count pattern of all s both datasets include paired_samples from an earlier stage and a later stage in the same patient it is of interest to study cervical and breast_cancer as we do because the number of cases of cervical_cancer and breast_cancer diagnosed early has increased owing to pap_smears and mammograms respectively early_diagnosis is important because lymph_node is one of the best predictors of poor_outcome paradoxically it has been shown statistically that early_diagnosis of breast_cancer has not led to a substantial decrease in deaths because most of the cancers diagnosed early would not progress to be life_threatening if left_untreated these are large_scale studies that do not address the benefits of early detection in individual cases therefore a consistent explanation of these findings is that earlier_detection could be of clinical value if there were a better understanding of tumor evolution to help identify the early_stage cancers likely to progress to dangerous forms the problem of modeling tumor_progression has been studied by a variety of techniques and using different kinds of tumor data several of these methods used techniques from the area of phylogenetics reviewed by because of the insight that tumor_genomes to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms

please_contact permissions_oup com evolve most prior studies have used either comparative_genome or sequencing of cell_populations which have the advantage that one can do genome_wide analysis but the disadvantage that the input_data are explicitly or implicitly averaged over many cells of the same tumor other data types can offer distinct advantages such as the microsatellite data used by which can allow some inference of useful population_genetic parameters generally difficult to assess with tumor data fish is the only currently available reliable technique that allows measurements on enough individual cells to model the evolution of substantial intratumor_heterogeneity the disadvantage of fish is that it uses only a small number of preselected markers only two of the previous_studies analyzed fish data these studies were limited either to two probes or to three probes and coarsely distinguishing only loss copy_number neutral copy_number and gain copy_number we address a need for new methods capable of handling the larger numbers of cells and probes in recent fish datasets more specifically we aim to develop a theoretical_foundation for efficient handling of large copy_number datasets toward this goal we develop theory and algorithms for a model of tumor_progression driven by gains_and associated with fish probes our methods handle in principle any number of probes and any range of copy_numbers through max copy default the use of max copy limits the combinatorial search and hence running time of our methods on inputs where the measured copy_numbers exceed this limit the work is intended to establish a framework capable of giving useful tree inferences on state of the art fish data which might be extended in future work to handle even harder problem instances and more realistic models of tumor evolution our contributions include the following reducing a model of the problem of modeling progression of fish probe cell_count patterns to the rectilinear steiner minimum tree rsmt problem and thus bringing prior theory on the rsmt problem to bear on the fish phylogeny problem design and implementation of an exponential time exact method and a polynomial time heuristic_method to construct trees modeling the progression of cell_count patterns mathematical proof and software implementation of a new inequality that speeds up the rsmt based computation definition and evaluation of new test_statistics based on the trees computed by our methods these test_statistics give novel insight into the selective_pressures in tumor_progression compared with test_statistics derived from the cell_count patterns alone definition and evaluation of features based on the tree structures that can be used with machine_learning to classify the tumors for example we show improved effectiveness at distinguishing the cervical_tumors that metastasize from those that do not in this section we present the results of experiments to evaluate the utility of tumor phylogeny inference for understanding the developmental_processes of these tumor_types we also explore the prognostic value of tumor phylogenies by using them to derive features for classification experiments and comparing to features that do not rely on tree_inference for these experiments we built tumor_progression trees of the cc and bc data using the ploidyless heuristic approach to phylogenetic_inference described in methods shows representative examples of tumor_progression trees from the cc dataset shows a tree inferred from the primary_tumor of patient of the cc dataset shows the tree for the paired metastatic sample from patient the primary stage tree has more nodes and is more balanced and broader in shape compared with the metastatic stage tree the distinct topologies of the trees may indicate the fact that cells residing in primary and metastatic_sites of the tumor face different selective_pressures supplementary figures s and s show examples of trees inferred from a dcis sample and an idc sample of a patient with id of the bc dataset the complete set of trees from the cc and bc patients is provided in supplementary section s
