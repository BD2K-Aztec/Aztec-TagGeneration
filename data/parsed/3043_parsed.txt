gene_expression modeling dynamic functional relationship networks and application to ex_vivo human erythroid_differentiation motivation functional relationship networks which summarize the probability of co functionality between any two genes in the genome could complement the reductionist focus of modern biology for understanding diverse_biological in an organism one major_limitation of the current networks is that they are static while one might expect functional_relationships to consistently reprogram during the differentiation of a cell_lineage to address this potential limitation we developed a novel algorithm that leverages both differentiation stage_specific data and large_scale heterogeneous functional genomic_data to model such dynamic changes we then applied this algorithm to the time course rna_seq we collected for ex_vivo human erythroid cell_differentiation results through computational cross_validation and literature validation we show that the resulting networks correctly predict the de activated functional_connections between genes during erythro poiesis we identified known critical genes such as hbd and gata and functional_connections during erythropoiesis using these dynamic networks while the traditional static network was not able to provide such information furthermore by comparing the static and the dynamic networks we identified novel genes such as osbp and pdzk ip that are potential drivers of erythroid cell_differentiation this novel method of modeling dynamic networks is applicable to other differentiation_processes where time course genome_scale expression data are available and should assist in generating greater understanding of the functional dynamics at play across the genome during development availability_and the network described in this article is available at http guanlab ccmb functional relationship networks offer a potentially critical complement to the reductionist focus of modern biology and to our ability to understand and interpret diverse_biological systematically in an organism these networks are modeled through integrating heterogeneous large_scale genomic_data and they represent the probability of co functionality between any two genes in the genome mining these networks can help us discover gene_functions and identify disease phenotype associated genes we have previously modeled the global functional relationship network for the mouse and developed the algorithm that can systematically model tissue_specific networks in mammalian_systems current network models including the ones we previously_established have one major_limitation a single network is generated without considering the dynamic changes of functional_connections which might be expected to change during the differentiation of any given cell_lineage it should be anticipated that functional_connections might consistently evolve which would allow different cell_fates to arise from the same genetic_background it has been widely_accepted and modeled that at the co expression physical_interaction and pathway levels interactions between genes are constantly_changing motivated by our recently_developed method to infer dynamic signaling_network responses and to classify cell lineage_specific expression_patterns we extend our algorithm to integrate heterogeneous datasets for predicting the dynamic co functionality relationships across a differentiation process to capture such dynamics in functional_connections here we introduce the concept of transitional functional relationship networks which are intended to reveal the activated and deactivated functional_relationships between any two stages distinguishable during cell_lineage differentiation the assumption behind this algorithm is that an existing connection in the stationary network is likely to be activated if both members of a pair of genes become upregulated and vice_versa however unlike most of the existing_methods that directly map upregulated downregulated genes to the stationary network we reweigh diverse genomic_datasets for their relevance to the de activated to whom correspondence should be addressed and weighted correlation network_analysis wgcna this algorithm has the following benefits systematics in developmental_biology is an exciting emerging field which uses large_scale genomic_data to understand the complexity of developmental_processes in this study we developed a new algorithm that models the dynamic functional_relationships during a differentiation process through large_scale data_integration such networks describe the dependency of functional_relationships between two time points this novel model for transitional networks is an advance over our previous global context specific and tissue_specific networks as well as other previously_established functional_networks all of which are static in nature these transitional networks reveal functional_relationships and genes important to erythroid cell_differentiation and function which are not shown in the static networks through the application of bayesian integration the approach described here managed to combine diverse genomic_datasets while datasets related to the target stage were assigned stronger weights the key element determining bayesian_classifier the gold_standard pairs is refined to a group of gene_pairs that are either upregulated or downregulated together across the various developmental_stages hence data from relevant contexts are highly weighted and trusted while irrelevant or inaccurate data are weighted more slightly and less regarded the results demonstrated that the dynamic stage specific network algorithm could precisely reveal functional_relationships that were masked in analysis of the static networks the genes that changed most were also confirmed to be highly related to the differentiation process we expect that this same generic algorithm can be readily applied to other developmental or differentiation_processes given appropriate time course expression data for example when predicting regulatory_networks classical co expressionbased analyses take a single time course dataset as its only input these approaches are likely to be sensitive to noise and require a considerable number of different time points in a single dataset compared with classical approaches these transitional networks make use of the highly_specific time course dataset together with thousands of public datasets we expect that combining the transitional network together with classical co expression networks should improve the performance of these networks in identifying regulatory_elements funding this work is supported by
