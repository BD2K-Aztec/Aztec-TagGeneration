gene_expression identifying dispersed epigenomic domains from chip_seq motivation post_translational to histones have several well known associations with regulation of gene_expression while some modifications appear concentrated narrowly covering promoters or enhancers others are dispersed as epigenomic domains these domains mark contiguous regions sharing an epigenomic property such as actively_transcribed or poised genes or heterochromatically silenced regions while high_throughput methods like chip_seq have led to a flood of high_quality data about these epigenomic domains there remain_important analysis problems that are not adequately solved by current analysis tools results we present the rseg method for identifying epigenomic domains from chip_seq for histone_modifications in contrast with other methods emphasizing the locations of peaks in read density_profiles our method identifies the boundaries of domains rseg is also able to incorporate a control sample and find genomic_regions with differential histone_modifications between two samples availability rseg including source_code is freely_available atpost translational modifications to histone_tails including methylation and acetylaytion have been associated with important regulatory_roles in cell_differentiation and disease development the application of chip_seq to histone_modification study has proved very useful for understanding the genomic landscape of histone_modifications certain histone_modifications are tightly concentrated covering a few hundred base_pairs for example h_k is usually associated with active promoters and occurs only at nucleosomes close to transcription_start tsss on the other hand many histone_modifications are diffuse and occupy large regions ranging from thousands to several millions of base_pairs a well known example h_k is associated with active gene_expression and often spans the whole gene body reflected in chip_seq the signals of these histone_modifications are enriched over large regions but lack well defined peaks it is worth pointing out that the property of being diffuse is matter of degrees besides the modification frequency the modification profile over a region is also affected by nucleosome to whom correspondence should be addressed densities and the strength of nucleosome_positioning by visual_inspection of read density_profiles we found that h bk me h_k h_k h_k h_k h_k and h r me show similar diffuse profiles there are several general questions about dispersed epigenomic domains that remain_unanswered many of these questions center around how these domains are established and maintained one critical step in answering these questions is to accurately locate the boundaries of these domains however most of existing_methods for chip_seq analysis were originally designed for identifying transcription_factor these focus on locating highly concentrated peaks and are inappropriate for identifying domains of dispersed histone_modification marks moreover the quality of peak analysis is measured in terms of sensitivity_and of peak_calling accuracy along with how narrow the peaks are precision often determined by the underlying platform but for diffuse histone_modifications significant peaks are usually lacking and often the utility of identifying domains depends on how clearly the boundaries are located
