genome_analysis the biological reference repository bior a rapid and flexible system for genomics annotation motivation the biological reference repository bior is a toolkit for annotating variants bior stores public and user specific annotation sources in indexed json encoded flat files catalogs the bior toolkit provides the functionality to combine and retrieve annotation from these catalogs via the command_line several catalogs from commonly used annotation sources and instructions for creating user specific catalogs are provided commands from the toolkit can be combined with other unix commands for advanced annotation processing we also provide instructions for the development of custom annotation_pipelines availability_and the package is implemented_in and makes use of external tools written in java and perl the toolkit can be executed on mac os xnext generation sequencing ngs_technology platforms are providing unprecedented_opportunities to study genomic_variants that are associated with clinical conditions and drug response using ngs_technologies researchers can identify mutations associated with rare_diseases characterize somatic variants in tumor for diagnostic or prognostic purpose or guide therapeutic treatment although the large amount of data produced by ngs_platforms and the time to process them are largely being addressed by expanding the it infrastructure high_performance and code optimization the annotation_process needed to interpret the thousands of variants found in individual_genomes is still a challenging_task the annotation process_requires extracting and combining information from disparate external and in house annotation sources or even command_line several applications such as annovar gemini and treat have recently been developed to automate the annotation and filtering of genomics variants however these systems are restrictive as expansion and maintenance of annotation depends on the authors availability willingness and annotation and filtering are often combined making integration with other tools challenging other approaches such as bio rdf propose the conversion of annotation sources into resource_description rdf format that can be loaded into a triple store database for querying this approach although flexible because it allows independent integration of new annotation sources presents scalability limitations and does not integrate well with existing command_line under production loads the number of searches to annotate variants can become extremely_large for instance the annotation of million variants from whole_genome runs per day with annotation extracted from data_sources would involve million queries in this article we present the biological reference repository bior a flexible and scalable infrastructure for the specific purpose of gene and variant annotation bior is built around a slightly modified_version of the json format http www json org referred in this article as tjson to facilitate usability bior provides a toolkit bior toolkit that includes a set of unix command_line functions to facilitate catalog management and annotation extraction the bior toolkit is engineered to work in high_performance environments and scale to multiple simultaneous instances bior is an open annotation tool it includes a toolkit with a base set of commands needed to build and index catalogs and retrieve annotations annotations can be retrieved based on location genomic_coordinates or identifiers the tjson format is used for catalogs and as input_output for most of the toolkit functions facilitating the assembly of complex pipelines because the tjson format is readable users can design their own scripts to extract annotation from catalogs scripts can also be intermixed with toolkit commands as long as the tsjon format is maintained this stream based_approach on which bior is based significantly_reduces memory_footprint in addition the bior toolkit is inherently parallel and can be configured to take advantage of computers with multi core architectures bior catalogs can easily be combined into new catalogs to decrease retrieval time by avoiding multiple crosscatalog queries in conclusion bior is a rapid and flexible system for annotating high_throughput genomics experiments
