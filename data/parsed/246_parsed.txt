a method for probing the mutational_landscape of amyloid structure motivation proteins of all kinds can self assemble into highly_ordered sheet aggregates known as amyloid_fibrils important both biologically and clinically however the specific molecular_structure of a fibril can vary dramatically depending on sequence and environmental_conditions and mutations can drastically alter amyloid function and pathogenicity experimental structure_determination has proven extremely_difficult with only a handful of nmr based models proposed suggesting a need for computational_methods results we present amyloidmutants a statistical_mechanics approach for de_novo prediction and analysis of wild_type amyloid structures based on the premise of protein mutational landscapes amyloidmutants energetically quantifies the effects of sequence mutation on fibril conformation and stability tested on non mutant full_length amyloid structures with known chemical_shift data amyloidmutants offers roughly fold_improvement in prediction_accuracy over existing_tools moreover amyloidmutants is the only method to predict complete super secondary_structures enabling accurate discrimination of topologically dissimilar amyloid conformations that correspond to the same sequence locations applied to mutant prediction amyloidmutants identifies a global conformational switch between a and its highly_toxic iowa mutant in agreement with a recent experimental model based on partial chemical_shift data predictions on mutant yeast toxic strains of het s suggest similar alternate folds when applied to het s and a het s mutant with core asparagines replaced by glutamines both highly amyloidogenic chemically_similar residues abundant in many amyloids amyloidmutants surprisingly predicts a greatly_reduced capacity of the glutamine mutant to form amyloid we confirm this finding by conducting mutagenesis experiments availability our tool is publically available on the web atunder optimum_conditions proteins with diverse primary sequence exhibit the ability to self assemble into structurally varied but highly to whom correspondence should be addressed ordered sheet aggregates known as amyloid_fibrils those forming amyloid under_normal can have profound effects on biological_systems deleterious and beneficial on the one hand amyloids play a role in diseases such as alzheimers parkinsons and huntingtons as well as systemic_amyloidosis on the other they serve vital functions in normal biology such as in human peptide_hormone storage biofilm_formation and a mechanism of protein only inheritance by yeast prions however the generic nature of the fold the observation that most proteins do not form amyloid under normal conditions and the ability of many amyloids to adopt multiple amyloid structures from the same peptide_sequence structural strains confounds standard sequence specific models of protein_folding moreover sequences with only a small likelihood of forming amyloid can remain so given many mutations or become abundantly amyloidogenic after only a single point change therefore to better understand the sequence structure relationship of amyloid_fibrils a meaningful predictive_model is required that describes the relationship between a given sequence and its mutational neighborhood countless experimental_studies have been performed to probe the molecular_mechanism of these enigmatic structures however most methods developed primarily for globular_proteins are difficult to apply to amyloids due to their large size and insolubility techniques such as solid_state nmr_spectroscopy and hydrogen_deuterium h d exchange have brought us the most information about fibril structure but only through exhaustive work and complex experimental_design the high_cost of such studies has prevented the kinds of large_scale investigations that can reveal the underlying sequence structure relationships in functional and pathogenic amyloid folds seminal work has shown that computational_prediction of sequence amyloidogenicity can help guide and speed investigations of amyloid structure these advances enabled new possibilities for genome_wide studies such as the discovery of new functioning amyloid_proteins in yeast more specialized tools have been further developed that detail the structurepage i i i amyloidmutants provides the highest_accuracy prediction to date of the full fibril structure of amyloid sequences but its greater value is its unique ability to discover which mutations effect a change in amyloid structure s to predict what that structure is and to assign meaningful energetic weights comparing mutant conformations this accuracy is due in part to the ability to model coarse higher dimension spatial interactions beyond simpler d sequence_motifs this is an important distinction from amyloidogenicity predictors that identify structurally homogeneous peptide_sequences while the latter can be helpful during an initial screen searching for amyloid steric zippers in particular amyloidmutants can predict and provide insight into the full_length structure and residue residue interactions of both solenoidal and serpentine steric zipper fibrils putatively identifying interactions critical to function or pathogenicity further through the use of boltzmann ensembles our model of sequence structure space is the only amyloid modeling tool that captures fibril structure variation and contact structural topology changes that may arise in in vivo the exploration of mutational landscapes is an important step in understanding differences between amyloid topologies how mutational variants arise in the wild and to elucidate evolutionary_relationships between related amyloid_proteins this capability depends on amyloidmutants novel thermodynamic characterization of all points within a mutational_landscape and is necessary for the discovery of non additive functional_relationships between sequences and conformational epistasis further we note that our tool provides additional features for experimentalists not used in this article that allows extrasequential experimental_data to be incorporated into the predictor supplementary text section as much or as little a priori_knowledge as desired enabling a new tactic for iterative tool re use at face value the ability of most proteins to form a characteristic cross sheet amyloid structure in vitro seems at odds with the relatively small number of amyloid forming proteins that have been identified in vivo and the apparently high sequence dependence some amyloids show when compared against sequence homologs moreover the existence of both beneficial functional amyloid sequences and putatively pathogenic misfolded amyloid_proteins suggests a more complicated sequence structure relationship than is found in standard protein_folding models the power to accurately_predict amyloid structure from sequence and to fully characterize the amyloidogenicity of an entire mutational_landscape provides insight into this problem by identifying recurring sequence_motifs coarse d residue arrangements and putative mutational pathways linking the sequences of known amyloid structures the immediate impact of this could improve our ability to identify amyloid structures from genomic_data alone to better understand familial mutations that intensify pathogenesis in diseases such as alzheimers to predict the interaction_strength of fibril regions that may be involved in nucleation and to enable targeted peptide design to alter fibril structure or inhibit fibril_formation
