dynet visualization and analysis of dynamic molecular_interaction the ability to experimentally determine molecular_interactions on an almost proteome_wide scale under different conditions is enabling researchers to move from static to dynamic network_analysis uncovering new insights into how interaction networks are physically rewired in response to different stimuli and in disease dynamic_interaction data presents a special challenge in network biology here we present dynet a cytoscape application that provides a range of func tionalities for the visualization real_time synchronization and analysis of large multi state dynamic molecular_interaction enabling users to quickly identify and analyze the most rewired nodes across many network states availability_and dynet is available at the cytoscape app store http apps cytoscape org apps dynet network biology is a rapidly developing area of research which recognizes that cellular_processes are controlled and coordinated at multiple different levels by tightly_regulated molecular_networks this cellular interactome is a highly_dynamic entity dependent on an array of temporal spatial cellular and environmental signals understanding how molecular_interaction change in their composition and connectivity in response to these cellular cues is crucial to understanding complex emergent phenotypes in health and disease for example have shown that two thirds of disease associated alleles perturb proteinprotein_interactions ppis until recently most studies_investigating the dynamics of ppi_networks inferred dynamic_network states through the integration of static maps of the interactome with state specific information such as gene_expression or genetic_interaction data fortunately advances in mass_spectrometry are now enabling high_throughput studies that directly investigate ppi network_dynamics recently for example researchers have mapped the hippo_signaling ppi_network and revealed how changes in protein_phosphorylation result in a significant rewiring of the interactions between members of this pathway dynamic_interaction data presents a special challenge in network_visualization and current software_tools are limited in their ability to visualize and analyze this type of data the dynnetwork cytoscape application http apps cytoscape org apps dynnetwork for example uses animation to visualize changes in networks over time conditions while fun this approach is of limited practical utility especially for larger or highly_dynamic networks and the user can quickly lose track of the nodes edges of interest this approach also lacks statistical_measures to support the detection and quantification of network rewiring the kddn approach is more advanced statistically but lacks integration with advanced network visualization_tools and is limited to the comparative_analysis of only two network states here we present dynet a cytoscape application that provides a range of functionalities for the visualization and analysis of large multi state dynamic molecular_interaction and the identification of the most rewired nodes dynet introduces several tools and metrics for visualizing and analyzing node and edge rewiring within large_scale many state dynamic molecular_interaction we believe dynet will be invaluable to researchers as they continue to generate large_scale contextual interaction data and delve into the rewiring of the cells dynamic interactome
