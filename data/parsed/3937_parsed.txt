reconstruction of the neuromuscular_junction connectome motivation unraveling the structure and behavior of the brain and central_nervous cns has always been a major_goal of neuroscience understanding the wiring diagrams of the neuromuscular_junction connectomes full connectivity of nervous_system neuronal components is a starting_point for this as it helps in the study of the organizational and developmental properties of the mammalian cns the phenomenon of synapse elimination during developmental_stages of the neuronal_circuitry is such an example due to the organizational specificity of the axons in the connectomes it becomes important to label and extract individual axons for morphological_analysis features such as axonal trajectories their branching patterns geometric information the spatial relations of groups of axons etc are of great interests for neurobiologists in the study of wiring diagrams however due to the complexity of spatial_structure of the axons automatically tracking and reconstructing them from microscopy_images in d is an unresolved problem in this article axontracker d an interactive d axon tracking and labeling tool is built to obtain quantitative information by reconstruction of the axonal structures in the entire innervation field the ease of use along with accuracy of results makes axontracker d an attractive tool to obtain valuable quantitative information from axon datasets availability the software is freely_available for download at http www cbi tmhs org axontracker contact stwong tmhs orgthe modern microscopic image_acquisition techniques provide the neuroscientists the visual_perception of axons in d space of particular interest is the knowledge of connectivity of the neuronal components of the nervous_system the connectome analyzing neuronal structures is instrumental in completely understanding the functional properties of the mammalian central_nervous one such phenomenon that can be studied is the developmental reorganization of connectivity in the mammalian nervous_system also known as synapse elimination pruning of synaptic_connections through competitive interactions during neurodevelopment and its effect on the neuronal connectivity is one such example a study of connectomes over various time points during brain development can reveal the mysteries about how the neural_circuits are established and the way it changes over the lifespan of the animal to whom correspondence should be addressed under study moreover mapping wiring diagram mouse_models can help understand how an abnormality in the neural_circuits can lead to psychiatric_disorders such as schizophrenia and autism another potential application is in the study of the effect of new drugs on the mammalian connectomes analysis of the connectomes at different time points during the drug testing could lead to valuable insights into the effectiveness of the new drugs designed to treat disorders related to brain and central_nervous the wiring diagram of the neuromuscular circuit is believed to be a good starting_point for this as it might lead to discoveries valuable to this study the neuromuscular circuits are well isolated and accessible its connectome is well defined due to the large size of the adult motor_neurons m in diameter which are separated from neighboring axons by schwann_cells and the large size of neuromuscular_junctions m in length the neuromuscular connectome is easier to resolve analyze and can be easily visualized moreover since the morphological_features of the neuromuscular connectome can be directly linked with its functional properties for example the morphology of individual neuromuscular_junction has been found to be directly related to its synaptic_strength it renders itself as an attractive platform to conduct connectome studies many questions related to synapse elimination can be answered from the study of mammalian neuromuscular connectome as the spatial_organization of the axons is very specific in nature down to the level of individual axons it becomes important to isolate each axon from the connectomes for extraction of morphological_features for these studies studies in neuronal connections are believed to help unravel the functional properties of the nervous_system the manual effort needed however is excessive as the neurobiologist has to manually track individual axons from a large set of data gb of volumetric_data this might amount to a few months of painstaking labor of note are similar researches in the mapping of neural_circuits for the study of neuronal connectivity a study of potential connectivity among neurons was done based on neuron reconstructions of the cortical_circuits in cat primary_visual probabilistic synaptic density maps were derived from the neural_circuitry of the olfactory centers of drosophila to predict connectivity drosophila olfactory circuits were mapped and rendered to study the mechanisms of olfactory coding in higher brain centers significant research_efforts have been attempted to extract the geometric_structure of axons from microscopic image_stacks page i i i in this article we presented a novel interactive tool to extract and reconstruct axons obtained from d confocal_microscopy image_stacks compared to the previously_proposed methods our algorithm has two major_contributions firstly the software can successfully extract centerlines of axons with minimal user intervention rendering of the data in d along with overlay of tracking results in real_time is a useful feature offered by the software by introducing user_interaction we can see that our algorithm can successfully extract and reconstruct touching axons and axons with dramatic orientation changes secondly by using local region_growing and interactive level set segmentation_methods we can get the actual boundary of each axon which can provide us valuable quantitative information such as the length radius for axon function and connectivity_analysis as a continuation of the work presented in this article we will discuss algorithms to detect and track branches in order to minimize user intervention needed for axontracker d the following are the planned improvements to the current version of the software axons in the connectome of neuro muscular junctions tend to branch into complex patterns the current version of axontracker d does not have a provision to automatically detect branches at branch points the centerlines were joined together manually to complete the wiring circuitry of the axons as an extension to our current work we plan to design and implement new algorithms to detect branching points along the axons methods such as adaboost classifier could be a potential solution to this problem this consists of three steps i re slice the axon tubes along its orientation ii extract d and d features from the slices and spheres rounding the center points iii select samples to train adaboost classifier manual selection of samples for training the adaboost method can be used to classify positive training examples from negative
