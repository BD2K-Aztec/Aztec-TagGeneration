the cyni framework for network_inference in cytoscape motivation research on methods for the inference of networks from biological data is making significant advances but the adoption of network_inference in biomedical_research practice is lagging behind here we present cyni an open_source fill in the algorithm framework that provides common network_inference functionality and user_interface elements cyni allows the rapid transformation of java_based network_inference prototypes into apps of the popular open_source cytoscape network_analysis and visualization ecosystem merely placing the resulting app in the cytoscape app store makes the method accessible to a worldwide community of biomedical_researchers by mouse click in a case study we illustrate the transformation of an aracne implementation into a cytoscape app availability_and cyni its apps user guides documentation and sample code are available from the cytoscape app storethe availability of large_scale experimental_technologies has enabled the routine measurement of global abundances and states of molecular_components in cellular_systems in contrast the experimental measurement of component interactionsimportant for analyses in a network contextis still far more difficult perhaps for this reason the development of methods that infer networks from transcriptomics or other global molecular measurements has recently_received however the use and adoption of these methods in biomedical_research has been slow to stimulate the exchange between the network_inference and biomedical research_communities we have developed the opensource computational framework cyni that allows to rapidly transform java_based network_inference core code into interactive components apps of the cytoscape visualization and analysis platform and thereby to rapidly make novel methods accessible to a large community of biomedical_researchers here we describe the structure of cyni and illustrate the implementation of the aracne network inference_method which has confirmed myc as a major regulatory hub in human b cells and identified a number of new myc targets
