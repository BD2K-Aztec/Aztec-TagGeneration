alternative_splicing and co option of transposable_elements the case of tmpo lap a and znf in mammals transposable_elements constitute a large fraction of vertebrate_genomes and during evolution may be co opted for new functions exonization of transposable_elements inserted within or close to host_genes is one possible way to generate new genes and alternative_splicing of the new exons may represent an intermediate step in this process the genes tmpo and znf are present in all vertebrate lineages although they are not evolutionarily_related mam malian tmpo and znf do have something in commonthey both code for splice_isoforms that contain lap alpha domains we found that these lap alpha domains have sequence_similarity to repetitive_sequences in non mammalian_genomes which are in turn related to the first orf from a dirs like retrotransposon this retrotransposon domestication happened separately and resulted in proteins that combine retrotransposon and host protein_domains the alternative_splicing of the retrotransposed sequence allowed the production of both the new and the untouched original isoforms which may have contributed to the success of the colonization process the lap alpha specific_isoform of tmpo lap a has been co opted for important roles in the cell whereas the znf lap alpha isoform is evolving under strong purifying_selection but remains uncharacterized vertebrate_genomes like those of other eukaryotes are largely constituted by transposable_elements tes up to two thirds of the human_genome according to a recent estimate the evolutionary_history of tes runs parallel to that of the host_genome all life_forms are endowed with mechanisms to defend against the threat posed by the activity and expansion of tes despite their threatening character many tes have been co opted for new functions during evolutionary_history in what is considered a form of domestication some tes have contributed non coding regulatory_sequences whereas others have given rise to new protein_coding basically there are two means of co opting tes into genes first a te or part of one may form a new whole gene this is probably what occurred with tert the telomerase of eukaryotes which probably originated from the reverse_transcriptase rt of a nonltr retrotransposon alternatively a te can insert within or close to a pre_existing gene and combine with it to produce a new protein this is what happened in the case of the histone_methyltransferase setmar in the ancestor of primates here a mariner like dna transposon inserted downstream of the set cds producing an exon that combined with the original exons to form a chimeric_protein setmar with a new dna_binding
