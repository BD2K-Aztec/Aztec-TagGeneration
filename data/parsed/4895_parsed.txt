structural_bioinformatics wavpeak picking nmr peaks through wavelet_based smoothing and volume based filtering motivation nuclear_magnetic nmr has been widely used as a powerful_tool to determine the d structures of proteins in vivo however the post spectra processing stage of nmr_structure usually involves a tremendous amount of time and expert_knowledge which includes peak_picking chemical_shift assignment and structure calculation steps detecting accurate peaks from the nmr_spectra is a prerequisite for all following steps and thus remains a key problem in automatic nmr_structure results we introduce wavpeak a fully_automatic peak_detection method wavpeak first smoothes the given nmr spectrum by wavelets the peaks are then identified as the local maxima the false_positive peaks are filtered out efficiently by considering the volume of the peaks wavpeak has two major_advantages over the state of the art peak_picking methods first through wavelet_based smoothing wavpeak does not eliminate any data point in the spectra therefore wavpeak is able to detect weak peaks that are embedded in the noise_level nmr spectroscopists need the most help isolating these weak peaks second wavpeak estimates the volume of the peaks to filter the false_positives this is more reliable than intensity based filters that are widely used in existing_methods we evaluate the performance of wavpeak on the benchmark set proposed by picky alipanahi et_al one of the most accurate methods in the literature the dataset comprises d and d spectra from eight different proteins experimental_results demonstrate that wavpeak achieves an average of and recall on n hsqc hnco hnca hncacb and cbca co nh respectively when the same number of peaks are considered wavpeak significantly_outperforms picky availability wavpeak is an open_source program the source_code and two test spectra of wavpeak are available atin this article we introduced wavpeak an automatic peak_picking method that is based on wavelet_based smoothing and volume based filtering experimental_results demonstrate that the wavelet_based smoothing outperforms existing decomposition techniques for this task and volume based filtering outperforms traditional intensitybased filtering the combination of these two ideas results in a novel method that is significantly more accurate than the state of the art peak_picking methods
