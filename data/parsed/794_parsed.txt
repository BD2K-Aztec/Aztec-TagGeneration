genome_analysis blastgraph a comparative_genomics tool based on blast and graph algorithms blastgraph is an interactive java program for comparative genome_analysis based on basic_local blast graph_clustering and data visualization the software generates clusters of sequences of multiple_genomes from all to all blast results and visualizes the results in graph plots together with related information such as sequence_features gene conservation and similarity relationships pruning algorithms are used to reduce results to more meaningful subclusters subsequent analyses can then be conducted based on the predicted clusters including gene content genome phylogenetics and gene gain and loss availability_and https github com bigwiv sequence_analysis especially comparative_genomics often starts with a sequence similarity_search using standard_tools such as basic_local blast or blat and homology orthology detection and clustering using additional tools such as blastclust in the blastall package clustering database at high identity with tolerance cd_hit inparanoid orthomcl markov cluster algorithm eukaryotic orthologous_groups kog and tribmcl nevertheless blast remains the most widely used method and is central to the majority of associated secondary packages additionally although there are many clustering tools based on blast and graph clustering_algorithms including blastclust using single_linkage clustering orthomcl and tribmcl using the markov cluster algorithm mcl these command_line provide only a simple clustering result currently there is no single integrated tool available for post clustering analyses such as phyletic pattern study genome level phylogenetics or gene gain and loss analysis we have developed blastgraph for the generation and visualization of clusters as a graph with accompanying statistics evaluation metrics and associated background information the user can check the coherence of a cluster identify useful relationships such as indels and fusion_events or gene types and interactively split and edit the cluster this is especially useful when remote homologies with low similarities exist among sequences thus we present a user_friendly workflow supplementary data s for integrated comparative_genomics analyses
