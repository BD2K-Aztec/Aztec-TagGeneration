sequence_analysis samstat monitoring biases in next_generation the sequence_alignment format sam is a commonly used format to store the alignments between millions of short_reads and a reference_genome often certain positions within the reads are inherently more likely to contain errors due to the protocols used to prepare the samples such biases can have adverse_effects on both mapping rate and accuracy to understand the relationship between potential protocol biases and poor mapping we wrote samstat a simple c program plotting nucleotide overrepresentation and other statistics in mapped and unmapped reads in a concise html page collecting such statistics also makes it easy to highlight problems in the data_processing and enables non experts to track data_quality over time results we demonstrate that studying sequence_features in mapped data can be used to identify biases particular to one sequencing protocol once identified such biases can be considered in the downstream_analysis or even be removed by read trimming or filtering techniques availability samstat is open_source and freely_available as a c program running on all unix compatible platforms the source_code is available from http samstat sourceforge net next_generation is being applied to understand individual variation the rna output of a cell and epigenetic_regulation not surprisingly the mapping of short_reads to the genome has received a lot of attention with over programs published to date seefor a review of the most commonly used approaches nevertheless commonly a noticeable fraction of reads remains unmatched to the reference_genome in each experiment one possibility is that these reads simply represent the fraction of reads containing more sequencing_errors in the form of mismatches insertions_or than the programs can handle alternatively it is conceivable that these reads contain contaminants and therefore do not map to the expected reference_sequence finally the unmapped reads may represent novel splice_junctions or genomic_regions absent from the reference assembly understanding the reason behind obtaining unmapped reads is clearly of interest mapping programs like maq and bwa report mapping qualities allowing for further investigation we wrote samstat to contrast properties to whom correspondence should be addressed of unmapped poorly mapped and accurately mapped_reads to understand whether particular properties of the reads influence the mapping accuracy as the name suggests our program is designed to work mainly with sam bam_files but also not only can be used to visualize nucleotide_composition and other basic statistics of fasta and fastq_files
