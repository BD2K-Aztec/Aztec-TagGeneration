systems_biology a novel motif_discovery algorithm to identify co regulatory_motifs in large transcription_factor and microrna co regulatory_networks in human motivation interplays between transcription_factors tfs and micrornas mirnas in gene_regulation are implicated in various physiological_processes it is thus important to identify biologically_meaningful network_motifs involving both types of regulators to understand the key co regulatory mechanisms_underlying the cellular identity and function however existing motif finders do not scale well for large_networks and are not designed specifically for co regulatory_networks results in this study we propose a novel algorithm comofinder to accurately and efficiently identify composite network_motifs in genome_scale co regulatory_networks we define composite network_motifs as network patterns involving at least one tf one mirna and one target_gene that are statistically_significant than expected using two published disease related co regulatory_networks we show that comofinder outperforms_existing in both accuracy and robustness we then applied comofinder to human tf mirna co regulatory_network derived from the encyclopedia of dna elements project and identified recurring composite network_motifs of size the functional analysis revealed that genes involved in the motifs are enriched for significantly_higher number of biological_processes or pathways comparing with non motifs we further analyzed the identified composite bi fan motif and showed that gene_pairs involved in this motif structure tend to physically interact and are functionally more similar to each other than expected availability_and comofinder is implemented_in and available for download atat the maturity of high_throughput such as microarray and next_generation a vast amount of genome_wide data have been generated to interrogate human regulatory_networks at both transcriptional_and level the combination and orchestration between regulatory_mechanisms at both levels are central to a precise gene_expression program in contrast toa regulatory_network involving only one type of regulators a coregulatory network may involve transcription_factors tf micrornas mirna and their shared target_genes the interplay between tf and mirna underlies a coordinated circuitry responsible for a variety of cellular_processes many of these processes are carried_out by recurring structures called network_motifs network_motifs are recurring patterns of connectivity occurring significantly more frequently than expected identification of network_motifs in the context of coregulatory networks can yield new mechanistic_insights into biological system and offer crucial clues into gene_regulation for instance it has been shown that mirnamediated feed_forward loops ffls and feedback_loops fbls enhance the robustness of gene_regulation in mammalian_genomes furthermore tf mediated ffls were theoretically proved to ensure the stability of gene_expression against stochastic_fluctuations whereas the tf mirna fbls are demonstrated to provide high flux capacity to coordinate the high information_flow that passes through the mirna and tf within the fbls various methods have been developed to detect network_motifs however only a handful of them could be applied on co regulatory_networks as one of the widely used tools fanmod is an efficient motif_detection algorithm which takes_into networks with different types of nodes and edges by exploiting the concept of graph isomorphism although fanmod has been widely_applied to many kinds of biological_networks its randomization scheme is limited to covering only a small range of subgraphs frequency reflected by the low variance of the number of certain subgraphs in the random_network ensemble besides fanmod is not capable of utilizing multi cores warswap is another network shuffling algorithm which was proposed to discover network_motifs in large tf mirna co regulatory_networks briefly warswap breaks the co regulatory_network into separate layers according to the node types and then shuffles the regulatory edges in each layer while keeping the node degree_distribution unchanged notably warswap is only a randomization technique that must be used accompanied with a motif_discovery tool such as fanmod which substantially limits its application scope additionally warswap requires predefining values of several free_parameters to adjust the sampling weights during the randomization process which may affect the final outcomes the limitations of these existing_methods make it necessary to develop new method that can effectively detect reliable network_motifs in large coregulatory networks consisting of mirnas tfs and target_genes in this study we propose a novel network motif search algorithm called comofinder which is developed based on a parallel subgraph enumeration strategy to efficiently and accurately identify composite motifs in large tf mirna co regulatory_networks distinct from previous_algorithms comofinder seeks for a maximum_difference between a given co regulatory_network and its randomized counterpart to ensure sufficient shuffling during the randomization process which provides a reliable background distribution of the random_network ensemble for motif_discovery compared with existing_methods that were applied to the published co regulatory_networks comofinder achieved favorable performance in terms of accuracy robustness and computational_complexity after having established its superior_performance we next applied comofinder to systematically discover recurring node motifs in human co regulatory_network derived from the encyclopedia of dna elements encode consortium we discovered composite motifs involving the previously wellstudied node ffls and are corroborated by a number of biological evidences such as enrichment for gene_ontology go terms or canonical pathways together we present a novel framework for network motif_discovery demonstrate its utility in analyzing_large human co regulatory_networks and envision it being a useful tool for future analyses of various large biological_networks it has been appreciated that gene_regulatory in metazoans are complex and involve multiple_layers and distinct type of regulators e g regulations at the transcriptional or post_transcriptional level and regulations by tf or by mirna or rna_binding an important goal in systems_biology is to accurately recapitulate co regulatory_networks to investigate how different types of regulators interact with each other accurate network motif_discovery plays_a in studies of complex_networks as they provide a systematic way to reveal the intrinsic co regulatory_patterns among multiple types of regulators however detecting network_motifs in arbitrarily complex_networks remains computationally_intractable and challenging in this study we developed a novel de_novo motif_finding algorithm called comofinder to discover co regulatory network_motifs each involving at least one tf one mirna and one target_gene here we define network motif as network patterns consisting of mirnas tfs and target_genes that occur significantly in higher_frequencies than expected the novelty of our algorithm is fold i we first proposed an efficient enumeration process specifically for finding co regulatory subgraphs of moderate_size ii we then introduced a refined canonical labeling method together with a new graph isomorphism testing_strategy to effectively classify these composite subgraphs into different isomorphic groups and iii we also proposed a new randomization strategy by breaking the co regulatory_network into different layers and seeking for the maximum_difference between the original network and the randomized network in each layer notably fanmod and warswap use canonical labeling generated by a practical graph isomorphism algorithm nauty which takes the diagonal of the adjacency_matrix to denote the node types different from these previous_approaches our refined canonical labeling method can easily differentiate composite subgraphs with or without self regulations interactions in co regulatory_networks furthermore our randomization algorithm is applicable to coregulatory networks containing multiple types of edges including undirected edges such as ppi and directed repression activation edges in contrast warswap can only be applied on directed coregulatory networks to demonstrate the utility of comofinder we compared it with fanmod and warswap on published co regulatory_networks of gbm and ad because the range of co regulatory subgraphs and their isomorphic classes are the same the performance of each method solely depends on their constructed background network distributions by examining the distributions of composite subgraphs generated by each randomization technique we found that comofinder and fanmod could maintain a similar number of composite subgraphs as in the observed network whereas warswap derived random networks lack a substantial number of composite subgraphs the results thus indicate that warswap tends to generate more statistically_significant network patterns as network_motifs improperly comparing with comofinder and fanmod based on the overlaps of motifs found by each method comofinder achieved a good balance comparing with fanmod and warswap which appear to be too stringent and too lenient respectively moreover we conducted rigorous power analysis using an empirical gold_standard motif set encouragingly comofinder achieved consistently the greatest area under the curves we also tested the robustness of each method upon random removals of edges in the given networks and showed that comofinder is relatively robust up to of edge removal together the results corroborate the reliability and stability of comofinder we then applied comofinder to a human coregulatory network derived from encode_project which is much larger than the gbm and ad networks we detected co regulatory network_motifs of size and found a significant_overlap between motifs from encode and gbm ad dataset the functional analysis revealed that the motifs are significantlyenriched for higher number of meaningful biological_pathways or processes compared with non motif instances among the motifs of them involve two tfs one mirna and one target_gene eight of them involve one tf two mirnas and one target_gene only one of them involve two genes with one tf and one mirna we further investigated the latter motif and found that the gene_pairs involved in this motif tend to physically interact with each other and have more functional_similarities in terms of computational time efficiency comofinder leverages multicores of modern cpu which can provide_substantial speed up in running time over singlethreaded algorithms such as fanmod and warswap in particular comofinder could gain an almost linear speed up as increase of the cpu cores in summary comofinder is a reliable and efficient tool that can detect co regulatory network_motifs in large_scale datasets nevertheless as the main focus of our method is to find network_motifs consisting of mirnas tfs and genes one of the limitations of comofinder is that it is only applicable to co regulatory_networks involving these elements up to now we also want to stress that the mirnas examined in our work represent both mirna_precursors mir and the mature forms mir however multiple distinct precursors may give rise to identical mature sequences that target the same set of genes while regulated by very distinct set of tfs since precursors typically reside within gene introns and are often subject to co regulation with their host gene the tf mirna regulatory relations usually involve host_genes and precursor i e tf gene mir mir this also implies the existence of mir gene mir regulation which would imply an indirect mirna mirna regulation thus it would be ideal to consider mir and mir as two separate node types although in this work we did not take the indirect regulations into consideration comofinder is able to deal with this type of regulations which can be explicitly specified by users in the input co regulatory_network the general framework of comofinder will be further extended to other types of composite networks with arbitrary numbers of node types in the future
