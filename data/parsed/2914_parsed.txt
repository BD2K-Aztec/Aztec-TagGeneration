metapred cs a sequence_based meta predictor for protein_protein of prokaryotic two component system proteins motivation two component systems tcs are the main signalling_pathways of prokaryotes and control a wide_range of biological_phenomena their functioning depends on interactions between tcs proteins the specificity of which is poorly_understood results the metapred cs web_server interfaces a sequence_based meta predictor specifically_designed to predict pairing of the histidine_kinase and response_regulator proteins forming tcss metapred cs integrates six sequence_based using a support_vector classifier and has been intensively tested under different benchmarking conditions i species specific gene_sets ii neighbouring versus orphan pairs and iii k fold_cross on experimentally_validated datasets availability_and web_server at two component systems tcss are the most common signal_transduction found in prokaryotes and they regulate crucial biological_functions such as antibiotic_resistance chemotaxis sporulation virulence stationary phase_transition nitrogen regulation competence and phosphate regulation tcss function via phosphoryl group transfer between a histidine_kinase hk and a response_regulator rr protein hk rr pairing is highly_specific and experimental validations are both costly and lengthy here we present metapred cs a web_server that interfaces a meta predictor designed to predict interactions between hk and rr proteins based on six sequence_based prediction_methods moreover users have also access to the source_code distributed on a git hub repository or as virtual_machine to execute the method on local computers thus providing full flexibility with regards to execution parameters reference datasets size of alignments etc we also present the prediction at genome_wide scale of the tcs interactome of myxococcus_xanthus dk as exemplar of large_scale applicability of the method in this work we present a web_server for prediction of ppis in prokaryotic tcs signalling_pathways predictions are generated by a sequence_based meta predictor which is interfaced through a freely_available user_friendly web_server http metapred cs ibers aber ac uk for local use the source_code and installation instruction is available at https github com martinjvickers metapred cs and a virtual_machine implementing the method at http metapred cs ibers aber ac uk metapred cs ova metapred cs also contains precomputed predictions for a number of organisms
