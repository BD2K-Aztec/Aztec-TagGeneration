a novel essential domain perspective for exploring gene_essentiality motivation genes with indispensable functions are identified as essential however the traditional gene level studies of essentiality have several limitations in this study we characterized gene es sentiality from a new perspective of protein_domains the independent structural or functional_units of a polypeptide_chain results to identify such essential domains we have developed an expectationmaximization em_algorithm based essential domain prediction edp model with simulated_datasets the model provided convergent results given different initial_values and offered accurate_predictions even with noise we then applied the edp model to six microbial_species and predicted domains to be essential in at least one species ranging in each species the predicted essential domains were more conserved than either non essential domains or essential genes comparing essential domains in prokaryotes and eukaryotes revealed an evolutionary distance consistent with that inferred from ribosomal_rna when utilizing these essential domains to reproduce the annotation of essential genes we received accurate results that suggest protein_domains are more basic units for the essen tiality of genes furthermore we presented several examples to illustrate how the combination of essential and non essential domains can lead to genes with divergent essentiality in summary we have described the first systematic analysis on gene_essentiality on the level of domains genes are widely regarded as the basic units of a cell a complex system made up of a large number of components and reactions therefore a fundamental_question in synthetic_biology is what is the minimal gene_set that is necessary and sufficient to sustain life the individual genes that constitute a minimal gene_set are called essential genes experimentally essential genes are defined as those that when disrupted confer a lethal phenotype to organisms under defined conditions therefore the essentiality of a gene is the indispensability of this genes product to the survival of transposon_mutagenesis or antisense_rna inhibitions these experiments have provided a tremendous amount of resources to further our understanding on gene_essentiality one important step closer to unraveling the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype recent comparative research on the available essential gene datasets has shown surprising results and has challenged many early assumptions in genomics first it was discovered that microorganisms share a limited set of essential genes for example a comparison of the essential gene_sets of four bacteria revealed that only of essential genes are shared between any pair indicating that a large number of unique essential genes exist supplementary this is somewhat expected as independent studies have firmly_established that bacterial_species share a very limited number of orthologs e g in supplementary regardless of which ortholog detection method is used this may reflect the physiology of diverse microorganisms increasing the number of organisms in the list will further decrease the number of orthologs and thus common essential genes for example merely orthologs and essential genes are common to all four bacteria supplementary it is highly unlikely that these essential genes would be capable of executing all functions of a cell second and more surprisingly a recent study showed that when tested_experimentally in model bacteria less than a quarter of the highly_conserved genes were essential this suggests that evolutionary_conservation of a gene does not necessarily imply that it is essential for microbial survival consider a hypothetical bacterium that utilizes both solar and chemical_energy although the genes for converting solar and chemical_energy have been highly_conserved and optimized thus allowing them to be conserved through evolutionary time neither is essential for survival if both solar and chemical_energy are present finally orthologs are often observed to be essential in one organism but not another for example the dape gene is essential in escherichia_coli but non essential in pseudomonas_aeruginosa it is also possible for orthologs to have different functions in different organisms even though it is a fundamental assumption of genomics that most orthologs perform a similar function this suggests that differences in genetic_regulation genetic redundancy and divergence in cellular_pathways or processes between organisms may all affect gene_essentiality their combined effects result in the discrepancy in essentiality between orthologs given the above evidence a theoretical_approach that attempts to identify a universal minimal gene_set by searching for conserved orthologs across multiple_organisms is unlikely to succeed since relying on orthologs or conservation on the gene level does not adequately explain essentiality are there other characteristics among different organisms that are more consistent with essentiality observing that genes from different evolutionary_origins perform the same function i e non orthologous gene displacements a group of researchers switched their focus to defining the set of essential functions however knowing a set of essential functions does not necessarily mean that the genes responsible for these functions can be easily_identified especially in understudied organisms in this study we have reexamined gene_essentiality from a novel essential protein domain point_of our results suggest that this new perspective may offer unique insights into the mechanistic_basis of gene_essentiality and help to resolve the controversy regarding this phenomenon protein_domains with known function such as those of the atpase enzyme class are amino_acid sequence_patterns with an associated activity they often correspond to structural_domains the independent globular components of the polypeptide_chain found in three_dimensional protein_structures although the correspondence is not exact independent of neighboring sequences a protein domain folds into a distinct structure and mediates the proteins biological functionality supplementary protein_domains can be detected from gene protein_sequences by well established algorithms such as hmmer currently the pfam v database contains domains detected by hmmer many of which have unknown_functions we hypothesized that gene_essentiality is likely preserved through the function of protein_domains or domain combinations rather than through the conservation of the entire genes numerous examples can be found in literature to support this postulation for instance there is only a single_copy of dna_polymerase subunits s and c domain iii pf in e coli p aeruginosa and bacillus_subtilis the host gene of this domain dnax is essential in all three species however the sequence_identity between them is low supplementary in further support of modularity within essential genes previous_studies have discovered that although a gene as a whole may be essential not every domain within the gene is required for the essential function for example e coli ftsk b is an essential gene consisting of two domains the n_terminal a a and the c terminal a a only the n_terminal domain of this gene is required for its role in cell_division and viability this study among others provides direct evidence that protein_domains may be responsible for the essentiality of a gene the structure of this paper is as follows in the section we describe the data_sources and give the details of the essential domain prediction edp model in the section we first assess the performance of the edp model on simulated_datasets we then use the edp model to predict essential domains in six microbes detailed domain information can be found in supplementary table s next we investigate the properties of these predicted essential domains such as their conservation and functions we also use these essential domains to reproduce the annotation of essential genes as a validation of our predicted essential domains and present several cases where literature provides support for our predictions in the section we discuss the significance of our research the advantages of explaining gene_essentiality from a domain perspective and possible improvements that can be applied to our edp model
