gene_expression using non uniform read_distribution models to improve isoform_expression inference in rna_seq motivation rna_seq technology based on next_generation provides the unprecedented ability of studying transcriptomes at high_resolution and accuracy and the potential of measuring expression of multiple_isoforms from the same gene at high_precision solved by maximum_likelihood isoform_expression can be inferred in rna_seq using statistical_models based on the assumption that sequenced_reads are distributed uniformly along transcripts modification of the model is needed when considering situations where rna_seq do not follow uniform_distribution results we proposed two curves the global bias curve gbc and the local bias curves lbcs to describe the non uniformity of read distributions for all genes in a transcriptome and for each gene respectively incorporating the bias curves into the uniform read_distribution urd model we introduced non urd n urd models to infer isoform_expression levels on a series of systematic simulation_studies the proposed models outperform the original model in recovering major_isoforms and the expression ratio of alternative isoforms we also applied the new model to real rna_seq and found that its inferences on expression ratios of alternative isoforms are more reasonable the experiments indicate that incorporating n urd information can improve the accuracy in modeling and inferring isoform_expression in rna_seq applying next generation high_throughput to transcriptomes rna_seq makes it possible to precisely measure the abundances of transcripts this technology has been widely investigated on the study of gene_expressions splice_variants novel transcripts discovery rna sequence_polymorphism and chimeric_transcripts in recent_literature the ability of rna_seq to count sequenced_reads along transcripts gives digital measurement of transcription_levels and is powerful for identifying and measuring the amount of transcribed isoforms of alternative_splicing genes changes of isoforms expression levels in many genes are of functional_importance in particular biological_processes for example switching between major and minor isoforms of genes plays_a in mouse muscle myogenesis isoform_expression changes have been shown to be highly related to the development of many complex_diseases such as lewy_bodies and progressive_supranuclear studies also obtained the evidence that the expression ratio of two alternative isoforms from human progesterone_receptor pr gene could result in different outcomes of breast_cancer treatment therefore correctly estimating isoform_expression levels is becoming increasingly important for understanding complicated biological_mechanisms in rna_seq under the assumption that the sequenced_reads are sampled independently and uniformly on all transcripts in the sample it is straightforward to model the distribution of read_counts of exons as a poisson_distribution using a uniform read_distribution model urd model for short proposed a maximum_likelihood estimate mle method to infer isoform_expression levels however some studies show that there are substantial biases in high_throughput sequencing_data which may cause non uniformity of read distributions in rna_seq recent literatures also pointed_out that hexamer priming and local sequence content can affect the sequencing preference in our investigations we observed the distributions of rna_seq in many datasets are not uniform some datasets have a strong bias toward the ends of transcripts which means that the ends usually have more reads sequenced this phenomenon may be caused by some pre sequencing procedures such as the poly a selection_step in sample_preparation see section for details in such situations the accuracy of isoform_expression inference based on the uniformity assumption will deteriorate thus the motivation of this study is to develop a method that takes the non uniformity of read_distribution into consideration to improve isoform_expression inference recently several other groups also realized the importance of this problem and incorporated non urd n urd information into uniform_distribution models in different ways in our study wepage n urd along a transcript is widely observed in many rna_seq we introduced bias curves to describe such distribution_patterns in each dataset and in each gene and proposed to modify the uniform model with these distribution informations experiments show that the proposed non uniform models can give better estimation of isoform_expression levels and identify major_isoforms more accurately biological reasons of the non uniformity in the read_distribution are not fully understood yet the degradation of mrna may play a main role for the global_distribution pattern as reported in literature mrna_degradation can initiate from either the end or end of mrnas in mrna studies usually a ploy a selection_step is adopted this purification also removes the rna_molecules decaying from the ends but not those decaying for each panel the three horizontal tracks in the picture from top to bottom are genomic_coordinates gene structure where exons are magnified for better visualization and the reads falling into every two genomic_coordinates where the red and blue bars represent numbers of reads on the forward and the reverse strand respectively from the ends as a result if the rna_seq library is constructed from total_rna with partially_degraded rna_molecules there would be more reads toward the ends of the transcripts and the read_distribution is therefore similar to what is shown_inand examples in supplementary one the other hand local sequence_features could explain a large part of the gene specific distribution_patterns sequence constitution such as gc_content along genes may play the most important role in amplification while other features may lead to biased hexamer priming studying the cause of sequencing preference may help to improve the protocol of rna_seq but recently_published rna_seq such as the data generated by also suffered from a strong global_distribution bias and local biases as well recently and howard and heber also addressed the non uniform_distribution issue from different viewpoints and proposed their models and methods for gene and or isoform expression_level estimation li et_al s work majorly focused on solving read_mapping uncertainty but their method could accommodate the general distribution bias in the expression inference through the usage of the empirical read start position distribution rspd they did not utilize the local sequencing preference specific to genes our study shows that properly combining the global and local read_distribution information is an effective way to improve the expression inference howard and heber proposed a linear_model to integrate the nonuniformity information but their model was based on a normal_approximation rather than the poisson_distribution this makes their model less accurate in the inference we conducted a series of experimental comparison with these newest methods and the results are summarized in the supplementary_materials for the future study several aspects in n urd modeling could be addressed first as the read_length by new sequencing_technologies becomes longer there will be more junction reads crossing two page or more exons these junction reads make up pseudo exons and could be helpful in the inference of alternative spliced isoforms and their expression levels the proper combination of the gbc and lbcs is another important question in this study we used a fixed mixture parameter to integrate them according to simulation_experiments more adaptively strategies such as dynamic weighting of the two bias curves during the iteration of expression inference would give further improvement another issue is about the gene_annotation the current model depends on known gene_annotation for the inference ideally it will be more useful if the inference can be done with incomplete annotation in such scenario the task of inferring isoform expression_level will be integrated with the task of detecting alternative_splicing isoforms from rna_seq accurately measuring the expression of genes and their multiple_isoforms is the first step in applying rna_seq technology to many biological_investigations with the promising results obtained by the n urd models we believe that the data adaptive strategy proposed here will benefit downstream_analyses such as detecting differentially_expressed and isoforms in human_diseases
