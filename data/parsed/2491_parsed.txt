in silico phenotyping via co training for improved phenotype prediction from genotype motivation predicting disease_phenotypes from genotypes is a key challenge in medical_applications in the postgenomic era large training_datasets of patients that have been both genotyped and phenotyped are the key requisite when aiming for high_prediction with current genotyping projects producing genetic data for hundreds of thousands of patients large_scale phenotyping has become the bottleneck in disease phenotype prediction results here we present an approach for imputing missing disease_phenotypes given the genotype of a patient our approach is based on co training which predicts the phenotype of unlabeled patients based on a second class of information e g clinical health record information augmenting training_datasets by this type of in silico phenotyping can lead to significant improvements in prediction_accuracy we demonstrate this on a dataset of patients with two diagnostic types of migraine termed migraine_with and migraine_without from the international headache genetics_consortium conclusions imputing missing disease_phenotypes for patients via co training leads to larger training_datasets and improved prediction_accuracy in phenotype prediction availability_and the code can be obtained at http www bsse ethz ch mlcb research bioinformatics and computational_biology co training htmlpredicting disease_phenotypes from genotypic information of a patient is a key_question in medical_research with implications for disease diagnosis prognosis and therapy any prediction system or classifier relies critically on the existence of a training_dataset which includes labeled examples that is to say patients for which both genotypic_and data are present the limiting_factor when creating such training_datasets used to be the low number of patients for which genotypic or even full genome data were available but experimental advances in genotyping using genotyping chips wellcome_trust or nextgeneration_sequencing plus the advent of many large_scale sequencing studies genomes_project and biobanks that store genotypic information are steadily changing this situation gradually the availability of disease_phenotypes is turning into the bottleneck when collecting training_datasets for phenotype prediction automated approaches to phenotyping such as image phenotyping which extracts features from images are currently gaining_popularity e g in model_organisms and plant genetics but not for all kinds of phenotypes such images are available e g for many human_diseases health record information on patients is collected in growing numbers both manually and by electronic_devices in order to systematically evaluate the utility of our in silico phenotyping approach we conducted the following experiments firstly we determined the lower_and for the prediction_performance of the algorithm assuming perfect labeling of the data we then examined how the actual prediction_performance of in silico phenotyping compared to these bounds secondly the effect of varying the amount of data in the training and co training_sets on the prediction_performance of in silico phenotyping was established finally using the relative_sizes of data splits detailed at the end of section we empirically examined the effect of varying the number of snps that are selected in the univariate feature_selection section
