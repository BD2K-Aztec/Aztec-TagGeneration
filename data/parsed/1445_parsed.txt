dizzy beats a bayesian evidence analysis tool for systems_biology motivation model_selection and parameter_inference are complex problems of long_standing interest in systems_biology selecting between competing_models arises commonly as underlying biochemical_mechanisms are often not fully known hence alternative_models must be considered parameter_inference yields important information on the extent to which the data and the model constrain parameter_values results we report dizzy beats a graphical java bayesian evidence analysis tool implementing nested sampling an algorithm yielding an estimate of the log of the bayesian evidence z and the moments of model_parameters thus addressing two outstanding challenges in systems modelling bayesian_methods provide a sound basis for ranking alternative systems_biology models and for characterizing the extent to which parameters are constrained by models and data markov_chain have been applied to model_selection and to parameter_inference in systems_biology but often require considerable algorithmic and conceptual development nested sampling promises to ease these complex computational tasks recent biological_applications include general_purpose code for nested sampling is available in r and biological_applications of the multinest tool have been reported a c based commandline application implementing nested sampling and providing a systems_biology sbml interface has recently been released but no graphical tool is currently available thus we sought to add nested sampling to the widely used dizzy chemical kinetics simulation tool over citations as of november in addition we have added an optimization function and sbml compatibility however as dizzys command language has operators that cannot be captured in sbml and sbml has features not supported by dizzy this feature is restricted to the intersection of the modelling languages dizzy beats is a graphical application for simulating and optimizing systems models based on an established simulator and its simple textual model syntax to which we have added sbml import export functionality uniquely dizzy beats provides model comparison and parameter_inference functions through the nested sampling algorithm in a graphical application comparable functions are implemented in biobayes however users must edit the xml representation of the model should they wish to make modifications sysbions implements nested sampling but all interaction is via the command_line the use of a likelihood_based on the l norm derived from biological replicate data makes fewer assumptions than a gaussian error_model and is less computationally complex than a transitional likelihood_function derived from reaction propensities
