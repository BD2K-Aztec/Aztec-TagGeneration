bgt efficient and flexible genotype query across many samples bgt is a compact format a fast command_line and a simple web_application for efficient and convenient query of whole_genome genotypes and frequencies across tens to hundreds of thousands of samples on real_data it encodes the haplotypes of samples across million snps into a gb database and decodes up to million genotypes per cpu second the high performance enables real_time responses to complex queries availability_and https github com lh bgt contact hengli broadinstitute orgvcf bcf is the primary format for storing and analyzing genotypes of multiple samples it however has a few issues first vcf is a site oriented format although accessing a site and all the associated genotypes is efficient with indexing retrieving site annotations or the genotypes of a few samples always requires to decode the genotypes of all samples which is unnecessarily expensive second vcf does not take advantage of linkage_disequilibrium ld while using this information can dramatically improve compression_ratio third a vcf record is not clearly defined each record may consist of multiple alleles with each allele composed of multiple_snps and indels this ambiguity complicates annotations query of alleles and integration of multiple datasets at last most existing vcf based tools do not support expressive data query we frequently need to write scripts for advanced queries which costs both development and processing time gqt attempts to solve some of these issues although it is very fast for selecting a subset of samples and for traversing all sites it discards phasing is inefficient for region query and is not compressed well the observations of these limitations motivated us to develop bgt
