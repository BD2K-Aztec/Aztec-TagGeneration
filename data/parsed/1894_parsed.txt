structural_bioinformatics ftflex accounting for binding_site flexibility to improve fragment based identification of druggable hot_spots computational solvent mapping finds binding hot_spots determines their druggability and provides information for drug_design while mapping of a ligand bound structure yields more accurate results usually the apo structure serves as the starting_point in design the ftflex algorithm implemented as a server can modify an apo structure to yield mapping results that are similar to those of the respective bound structure thus ftflex is an extension of our ftmap server which only considers rigid structures ftflex identifies flexible residues within the binding_site and determines alternative conformations using a rotamer library in cases where the mapping results of the apo structure were in poor agreement with those of the bound structure ftflex was able to yield a modified apo structure which lead to improved ftmap results in cases where the mapping results of the apo and bound structures were in good agreement no new structure was predicted availability ftflex is freely_available as a web_based server at http computational solvent mapping emerged as an important tool for the identification and characterization of binding_sites in proteins for determining their druggability and for providing information for fragment_based mimicking the radiographic crystallographic approach of multiple solvent crystal_structures this computational_method places molecular probessmall organic_molecules containing various functional groupson a dense grid defined around the protein finds favorable positions using empirical energy_functions further refines the selected poses by energy_minimization clusters the low_energy calculates the partition_function for each cluster and ranks the clusters on the basis of their probabilities the consensus sites are then defined as those where clusters of different probes overlap such consensus sites identify the binding hot_spots i e regions of interactions that substantially contribute to the binding_free and hence are of prime importance to drug_design we have shown that the approximate location of binding hot_spots is generally not affected by conformational changes and can be identified by mapping unbound protein_structures even in cases in which the goal is to find small_molecule binding_sites in proteinprotein_interfaces however the exact shape of hot_spots may change on ligand_binding and hence accounting for protein_flexibility provides more accurate mapping results mapping snapshots from molecular_dynamics simulations is a useful but computationally_demanding approach here we describe the ftflex algorithm which incorporates side chain flexibility considerations into our previously_developed computational mapping method ftmap in an efficient fashion while providing similarly accurate results to increase efficiency ftflex only considers residues that exhibit i significant flexibility as evident by the large number of possible rotamers and ii significant_contributions to binding_site size based on rmsd thus ftflex considers rotamers of the following residues arg his lys met phe trp tyr asp asn glu and gln to test this implementation the ftflex algorithm was used to map the apo structures for targets the apo structures were first mapped using only ftmap these structures are referred to as apo structures throughout the mapping results for apo ftflex modified apo and bound structures were compared in terms of contact frequencies defined as the number of non bonded contacts between probes to whom correspondence should be addressed and each individual residue divided by the total number of nonbonded contacts we also calculated correlation_coefficients between the contact frequencies for apo and bound structures as well as for modified apo and bound structures the more similar are the probeprotein interactions the higher the correlation value shows contact frequencies for trnaguanine transglycosylase tgt left and cyclin_dependent cdk center in both cases there is a deviation in the mapping results obtained using ftmap for the apo and bound structures as indicated by the differences in the probe protein interactions for tgt this deviation can be attributed to tyr which blocks the ligand_binding in the apo structure left and center panels for bound and apo mapping results respectively in the ftflex modified apo structure tyr has been rotated out of the site right which opens the pocket and yields mapping results in better agreement with those of the bound structure a similar improvement is observed for cdk center for dihydrofolate_reductase dhfr pdb id ai there are minimal structural_differences between the apo and bound structures and ftflex predicts no new conformations using ftflex we have shown the following results i mapping results were improved in cases of poor correlation between bound and apo structures ii when the mapping results for apo and bound structures were similar no new structure was predicted iii for tyr phe trp and his the new residue conformation predicted by ftflex for the apo structure was similar to the conformation found in the bound structure funding this work was supported by grants nih r gm and nih r gm from nigms
