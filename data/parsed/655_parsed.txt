genome_analysis bammds a tool for assessing the ancestry of low depth whole_genome data using multidimensional_scaling mds we present bammds a practical tool that allows visualiza tion of samples sequenced by second generation sequencing when compared with a reference_panel of individuals usually genotypes using a multidimensional_scaling algorithm our tool is aimed at determining the ancestry of unknown samplestypical of ancient_dna dataparticularly when only low amounts of data are available for those samples availability_and the software_package is available under gnu_general v and is freely_available together with test datasets https savannah nongnu org projects bammds it is using r http www r project org parallel http www gnu org software parallel samtools https population_structure plays an important role in determining the evolutionary_history of a group a great_deal has been learned from single_nucleotide snp_array technology providing unmatched information of the population_structure of several species for humans see the advent of new sequencing_platforms which can deliver millions to billions of sequencing_reads within days has shifted the focus from snp_array to whole_genome shotgun wgs_data while the cost has steadily decreased obtaining many high depth genomes remains prohibitive for many laboratories in particular when working with ancient_dna adna samples where it is often desirable to screen many samples of potential interest while keeping the cost at a minimum methods based on non parametric multidimensional statistics more specifically principal_components pca were first applied to genetic data more than years_ago pca has since become a standard tool in population_genetics owing in particular to i the low computational demand of such analyses ii the appealing graphical result and iii its ease of use here we describe a tool that allows to assign an ancestry to low depth mapped wgs_data when compared with an existing reference_panel of genotype data using multidimensional_scaling mds based on genetic_distances a related method that provides results similar to those of pca the graphical result with all modern individuals at a depth of can be seen on we find in the simulations that for all but two cases we recover the geographic_region as the first hit for as few as reads in the remaining two cases the sardinian and the karitiana individual a depth of and respectively is enough the true nearest population was also identified in most cases within the three closest centroids for a depth above cases for the second criteria we find that in of the cases the wgs sample was within the population ellipse at and above only in one case san individual was a depth of necessary to be placed within the population ellipse for the ancient data we get similar results for the aborigine which is assigned to the correct geographic_region oceania as a first hit with a depth of and above at a depth higher than we also recover the expected population as the closest population for the anzick individual presumably because of increased damage a depth of is needed to recover the geographic_region as the first hit on the other hand a native american_population is among the three closest populations from a depth of and above the results for gus are given in supplementary data the tool we present in this article is based on classical mds a technique that originated in the s and is commonly used in other fields see e g and citations therein we present a tool that was designed to be practical to assess the ancestry of mapped wgs_data for samples sequenced at low depth assuming that a relevant reference_panel in terms of ancestry is provided we show through simulations that useful ancestry information can be recovered for as few as readscorresponding to a fraction in early of a hiseq lane www illumina com for a sample with endogenous content or of a lane for a typical modern sample
