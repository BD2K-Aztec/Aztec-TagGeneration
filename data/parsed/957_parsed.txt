structural_bioinformatics cheshift graphic validation of protein_structures the differences between observed and predicted c chemical_shifts can be used as a sensitive probe with which to detect possible local flaws in protein_structures for this reason we previously_introduced cheshift a web_server for protein_structure validation now we present cheshift in which a graphical_user is implemented to render such local flaws easily visible a series of applications to ensembles of conformations illustrate the ability of cheshift to locate the main structural flaws rapidly and accurately on a per residue basis since accuracy plays_a in cheshift predictions the treatment of histidine his is investigated here by exploring which form of his should be used in cheshift availability cheshift is free of charge for academic use and can be accessed from www cheshift comchemical shifts provide_important about the conformations of proteins in solution see for example wishart and references therein for this reason we developed cheshift a web_server for protein_structure validation based on a quantum_mechanics database of c chemical_shifts cheshift was originally developed to return a list of predicted values of c chemical_shifts it was the users responsibility to compare the predicted with the observed c chemical_shifts to assess the global quality of a protein however it is a highly_desirable goal of any accurate validation method to identify the existence of local flaws in addition to the global quality see analysis of local versus global chemical_shift validation of dynein light_chain a protein in supplementary_material in order to automate and facilitate the validation_process on a per residue basis we added a gui to cheshift the gui displays the differences between observed and predicted c chemical_shifts by using a four color code mapped onto a d protein model a set of proteins was used to test the ability of cheshift to detect local flaws this set was selected from the protein_data pdb and corresponds to obsolete and superseded nmr protein_structures released pdb data coordinates and experimental_data are rendered obsolete when to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors have collected new data or had re refined the structure the obsolete entry is usually replaced by a new superseding entry that receives a new pdb id we found evidence see_supplementary indicating that the protonated form of histidine his rather than the neutral ones namely the n h or n h tautomers form respectively leads to a better representation of the observed c chemical_shifts this observation together with the well documented effect of proline on the computed chemical_shift of the preceding residue are now taken into account in cheshift predictions shows the color distribution obtained for three ensembles of conformations for the bovine cytochrome b protein the first ensemble of conformations was obtained by nmrspectroscopy pdb id wdb most of the flaws red colored residues are located in the helices which are very distorted in the year wdb was superseded by hko also determined_by according to cheshift hko is enriched in blue regions indicating that it is indeed a better structural model than wdb a third conformation pdb id cyo is included for comparison with the previous two nmr derived conformations this third conformation was determined by x_ray at resolution and is colored almost white blue indicating that this x_ray model is essentially_free of flaws as a second example we analyzed the rabbit kda dynein light_chain protein this protein was first incorrectly solved as a monomer pdb id bkq and then as a dimer pdb id f c bkq was rendered obsolete and superseded by f c the most important difference between bkq and f c is the relative orientation of the third strand highlighted as b in with respect to the rest of the protein specifically in the bkq conformation strand b is part of a sheet of the monomer while in f c strand b is part of the sheet of a monomer forming a dimer not shown comparison of the color distribution obtained from bkq and f c could mislead the user to conclude that the sheet arrangement of i is better than that of figure b ii it should be pointed_out that cheshift does not enable one to determine_whether a given structure should be a monomer or dimer the reason for this drawback of the method is due to the fact that c chemical_shifts are a local property and hence our validation tool cannot be used to decide as to whether a topological arrangement is correct or not therefore a correct interpretation ofis that both structures bkq and f c need further refinement in contrast cmi solved as a dimer by x_ray at resolution is enriched in blue white regions confirming that the cmi protein is indeed a very good structure see
