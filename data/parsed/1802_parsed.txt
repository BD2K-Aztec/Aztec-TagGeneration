structural_bioinformatics feature_based d motif filtering for ribosomal_rna motivation rna d motifs are recurrent substructures in an rna subunit and are building_blocks of the rna architecture they play_an in binding_proteins and consolidating rna_tertiary rna d motif searching consists of two steps candidate generation and candidate filtering we proposed a novel method known as feature_based rna motif filtering frmf for identifying motifs based on a set of moment invariants and the earth movers distance in the second step results a positive set of rna motifs belonging to six characteristic types with eight subtypes occurring in hm s is compiled by us the proposed method is validated on this representative set frmf successfully finds most of the positive fragments besides the proposed new method and the compiled positive set we also recognize some new motifs in particular a turn and some non standard a minor motifs are found these newly_discovered motifs provide more information about rna_structure conformation availability matlab_code can be downloaded fromin recent_years non protein_coding ncrnas in particular long ncrnas nt are receiving more and more attention increasing evidences indicate that these rnas have important regulatory_functions e g the regulation of epigenetic processes related to cell_differentiation etc starting from a nucleotide_sequence rna will experience a process of hierarchical folding and finally form a unique compact d structure to perform certain functions in the final d structure some nucleotides that are originally remote from each other at the sequence level may be connected by chemical bonds or form tertiary_interactions those nucleotides undergoing tertiary_interactions together with some related nucleotides often compose special substructures that occur recurrently in an rna subunit these recurrent substructures are called rna d motifs rna d motifs have various functions e g interacting with proteins and to whom correspondence should be addressed consolidating the rna_tertiary by characterizing these motifs researchers can find a way to explore the possible functions of ncrnas rna d motifs are also important for predicting the possible tertiary_structures for an rna_sequence since they are the building_blocks of rna d structure understanding rna_structures relies on the ability to identify the component motifs many fragment assembly approaches for rna tertiary_structure e g mc fold mc sym are based on the reconstructed base_pairs and or motifs despite the efforts made in trna and medium_size rna_structure to our knowledge no significant_improvement has been reported in long ncrnas tertiary_structure if suitable rules can be inferred from rna d motif composition methods for rna tertiary_structure will be expected to benefit from these rules and may achieve_higher the goal of rna motif searching is to identify the complete set of motifs in an rna subunit which have similar structures to the query motif query motifs are often observed recurrent substructures reported in previous publications in early studies rna motif searching algorithms are based on the secondary_structure of rna these algorithms first produce d symbolic representations of the rna d structures then recurrent motifs are manually determined using the d representations generated in the first step some methods that identify rna motifs from sequences were also developed find local motifs from sequences based on a probabilistic_model andfinds motifs from homologous_sequences based on genetic_programming however motifs discovered by the above approaches are actually d motifs like hairpins and contiguous base_pairs and d motifs based on tertiary_interactions are quite difficult to discover through these methods in order to find rna d motifs new methods are proposed and can be categorized into two types the first type of methods is based on geometrical matching these methods use the root_mean rmsd and other distance metrics to calculate the distance between the two rna_fragments among these geometry based_approaches fr d is an effective method that is mainly used for rna d motif searching when comparing two structures it first superimposes the candidate and the query motif in d space and then uses the fitting error and the orientation error to measure the distance between the two fragments on the other hand in the following subsections we present the results on searching different types of motifs we also list the results obtained from fr d and the method used infor comparison rna_fragments are represented in the form of sequence id chain id for example a standard tetraloop g a a a consists of a guanine and three adenines their sequence ids are and respectively all four nucleotides are located on chain and therefore there are four zeros at the end fr d candidate generation module is used to generate possible candidates there will be n n when evaluating the three methods we discover a number of new motifs in the experiments the first discovery is a new turn motif g g the structure of which is shown in the rmsd between the backbone of this new motif and the standard turn g g is the rmsd values of the other five turns to g g range from to structure alignments are shown in beside this new turn we also discovered a motif u g which has a structure similar to a turn u g also connects two helices and forms a shape compared with the standard turns the first nucleotide on the side u is elongated and far away from the neighboring nucleotide a the vacancy between u and a is occupied by a remote nucleotide a the rmsd between the backbones ofu g and g g is u g can be regarded as a special_case of turn because u is far away from its standard position it can also be regarded as a possible composite turn if u is replaced by a another main discovery is the observation of some instances of non standard type i a minor motif standard type i a minor motif consists of four hydrogen_bonds however the examples presented inconsist of fewer hydrogen_bonds than the standard type which indicates that these non standard instances are easier to form but could be less stable than the standard ones in an adenosine is inserted into an au pair instead of a gc pair no hydrogen_bond is formed between n of the inserted a and the bases of the au pair inand c the bases of the inserted a rotate by a certain angle bullet in bullet in after rotation n is far away from the watsoncrick base_pair and fails to form a hydrogen_bond in the ribose sugar and phosphate of the inserted a are raised from their typical positions as a result only n and n of the inserted a interact with the n and oh of g through the experiments standard instances and non standard instances are observed the large number of non standard cases indicates that type i a minor motifs are not as stable as previously supposed these newly observed motifs lend evidence to the possible variations of turns and type i a minor motifs they also provide_additional about the rna_tertiary and functions in this article we compile a set of positive rna d motifs occurring in hm s this set includes six characteristic types and eight subtypes of rna d motifs in addition to the published motifs this set also contains a new turn motif and non standard instances of type i a minor motifs discovered by us frmf fr d and the method used inhave been evaluated on this positive set the experimental_results suggest that i the method used indoes not achieve the best result for any of the motifs ii frmf outperforms fr d in the case of searching tetraloops with deletion local kink turns turns and ribose zippers auc pr value of frmf is greater by and percentage_points respectively iii fr d outperforms frmf in the other cases as a result the advantage of frmf lies in serving as an important complementary_approach to fr d for particular types of rna motifs and its capability to find new motifs in this work we have adopted the simplified criterion that if the distance between the candidate and the query motif is lower than a threshold the candidate is considered to be of the same type as the query motif while this notion may not necessarily be the standard one used in motif searching its adoption makes it easier to compare the performance and rankings of different approaches in practice since the measures disc disc and disc are decoupled we can set the corresponding thresholds t t and t separately by selecting from a suitable transition_region between a group of small and more cohesive discrepancy values and a group of comparatively large and less cohesive values based on their overall distribution another possible way is that the thresholds can be determined through an adaptive example based learning approach based on a set of representative_samples for different types of motifs in addition parameters used by frmf for searching different motifs are not standardized in future we shall focus on normalizing the discrepancies of the candidates from different types of motifs to the same range to facilitate the selection of a suitable set of parameters finally distance histograms apart from its use in the candidate filtering step could also serve as a computationally_efficient approach during the candidate generation step to distinguish between substructures with grossly different shapes we shall investigate this approach for candidate generation in our future work
