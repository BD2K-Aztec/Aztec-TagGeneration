genome_analysis kgbassembler a karyotype based genome assembler for brassicaceae species motivation the brassicaceae family_includes the most important plant model arabidopsis_thaliana and many cruciferous vegetable crops a number of close_relatives of arabidopsis and economically_important brassica species are being sequenced with whole_genome shotgun sequencing_technologies however de_novo of full chromosomes is difficult since many non model brassicaceae species are lacking genetic and or physical_maps as a unique feature for brassicaceae the genome of each member is composed of conserved chromosomal blocks and the arrangement of the blocks can be obtained from karyotype_analysis via comparative chromosome_painting experiments taking this advantage we developed a bioinformatic tool named kgbassembler to automatically finalize assembly of full chromosomes from contigs and or scaffolds based on available karyotypes of brassicaceae species the brassicaceae family contains about species including the most well known model plant arabidopsis_thaliana arabidopsis and many agronomically important vegetable crops e g brassica_rapa b oleracea and numerous species with promising use for biodiesel_production e g b napus b juncea several projects have been launched to sequence the genomes of a selection of brassicaceae species for instance the brassicales map alignment project http www brassica info however because of lacking genetic and or physical_maps for many of these non model plants the sequence_reads from whole_genome can be only assembled to contigs or scaffolds an alternative strategy to achieve the assembly of chromosomes from contigs or scaffolds is utilizing the genome synteny from the completed genomes of model_organisms this is especially feasible for brassicaceae because it was postulated that the genome of species in this family is composed of conserved chromosomal blocks whose arrangement can be obtained from comparative chromosome_painting ccp analyses e g numerous karyotypes in different lineages of brassicaceae have been profiled with ccp experiments such as a thaliana n eutrema salsugineum n a lyrata n b rapa n and so on thus these existing and forthcoming karyotype maps of brassicaceae can be used to finalize the assembly of chromosomes the feasibility of karyotype based assembly has been shown in the assembly of thellungiella schrenkiella parvula genome independent of genetic and or physical_maps taking this advantage we developed the kgbassembler a tool to assemble full chromosomes from scaffolds if a karyotype is provided the kgbassembler is featured with a user_friendly graphical_user gui allowing users to use automatic assembling of chromosomes based on ccp based karyotypes and or to manually edit the layouts of contigs according to in silico generated karyotypes we ran kgbassembler to assemble the seven chromosomes from the gap free contigs mb of t parvula sequenced by
