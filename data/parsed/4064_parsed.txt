data_and robust rank_aggregation for gene_list integration and meta_analysis motivation the continued progress in developing technological platforms availability of many published experimental_datasets as well as different statistical_methods to analyze those data have allowed approaching the same research_question using various methods simultaneously to get the best out of all these alternatives we need to integrate their results in an unbiased manner prioritized gene_lists are a common result presentation method in genomic_data analysis applications thus the rank_aggregation methods can become a useful and general solution for the integration task results standard rank_aggregation methods are often ill suited for biological settings where the gene_lists are inherently noisy as a remedy we propose a novel robust rank_aggregation rra method our method detects genes that are ranked consistently better than expected under null_hypothesis of uncorrelated inputs and assigns a significance score for each gene the underlying probabilistic_model makes the algorithm parameter free and robust to outliers noise and errors significance scores also provide a rigorous way to keep only the statistically relevant_genes in the final list these properties make our approach robust and compelling for many settings availability all the methods are implemented as a gnu r package robustrankaggreg freely_available at the comprehensive_r http cran r project org data_integration plays an important role in the analysis of highthroughput data as the outputs of individual experiments can be rather noisy it is essential to look for findings that are supported by several pieces of evidence to increase the signal and lessen the fraction of false_positive the structure of the data and specific research_questions largely dictate the methods used in integration still some very general techniques for aggregation of genomic_data have been proposed such as the bayesian_networks and the kernel methods in this work we limit ourselves to the situation where all the data_sources are represented as prioritized lists of genes this is to whom correspondence should be addressed a very natural way to represent a result of a genome_wide study and therefore ubiquitous in different types of analyzes finding a meaningful combination of different data_sources is often a non trivial task for example differences in measurement platforms and lab protocols can render gene_expression levels incomparable hence it might be better to analyze different datasets separately and then aggregate the resulting gene_lists such a strategy has been employed to finding gene_co and for defining more robust sets of cancer_related another example is the study by where the authors combined different kinds of data_sources to find disease related genes for this they ranked genes by similarity to the disease genes in the gene_ontology go pathways transcription_factor sequence and literature and subsequently aggregated these rankings to get the final_result used an analogous methodology to combine results of differential_expression combining preference lists into a single ranking is known as rank_aggregation this problem has a rich history in the fields of information_retrieval and theory of social choice in these contexts the main focus is on the correctness of the resulting ranking for example in elections it is critical that each vote gets counted and represented in the final_result however finding the best ranking is often computationally very expensive for example the one that minimizes the misplacement or so_called bubble sort distance and thus applicable only for a relatively small class of problems data from high_throughput genomic experiments usually contains a significant proportion of noise and thus correctness is not right objective for these kinds of studies for such settings a good rank_aggregation method must be robust enough to find a relevant ranking even in the presence of unreliable or irrelevant inputs since it possible that all rankings are meaningless in the context of a particular study the method should also quantify the reliability or significance of the results finally the method should be applicable also for partial or top rankings only since full rankings are often unavailable e g gene_lists derived from articles or various tools and databases in this article we propose a novel rank_aggregation method based on order_statistics that achieves all described objectives were the first to utilize order_statistics in rank_aggregation the computational scheme for their method was further optimized by this algorithm compares the actual rankings with the expected behavior of uncorrelatedpage
