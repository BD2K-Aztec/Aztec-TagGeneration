estimating evolutionary_rates using time structured data a general comparison of phylogenetic_methods motivation in rapidly_evolving pathogens including viruses and some bacteria genetic change can accumulate over short time frames accordingly their sampling_times can be used to calibrate molecular clocks allowing estimation of evolutionary_rates methods for estimating rates from time structured data vary in how they treat phylogenetic uncertainty and rate variation among lin eages we compiled virus data_sets and estimated nucleotide substitution_rates using root to tip regression least_squares dating and bayesian_inference results although estimates from these three methods were often congruent this largely relied on the choice of clock model in particular relaxed_clock tended to produce higher rate estimates than methods that assume constant rates discrepancies in rate estimates were also associated with high among_lineage and phylogenetic and temporal clustering these results provide insights into the factors that affect the reliability of rate estimates from time structured sequence_data emphasizing the importance of clock model testing reliable inference of molecular_evolutionary time scales depends on accurate estimates of substitution_rates the simplest way to estimate these rates is to assume that the divergence of nucleotide or amino_acid occurs constantly over time a model known as the strict molecular_clock under this model the rate of evolution corresponds to the amount of sequence_divergence between a pair of lineages divided by the time to their most_recent for data_sets in which appreciable genetic change has accumulated during the window of sampling such that the sequence_data are time structured the sequence ages can be used as calibrations to estimate the rate reviewed by sequence_data from rapidly_evolving pathogens and ancient specimens often meet these conditions there has been a surge in phylogenetic_methods that can explicitly handle time structured sequence_data these methods include root to tip regression implemented in least_squares dating implemented in lsd and bayesian phylogenetic_inference e g beast these methods differ in how they treat phylogenetic uncertainty and in their assumptions about rate variation among lineages root to tip regression uses a phylogenetic_tree with branch_lengths in units of genetic_divergence e g substitutions site a regression of the root to tip number of expected substitutions as a function of the sampling_times is fitted the slope of the regression corresponds to the rate the x intercept is the time to the most_recent and the r value can be used as a measure of clocklike behavior crucially however the data_points in the regression are not phylogenetically independent in particular deep branches in the tree contribute to multiple root to tip distances leading to pseudoreplication least_squares dating also requires a phylogenetic_tree instead of fitting a regression it estimates the rate using a normal_approximation of the langley fitch algorithm both root to tip regression and least_squares dating assume clock like evolution and use rooted trees but they are able to estimate the position of the root as part of the analysis however the two methods do require a fixed tree such that phylogenetic uncertainty is not explicitly taken into account although this can be done indirectly by conducting the analysis over a set of bootstrap trees bayesian approaches to estimating evolutionary_rates require a model of rate variation to be specified in most bayesian dating programs such as beast several clock models are available the strict clock sc model assumes rate homogeneity throughout the tree in contrast relaxed_clock allow a different rate along each branch in the tree although these are assumed to follow a chosen statistical_distribution for example branch rates can be treated as independent and identically distributed samples from a lognormal distribution or an exponential distribution in the uncorrelated lognormal ucld and uncorrelated exponential uced relaxedclock models respectively an advantage of bayesian_methods is that the rate estimate is integrated over the uncertainty of all of the other parameters including the phylogenetic_tree the fundamental_differences among the three methods might be expected to result in different estimates of evolutionary_rates to test for congruence in rate estimates we collected sequence data_sets for different rna and dna_viruses for each data_set we estimated the evolutionary_rate using root to tip regression in tempest v least_squares dating in lsd v and bayesian phylogenetic_inference in beast v we found some discrepancies in the estimates most of which were explained by high among_lineage and phylogenetic and temporal clustering as such these factors should be routinely assessed in empirical data to improve estimates of evolutionary_rates and time scales for of the data_sets it was not possible to estimate the rate using tempest or lsd this occurs when the rate estimate from tempest is negative or when that from lsd corresponds to the lower_threshold value we found that of these data_sets displayed considerable rate variation across branches with coefficients of rate variation that were distinctly non zero supplementary we therefore focus on the data_sets for which we could estimate the rate using all three methods supplementary we also calculated the regression p value and found that data_sets yielded_positive slopes that were non significant however since the p value is difficult_to in this context due to pseudoreplication we retained these data_sets in our analysis we plotted a pairwise_comparison of the rates from the different methods we measured their median proportional difference between the estimates with sufficient temporal_structure according to cr in the date randomization test for example for tempest vs lsd the proportional difference is the estimate from tempest minus that from lsd divided by that from tempest for the estimates_obtained with beast we report the mean while for those from tempest and lsd we use the point_estimates to measure bias we noted the percentage of data_sets for which the estimates along the y axis are larger than those on the x axis although tempest tended to produce higher estimates than lsd with a bias of more than the estimates from tempest were only about times_higher those for lsd measured using the median proportional difference and in comparison the estimates from beast were less congruent with those from both lsd and tempest with median proportional differences of and respectively although the estimates from beast were not systematically higher or lower than those from lsd and tempest the level of bias was greater for data_sets with considerable among_lineage for example in our comparison of beast versus lsd of data_sets analyzed using the ucld model had higher rates than those from lsd but only of those analyzed with the sc model displayed this pattern this is likely because lsd and tempest assume a strict molecular_clock whereas beast can use relaxed_clock this result is also evident in our comparison of the different clock models in beast the credible_intervals of estimates from the three clock models largely overlap and there is broad agreement between the estimates using the ucld and uced models however the mean values from the two relaxed_clock are nearly always higher than those from the sc model a probable reason for this pattern is that estimates from relaxed_clock have higher uncertainty than those from the sc model which might be upwardly biasedthe proportional difference for two methods such as tempest versus lsd is the difference between their estimates divided by the estimate from tempest the measure of bias is the percentage of estimates on the y axis that are larger than those on the x axis estimating evolutionary_rates using time structured databecause the rate naturally has a lower_bound at zero these factors can lead to a higher mean value consequently the use of relaxed molecular clocks can lead to overestimates of the mean substitution_rate when the data in fact fit a sc indicating that clock model testing should be routinely performed we looked for common features among those data_sets for which the methods analyzed here produced very different rate estimates notably these data_sets typically displayed high among_lineage incongruence between the maximum_likelihood and bayesian estimates of tree_topology and phylogenetic and temporal clustering however high among_lineage was the only factor to display a significant i e p and positive correlation with the degree of incongruence across all data_sets supplementary supplementary one example of a data_set with incongruent rate estimates among methods and which displayed all these factors is the hantaan_virus data_set with an especially high coefficient of rate variation mean credible interval very strong phylogenetic and temporal clustering p and high relative topological distance between the maximum_likelihood and bayesian trees strikingly the absolute sampling time frame does not appear to predict whether there would be conflict between the rate estimates from different methods overall our study demonstrates that methods for analyzing timestructured sequence_data largely produce congruent estimates of substitution_rates provided that clock model testing is performed and that the data meet certain criteria in practice therefore it is important to verify that the data have sufficient temporal_structure and have no phylogenetic or temporal clustering if the data display phylogenetic and temporal clustering a modification of the date randomization test can be conducted but this is not trivial for data_sets without discrete monophyletic groups with the same sampling_times as in our data the performance of these methods should also be investigated using analyses of other time structured data_sets such as those from bacteria and ancient_dna these data_sets form the basis of a wide_range of important evolutionary_studies but pose substantially different analytical challenges from the virus data_sets studied here measures of distance and bias are the same as those in
