systems_biology mr tandem parallel x tandem using hadoop mapreduce on amazon_web mr tandem adapts the popular x tandem peptide search_engine to work with hadoop mapreduce for reliable parallel execution of large searches mr tandem runs on any hadoop cluster but offers special support for amazon_web for creating inexpensive on demand hadoop clusters enabling search volumes that might not otherwise be feasible with the compute resources a researcher has at hand mr tandem is designed to drop in wherever x tandem is already in use and requires no modification to existing x tandem parameter files and only minimal modification to x tandem based workflows availability_and mr tandem is implemented as a lightly modified x tandem c executable and a python script that drives hadoop clusters including amazon_web aws elastic map reduce emr using the modified x tandem program as a hadoop streaming mapper and reducer the modified x tandem c source_code is artistic licensed supports pluggable scoring and is available as part of the sashimi project atpost translational modifications ptms of proteins are a valuable source of biological_insights and mass_spectrometry is one of the few techniques able to reliably prospect for and identify ptms yet many valuable datasets are not searched for ptms due to computational constraints on investigators who do not have claim to significant time on a compute cluster mr tandem helps by bringing x tandem peptide search to cloud_computing and using hadoop to process large_datasets in a fast and robust manner mr tandem is not the first parallel implementation of x tandem but it is the first to exploit the scalability and fault tolerance of hadoop to create large on demand compute clusters on commodity hardware where mpi implementations may fail to whom correspondence should be addressed
