data_and branch an interactive web_based for testing hypotheses and developing predictive_models branch is a web_application that provides users with the ability to interact directly with large biomedical datasets the interaction is mediated through a collaborative graphical_user for building and evaluating decision_trees these trees can be used to compose and test sophisticated hypotheses and to develop predictive_models decision_trees are built and evaluated based on a library of imported datasets and can be stored in a collective area for sharing and re use availability_and branch is hosted at http biobranch org and the open source_code is available at http bitbucket org sulab biobranch scientific advances based on large_datasets often involve a cycle of interactions between experts in computation data scientists and experts in the domain of inquiry typically computational scientists will need to adapt scripts for data analysis and presentation at each step limiting the number of potential iterations and resulting in relatively little feedback from the subject matter expert graphical interfaces for data exploration can empower domain_experts with the ability to engage with data directly increasing their capacity to rapidly define and answer_questions leading to new insights given a dataset with many features e g gene_expression clinical attributes and nominal class values for each sample e g breast_cancer relapse status a decision_tree can provide a visual representation of a sophisticated logic function linking selected input_features to an output class decision_trees are often induced automatically from training data and applied to classify new samples they can also be constructed manually with the intent to either incorporate domain expertise into their structure to improve generalizability or to test specific hypotheses as one example of the latter process a researcher may ask whether a dataset supports her hypothesis that breast_cancer relapse will be associated with high levels of psrc expression or a combination of low levels of pscr and high levels of brca this hypothesis can be represented as a decision_tree rooted in a feature for psrc gene_expression with a leaf node predicting relapse for high pscr and a secondary split under low pscr on brca expression the extent to which this decision_tree fits the dataset measured by e g its predictive_accuracy or a statistical_test of association between samples in leaf nodes and their actual class values indicates the extent to which the data supports the hypothesis here we introduce an interactive collaborative web_application called branch that allows domain_experts to rapidly and easily build evaluate and share decision_trees based on large biomedical datasets
