a novel and versatile computational_tool to model translation motivation much is now known about the mechanistic_details of gene translation there are also rapid advances in high_throughput to determine quantitative aspects of the system as a consequence realistic and system wide simulation_models of translation are now feasible such models are also needed as devices to integrate a large_volume of highly fragmented data known about translation progress in biotechnological methods means that we now have a very good working_knowledge of the biological_components that are essential for gene translation moreover rapid_improvement of quantitative methods in high_throughput biology enables us to obtain kinetic rate_constants and other parameters of the system to date there are no available tools that allow the user to develop a quantitative system wide understanding of translation from the available data in this application note we present a generic model of translation that can be used precisely for this purpose it can be parameterized to describe translation of any eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell the model can be used to answer fundamental_questions about the dynamics of translation including its limiting_factors under various conditions moreover it could also be of significant practical and industrial utility for example within bioprocessing to understand how recombinant_protein impacts on the translation of endogenous_genes prima facia translation is a driven walk of ribosomes over a sequence of codons contained on the mrna a ribosome can only progress to the next codon if an aa trna has bound to it and delivered its amino_acid to the growing polypeptide there are a number of couplings between system variables transcripts interact with one another via the competition for aa trna and ribosomes to whom correspondence should be addressed within a polysome ribosomes may collide with one another potentially resulting in traffic jams that may slow down translation significantly the relative importance of these interactions is parameter and hence species dependent there have been many previous attempts to model translation none of those provides a system wide and dynamic representation of the system the biophysical mechanism of polypeptide elongation as an step process that has first been described by zouridis and hatzimanikatis have performed a sensitivity analysis of the variables involved in the translation process and also modelled translation of a single transcript modelled translation as a totally asymmetric exclusion process while they provide analytic insights specifically illuminating the effects of ribosomeribosome interactions on transcripts their model_assumptions are by necessity too simplified to provide a comprehensive insight into the various factors_influencing translation dynamics presented a stochastic mean field model of translation where the heterogeneity of the model transcript population is represented by its average sequence while this model reproduces overall features of the translation system well its mean field assumption leaves out crucial aspects relating to transcripttranscript competition for ribosomes as well as translation_initiation most recently presented a model based on a master_equation approach this model does not represent free ribosomes explicitly nor does it take into account competition for aa trna or ribosomes the tool described here uses a hybrid_approach mixing agentbased techniques with event driven stochastic_simulation algorithms the individual mrnas are explicitly represented as strings of codons they also contain an initial binding_site that summarizes the utr of every transcript each transcript can be occupied by one or more ribosomes the spatial_arrangement of codons makes it necessary to keep track of the position of individual ribosomes on the mrna consequently ribosomes are represented as agents encapsulating information about the particular transcript they are bound to the position thereon as well as information about the trna they are interacting with individual trna molecules on the other hand are assumed to be perfectly mixed within the cell compartment and need not be accounted for individually therefore the model merely tracks the number of amino acylated uncharged bound and unbound trnas the total numbers of trna mrna and ribosomes are assumed to be unchanged over the course of a simulation run the software is written in java version and runs on any computer platform that supports a java virtual_machine parameters are entered via parameter files the user can select the orfs to be expressed using fasta_format and specify mrna copy_numbers and ribosomemrna affinities for each orf during execution the program outputs data whenever a ribosome has finished a translation round this output includes the orf that has just been translated the translation time the length of the orf and the proportion of free ribosomes upon completion the program also outputs a summary file with comprehensive statistics about each codon and orf including translation error usage rates for codons and trna and total translation numbers and polysome sizes for individual orfs the run time of the model depends on the parameters the number of transcripts to be simulated and the number of ribosomes using realistic parameters for saccharomyces_cerevisiae we found that s of translation can be simulated within days using a single core of a ghz intel_xeon processor
