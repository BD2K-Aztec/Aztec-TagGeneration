picante r tools for integrating phylogenies and ecology picante is a software_package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing the phylogenetic and trait diversity of ecological_communities the package calculates phylogenetic diversity metrics performs trait comparative_analyses manipulates phenotypic and phylogenetic data and performs tests for phylogenetic_signal in trait distributions community_structure and species interactions availability picante is a package for the r statistical language and environment written in r and c released under a gpl v open_source and freely_available on the web http picante r forge r project org and from cran http cran r project org incorporating phylogenetic_information into ecology is enlightening because it allows ecological questions to be addressed in an evolutionary context leading to a deeper_understanding of the processes that give rise to patterns of biological_diversity ecophylogenetic research also has numerous applications such as designating conservation priorities predicting species invasiveness and estimating the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem_functioning in this rapidly_expanding field two barriers have prevented ecologists from incorporating phylogenetic_information into their own work first many ecophylogenetic methods are not available in open_source software_packages preventing end_users from modifying methods to suit their own purposes second the available tools are implemented in multiple software_packages each with unique learning curves and data formatting requirements here we describe a software_package designed to overcome_these by implementing the most commonly used ecophylogenetics tools in a single open_source software_package for the r statistical language and environment r development core to whom correspondence should be addressed
