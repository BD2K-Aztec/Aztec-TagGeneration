a performance enhanced psi blast_based on hybrid alignment motivation sequence_alignment is one of the most popular tools of modern biology ncbis psi_blast utilizes iterative model_building in order to better detect distant homologs with greater sensitivity than non iterative blast however psi blasts performance is limited by the fact that it relies on deterministic alignments using a semi probabilistic alignment scheme such as hybrid alignment should allow for better informed model_building and improved identification of homologous_sequences particularly remote_homologs results we have built a new version of the tool in which the smith_waterman alignment algorithm core is replaced by the hybrid alignment algorithm the favorable statistical_properties of the hybrid algorithm allow the introduction of position_specific penalties in hybrid_psi this improves the position specific modeling of protein_families and results in an overall improvement of performance availability source_code is freely_available for download atsequence alignment is one of the most commonly used tools in modern biology the blast and psi_blast algorithms have become standard_tools for homology detection in particular psi_blast iteratively refines models for a protein_family of interest with the goal of working toward the detection of weaker or more distant homologs the detection of deeper evolutionary_relationships can impact many aspects of biology such as the broadness of evolutionary_studies the quality of gene_annotations protein_structure function predictions and our understanding of genes found in metagenomic surveys improving psi_blast has the potential to affect a large number of users and scientific applications to whom correspondence should be addressed the idea behind psi_blast or position specific iterated basic_local is to leverage information from identified homologs to create a position specific substitution matrix that can then be used to detect even more distant homologs these searches take place in an iterative fashion by using homologs identified in the previous round for the model_building phase where the position specific substitution matrix is refined for the next round while this method increases the sensitivity of the subsequent searches the blast core imposes a severe limitationnamely an inability to incorporate position_specific costs this limitation stems from the inability to statistically assess the significance of alignment scores with position_specific costs on practical timescales here we overcome_this by replacing the alignment core of psi_blast by the semi probabilistic hybrid alignment algorithm this algorithms main advantage over the alignment core of ncbi psi_blast is its statistical tractability particularly with regards to position_specific costs in effect hybrid alignment introduces to psi_blast one of the advantages usually reserved for profile_hidden the hybrid_psi software which we present here incorporates the hybrid alignment algorithm for both homolog detection and model_building thus allowing the use of position_specific costs that were previously unfeasible we show that hybrid_psi represents an improvement to the overall sensitivity and selectivity of homolog detection in comparison to ncbi psi_blast using the parameter_values we identified using scop v we measure the performance of both ncbi and hybrid_psi by comparison against an independent dataset that derives from the astral subset of scop v of the sequences in the astral subset of scop v are not contained in the astral subset of scop v we use the new sequences as an independent set of queries for testing the performance of hybrid and ncbi psi_blast we use version of ncbi psi_blast and hybrid psiblast as described above to search the ncbi nr database for homologs of the query_sequences in astral scop v that are not in astral scop v and save the resulting models after each round these models are then used to search the astral scop v database and we ask how many proteins identified by ncbi and hybrid_psi are in agreement or disagreement by plotting the number of true versus false hits that occur ordered by e value in order to determine which hits are true and which are false we use the superfamily evaluation ruleset for scop benchmarks which classifies each pair of sequences in scop as either homologs non homologs or undecidable in general two sequences in the same scop superfamily are considered as homologs sequences in different folds are considered non homologs and sequences in the same fold but different superfamily are considered undecidable the authors of the evaluation ruleset also include a number of exceptions from this general classification_scheme for common folds such as rossmann folds and tim barrels as well as for individual sequences deemed to be misclassified by scop after manual_inspection since a newer version of the ruleset is not available we manually verified that none of the sequences covered by specific exceptions in the ruleset change classification between version and for the purpose of evaluating the algorithms we ignore hits classified as undecidable the round by round results for ncbi psi_blast are shown in from this plot one can see the effects of the rather classic problem of model corruption in iterative approaches as previously_reported ncbi psi_blast performance initially improves in subsequent rounds but then becomes worse past round due to inclusion of a large number of non homologs in the building of the query models hybrid_psi exhibits very little model corruption up to round as shown in here the optimal_performance is given by round note that the coverage of hybrid_psi while still subject to the effects of model corruption is less sensitive than that of ncbi psi_blast to these effects finally we plot the best rounds for both algorithms and compare their overall performances shows that hybrid_psi performs measurably better than ncbi psi_blast in order to determine if this improvement is due to the position_specific cost or due to the other changes in the algorithm we repeat the evaluation of hybrid_psi keeping the gap weights constant at their initial value while keeping all other parameters the same shows that in this case the model corruption effects are present but not as severe as for ncbi psi_blast adding the performance of the best round of fixed gap cost hybrid_psi to we find that its performance is between that of ncbi and full hybrid_psi in the low coverage region however in the higher_coverage region hybrid_psi without position_specific costs performs worse than ncbi psi_blast we thus conclude that incorporating position_specific costs indeed improves detection of remote homologies this work implements a version of psi_blast that incorporates the semi probabilistic hybrid alignment scheme this alignment scheme allows for the use of position_specific costs and information from suboptimal alignments in the model_building phase resulting in overall more accurate homology_searches than ncbi psi_blast the relevance of our result is that we have shown how to improve the very core of psi_blast i e the alignment engine which was already backed by a long record of scientific scrutiny and sound theoretical_foundations our performance_improvements are orthogonal and therefore potentially cumulative to those brought about by more recent_advances on here the optimal_performance is given by round two earlier rounds than for hybrid_psi with position_specific costs note that the coverage of the fixed gap cost hybrid_psi is more sensitive to model corruption than the full hybrid_psi algorithm but less sensitive than ncbi psi_blast other parts of psi_blast such as the homolog detection and model_building
