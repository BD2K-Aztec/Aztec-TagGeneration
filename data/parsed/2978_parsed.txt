data_and mining and integration of pathway diagrams from imaging data motivation pathway diagrams from pubmed and world_wide www contain valuable highly curated information difficult to reach without tools specifically_designed and customized for the biological semantics and high content density of the images there is currently no search_engine or tool that can analyze pathway images extract their pathway_components molecules genes proteins organelles cells organs etc and indicate their relationships results here we describe a resource of pathway diagrams retrieved from article and web_page images through optical character recognition in conjunction with data_mining and data_integration methods the recognized pathways are integrated into the biologicalnetworks research environment linking them to abiological pathways provide intuitive views of the myriad of interactions involved in biological_processes a typical signaling_pathway for example can represent receptor binding_events protein_complexes phosphorylation reactions translocations and transcriptional_regulation usually depicted with a set of symbols with lines and arrows automated_detection of genes and proteins and inference of signaling_network architecture and dynamics from general as well as domain specific imaging data has been of increasing interest during last years these sophisticated methods were implemented only for a specific domain and do not provide public_services for extracted pathways analysis or a software for a broader use thus in spite of the importance of collecting and maintaining pathway_information with the attendant biological annotations and experimental_data pathways construction curation and integration to whom correspondence should be addressed with public_databases and experimental_data remain a tedious and time consuming task a small number of systems have considered the issue of figure retrieval sub cellular_location image finder that retrieves fluorescence micrograph images from a single journal corpus biotext and yale image finder yif that performs text queries of figures legends none of these methods analyzes information embedded in the image itself nor do they compare with and supplement knowledge available in public_databases and pudmed here we present the system that addresses the problems of extraction comparison searching and managing biological_knowledge embedded in pathway imaging data the system provides a repository of freely_available pathways recognized from imaging data the repository allows biologists to explore search over pathway_components in open_access publications and world_wide www and construct users pathways and interaction networks these pathways can be visualized and dynamically analyzed in concert with data integrated from other public_databases and literature
