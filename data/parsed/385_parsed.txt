genetics_and a novel copy_number kernel association test with application to autism_spectrum studies motivation copy_number cnvs have been implicated in a variety of neurodevelopmen tal disorders including autism_spectrum intellectual_disability and schizophrenia recent_advances in high_throughput have enabled rapid discovery of many genetic_variants including cnvs as a result there is increasing interest in studying the role of cnvs in the etiology of many complex_diseases despite the availability of an unprecedented wealth of cnv data methods for testing association between cnvs and disease related traits are still underdeveloped due to the low prevalence and complicated multi_scale features of cnvs results we propose a novel cnv kernel association test ckat in this paper to address the low prevalence cnvs are first grouped into cnv regions cnvr then taking_into the multi_scale features of cnvs we first design a single cnv kernel which summarizes the similarity between two cnvs and next aggregate the single cnv kernel to a cnvr kernel which summarizes the similarity between two cnvrs finally association between cnvr and disease related traits is assessed by comparing the kernel_based similarity with the similarity in the trait using a score test for variance components in a random_effect we illustrate the proposed ckat using simulations and show that ckat is more powerful than existing_methods while always being able to control the type_i we also apply ckat to a real_dataset examining the association between cnv and autism_spectrum which demonstrates the potential usefulness of the proposed method availability_and a r package to implement the proposed ckat method is available atcnvs are deletions and duplications of dna_segments in the genome ranging in size from one kilobase kb to several megabases mb which represent the most common form of structural genetic_variation in human_genome the advent_of technologies such as comparative_genomic cgh and single_nucleotide snps microarrays has enabled rapid discovery of genetic_variants including cnvs as more and more cnvs have been detected throughout the human_genome there is a growing appreciation for studying their potential role in the etiology of many conditions and diseases including autism_spectrum asd intellectual_disability schizophrenia and many other neurodevelopment disorders understanding the relationship between cnvs and these diseases can contribute important new insights into the underlying genetics etiology and may further lead to effective means in prevention and treatments a useful means to study the complex relationship between cnvs and human health_conditions is through genetic_association a powerful mode of genetic_association is collapsing methods which study the association between a group of genetic_variants and traits such methods have been widely used in snps association analysis and rare_variants association analysis however these collapsing methods cannot be directly applied to cnv association analysis due to its unique features first snps are probe based in that different subjects have the same loci genotyped on the other hand cnvs are sample based in that different cnvs can be detected in different subjects it is very common that a particular rare cnv is detected in few subjects while is absent in the rest in other words a typical snp data matrix is a regular matrix while a cnv data matrix is irregular in that different rows samples have different length of columns cnvs a snps collapsing method usually combines multiple columns together for analysis however it is not clear how cnvs should be grouped together in the irregular data matrix second it is more complicated to model the effect of cnvs than that of snps snps usually takes values in an additive_model representing the copy of minor alleles on the other hand cnvs has multi_scale features including a start position an end position and a type deletion or duplication phenotypic heterogeneity a deletion cnv and a duplication cnv can have different effects are often observed also it has been hypothesized that both cnv size length and cnv type deletion or duplication may affect the disease risk due to all these reasons it is not straightforward to extend most current snp or rare_variant collapsing methods to cnv association analysis one way to fix those aforementioned difficulties is to break the multi_dimensional cnv information into pieces and to apply some collapsing methods on a certain piece for example the recent cnv collapsing random_effects test ccret treats the length of cnv as fix effect and the cnv dosage copy_number as random effect of interest to test for association with traits kernel_based collapsing methods can be easily applied to the cnv dosage despite its feasibility the interpretation of this method may be slightly different from classical cnv association analysis it is no longer the cnv effect on the disease risk but the cnv dosage effect on the disease risk conditioned on the cnv length alternatively instead of breaking the multi_scale cnv information into pieces the presence absence analysis is often used in casecontrol_studies typically a contingency_table is created based on counting whether a cnv is detected in a subject and then a statistical_test such as fishers_exact is applied to evaluate the association this kind of analysis only utilizes the presence absence information of a cnv and ignores other information such as cnv type and size thus neither ccret nor fishers_exact exploits the full information in a cnv in this study to utilize both type and size information in a cnv we propose the cnv kernel association test ckat we first design a single cnv kernel which accounts for the multi_scale features of a cnv intuitively speaking the kernel is used as a similarity measure between two cnvs to overcome low prevalence of cnvs we pool cnvs together to form cnv regions cnvrs and carefully aggregate the single cnv kernel to a cnvr kernel which describes the similarity between two cnvrs compared with a single cnv more samples are likely to have cnvs detected in a region which can makes the cnvr kernel more informative finally association between cnvr and the trait is tested by comparing the similarity in cnvrs captured by the cnvr kernel to that in the trait in particular the trait we considered in this paper is disease status if the cnvr similarity between two patients or two healthy_controls is consistently higher than the cnvr similarity between one patient and one healthy control then it may suggest existence of association between the cnvr and the disease risk statistically speaking the similarity comparison is evaluated in a logistic random_effect and the p value for the association test is also analytically calculated via a variance_component score test in the logistic regression_framework using extensive_simulation we demonstrate that the proposed ckat always has correct type_i and high power in a wide_range of settings finally the ckat is applied to a real asd data example which provides new insights and formal testing results for previous observations
