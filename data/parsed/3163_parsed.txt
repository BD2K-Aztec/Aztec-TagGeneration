multi population gwa mapping via multi task regularized_regression motivation population heterogeneity through admixing of different founder populations can produce spurious_associations in genome_wide that are linked to the population_structure rather than the phenotype since samples from the same population generally co evolve different populations may or may not share the same genetic_underpinnings for the seemingly common phenotype our goal is to develop a unified_framework for detecting causal genetic_markers through a joint association analysis of multiple_populations results based on a multi task regression principle we present a multi population group_lasso algorithm using l l regularized_regression for joint association analysis of multiple_populations that are stratified either via population survey or computational estimation our algorithm combines information from genetic_markers across populations to identify causal markers it also implicitly accounts for correlations between the genetic_markers thus enabling better control over false_positive joint analysis across populations enables the detection of weak associations common to all populations with greater_power than in a separate analysis of each population at the same time the regression_based framework allows causal alleles that are unique to a subset of the populations to be correctly_identified we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on hapmap simulated and lactase_persistence datasets where we significantly_outperform state of the art methods with greater_power for detecting weak associations and reduced spurious_associations availability software will be available atassociation mapping has recently become a popular_approach to discover the genetic causes of many complex_diseases such as cancer asthma and diabetes a typical genome_wide association gwa study involves examining genotype data often singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps collected over millions of genetic_markers in search for an association with the given phenotype such as disease outcome or disease related quantitative_traits where a very small fraction of the markers are linked to the phenotype thus the main_challenge is to maximize the power for identifying causal alleles while suppressing false_positives we consider the problem of taking_advantage of the population_structure in the samples to increase the power of an association analysis it has been observed that population heterogeneity arising from admixing of ancestor populations almost always exists at different levels in any genotype data and is often correlated with to whom correspondence should be addressed the geographical_distribution of the individuals for example it has been shown that such heterogeneity is present in the hapmap data across european asian and african_populations and heterogeneity at a finer scale within european_ancestry has been found in many genomic_regions in the uk samples of wellcome_trust wtccc dataset wellcome_trust although the standard assumption in existing_approaches for association_mapping is that the effects of causal_mutations are likely to be common across multiple_populations the individuals in the same population or geographical region tend to co evolve and are likely to possess a population specific causal allele for the same phenotype for example reported that the lactase_persistence phenotype is caused by different mutations in africans and europeans in addition the same genetic_variation has been observed to be correlated with gene_expression levels with different association strengths across different hapmap populations our goal is to be able to leverage information across multiple_populations to find causal markers in a multi population association study in this section we compare the performance of the mpgl with those of previously_developed methods such as single snp association tests without controlling for population_stratification gc eigenstrat lasso for a pooled dataset of individuals from all populations and lasso for structured association lasso sa as discussed in section we perform an extensive simulation_study under various scenarios using datasets simulated from hapmap genotypes and demonstrate our method on a real_dataset the lactase_persistence phenotype with the wtccc genotypes
