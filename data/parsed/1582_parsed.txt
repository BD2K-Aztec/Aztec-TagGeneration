sequence_analysis enrich software for analysis of protein_function by enrichment and depletion of variants measuring the consequences of mutation in proteins is critical to understanding their function these measurements are essential in such applications as protein_engineering drug_development protein design and genome sequence_analysis recently high_throughput has been coupled to assays of protein activity enabling the analysis of large_numbers of mutations in parallel we present enrich a tool for analyzing such deep mutational scanning data enrich identifies all unique variants mutants of a protein in high_throughput sequencing_datasets and can correct for sequencing_errors using overlapping paired_end enrich uses the frequency of each variant before and after selection to calculate an enrichment ratio which is used to estimate fitness enrich provides an interactive interface to guide users it generates user accessible output for downstream_analyses as well as several visualizations of the effects of mutation on function thereby allowing the user to rapidly quantify and comprehend sequencefunction relationships understanding how variations in protein_sequence relate to function is of fundamental_importance measurement of protein activity is critical to engineer protein_function to understand how mutations relate to disease and to gain insight into catalytic_mechanisms efforts to parallelize measurement of protein activity rely on selection for a desired function present within a library of variants of a protein of interest using a display based system that directly links a proteins activity to its encoding dna_sequence selection for function e g ligand_binding catalytic_activity or stability alters the population of displayed proteins and thus their associated dna_molecules dna sequences_encoding highly functional_variants
