gene_expression shrinkage estimation of dispersion in negative_binomial for rna_seq experiments with small_sample motivation rna_seq experiments produce digital counts of reads that are affected by both biological and technical variation to distinguish the systematic changes in expression between conditions from noise the counts are frequently modeled by the negative_binomial however in experiments with small_sample the per gene estimates of the dispersion parameter are unreliable method we propose a simple and effective approach for estimating the dispersions first we obtain the initial estimates for each gene using the method of moments second the estimates are regularized i e shrunk towards a common value that minimizes the average squared difference between the initial estimates and the shrinkage estimates the approach does not require extra modeling assumptions is easy to compute and is compatible with the exact test of differential_expression results we evaluated the proposed approach using simulated and experimental_datasets and compared its performance with that of currently popular packages edger deseq bayseq bbseq and samseq for these datasets sseq performed favorably for experiments with small_sample in sensitivity specificity and computational time whole transcriptome shotgun_sequencing rna_seq technology quantifies gene_expression in biological_samples in counts of transcript reads_mapped to the genes accurate and comprehensive it has made a major impact on genomic_research one common_goal of rna_seq experiments is to detect differentially_expressed i e genes for which the counts of reads change between conditions more systematically than as expected by random chance statistical_methods for detecting differentially_expressed must reflect the experimental_design and appropriately account for the stochastic variation moreover many rna_seq experiments serve as high_throughput of a small number of samples with the goal of subsequent experimental_validation therefore the analysis must handle a relatively small number of biological_replicates a variety of statistical_methods and software has recently been proposed for detecting differentially_expressed these include deseq edger bayseq samseq bbseq we briefly overview these methods we further propose a direct and effective approach for characterizing the variation in the counts of reads which improves the sensitivity_and of detecting differentially_expressed for experiments with small_sample we support this approach with an open_source r based software_package sseq in addition to sseq the following versions of the existing packages were used edger v deseq v bayseq v bbseq v samseq as part of the r package samr v for sseq all the datasets were analyzed with the exact test and analyses of the hammer and the tuch datasets accounted for their experimental_designs for edger and deseq the datasets with two group comparisons were analyzed with the exact test and hammer and tuch datasets were analyzed with the glm based_approaches for edger the estimatecommondisp function in an older version of edger package v was used to analyze unreplicated datasets for deseq the option fittypelocal was used to estimate the per group variance the default_parameters were used otherwise see supplementary_materials for details and representative r scripts in this manuscript we advocated a model that specifies free pergene dispersion parameters in the negative_binomial for counts of rna_seq we also advocated a biased estimation of these parameters which can reduce the variance of the estimates and minimize the overall mse biased estimation is different from specifying a probability model such as in deseq that assumes a true systematic relationship of the true variance and the true mean it is particularly useful for experiments with a small_sample where the systematic relationship may be difficult to evaluate the shrinkage estimates are easy to compute avoid iterative estimation minimize the potential for overfitting and do not require extra computation time they are compatible with the exact test of differential_expression for the datasets in this manuscript sseq consistently had a similar or a higher sensitivity_and of detecting differential_expression than the existing_methods the approach can be generalized to express the dependence of the dispersions on the expected value or on other covariates such as guanine cytosine gc_content or gene_ontology sseq edger deseq bayseq bbseqp value p

desired patterns are high areas under the avsb curves and avsa curves that are at or below the degree line estimation of dispersion in negative_binomial sseq can produce meaningful_results in under replicated rnaseq screens however we stress that rna_seq screens do not eliminate the biological_variation in gene_expression equation as evidenced byand the under replicated screens have lower reproducibility as compared with the replicated studies multiple biological_replicates are necessary to adequately assess the full extent of the variation in the biological system therefore the under replicated screens can only be conducted when followed by a rigorous experimental_validation with complementary technologies and adequate sample_size
