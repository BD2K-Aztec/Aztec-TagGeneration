systems_biology silver an efficient tool for stable_isotope lc_ms data quantitative analysis with quality_control methods with the advance of experimental_technologies different stable_isotope methods have been widely_applied to quantitative_proteomics here we present an efficient tool named silver for processing the stable_isotope mass_spectrometry data silver implements novel methods for quality_control of quantification at spectrum peptide and protein levels respectively several new quantification confidence filters and indices are used to improve the accuracy of quantification results the performance of silver was verified and compared with maxquant and proteome discoverer using a large_scale dataset and two standard datasets the results suggest that silver shows high_accuracy and robustness while consuming much less processing time additionally silver provides user_friendly interfaces for parameter setting result visualization manual validation and some useful statistics analyses availability_and silver and its source codes are freely_available under the gnu_general v at http mass_spectrometry ms has been applied in proteomics research for years the great advantages in resolution sensitivity and accuracy make ms the dominating technology in proteomics as the technology improves ms based quantitative_proteomics has become an important research field in proteomics among the strategies developed for quantitative_proteomics stable_isotope strategies have been widely used thanks to their high_accuracy and precision recently several software_tools have been developed for stable_isotope quantification such as msquant and census the well known software_package maxquant embedded with its own search_engine named andromeda as well as a newly published quantification pipeline isoquant which was designed especially for stable_isotope by amino_acids silac however there has been little attention to quantitative quality_control among these tools and there is hardly any proper algorithm focused on this issue on the other hand the rapidly_growing amount of large_scale quantitative proteomics_data requires faster and more efficient tools here we present a new efficient tool named silver for stable_isotope data analysis with special_considerations for quality_control of quantification silver introduces novel quantification confidence filters and indices which finally result in accurate and robust quantification for stable_isotope experiments meanwhile silver is fast and flexible by supporting different types of ms data such as the original raw files and the mzxml format files silver takes the quality_control results of peptideprophet or pepdistiller as the input and provides user_friendly interfaces for parameter setting result visualization manual validation and some useful statistical_analyses silver was developed for fast and accurate quantification of stable_isotope data the quantitative_accuracy of silver was evaluated and compared with maxquant v and proteome discoverer v thermo scientific using a large_scale dataset named maxquant dataset as well as two standard datasets n and o labeling with different labeling ratios for maxquant dataset only commonly quantified proteins by the three tools were evaluated for an objective comparison as shown in supplementary the median ratio of silvers result is the closest to the theoretical value compared with the other two software_packages for o labeling dataset silver performs as well as maxquant for the labeling data and its results are closer to the theoretical ratio for the labeling data supplementary whats more silver can also handle n labeling data that is another advantage over maxquant and proteome discoverer there are three different ratios h l in the n labeling dataset the protein ratio medians are all close to the theoretical_values suggesting the high_accuracy and sensitivity of silver supplementary these results demonstrate that silver is able to handle large_scale complex stable_isotope data and displays a high quantitative_accuracy and sensitivity despite data complexity supplementary methods in addition the quantification processing time of the three software_tools is compared on maxquant dataset as shown in supplementary table s the time consumed by silver is nearly one third of that consumed by maxquant and even nearly one tenth of that of proteome discoverer under the same computing conditions more details are provided in supplementary methods
