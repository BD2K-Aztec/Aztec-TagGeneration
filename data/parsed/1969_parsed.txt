systems_biology genenetweaver in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network_inference motivation over the last decade numerous methods have been developed for inference of regulatory_networks from gene_expression data however accurate and systematic evaluation of these methods is hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated analysis of network_predictions on such benchmarks results here we describe a novel and comprehensive method for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network_inference available to the community as an open_source called genenetweaver gnw in addition to the generation of detailed dynamical_models of gene_regulatory to be used as benchmarks gnw provides a network motif analysis that reveals systematic prediction_errors thereby indicating potential ways of improving inference methods the accuracy of network_inference is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision_recall and receiver_operating we show how gnw can be used to assess the performance and identify the strengths_and of six inference methods furthermore we used gnw to provide the international dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods dream competition with three network_inference challenges dream dream and dream availability gnw is available at http gnw sourceforge net along with its java source_code user_manual and supporting data a challenging issue in systems_biology is the development of computational_tools for the reverse_engineering of gene_regulatory from quantitative experimental_data over the last decade high_throughput assays for mrna_expression have opened the door to the inference of regulatory_networks by allowing simultaneous measurements of the expression levels of thousands of genes technologies such as spotted microarrays and oligonucleotide chips have enabled to whom correspondence should be addressed genome_wide quantification of differential gene_expression and more recently short_read sequencing_technologies such as rna_seq have provided more precise quantification of mrna_levels researchers have proposed a plethora of methods for reverse_engineering the complex network of interactions between the genes and their rna and protein products also called regulatory program from spatial and temporal high_throughput regulatory_networks are often represented as directed signed graphs in which nodes represent genes or transcription_factors tfs in this context edges correspond to enhancing or inhibitory regulations that affect gene transcription_rates network_inference rely on various computational_approaches such as correlation mutual_information mi ordinary_differential ode_models bayesian_networks or hybrid algorithms numerous methods have been developed for inference of gene_regulatory however relatively little effort has been put into evaluating the performance of those methods on adequate benchmarks so_far three main strategies have been proposed to generate benchmark networks a first strategy consists in evaluating network_predictions made by reverse_engineering algorithms on well studied in vivo pathways from model_organisms however those networks are incomplete maps of the physical_interactions in the cell that are responsible for cellular_functions and using them as benchmarks imply making error when evaluating network_predictions another strategy consists of genetically engineering synthetic in vivo networks the main_drawback of this strategy is that only a few small networks are available yet another strategy consists in developing in silico gene_regulatory that can be simulated to produce artificial gene_expression data the simulation of in silico networks has the advantages of being fast easily reproducible and less expensive than biological_experiments a few instances of small in silico networks with handcrafted topologies have been proposed as benchmarks for reverse_engineering algorithms more recently several generators have been developed to automate the construction of in silico regulatory_networks including up to thousands of genes to be used as benchmark networks for reverse_engineering algorithms page we assessed the performance of six inference methods to illustrate benchmarking and performance profiling of network_inference using gnw we first describe how to generate suitable network benchmark suites for the testing of various hypotheses specifically we designed benchmark suites to show how the performance of inference methods is affected by different sizes and structural_properties of regulatory_networks in addition we show how gnw can help to identify the most informative type of gene_expression data that a given inference_method could use to achieve the best possible reconstruction from in vivo experiments finally we introduce the dream network_inference challenge we generated which has been used to assess the performance of many inference methods we propose a comprehensive and powerful framework for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network_inference we implemented this framework as an opensource tool called genenetweaver gnw biologically_plausible network_structures are generated by extracting modules from known biological interaction networks such as those of e coli and the yeast s cerevisiae network_structures are then endowed with detailed dynamical_models of gene_regulation describing both transcription and translation processes transcriptional_regulation is modeled using a thermodynamic approach accounting for both independent additive and synergistic multiplicative interactions in addition our models account for stochastic molecular noise as well as experimental_noise observed in microarrays the generated in silico benchmark networks can be simulated in gnw to reproduce wild_type knockout null_mutant knockdown heterozygous and multifactorial perturbation gene_expression experiments as an example of the application we have used gnw to generate the target networks for three international competitions on gene network reverse_engineering dream dream and dream in total teams have submitted over network_predictions on gnw generated networks making gnw one of the most widely used benchmark generators by the community in contrast to the previously_proposed benchmark generators gnw also integrates tools for systematic evaluation of the predictions from inference methods on benchmark networks a unique feature of gnw is the ability to perform a network motif analysis from a set of network_predictions and their corresponding benchmark networks the network motif analysis reveals systematic prediction_errors made by inference_method on specific network_motifs thereby indicating potential ways of network_reconstruction improvements the accuracy of network_inference is assessed using standard metrics such as pr and roc_curves we have used gnw to generate in silico benchmark suites to assess the performance and identify the strengths_and of six network_inference we show that z_score and the inference methods developed by pinna et_al and yip et_al make more accurate network_predictions than the two widely used methods aracne and clr this good performance is achieved apparently because those methods target the inference of causal_relationships between genes however aracne and clr do not require systematic knockout gene_expression data which are not always available in practice to infer undirected networks yet aracne clr and genie methods can be applied to infer regulatory_networks even if no systematic knockout or knockdown experiments are provided furthermore our results show that at some point simply giving more expression data to inference methods does not necessarily imply performance improvement therefore the integration of additional information about the target regulatory_networks should be considered for instance using prior_knowledge about the network_structures the novelty of gnw is that it additionally provides a unique network motif analysis which we used to show that the structural_properties of the target regulatory_networks affect the performance of inference methods we observed that the performances of z_score and the methods developed byare impeded by the presence of cascade motifs in the target networks thus we show that those methods make significantly less accurate network_predictions on the yeast s cerevisiae whose structure includes more cascade motifs than e coli transcriptional network_structure finally we also provide evidence that in silico benchmark networks can be used to identify the most informative type of gene_expression data that a given inference_method could use to achieve the best possible reconstruction from in vivo experiments
