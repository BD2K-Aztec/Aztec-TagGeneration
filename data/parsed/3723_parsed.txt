profet feature engineering captures high_level protein functions motivation the amount of sequenced_genomes and proteins is growing at an unprecedented pace unfortunately manual_curation and functional knowledge lag behind homologous inference often fails at labeling proteins with diverse functions and broad classes thus identifying high_level protein functionality remains_challenging we hypothesize that a universal feature engineering_approach can yield classification of high_level functions and unified properties when combined with machine_learning without requiring external databases or alignment results in this study we present a novel bioinformatics toolkit called profet protein feature engineering toolkit profet extracts hundreds of features covering the elementary biophysical and sequence derived attributes most features capture statistically informative patterns in addition different representations of sequences and the amino_acids alphabet provide a compact compressed set of features the results from profet were incorporated in data analysis_pipelines implemented in python and adapted for multi genome_scale analysis profet was applied on established and novel protein benchmark_datasets involving classification for a variety of binary and multi class tasks the results show state of the art performance the extracted_features show excellent biological interpretability the success of profet applies to a wide_range of high_level functions such as subcellular_localization structural_classes and proteins with unique functional properties e g neuropeptide precursors thermophilic and nucleic_acid binding profet allows easy universal discovery of new target_proteins as well as understanding the features underlying different high_level protein functions availability_and profet source_code and the datasets used are freely_available at https github com ddofer profet the most used approaches in protein classification rely on distance measures between sequences based on various alignment_methods e g smith_waterman blast with the growth in the amounts and diversity of protein_sequences more sophisticated methods have been introduced e g pssm profile profile hmm hmm these methods are based on multiple_sequence for improving remote_homologs detection incorporating d structure as a seed for the statistical_models further improved the quality of protein_domains and families e g pfam currently there are such models interpro that cover of all sequences in uniprotkb function assignment is gained from mapping interpro models to the assessment of large_scale automatic protein functional_annotations and the contribution of alternative_approaches toward this task have been extensively discussed e g despite the strength of the model based_methods in many instances the local sequence_based methods_fail to reliably assign a function this is best demonstrated by the limitation in classifying proteins by their d folds notably the classification of some biological niches is especially suited for feature representation for example routine annotation tools fail to confidently assign function for bioactive_peptides and short proteins a number of previous_studies focus on feature_extraction from whole protein_sequences as a starting input for machine_learning ml approaches structural benchmark from scop and cath are frequently used to assess the predictive ml methods specialized predictors have been presented for structural tasks including secondary_structure solvent_accessibility stability disordered_regions domains and more ml approaches have proven suitable to classify protein properties beyond their d structure svmprot was tested on preselected functional families from pfam naive biophysical features classification outperformed simple sequence_based for a number of protein_families however the most likely advantage of the feature and pattern based ml approach is toward high_level functionality e g examples for such predictions include proteinprotein_interactions discriminating outer_membrane membrane topology subcellular_localization and more the strongest features learned by the ml classifiers often expose biologically_important motifs in this study we focus on the ability of elementary biophysical features together with a rich set of engineered representation of proteins to classify high_level protein functions these features are suited for both supervised and unsupervised classification our goal is to illustrate the importance of profet protein feature engineering toolkit as a one size fits all framework for representing whole protein_sequence we present a universal modular workflow for protein_function classification i feature generation and extraction from primary sequences profet ii application of the extracted_features in a ml framework for binary or multi class partition iii presentation of discriminative classification power iv identification of patterns and features that underlie the successful classification feature_selection the main drawbacks in existing sequence_based are i some functions cannot be detected by sequence_based ii current statistical_models mostly capture local patterns rather than high_level function and iii rare sequences or those that have very few homologs cannot be successfully used for inference or construction
