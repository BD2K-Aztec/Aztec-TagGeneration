two group comparisons of zero inflated intensity values the choice of test_statistic matters motivation a special characteristic of data from molecular_biology is the frequent occurrence of zero intensity values which can arise either by true absence of a compound or by a signal that is below a technical limit of detection results while so_called two part tests compare mixture distributions between groups one part tests treat the zero inflated distributions as left censored the left inflated mixture_model combines these two approaches both types of distributional assumptions and combinations of both are considered in a simulation_study to compare power and estimation of log_fold we discuss issues of application using an example from peptidomics the considered tests generally perform best in scenarios satisfying their respective distributional assumptions in the absence of distributional assumptions the two part wilcoxon_test or the empirical likelihood_ratio is recommended assuming a log normal subdistribution the left inflated mixture_model provides estimates for the proportions of the two considered types of zero intensities availability r code is available atthe appropriateness of a statistical_test for detecting differential_expression in omics experiments e g microrna metabolomics or peptidomics is primarily determined by the data distribution after pre_processing intensity values of such experiments typically show a distribution consisting of a certain proportion of values at a point mass at zero point mass values pmvs and a continuous component distinguish between two types of pmvs biological pmvs bpmvs meaning that the compounds intensity is absent and technical pmvs where a compound is present but its signal is below the limit of detection lod data taken from http mosaiques diagnostics de diapatpcms mosaiquescms front content php idcat will be used to demonstrate the occurrence of pmvs see urine_samples from patients with chronic_kidney ckd estimated_glomerular and samples from control patients estimated_glomerular are available the dataset comprises peptides of randomly_selected ckd and control patients across all peptides the median pmv proportion amounts to quartiles in the control and quartiles in the ckd group for the majority of peptides the pmv proportions in the two groups are v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com close to each other quartiles of the intra compound difference of the number of pmvs are and shows histograms for two selected peptides similarly to the definition of biological and technical pmvs taylor and pollard distinguish between true zeros and truncated values where the truncation results either from signals below the lod or from a lower_bound on meaningful signal set by the researcher examples of such lower bounds are given infor microarray_data the same authors also discuss dna_methylation data where negative results due to only partially or un methylated test regions would correspond to bpmvs in our nomenclature bpmvs are also comparable to the rancid part of the sample in hallstrom in typical omics experiments both biological and technical pmvs may occur a biological_phenomenon may lead to highly_expressed compounds in one part of the samples but to low or absent signals in another part where different compounds are activated instead this could be caused by sporadic posttranslational_modifications which do not directly connect to the investigated experimental_condition as a result for many compounds the observed distribution of intensities will be bimodal with a lower mode exactly at the point mass and an upper mode characterizing the location of the continuous i e highly_expressed part of the distribution tpmvs may have two reasons first in some compounds the distribution of intensities may be characterized by a high variance and a low mean but without bimodality in these compounds we will find a high proportion of values below detection_limit second it is also plausible that the true intensity of a compound is just above the detection_limit but is not correctly_detected because of technical reasons such as interference e g adsorption of the compound or signal suppression or misinterpretation of the signal e g caused by incorrect charge assignment or error in monoisotopic mass determination therefore statistical_test procedures for comparing omics_data between groups have to accommodate the information contained not only in the continuous part of the distribution but also the information present in the biological as well as in the tpmvs depending on whether the pmvs are considered as technical or biological the distribution of the continuous part is more adequately described by a left censored or by a fully observed uncensored distribution according to the observed distributions of compounds in two groups taylor and pollard as well ashave distinguished between consonant and dissonant compounds the former are characterized by exhibiting the higher pmv proportion in the group with the lower mean in the continuous part while in the latter case the group with the higher pmv proportion also has the higher mean this definition does not distinguish between technical and biological pmvs however the occurrence of tpmvs naturally corresponds to consonant compounds whereas bpmvs generally allow for both types in our dataset we found consonant and dissonant peptides have equal pmv proportions an example of each type is shown in there is extensive literature independent of the context of omics_data on two group comparisons for data including values below a lod a thorough overview is given by who investigate the following test_statistics among others various ad_hoc approaches to impute pmvs before applying a t test tobit models for an explicit modeling of left censored distributions and log_rank type tests applied to the flipped and thus right censored_data see also in all these tests in some way or another the pmvs are seen as being an implicit part of the full distribution instead of as one of two independent components of a mixture distribution in this sense we will denote these tests as one part tests and view them as primarily targeting distributions that contain tpmvs up to now the test_statistics explicitly proposed for omics_data comprise only two part tests these contain two independent components that contribute to a pooled test_statistic one measuring differences in the pmv proportion and the other one in the continuous subdistribution two part test_statistics are by construction adequate for cases where pmvs are primarily assumed as biological furthermore the non parametric empirical likelihood_ratio elrt proposed byis implicitly of a two part nature the only two one part tests investigated as competitors by these authors are the t test and wilcoxons ranksum test the same holds for other comparison studies such as that of the goal of this paper is to evaluate the various statistical_tests proposed for comparing distributions with zero inflation under scenarios allowing for both types of pmvs to our best knowledge no simulation_study has yet been performed that directly compares two part and one part tests for the setting of omics_data controlling for biological as well as technical pmvs simultaneously the following section gives an overview of the test_statistics considered for comparison in this paper the subsequent two sections present the results of a comprehensive simulation_study and of the application to the above_mentioned real peptidomics data the final section will discuss strengths and limitations of our study and draw some conclusions in this section the previously_introduced and evaluated statistical_tests are applied to the motivating dataset presented in the introduction for this purpose we first restrict the dataset to peptides with a pmv proportion below ignoring group labels the restricted dataset contains peptides with a median pmv proportion at quartiles to including consonant and dissonant peptides and with equal pmv proportions shows the pair_wise correlations between the uncorrected p values of the discussed tests spearman_correlation of at least are observed within the group of onepart tests with a few exceptions as well as within the group of all two part tests and the lim lrt the following method for controlling the false_discovery fdr is used to adjust for multiple testing among the peptides for various thresholds a we estimated false_discovery using are the empirical cumulative distribution functions of all p values across all peptides in the restricted original dataset and across all peptides and all permutations respectively and p is the estimated proportion of genes for which the null_hypothesis applies this procedure resembles the one outlined in kerr except of using f p a instead of a in the numerator finally q values based on these estimates of the fdr are given presents the numbers of compounds declared significant based on a fdr of as expected from our simulations the twopart tests and the lim lrt show a higher proportion of dissonant peptides among those declared significant than the other tests as seen from the kappa_coefficients inthere is a lower overlap of significant compounds between the lim lrt and the group of two part tests than within the two part tests to assess whether technical or biological pmvs play_a in the set of peptides we use the pmv proportion estimates from the lim models the median number of technical and biological pmvs is quartiles and quartiles respectively in the ckd group and quartiles and quartiles respectively in the control_group across all peptides the median of the proportion of biological among all pmvs within a given peptide is quartiles in the ckd and quartiles in the control_group however we have learned from supplementarythat the proportion of bpmvs might be overestimated in the respective group with the lower location parameter in addition to the prevailing but not exclusive biological nature of the pmvs in this dataset the continuous parts largely exhibit an approximate left censored log_normal graphical inspection results not shown thus the lim lrt and the two part tests including the elrt seem most appropriate for analysis the detailed results for the two example peptides presented inare shown in there are striking discrepancies between the two part tests and the lim lrt on the one hand and the one part tests on the other for the consonant peptide the tobitsensitivity specificity percent of peptides declared significant non significant in samples that are also significant non significant in the presented samples see_text shows that the agreement between subdistribution lfc estimates is generally high among the two part tests whereas there are large discrepancies with and among one part tests by construction the estimates of mt and t and those of w and elrt are identical the results for the top peptides selected by the lim lrt are summarized in supplementary it can be seen that the proportion of tpmvs among the selected peptides is disproportionately_high of the top peptides exhibit tpmvs in at least one group furthermore of these peptides are dissonant finally we re examined the same set of peptides with the same methods in larger groups of ckd cases and controls which contains the samples investigated so_far as a subsample as seen in the last two columns ofthe internal_consistency in terms of sensitivity relative to the larger groups is generally higher for one part tests and is smallest for the lim lrt this pattern is quite similar in three other randomly_selected samples results not shown specificity is generally around this paper tries to fill the gap between proposals for handling pmvs in the context of omics_data and those for general or other specific types of data showing a zero inflation phenomenon we applied several test_statistics in an extensive simulation_study and to a real_dataset we observed large differences between the results from one part and two part tests this is a direct consequence of their respective construction in the simulation_study we generated data simultaneously exhibiting biological and technical pmvs since it is plausible that a known or unknown underlying mechanism controls the binomial part independently from the continuous part and from the mechanism producing the tpmvs in contrast the dependency model by hallstrom tends to produce only consonant distributions despite two independent sources of pmvs it is clear from our investigations that the two considered types of pmvs have different implications for the operation characteristics of the considered tests all tests of the one part or the two part types explicitly serve only one type of pmv but may be more or less robust to the other our results show that one part tests give acceptable results for equal_proportions of bpmvs generally two part tests show higher tprs and the corresponding estimates have low bias depending on the proportion of tpmvs for a particular data analysis it may often be difficult to judge whether the observed pmvs are technical or biological the lim lrt offers a way to circumvent a decision between one part and two part tests by allowing for and explicitly estimating the proportion of both types of pmvs the interpretation of the measures of location corresponding to one part and two part tests is quite different for one part tests location measures and differences between groups calculated from them are based on the full distribution of values including the unobserved signals which are generally assumed as being leftcensored by contrast two part tests supply two separate estimates of group difference one for the pmv proportion and one corresponding to the difference between the group specific subdistributions of continuous values in estimating these group differences none of the two part tests distinguishes between technical and biological pmvs unlike the lim lrt by making a distributional assumption on the continuous subdistribution the lim lrt can provide such a distinction which can be useful in situations where both technical and biological pmvs occur the group difference in the pmv proportions estimated by the lim lrt only incorporates those pmvs that have been classified as biological we showed that the distinction between consonant and dissonant compounds has a large impact on test performance it is however unclear if investigators are at all interested in detecting dissonant compounds by rejecting a compound two part null_hypothesis as described in the introduction dissonant compounds of scientific interest could arise if several compounds are alternatively activated by the same biological_phenomenon this aspect however is more appropriately covered by testing whole sets of compounds instead of a single_compound at a time further investigations are needed to see whether the likelihood_ratio nature of the lim lrt allows for a useful extension along those lines this study did not consider other continuous distributions than the normal distribution on the log scale extensions in this direction have been investigated byfor two part tests and byfor the tobit model these authors observed that parametric test_statistics were fairly robust to other distributions we also did not consider different variability in the two groups and across compounds and set all variances in the simulations equal to one neither did we vary the lod across compounds or samples in analogy to tw we also investigated a truncated version of the t test see supplement with a performance close to that of tw results not shown in conclusion the two part wilcoxon_test and the elrt show good overall properties without any distributional assumptions for the continuous part they are recommendable if technical pmvs can be ruled_out beforehand if the assumption of a left censored log normal subdistribution is reasonable and technical pmvs are possible
