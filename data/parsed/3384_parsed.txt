orfanfinder automated identification of taxonomically restricted orphan genes motivation orphan genes also known as orfans are newly evolved genes in a genome that enable the organism to adapt to specific living environment the gene content of every sequenced_genome can be classified into different age_groups based on how widely narrowly a genes homo logs are distributed in the context of species taxonomy those having homologs restricted to organisms of particular taxonomic ranks are classified as taxonomically restricted orfans results implementing this idea we have developed an open_source program named orfanfinder and a free web_server to allow automated classification of a genomes gene content and identification of orfans at different taxonomic ranks orfanfinder and its web_server will contribute to the comparative_genomics field by facilitating the study of the origin of new genes and the emergence of lineage specific_traits in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes availability_and http cys orfans stand for orphan open_reading in addition to orfans in literature orphan genes are also known as new genes lineage_specific genes lsgs and taxonomically restricted genes trgs although some terms are used in very specific_contexts e g de_novo originated new genes orphan genes hereafter orfans are new inventions of a genome that enable the organism to adapt to its specific living environment they are fundamentally_important for the origin of new species and the emergence of lineage specific_traits e g morphological diversity metabolic innovation and pathogenicity orfans are usually identified by using sequence similarity_search tools such as blast the simple blast method tends to identify very narrowly distributed orfans and cannot classify orfans into groups of different ages therefore the phylogeny based_approach was developed to map blast hits onto a species phylogeny which allows identifying orfans of different ages one method using this approach required a wellaccepted species phylogeny often not available for non model_organisms another method termed phylostratigraphy approach also required a phylogeny which however is derived from the query species taxonomic lineage although the phylostratigraphy approach was recently shown to have some limitations it has been widely used to study orfans in various organisms e g however the phylogeny based_methods are more difficult to automate and often need human intervention here we present a new tool orfanfinder and its web_server orfanfinder is fully_automated and the results are completely reproducible while the algorithm behind orfanfinder is essentially based on the phylostratigraphy approach it is more strictly formulated for the purpose of complete automation to our knowledge orfanfinder is the only open_source computer software and the first online server for orfan identification and classification
