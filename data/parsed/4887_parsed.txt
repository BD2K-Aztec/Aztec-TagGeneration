walt fast and accurate read_mapping for bisulfite_sequencing whole_genome wgbs has emerged as the gold standard_technique in genome_scale studies of dna_methylation mapping reads from wgbs requires unique considerations that make the process more time consuming than in other sequencing_applications typical wgbs data_sets contain several hundred million_reads adding to this analysis challenge we present the walt tool for mapping wgbs reads walt uses a strategy of hashing periodic spaced seeds which leads to significant speedup compared with the most efficient methods currently available although many existing wgbs mappers slow down with read_length walt improves in speed importantly these speed gains do not sacrifice accuracy dna_methylation is essential for many biological_processes and is found altered in a variety of human_diseases technological_advances over the past_decade have enabled wholegenome bisulfite_sequencing wgbs which has become the goldstandard approach for studying cytosine c methylation due to its ability to quantify methylation_levels unambiguously for nearly all cs in mammalian_genomes treatment with sodium_bisulfite converts each unmethylated c into uracil which is reported as thymine t in sequenced_reads the most computationally_intensive step analysis of wgbs data is to map reads to the reference_genome the bisulfite_conversion makes mapping more complicated and each data_set typically includes hundreds of millions of reads in recent_years several mappers have been developed specifically for reads from bisulfite_sequencing which we refer to here as bisulfite reads these mappers use a variety of strategies for example bismark converts every c in the reads and the reference_genome to t then applies bowtie to map the converted reads to the converted reference_genome bsmap builds a pre compiled hash_table to minimize the cache miss latency when searching possible genome positions for k_mers bsmap also applies a bitwise masking method to efficiently count the number of mismatches for asymmetric conversion of c t existing_tools are not fast enough to map a large wgbs data_set in a day using a single processing core the challenge in mapping bisulfite reads is derived from two related sources accommodating the asymmetric conversion of c t and the reduced entropy of the alphabet i e nearly t here we present walt a new mapper for bisulfite reads walt is faster than existing_methods and has advantages in accuracy we assessed the performance of walt in comparison with bismark bsmap and other tools shown in supplementary_material all tests were run using identical intel_xeon processors using a single core details in supplementary_material we used three datasets srr srr and srr for this comparison evaluating both speed and accuracy all of them are paired_end data by illumina_hiseq the read_length reference_genome and number of reads in each dataset are shown in for the two human datasets shows a comparison of runtimes for walt bismark and bsmap walt is about faster than bismark and faster than bsmap in single_end mapping for paired_end walt is approximately faster than bismark and faster than bsmap walt does a look up for three seeds when reads have more than one mismatch but only one seed for exact_matches and two for one or two mismatches since in our experiments on the average and of reads are matched with and mismatch respectively the average number of lookups per read is only supplementary the arabidopsis_thaliana genome is relatively small leading to fewer candidates in each hash bucket even with this small genome walt nearly matches the speed of bsmap and is still approximately faster than bismark shows the runtime on reads with different lengths generated from srr supplementary walt runs faster on longer_reads while bismark and bsmap slow down significantly walt and bsmap both are based on hash_table method the time required to validate each candidate mapping location is proportional to the read_length however walt uses heavier seeds for longer_reads and gets less false_positive candidates while bsmap uses fixed seed length bismark uses bowtie to map the reads which essentially conducts an inexact search in a compressed suffix_array which is also more costly for longer_reads mapping accuracy is essential in wgbs as incorrect mapping may lead to bias in estimates of methylation_levels and other epigenomic features in downstream_analyses ambiguously mapping readsthose for which the best matching genome position is not uniqueare excluded from most analyses as their interpretation requires project specific considerations we used the program mrsfast with c t converted reads and reference_genome to obtain all possible mapping positions for all reads mrsfast is designed to produce all mappings this provided a ground_truth in measuring mapping accuracy for a uniquely mappable read as determined by mrsfast if the bisulfite mapper reports it as uniquely mapping then it counts as true_positive tp
