libra ligand_binding recognition application motivation in recent_years structural_genomics and ab_initio molecular_modeling activities are leading to the availability of a large number of structural_models of proteins whose biochemical function is not known the aim of this study was the development of a novel software_tool that given a proteins structural model predicts the presence and identity of active_sites and or ligand_binding results the algorithm implemented by ligand_binding recognition application libra is based on a graph_theory approach to find the largest subset of similar residues between an input protein and a collection of known functional sites the algorithm makes use of two predefined databases for active_sites and ligand_binding respectively derived from the catalytic_site atlas and the protein_data tests indicate that libra is able to identify the correct binding active_site in of the cases analyzed of which feature the identified site as ranking first as far as ligand_binding recognition is concerned libra outperforms other structure based ligand_binding detection_tools with which it has been compared availability_and the application developed in java se with a swing gui embedding a jmol applet can be run on any os equipped with a suitable java virtual_machine jvm and is available at the following url http www computationalbiology it software librav zip an important area of investigation in structural_biology related to protein_function recognition is the identification of ligand_binding on the surface of proteins this has a number of different applications ranging from function identification to drug_discovery current_tools implemented in software applications like ef seek g losa and apoc predict putative_binding of a given input protein by comparing the properties of its surface patches with those of known binding_sites in addition web_applications such as profunc provide similar predictions based on a combination of sequence and structural_information in this study libra a novel application employing a graph_theory approach for function recognition and ligand_binding detection is described libra is based on the comparison of an input protein_structure with a database of ligand_binding extracted from pdb besides the application has been also designed to overcome some
