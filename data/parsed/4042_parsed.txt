gene_expression rnaseqgui a gui for analysing rna_seq we present rnaseqgui r package a graphical_user gui for the identification_of across multiple biological conditions this r package includes some well known rna_seq tools available at www bioconductor org rnaseqgui package is not just a collection of some known methods and functions but it is designed to guide the user during the entire analysis process rnaseqgui package is mainly addressed to those users who have little experience with command_line software therefore thanks to rnaseqgui they can conduct analogous analyses using this simple graphical_interface moreover rnaseqgui is also helpful for those who are expert r users because it speeds up the usage of the included rnaseq methods drastically availability_and rnaseqgui package needs the rgtk graphical library to run there is a plethora of rna_seq tools available to study the difference of the gene_expression across multiple biological conditions see soneson and delorenzi for a review generally a complete analysis requires carrying out several steps using different methods and comparing their outputs to obtain more reliable and less biased results rnaseqgui is a tool that facilitates and speeds up the exploration of the rnaseq_data the usage of several rna_seq methods and the comparison of different results moreover rnaseqgui is a modular software this gives the user the possibility to customize the software for a specific type of study
