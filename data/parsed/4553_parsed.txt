tess an r package for efficiently simulating phylogenetic_trees and performing bayesian_inference of lineage diversification rates many fundamental_questions in evolutionary_biology entail estimating rates of lineage diversification speciationextinction that are modeled using birthdeath branching processes we leverage recent_advances in branching process theory to develop a flexible bayesian_framework for specifying diversification modelswhere rates are constant vary continuously or change episodic ally through timeand implement numerical_methods to estimate_parameters of these models from molecular phylogenies even when species sampling is incomplete we enable both statistical_inference and efficient_simulation under these models we also provide robust_methods for comparing the relative and absolute fit of competing branching process models to a given tree thereby providing rigorous tests of biological_hypotheses regarding patterns and processes of lineage diversification availability_and the source_code for tess is freely_available cran r pro ject org_web tess stochastic branching process models e g birthdeath models describe the process of diversification that gave rise to a given study tree and include parameters such as the rate of speciation and extinction statistical_analysis of lineage diversification rates involves i simulating trees under null and alternative_hypotheses ii estimating parameters in e g a bayesian_framework and iii evaluating the relative and absolute fit of candidate models these considerations motivated our development of tess an r package for statistical_inference of lineage diversification rates that allows researchers to address three fundamental_questions i what are the rates of the process that gave rise to my study tree ii have diversification rates changed through time in my study tree iii is there evidence that my study tree experienced mass extinction we compare tess to other software in the accompanying vignette http cran r project org_web tess
