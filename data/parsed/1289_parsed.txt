systems_biology decompositions of large_scale biological_systems based on dynamical_properties motivation given a large_scale biological_network represented as an influence graph in this article we investigate possible decompositions of the network aimed at highlighting specific dynamical_properties results the first decomposition we study consists in finding a maximal directed acyclic subgraph of the network which dynamically corresponds to searching for a maximal open_loop subsystem of the given system another dynamical property investigated is strong monotonicity we propose two methods to deal with this property both aimed at decomposing the system into strongly monotone subsystems but with different structural_characteristics one method tends to produce a single large strongly monotone component while the other typically generates a set of smaller disjoint strongly monotone subsystems one of the outstanding challenges that systems_biology is currently facing is to provide the right tools for the investigation of the dynamical_behavior of the large_scale networks used to represent complex_biological such as gene_regulatory signaling_pathways and chains of metabolic_reactions even if our knowledge of the interactions among the molecular_species involved in these systems is growing at a fast pace the details of the dynamics that they describe are seldom available and often unlikely to be obtainable in a near future what is often more plausible to assume is that only an influence graph is available for these networks an influence graph is a signed graph where an edge represents the action of a variable on another variable and the signs may have the meaning of activatory inhibitory action or may simply represent the signature of the jacobian linearization of a non linear vector_field which is unknown but sign constant over the entire state_space common forms of the kinetics such as mass action and michaelismenten normally obey to this condition in choosing this level of detail for our networks we are guided by an abundant literature see e g milo to whom correspondence should be addressed thieffry important dynamical problems that can be investigated on an influence graph include compute the equilibria of the system investigate the stability properties of the dynamics identify the largest open_loop subsystem of a given system study the monotonicity and strong monotonicity properties of the dynamics and select a minimal intervention set for medical_treatment in this article we are interested in the problems and of the list above in graph_theoretical terms finding the largest open_loop subsystem corresponds to identifying a maximum_size directed_acyclic dag within a network by dropping all feedback_loops in the computer science literature this is called the minimum feedback arc set problem and it is well known to be np_hard although several heuristic methods are already available for it the novel algorithm we propose in this article has the advantage that available a priori_knowledge on the open_loop part of the system can be easily taken into account when computing a maximal dag we will show in the large_scale examples of section that the performances of our algorithm are comparable to those of the best heuristics in a series of papers by e sontag and colleagues it was shown that influence graphs can be used to study an important property of dynamical_systems namely monotonicity monotone systems have nice properties of order in their dynamical_behavior for example they neither admit stable periodic orbits nor chaotic behavior moreover for strongly monotone systems i e monotone systems whose graph is irreducible see smith hirsch theorem states that almost all bounded solutions converge to the set of equilibria the concept is particularly attracting for biological_networks because it is well known that these systems though complex have indeed outstanding stability properties are largely devoid of spurious sustained oscillations and are definitively not chaotic hence the paradigm of monotonicity has gained some momentum in recent_years and there is by now a consistent literature on using thesepage
