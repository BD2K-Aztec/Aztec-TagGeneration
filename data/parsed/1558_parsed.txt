systems_biology efficient searching and annotation of metabolic_networks using chemical similarity motivation the urgent need for efficient and sustainable biological production of fuels and high value chemicals has elicited a wave of in silico techniques for identifying promising novel pathways to these compounds in large putative metabolic_networks to date these approaches have primarily used general graph search algorithms which are prohibitively slow as putative metabolic_networks may exceed million_compounds to alleviate this limitation we report two methodssimindex si and simzymewhich use chemical similarity of d chemical fingerprints to efficiently navigate large metabolic_networks and propose enzymatic connections between the constituent nodes we also report a byerswaterman type pathway search algorithm for further paring down pertinent networks results benchmarking tests run with si show it can reduce the number of nodes visited in searching a putative network by fold with a computational time improvement of up to fold subsequent byerswaterman search application further reduces the number of nodes searched by up to fold while simzyme demonstrates accuracy in matching query substrates with enzymes using these modules we have designed and annotated an alternative to the methylery thritol phosphate pathway to produce isopentenyl_pyrophosphate with more favorable thermo dynamics than the native pathway these algorithms will have a significant impact on our ability to use large metabolic_networks that lack annotation of promiscuous reactions availability_and python files will be available for download at http tyolab north_western edu tools metabolic reaction_networks have been the focus of intense study in recent_years unravelling the topology of metabolic_networks has been used to gain_a of metabolism in addition to identifying opportunities for engineering the production of drugs fuels and chemicals for this task numerous in silico utilities such as metabolic_flux have been developed to optimize existing pathways engineer novel pathways and identify drug_targets by simulating the effect of remodeling the underlying metabolic_network and analyzing its topology however the emergence of evidence that many enzymes exhibit promiscuous activities acting on several different substrates or carrying out disparate reactions tends to obfuscate the well defined topology of metabolic_networks the putative nodes and edges contributed by these promiscuous activities to the metabolic_network both increase its overall size and number of unannotated edges we will focus on two significant challenges that exist in exploiting the functionality of putative metabolic_networks with potentially nebulous topology first finding pathways in a metabolic_network linking two compounds reactions or enzymes of interest is atime consuming task using traditional graph searching algorithms due to the large number of nodes in extant metabolic_networks hence a more efficient mode of traversing possible pathways to a specific target must be developed native metabolic_networks such as that of iaf are composed of compound nodes with an additional reaction nodes comprehensive reaction databases such as the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg also have a networklike structure and contains upwards of compounds with reactions at the largest scale putative metabolic_networks with sizes in excess of compounds and reactions can also be generated thanks to several computational_tools these algorithms use a library of generalized biochemical transformations and apply them where possible to successive generations of compounds starting with one or more compounds in the zeroth generation these computer generated networks are useful because they elucidate all potential transformations that can be performed on a compound which can be added to a growing putative metabolic_network containing numerous novel pathways to a desired end_product tools exist that can cap the size of putative networks by prescribing a putative number of intermediate steps but if a long pathway is predicted yielding networks with nodes or more the networks quickly become infeasible to analyze limiting our ability to discover and design novel metabolic_pathways a second challenge in exploiting large metabolic_networks is associating a given metabolic reaction with a specific enzyme or set of enzymes capable of carrying out that reaction although most biochemistry literature is built on the assumption that one enzyme acts on one substrate it is known that many similar substrates can often be catalyzed by one particular enzyme an example of such a phenomenon is acetate secretion in escherichia coli_strains that have had the acetate producing enzymes pta ack and poxb knocked out enzyme promiscuity has been conjectured to be the responsible factor in this and similar situations with other metabolites this significant problem most likely occurs on the genome_scale as it is believed that of enzymes have promiscuous function this is most likely exacerbated in engineered cells where enzyme and metabolite_concentrations may be far away from standard concentrations found through evolution in addition enzymes with similar sequences may catalyze reactions on different substrates or have different activities for the same set of substrates thereby leading to improperly annotated_genes in general enzymes whose activity extends to substrates other than their native substrates will act on compounds with a similar structure or substructure determining which enzyme can fill these roles then requires search algorithms that consider the molecular_structure of the substrates searching these networks with a basic depth or breadth first search algorithm is time intensive and impractical for moderately long pathways and several algorithms have been developed to explore the space of known reactions in a probabilistic manner in the past much success has been reported in using d chemical fingerprints in exploring the substrate and inhibitory promiscuities of cytochrome_p s and in assessing the verisimilitude of enzyme substrate complexes we present here a molecular_structure biased search algorithm based on smarts type daylight theory supplementary fingerprint similarity measured using the tanimoto coefficient s to guide the network search making the use of traditional pathway search algorithms a more tractable undertaking similar successful_approaches have been taken to enable rapid searching of extant metabolic_networks such as kegg for links to known pathway mapping and validation of biochemical_reactions in large_databases our approach applies the chemical similarity comparison on the fly to foster efficient convergence on a target_molecule and subsequent annotation of the edges in the resultant network in a metabolic_network nearby metabolites are more chemically_similar than distant metabolites therefore proceeding towards a particular product via a metabolic_pathway should see the intermediates generally becoming more similar to the final_product we have used this property of increasing chemical similarity in metabolic_pathways to bias our search through metabolic_networks this algorithm of searching for increased chemical similarity cannot only be used for reaction metabolite bipartite networks but also can be utilized to search for promiscuous substrates an enzyme may act on within a metabolic_network an additional improvement to pathway searching utilizes the searching algorithm developed byto expedite pathway searching by ensuring that only pathways that have the capability of meeting certain additional_criteria are explored for the work in this article we utilize the criteria of path_length with the assumption that short paths are in general easier to engineer into a cell however this technique is capable of expediting pathway searching by utilizing additional_criteria such as the number of reactions that are novel to an organism the thermodynamic favorability of a pathway or the number of energy carriers expended by the pathway to our knowledge this is the first use of this technique to search for pathways in putative metabolic_networks the tanimoto coefficient moves towards as the pathway distance between a product node and an intermediate approaches but can have deviations from this trend in cases where large cofactor modifications are carried_out the pathways shown are tryptophan synthesis trp the mep_pathway glycolysis emp uridinyl synthesis ump a synthetic butanediol pathway bdo and caffeine synthesis caf pathway distance is defined as the number of transformations linking two metabolites tanimoto coefficient shows a general increasing trend on average as a function of pathway distance dashed_line using these methods we present a fast and efficient strategy for exploring metabolic_networks generated by making use of known biological transformations to suggest alternative_pathways based on the expansion of known enzymatic_activities as a test case we apply the tools developed to a problem that was previously impractical using the biochemical_network integrated computational explorer bnice a program that creates a metabolic_network by simulating all combinations of possible biochemical_reactions on a starting compound searching this large network is intractable with previous graph search approaches we show that our new algorithms overcome_these by predicting a novel pathway linking methylerythritol phosphate mep and isopentenyl_pyrophosphate ipp the results should enable the analysis of metabolic_networks that are orders_of larger than current networks applying these tools will allow for the development of many novel synthetic routes to previously unattainable chemicals
