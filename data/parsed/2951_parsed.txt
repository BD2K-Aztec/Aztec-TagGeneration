mfasd a structure based algorithm for discriminating different types of metal_binding motivation a large number of proteins contain metal_ions that are essential for their stability and biological_activity identifying and characterizing metal_binding through computational_methods is necessary when experimental clues are lacking almost all published computational_methods are designed to distinguish metal_binding from non metal_binding however discrimination between different types of metal_binding is also needed to make more accurate_predictions results in this work we proposed a novel algorithm called mfasd which could discriminate different types of metal_binding effectively based on d structure data and is useful for accurate metal binding_site mfasd captures the characteristics of a metal binding_site by investigating the local chemical_environment of a set of functional atoms that are considered to be in contact with the bound metal then a distance measure defined on functional atom sets enables the comparison between different metal_binding the algorithm could discriminate most types of metal_binding from each other with high_sensitivity and accuracy we showed that cascading our method with existing ones could achieve a substantial improvement of the accuracy for metal binding_site availability_and source_code and data used are freely_available fromproteins usually execute their functions by interacting with other components including macromolecules such as dna and proteins as well as small cofactors among which metals are most frequently used approximately one third of all proteins contain at least one metal_ion according to the data in protein_data pdb binding of metal_ions is known to have profound effect on the overall protein conformation where metals contribute significantly to proteins stability and biochemical activity on one hand metals are often directly involved in chemical_reactions by serving as redox centers or electrophilic reactants in catalysis and helping to bring reactive groups into correct orientations for reactions on the other hand metals play_a in signal_transduction and conformational changes of proteins by switching from state to state since they have different valence states thus identifying metal_binding could be a key_step in understanding the function mechanisms of metal binding_proteins experimental_approaches to detect whether a protein binds a specific metal_ion include atom absorption_spectroscopy reed and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com doi bioinformatics btv
