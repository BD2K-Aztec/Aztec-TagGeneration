structural_bioinformatics open_source platform for the execution and analysis of mechanical refolding experiments motivation single_molecule has facilitated the experimental_investigation of biomolecular force coupled kinetics from which the kinetics at zero force can be extrapolated via explicit theoretical_models the atomic_force afm in particular is routinely used to study protein_unfolding kinetics but only rarely protein_folding kinetics the discrepancy arises because mechanical protein refolding studies are more technically_challenging results we developed software that can drive and analyse mechanical refolding experiments when used with the commercial afm setup picoforce afm bruker previously digital instruments we expect the software to be easily_adaptable to other afm setups we also developed an improved method for the statistical characterization of protein_folding kinetics and implemented it into an afm independent software module availability software and documentation are available atbiochemical reactions commonly proceed via large conformational changes resulting in a well defined mechanical reaction coordinate on which they can be monitored since force is a determinant_factor in the rate of such reactions single_molecule smfs emerged as an invaluable tool in their investigation under mechanical tension thanks to its remarkable ability to stretch and monitor one molecule at a time smfs seeks to achieve the long_standing goal of mapping the energy_landscape of biomolecules e g proteins rna on a well defined reaction coordinate even for proteins which show irreversible thermal or chemical unfolding in particular protein_folding kinetics can be studied at the single_molecule level using the atomic_force afm to this end protein modules can be first unfolded and subsequently allowed to refold while subjected to a force clamp or they can be directly to whom correspondence should be addressed observed to refold at fixed extension via lock in force spectroscopy such techniques depend on recent_technological implemented in custom_built afms with very limited availability alternatively the afm can be used in the more traditional velocity clamp mode to drive protein modules to fold under mechanical tension via the double pulse protocol see suplementary material shortly the distance between the base of the cantilever and the surface rather than the stretching force is maintained constant for some amount of time allowing previously unfolded protein modules to refold despite the widespread availability of afm instrumentation supporting the velocity clamp mode of operation single_molecule folding kinetics studies remain rather scarce in the scientific_literature likely due to the unavailability of mandatory software technology we fill this gap by making such software freely_available to validate our software we studied the folding kinetics of protein gb and obtained a kinetics characterization similar to the previously_published one mechanical refolding experiments can be performed with typical commercial velocity clamp afm instrumentation and we provide an out of the box software solution for performing and analysing such experiments in conjunction with picoforce afm bruker we expect our software to be easily_adaptable to other afm setups in fact since the analytical model of section is not specific to a particular afm its implementation can already be used with refolding data obtained with any other afm furthermore we developed all the software in the java and python programming_languages to ensure its portability across all major operating_systems colour online a force extension trace according to the doublepulse protocol with the homomeric polyprotein gb the lower curve represents the protein fetching phase during which the polyprotein attached non specifically to the cantilever and then a total of modules have been subsequently unfolded the higher curve is shifted by pn just for display purposes and it represents the phase where the same molecule is pulled for the second time note that only out of the modules could have refolded since one module was not unfolded during the fetching phase the vertical dashed_line represents the piezo position during the waiting_time lapse relative to the resting position of the cantilever tip and its numerical value is shown together with the length of the time lapse at the top of the figure each wlc fit is shown redundantly shifted higher for display purposes the contour length at the start of the waiting_time lapse before any refolding is indicated in the bottom right position
