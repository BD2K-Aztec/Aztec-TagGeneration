comprehensive estimation of input signals and dynamics in biochemical_reaction motivation cellular information_processing can be described mathematically using differential_equations often external stimulation of cells by compounds such as drugs or hormones leading to activation has to be considered mathematically the stimulus is represented by a time dependent input_function parameters such as rate_constants of the molecular_interactions are often unknown and need to be estimated from experimental_data e g by maximum_likelihood for this purpose the input_function has to be defined for all times of the integration interval this is usually achieved by approximating the input by interpolation or smoothing of the measured data this procedure is suboptimal since the input uncertainties are not considered in the estimation process which often leads to overoptimistic confidence_intervals of the inferred parameters and the model dynamics results this article_presents a new approach which includes the input estimation into the estimation process of the dynamical model_parameters by minimizing an objective_function containing all parameters simultaneously we applied this comprehensive approach to an illustrative model with simulated_data and compared it to alternative_methods statistical_analyses revealed that our method improves the prediction of the model dynamics and the confidence_intervals leading to a proper coverage of the confidence_intervals of the dynamic parameters the method was applied to the jak_stat availability matlab_code is available on the authors websitemathematical modeling of biological_systems has become a widely used approach to better understand the system behavior as a whole rather than observing isolated parts the rapid development in quantitative molecular_biology enables to calibrate mathematical_models to experimental_data and therefore generating model_predictions for parametric_models such as ordinary_differential ode_models calibration can be performed e g by maximum_likelihood mle uncertainties of the measurements generated by biological_variability or technical_limitations have to be considered in the calibration_process as they propagate to the parameter_estimates to whom correspondence should be addressed an accurate method for calculating confidence_intervals is given by the profile likelihood approach one unresolved issue in data based modeling is the insufficient consideration of input measurement uncertainties in the parameter_estimation process in this article we solve this problem with a new approach the method presented in the following includes the input estimation into the estimation process of the dynamical model_parameters by minimizing an objective_function containing all parameters simultaneously an illustrative model with known parameter_values and noise distributions reveals that our method is able to i increase the precision of the parameter_estimates and ii correct the coverage of the likelihood_based confidence_intervals furthermore we applied the method to a model of the jakstat signaling_pathway introduced bywhere quantitative biological data are available leading to different estimated dynamics of the model trajectories compared to the standard method
