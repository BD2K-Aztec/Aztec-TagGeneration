accurately_predict the glucoronidation of atypical sites such as carbons we also describe a simple heuristic_model for predicting ugt mediated sites of metabolism that performs nearly as well with respectively and top and top accuracy and can identify the most challenging molecules to predict on which to assess more complex models compared with prior studies this model is more generally_applicable more accurate and simpler not requiring expensive quantum modeling availability_and the ugt metabolism predictor developed in this study is available aturidine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases ugts are an important family of proteins that metabolize of fda_approved ugts conjugate glucuronic_acid to a diverse range of molecules rendering them more hydrophilic and more easily eliminated specifically the glucuronic_acid can conjugate to oxygens nitrogens sulfurs or carbons in order of decreasing likelihood understanding and modeling ugt metabolism is important because conjugation can affect the safety and efficacy of drugs for example a genetic_polymorphism that inactivates a specific ugt significantly increases the bone_marrow toxicity of irinotecan by preventing its primary route of elimination similarily genetic_polymorphisms that increase expression of a specific ugt reduce the efficacy of atorvastatin a commonly used hmg_coa more commonly drug_candidates are optimized to ensure that they are metabolically stable and therefore not too rapidly eliminated identifying the specific atoms of a candidate drug that are glucoronidated during ugt mediated metabolismits sites of metabolism soms is valuable to lead_optimization efforts knowing the soms of a candidate drug allows medicinal chemists to design new compounds with improved bioavailability computational_methods that predict ugt mediated soms for drug like molecules are just now beginning to appear so_far the literature_reports two approaches to predicting ugt soms both methods use machine_learning to encode the chemical and biological rules represented in a set of reactions extracted from the accelrys metabolite database amd here we present two models to predict ugt metabolism first we propose a simple heuristic_model based on global statistics to predict ugt metabolism this simple model correctly_predicts the site of ugt conjugation in of molecules this heuristic_model provides both a baseline of performance against which other methods can be compared and also a method for identifying specific molecules in the dataset that are difficult to predict without modeling second we introduce xenosite ugt an adaptation of an algorithm previously_developed by our group to predict drug_metabolism by cytochrome_p s the xenosite ugt model uses a similar approach as existing_methods by learning rules from a training_dataset derived from the amd we built the xenosite model using unique substrates containing glucoronidation reactions times more reactions than used in previous_models xenosite improves on existing_approaches including the simple heuristic_model in several ways first it improves on the som ugt model described by who used support_vector to build four independent classification_models to differentiate between observed and non observed soms for common substructures vulnerable to ugt mediated metabolismaromatic and aliphatic hydroxyls carboxylic_acids and nitrogen containing groups unlike xenosite som ugt cannot predict glucuronidation of less common or atypical substructures such as ketones thiols or amides moreover do not describe or test any strategies for combining the predictions of their four independent models into a single set of predictions for a given molecule this is a critical shortcoming because in practice individual_molecules are being evaluated for metabolic soft spots and there is no way to know the performance of som ugt at correctly identifying these soft spots on a per molecule basis in contrast xenosite is a single model that produces predictions for all atoms in molecule and can even identify atypical sites of conjugation accurately second xenosite improves on the site of metabolism prediction somp model described by which uses fingerprint descriptors in a navenave bayes classifier to rank all atoms in a molecule by their likelihood of being conjugated by ugts however somp was only tested on small uncharged molecules and was not evaluated on difficult to predict molecules on these challenging molecules xenosite was significantly more accurate than somp som ugt and the heuristic_model this study introduces two approaches to predicting ugt soms i a statistics based heuristic_model and ii xenosite a neural_network trained on a large database of ugt metabolism xenosite accurately_predicts observed soms of known substrates of the time and outperforms_existing including the heuristic_model on difficult molecules xenosite might be most useful in contexts where atypical sites of ugt metabolism are important and therefore the heuristic_model is less accurate
