visual omics explorer voe a cross_platform portal for interactive data visualization motivation given the abundance of genome_sequencing and omics_data an opprtunity and challenge in bioinformatics relates to data_mining and visualization the majority of current bio informatics visualizations are implemented either as multi tier web_server applications that require significant maintenance effort or as client software that presumes technical expertise for installation here we present the visual omics explorer voe a cross_platform data visualization portal that is implemented using only html and javascript code voe is a standalone software that can be loaded offline on the web_browser from a local copy of the code or over the internet without any dependency other than distributing the code through a file sharing service voe can interactively display genomics transcriptomics epigenomics and metagenomics_data stored either locally or retrieved from cloud storage services and runs on both desktop computers and mobile_devices availability_and voe is accessible atdata visualization applications are key for representing integrating and mining next_generation and other types of omics_data a common paradigm involves omics_data visualizations that are computed on a remote server and displayed through common gateway interface web_pages ucsc https genome ucsc edu or using a java client server architecture that provides interactive local data visualizations igv recently a number of omics databases came online that provide rich application programming interfaces api or which combine the api with data storage and computational capacity for rent such as google genomics https cloud google com genomics furthermore a new generation of omics_data visualizations provide interactive interfaces that leverage computing within the web_browser and are completely decoupled from remote web_servers here we present the visual omics explorer voe a data visualization portal that offers dynamic mobile friendly omics_data displays combining the power of apis with that of local compute within the browser using javascript voe provides a diverse set of visualizations supplementary for data on the google genomics cloud genetic_variants chip_seq rna_seq and phylogenetic data using html and javascript d web technologies https github com mbostock d voe is standalone software that can be loaded offline on the web_browser from a local copy of the code https github com bcil voe archive master zip index html file over the internet from github http bcil github io voe or online storage such as amazon s http tinyurl com bioitcore and similarly from google drive or dropbox voe has been tested to work on all v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com current versions of desktop or mobile web_browsers and by using the phonegap framework http phonegap com we packaged voe as a touch enabled mobile app for the android system http tinyurl com voe apk we evaluated voe with data processed using bioinformatics_pipelines http galaxy hunter cuny edu workflow list published running on our local instance of the galaxy server for the chip_seq pipeline based on data are for the h k histone interactions on the mcf breast_cancer line http www ebi ac uk ena data view srp we visualized the bed output of the pipeline and identified a large number of interactions on chromosome supplementary where histone_modifications have been associated with breast_cancer we also visualized an rna_seq pipeline output using prostate_cancer data http www ebi ac uk arrayexpress ex periments e mtab and found overexpression of the myc and tspan genes supplementary known to be involved in this type of cancer voe provides an interactive mobile friendly omics visualization platform in the form of self contained code running within the web_browser with release of this software we aim to present a new paradigm for bioinformatics visualizations in contrast to the complex software stacks and monolithic web_server setups our implementation uses purely javascript and enabled us to easily bundle voe as a mobile application as sequencing is becoming a commodity and with widespread use of powerful yet portable computational platforms such as tablets as smartphones software following a similar paradigm with voe running on mobile platforms can find applications in the clinic and doctors offices furthermore new html standards http www w org tr wd work ers including web workers allow development of multithreaded web_browser applications that utilize multiple cpu cores for scalability we plan to further develop voe using these standards and also support other developers utilizing our open source_code in this respect
