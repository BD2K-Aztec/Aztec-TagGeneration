gene_expression bdval reproducible large_scale predictive_model development and validation in high_throughput datasets high_throughput data can be used in conjunction with clinical information to develop predictive_models automating the process of developing evaluating and testing such predictive_models on different datasets would minimize operator errors and facilitate the comparison of different modeling_approaches on the same dataset complete automation would also yield unambiguous documentation of the process followed to develop each model we present the bdval suite of programs that fully automate the construction of predictive classification_models from high_throughput data and generate detailed reports about the model construction process we have used bdval to construct models from microarray and proteomics_data as well as from dna_methylation datasets the programs are designed for scalability and support the construction of thousands of alternative_models from a given dataset and prediction task the technical ability to assay levels of molecules in biological_material has evolved dramatically in the last decade various technologies now make it possible to assay a large number of features in individual patients these data can be used to train models to predict information of clinical interest such as the response of a patient to a given treatment or a specific biological attribute of a sample since it is not clear a priori which modeling_approach will yield a competitive model for a given problem several modeling_approaches are often compared on the same dataset to yield estimates of future performance for each model that they produce performance estimation and model_selection is often done with cross_validation several authors have noted that complete cross_validation must be used to avoid optimistically biasing the estimates of performance that result from the evaluation in complete cross_validation the feature_selection approach is used within each fold of cross_validation to select features used to train the model performance_estimates can also be biased when choosing a model with the parameters to whom correspondence should be addressed that maximize performance estimated from the training_set tibshirani and tibshirani have recently described a practical and scalable approach to estimate such a parameter selection_bias in this application note we present the bdval suite of programs a set of software_tools designed to automate the process of developing and evaluating the performance of predictive classification_models in high_throughput datasets bdval supports several modeling_approaches complete cross_validation and can estimate the tibshirani and tibshirani parameter selection_bias
