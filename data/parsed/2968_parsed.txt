gene_expression mimsg a target enrichment algorithm for predicted mir mrna interactions based on relative ranking of matched expression data motivation algorithms predicting microrna mir mrna interactions generate high numbers of possible interactions many of which might be non existent or irrelevant in a certain biological_context it is desirable to develop a transparent user_friendly unbiased tool to enrich mirmrna predictions results the mimsg algorithm uses matched mir mrna_expression data to enrich mirmrna predictions it grades interactions by the number magnitude and significance of misplacements in the combined ranking profiles of mir mrna_expression assessed over multiple biological_samples mimsg requires minimal user input and makes no statistical assumptions it identified out of interactions as top scoring and significant in an actual germ_cell dataset twenty eight mirmrna pairs were deemed of highest interest based on ranking by mimsg and supported by current knowledge about validated interactions and biological_function to conclude mimsg is an effective algorithm to reduce a high number of predicted interactions to a small set of high_confidence interactions for further study availability_and matlab_source and datasets available at www martinrijlaarsdam nl mimsgmicrornas mirs are a subclass of a large group of noncoding_rnas that play_an in post_transcriptional crucially influencing development and physiology in addition mirs also contribute to initiation and progression of diseases including cancer around mirs have been identified in mammals so_far each possibly regulating protein levels of hundreds of different mrnas according to available prediction_algorithms much research has been done to elucidate the regulation of mrna_levels by mirs initial results showed that in plants mrna_degradation occurs by fully complementary binding of mirs to open_reading in animals mirs were hypothesized to predominantly repress translation by binding of partially complementary_sequences to their targets mrnas untranslated_region hence not leading to mrna_degradation however mrna_degradation as a consequence of mir binding has also been demonstrated in animals in general induction of mir expression results in reduced levels of their mrna_targets while depletion of a specific mir will lead higher target levels inactivation of the mir processing pathway also leads to higher overall levels of mrna_targets therefore the current dogma acknowledges that both translational_repression and mrna_degradation are present in plants and animals these effects on mrna_levels are also detectable in gene_expression data degradation of mrnas by mirs can be detected in highthroughput expression data and can be successfully_applied to enrich the many possible interactions suggested by sequencebased prediction_algorithms e g targetscan miranda or pictar in this article a novel method mimsg will be presented to enrich predicted mirmrna interactions within a specific biological_context the algorithm uses matched high_throughput mir and mrna_expression data of biological_samples the mimsg algorithm is based on relative ranking rr profiles of the expression data and does not directly_assess the absolute expression levels therefore the algorithm can be applied to detect small effects of mirs on to whom correspondence should be addressed mrna inferring power by detecting patterns over multiple biological_samples in recent_literature various other computational_methods have been applied to matched mrna and mir expression data including regression correlation_analysis and bayesian learning algorithms detailed comparison and review of previously_published related methods is provided in supplementary data a and in comparison mimsg is independent of the methods used to measure expression levels and the statistical_properties of the data it also only needs a minimal number of user_defined parameters and has built in quality_control finally it yields a result that is directly related to the observed expression_patterns and also supplies a visualization_tool for individual interactions mimsg is extensively benchmarked against other methods using different sub sets of cancer related expression data benchmarking shows that non parametric correlation methods are inferior to the other algorithms tested for the remaining algorithms results vary strongly depending on the dataset and overlap is minimal identifying mimsg as a valuable alternative as a proof_of mimsg is applied to germ_cell gct data investigating mrna_degradation as most mir have an inhibitory_effect on mrna protein levels in this deregulated cancer context mimsg identified validated relevant interactions and mirs mrnas
