gene_expression survmicro assessment of mirna based prognostic signatures for cancer clinical_outcomes by multivariate_survival micrornas mirnas play_a in post_transcriptional of mrna_levels their function in cancer has been studied by high_throughput methods generating valuable sources of public_information thus mirna_signatures predicting cancer clinical_outcomes are emerging an important step to propose mirna based biomarkers before clinical validation is their evaluation in independent cohorts although it can be carried_out using public data such task is time consuming and requires a specialized analysis therefore to aid and simplify the evaluation of prognostic mirna_signatures in cancer we developed survmicro a free and easy to use web_tool that assesses mirna_signatures from publicly_available mirna profiles using multivariate_survival survmicro is composed of a wide and updated database of cohorts in different tissues and a web_tool where survival analysis can be done in minutes we presented evaluations to portray the straightforward functionality of survmicro in liver and lung_cancer to our knowledge survmicro is the only bioinformatic tool that aids the evaluation of multivariate prog nostic mirna_signatures in cancer availability_and survmicro and its tutorial are freely_available atmicrornas mirnas are nt molecules that play an important post_transcriptional regulatory_role this molecular_mechanism has been widely_studied in cancer it is known that some mirnas act like oncogenes or tumor_suppressor esquela and whose regulatory_roles are linked to cancer hallmarks mirnas have also been proposed as drug_targets and biomarkers the roles of mirnas in the tumor_cell have been explored using high_throughput techniques such as microarrays and sequencing these data have also been used to associate mirnas to clinical_outcome in patients generating signatures for diagnostics and prognostics that are composed of several mirnas a mirna signature trial has been recently announced mrx trial a key issue for mirna_signatures for cancer is their validation in diverse cohorts such task generates difficulties even though many public cohorts are available these are related to timeconsuming tasks such as exploration of repositories acquisition and processing and the modeling of mirna_levels to assess their value as prognostic_biomarkers the current approaches for mirnas signature validation are limited progmir and mirumir implement only univariate_analyses even though signatures are composed of several mirnas moreover both tools are restricted regarding the available cohorts these characteristics limit the assessment of multivariate mirna biomarkers to provide assessment of multivariable prognostic mirna biomarkers and to simplify the evaluation in several cohorts we developed survmicro survmicro is a curated and updated web_tool of mirna_expression levels associated with clinical_outcome that provides survival analysis and risk_assessment in cancer
