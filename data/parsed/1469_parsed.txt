bioimage_informatics dp distributed d image_segmentation using micro labor workforce this application note describes a new scalable semi_automatic approach the dual point decision_process for segmentation of d structures contained in d microscopy the segmentation problem is distributed to many individual workers such that each receives only simple questions regarding whether two points in an image are placed on the same object a large_pool of micro labor workers available through amazons mechanical_turk system provides the labor in a scalable manner availability_and python based code for non commercial use and test data are available in the source archive at https sites google com site imagecrowdseg the improved_resolution and amount of detail afforded by emerging electron_microscopy em techniques such as serial block scanning em sbem is enabling researchers to explore scientific questions_pertaining to morphology and network_connectivity that were previously impossible sbem techniques coupled to new staining protocols are able to reveal cell_boundaries sites such as synapses and many intracellular_components such as synaptic_vesicles and mitochondria manual_segmentation represents a well recognized bottleneck in cellular_imaging in a typical scenario segmentation involves a single trained expert using automated algorithms or manual_methods to examine and mark up each individual slice and trace contours around the structures of interest using a program such as trakem or other specialized software programs dual point decision_process dp streamlines and parallelizes the process by distributing it to a large number of workers amazons mechanical_turk system enables rapid completion of jobs as a consequence of the large number of workers continuously available and attracted to this resource in our tests tens_of of decisions were accomplished in day average cost was dollars per cubic micron for dataset a mouse optic_nerve sample and dollars per cubic micron for dataset a mouse cerebellar neuropil sample shown in supplementary_information the tests were performed with a payment of one cent us dollars per decision
