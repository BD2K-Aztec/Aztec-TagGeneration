gdfuzz d a method for protein d structure reconstruction from contact_maps based on a non euclidean distance_function motivation to date only a few distinct successful_approaches have been introduced to reconstruct a protein d structure from a map of contacts between its amino_acid a d contact_map current_algorithms can infer structures from information rich contact_maps that contain a limited fraction of erroneous predictions however it is difficult to reconstruct d structures from predicted contact_maps that usually contain a high fraction of false contacts results we describe a new multi_step protocol that predicts protein d structures from the predicted contact_maps the method is based on a novel distance_function acting on a fuzzy residue proximity graph which predicts a d distance map from a d predicted contact_map the application of a multi_dimensional scaling algorithm transforms that predicted d distance map into a coarse d model which is further refined by typical modeling programs into an all atom representation we tested our approach on contact_maps predicted de_novo by multicom the top contact_map predictor according to casp we show that our method outperforms ft comar the state of the art method for d structure reconstruction from d maps for all predicted d contact_maps of relatively low sensitivity gdfuzz d generates more accurate d models with the average improvement of a in terms of rmsd availability_and gdfuzz d server and standalone version are freely_available atpredicting protein tertiary_structure from amino_acid has been a major_challenge in structural_biology for over four decades it was proposed by anfinsen that in the native environment all proteins assume their tertiary_structure spontaneously and this process is solely determined by the amino_acid still predicting the d structure accurately from its amino_acid remains a formidable challenge contemporary protein_structure protocols are built upon two distinct approaches comparative modeling typically based on the evolutionary_relationship between the target_sequence and a sequence of another protein with known structure which can be used as a template and folding simulation typically based on a search of the conformational_space with a scoring_function that attempts to identify native like conformations for the polypeptide_chain both approaches can benefit from the use of additional data encoded as v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com spatial restraints which can be derived from experimental analyses or from independent predictions one of the commonly_considered types of additional data useful for protein_d are the spatial proximities between individual amino_acid information about the proximity of residue or atom pairs in the molecule can be represented as a square symmetric matrix values stored in such a matrix may represent the euclidean_distances between particular atoms and such a matrix is then called a euclidean_distance map if only binary information about residue residue interactions is included e g qualified by a euclidean_distance below a given threshold that matrix is called a contact_map the majority of the contact_map processing approaches especially those using contacts in protein_d use euclidean metric functions based on the distances between the ca or cb atoms of the residues with the contact threshold set to a a protein d structure can be accurately_predicted based on information about distances between its individual atoms encoded as spatial restraints it can be also modeled based on its binary contact_map with the reconstructed and original structures similar up to the resolution of the contact_map representation the pioneering method for protein d structure reconstruction from d contact_maps developed by vendruscolo et_al was tested and proven to work with the native accurate contact_maps as well as with maps into which up to of true contacts were replaced by erroneous ones a more recent method ft comar enabled d structure reconstruction from less accurate contact_maps it was shown that the quality of d reconstruction with ftcomar is unaffected by deleting up to an average of the real contacts if the remaining contains no errors while indeed only a small percentage of randomly_generated wrong contacts in place of non contacts are sufficient to hamper d reconstruction a detailed error_rate comparison implies that a rmsd model quality limit is upheld by vendruscolo method if the random error_rate is about or less while in ft comar an error_rate of or lower can be tolerated it must be emphasized that information about chirality in d handedness is lost upon conversion of a protein_structure from d to a d representation the determination of the actual biological structure among the two mirror_image models that are in agreement with the map is not trivial but can be achieved typically if the protein contains a helices a model with biologically_relevant righthanded helices can be selected further the need to instantiate biologically_relevant stereoisomeric forms of individual_residues may allow the discrimination of models with native like versus mirrored topologies using scoring_functions for protein model_quality at the stage of all atom reconstruction of the d model the conservation of d structures in globular protein_domains imposes strong constraints on amino_acid in each protein favorable interactions are formed between residues with appropriate side_chains e g disulfide_bridges between cysteine_residues salt_bridges between charged_residues hydrophobic_interactions between aliphatic residues etc favorable interactions tend to be preserved in evolution resulting in correlations among amino_acid at different sequence_positions when aligned sequences of homologous_proteins are considered both physico_chemical and evolutionary considerations can be exploited to infer spatial contacts for proteins with unknown structure currently the computational_prediction of direct contacts is considered much easier than the prediction of distances between residues there are many methods that predict contacts between amino_acid from protein_sequence e g nncon svmcon possum psicov pconsc and multicom typically they generate a map with predicted contact probabilities for all possible pairs of residues which can be used as a starting_point for d structure reconstruction for a typical structure of a protein of length l the total number of unique contacts defined as distances between the ca atoms a is about l data not shown a typical predicted map contains a much larger number of tentative contacts however a more realistic map with a native like number of contacts may be inferred by taking l contacts predicted with highest probability scores over last years significant effort has been made to benchmark and assess methods for predicting protein_structure from amino sequence in particular in the framework of the biannual critical assessment of protein_structure casp experiment methods for contact_prediction were evaluated in the rr category of casp a common evaluation metric for residue residue contact predictions is the accuracy of only the top l l or predictions scored best by a given method accuracy is defined as the number of correctly_predicted residueresidue contacts divided by the total number of contact predictions considered unfortunately the overall contact_prediction quality is still at a disappointingly low_level as compared with the required levels of d structure retrieval protocols recently novel quality_measures were introduced to score predictors in casp multicom was able to predict contacts with best quality levels defined as a mutual score of sensitivity recall and precision accuracy when considering predictions for long_range i e residue pairs separated in the sequence by at least other residues however these predictions of contact_maps that may be considered state of the art are significantly_worse than the minimal requirements by the state of the art methods for d protein_structure reconstruction from d contacts here we present a novel approach for predicting d structures from d maps it is based on two components first a new method for predicting d distance maps from d contact_maps and second a modeling protocol that involves a combination of coarse_grained and all atom modeling our method was developed to use predicted contact_maps that include probabilities of contacts for all residues and can be used in de_novo d structure_prediction based on the output of various existing contact_map programs we implemented this protocol as a publicly_available web_server gdfuzz d that takes a contact_map as an input and reports an allatom d model of the protein_structure as well as a predicted d distance map we developed a method for predicting protein d structures from d contact_maps which is based on a novel approach for predicting distance maps from predicted d contact_maps the main novelty is in the concept of a non euclidean d distance map which can be derived directly and unambiguously from a protein contact_map the graph distance reflects a series of physical contacts between the residues and thereby indicates the length of the path of the signal produced by a perturbation of a given residue due to a substitution or due to any physical_interaction with the environment until it affects other residues in the protein the graph distance_matrix can be therefore treated as a map of perturbation propagation pathways which describes in detail to which extent a single_residue substitution may impact other residues in protein_structure most of existing_methods for predicting protein d structures from d contact_maps are very sensitive to errors currently the best methods for d contact_map predictions perform rather poorly on average and only a small fraction of their predictions have high_accuracy typical predicted contact_maps contain a non physical number of contacts and they include a large number of contacts that are erroneous our intention was to develop a method that overcomes the problem of non physicality of typical predicted contacts maps and to handle input maps with probabilities of contacts for all residues such maps contain a very high number of predicted contacts of which many are erroneous and which often contradict one another our algorithm does not tackle cases where only a few highly_relevant contacts are known but this task can be handled by standard methods for protein_d by folding with restraints such as rosetta or cabs we tested our d structure_prediction protocol on contact_maps predicted with multicom the best method for contact_map according to casp and found that it generates more accurate d models than those produced by ft comar on maps with a wide_range of sensitivity values we have also tested it on contact_maps predicted by pconsc with a restricted range of sensitivities and demonstrated that models generated by gdfuzz d are on the average almost as accurate as those generated by computationally_demanding pconsfold protocol our method is modular and elements of our protocol can be incorporated into other protocols for protein_d from contact_maps in particular the d modeling methodology we used combination of modeller and refiner can be easily replaced any other method for structure_prediction that uses distance_restraints in particular the use of extensive conformational_sampling as in pconsfold with rosetta and or the use of alternative_methods for model_quality and identification of candidate structures from many decoys may further improve the accuracy of predicted structures in particular we envisage that elements of our protocol could be combined with elements of the pconsfold protocol to generate even better predictions on the other hand the choice of a method with which to generate an input contact_map can be a significant factor in the procedure it would be interesting to evaluate various combinations of methods for contact_map generation conversion of distance maps to contact_maps and protein d folding with restraints we envisage potential applications of graph distance maps beyond protein_d one possible application is in protein contact_map alignment flexible superposition of protein_structures and structure based sequence_alignment algorithms that use contact_maps operate on sparse matrices in which the majority of entries represent non contacts the use of graph distance maps which can be obtained both from experimentally_determined protein d structures and from predicted contact_maps would allow for the use of more efficient algorithms developed e g for distance_matrix comparison as in dali this approach could facilitate comparison of proteins with known structures with those with unknown structures for which only theoretical_predictions including predicted contact_maps are available another possible application of graph distance maps include rna d structure modeling most methods for rna d structure_prediction developed to date utilize similar strategies to those developed for protein d structure modeling rna d structure_prediction is usually guided by secondary_structure which identifies canonical watson_crick comparison of a full gdfuzz d procedure graph distance with a simplified_version contacts only where only restraints on contacts are used with modellernote rmsdthe smaller the better tm scorethe higher the better details in supplementary tables s and s between ribonucleotide residues however there exist methods such as shevek mc fold or rnawolf zu that predict other types of contacts in rna_structures including non canonical base_pairs thus the approach delineated here for protein_structure modeling could be used to improve rna d structure modeling by the inference of rna graph distance maps last but not least some elements of the methodology described in this article could be adapted to help generation of coarse_grained d models of chromatin_structure based on long_range contact_information from experiments such as hi c
