structural_bioinformatics ialign a method for the structural_comparison of protein_protein motivation proteinprotein_interactions play_an in many cellular_processes the rapid accumulation of proteinprotein_complex structures provides an unprecedented opportunity for comparative_studies of proteinprotein_interactions to facilitate such studies it is necessary to develop an accurate and efficient computational algorithm for the comparison of proteinprotein interaction_modes while there are many structural_comparison approaches developed for individual proteins very few methods are available for proteinprotein_complexes results we present a novel interface alignment_method ialign for the structural_alignment of proteinprotein_interfaces new scoring_schemes for measuring interface similarity are introduced and an iterative dynamic_programming is implemented we find that the similarity_scores follow extreme value distributions using statistical_models we empirically estimate their statistical_significance which is in good agreement with manual classifications by human_experts large_scale tests of ialign were conducted on both artificial docking models and experimental_structures in a benchmark test on dimers ialign successfully detects biologically related structurally_similar proteinprotein_interfaces at a coverage percentage of and an error per query of when compared against previously_published ialign is substantially more accurate and efficient availability the ialign software_package is freely_available atvirtually all biological_processes are dependent on protein_protein the role of proteinprotein_interactions can be structural e g stabilization of homo oligomers or macromolecular assemblies and or functional e g inhibition of antigens or enzymes given the essentiality of proteinprotein_interactions for a cell one ultimate_goal of current research is to identify and elucidate all protein_protein toward this goal one promising_avenue and necessary task is the structural_determination to whom correspondence should be addressed of all representative proteinprotein_complexes at high_resolution over the past_two there has been an exponential_growth in the number of solved protein complex structures as structural_genomics initiatives select more protein_complexes as targets it is anticipated that the growth_rate of protein complex structures will be further accelerated these rich structural data allow us to characterize proteinprotein_interactions at the atomic_level by analyzing various properties of a proteinprotein interface such as hydrophobicity hydrogen_bonding buried surface_area topology planarity compositions and so on one can gain insights into the mechanisms of proteinprotein recognition however these analyses are typically performed for individual protein_complexes and they do not provide detailed structural_alignments between protein_complexes it is well known that the structures of proteins are more likely to be conserved than their sequences therefore structural_comparison often provides evolutionary insights that are not obvious in sequence comparison in the era of structural_genomics structural_comparison is very relevant because significant structural_similarity may guide the study of biological_relationships e g whether two proteins are evolutionarily_related and or fulfill similar functions consequently many computational_tools have been developed for structural_alignment of individual proteins such as dali ce and tm_align extensive classifications of protein_domains based on their structural sequence and functional_similarity have also become available such as scop and cath since proteinprotein_interactions are responsible for the stability and or function of protein_complexes it makes sense to directly compare the interaction_modes of protein_complexes and to categorize these complexes according to their interaction_modes one simple strategy is to utilize the alignments of individual protein_structures and define interaction_modes by the orientation of two complexes and or the overlap in the interfaces while these studies are informative they have two assumptions first the individual corresponding proteins from two complexes are sufficiently_similar in structure second the combination of individual protein_alignments produces a good interface alignment however these assumptions are often not true in biologically_interesting cases one example is shown in two headed tomato inhibitor ii ti ii simultaneously inhibits two molecules ofcartoon representation the coordinates were taken from a crystal_structure pdb code oyv two subdomains and of ti ii are shown in blue and green and the two subtilisins are shown in red and orange molecular visualizations were generated with vmd protease subtilisin the two interaction sites located in the two subdomains of ti ii are well separated obviously these two interaction sites cannot be aligned in the comparison of the inhibitor against itself moreover due to the different topologies exhibited in the two ti ii subdomains most structural_alignment programs only detect weak similarity between them and cannot properly align the two interaction sites even when one attempts to align the two subdomains in contrast it is straightforward for ialign to identify highly_significant similarity between the two proteinprotein_interfaces suggesting that the same inhibition mechanism is employed in a second strategy one can extend a structural_alignment algorithm for individual proteins to the entire protein complex e g mm align an intrinsic limitation of such an approach is that it does not differentiate between interface regions from non interface regions as a result a significant similarity_score does not necessarily mean that two complexes have similar interaction_modes an illustration of this issue is the following suppose that a protein a forms complexes with two different partners b and c assuming no significant structural changes of a the comparison of two complexes a b and a c will lead to a significant score because of the alignment of a to itself yet a may associate with b and c in totally different ways this is particularly problematic when the size of protein a is much bigger than the sizes of b and c thus the similarity between these two a proteins dominates the structural_comparison regardless of the actual interaction_modes which could in fact be quite different in addition the alignment of full complexes does not necessarily provide the best alignment of interfaces in the ti ii subtilisin example mentioned above the two interaction sites on the inhibitor still cannot be properly aligned by mm align thus the development of a dedicated method for comparing proteinprotein_interfaces is necessary for studying proteinprotein interaction_modes an early approach employed a geometric hashing algorithm more recently methods that compare physical_chemical interactions non covalent interactions or contact_maps have been proposed in i i siteengine galinter and cmapi respectively none of these studies however provides an assessment of statistical_significance of the interface similarity moreover these methods were tested on small_datasets and it is not clear how well they perform in large_scale benchmarks in particular it has not been established that interface comparison is useful for the detection of biological_relationships to address_these we present a novel method ialign for the structural_comparison of proteinprotein_interfaces below we first introduce scoring_functions for measuring similarity between proteinprotein_interfaces we then describe the alignment algorithm and statistical_models for the estimation of statistical_significance large_scale benchmark tests were performed on both docking models and experimental_structures in addition ialign is compared with mm align and i i siteengine finally we discuss both the advantages and limitations of our approach we first tested ialign on docking models and obtained encouraging_results supplementary_material below we describe the result of detecting evolutionarily_related structurally_similar proteinprotein_interfaces and comparison with mm align and i i siteengine comparative_studies of protein_structures provide_valuable the biological relationship between proteins especially those with distant evolutionary_relationship undetectable from sequence_information alone during the past_two many computational_methods have been developed for protein structural_comparison some well known examples_include dali ce and tm_align however these methods are designed for comparing the global tertiary_structures of individual proteins considering that proteinprotein_interactions play_an in a cell structural_comparison of proteinprotein_interfaces may provide additional insights that are not obvious in standard structural comparisons of individual proteins the main purpose of this work is to introduce ialign an accurate and efficient computational_method for protein interface comparison and to demonstrate that such a comparison is indeed helpful for deciphering biological_relationships between proteins like structure comparisons of individual proteins it is important to define a measure that effectively characterizes the level of structural_similarity one advantage of the tm_score first introduced for measuring the similarity between monomeric protein_structures is that the tm_score is approximately length independent for globular structures this property allows one to estimate statistical_significance according to the values of the score an mtm score is considered significant however it is not clear whether the tm_score can be applied to proteinprotein_interfaces which are often flat and discontinuous we show that the interfacial tm_score itm score can be applied to measure the similarity between proteinprotein_interfaces and that the property of length independence is still maintained in addition we designed a new measure the is score which compares not only geometric distances but also contact patterns not considered by the itm score as a result the is score is more specific and significantly better than the itm score in differentiating closely_related protein protein_complexes e g near native docking models supplementary results moreover we employed statistical_models to estimate the significance of the itm is scores in large_scale benchmark tests on dimers our estimates agree well with the scop classification despite the fact that scop was not used for deriving the statistical_models in the predictions of biological_relationships the p values of itm is score yield significantly more accurate results than the scores in general accurate_predictions were obtained by ialign with the p values of both scores for example about coverage is achieved at epq there is unlikely to be a consensus on the definition of the optimal similarity_metric for proteinprotein interface comparison while geometry based similarity_measures are used in ialign measures based on physical_chemical were proposed in i i siteengine benchmark results show that ialign is significantly more accurate and two orders_of more efficient than i i siteengine however the difference in accuracy does not mean that physical_chemical are not important for interface comparison the better accuracy of ialign is mainly due to the length independence of the itm is score and a sound assessment of statistical_significance it is known that the space of tertiary_structures of individual protein_domains is very limited largely because only certain ways of secondary_structure packing are physically viable as a consequence two evolutionarily unrelated proteins may converge to a similar structural fold this interesting phenomenon unfortunately creates a challenge for predicting biological_relationships from protein_structure in this study we demonstrate that comparison of proteinprotein_interfaces may be utilized for differentiating biological_relationships this works because proteinprotein_interactions are important for their stability and or function leading to the conservation of a specific interaction mode during the course of evolution however we emphasize that interface comparison is not a replacement for but rather is complementary to structural_comparison of individual proteins this point can be illustrated with one example suppose protein a and its homolog a interacts with two different proteins b and c respectively and the proteinprotein_interfaces of complexes a b and a c are dissimilar an interface alignment of a b and a c gives an insignificant score whereas an alignment between a and a yields a significant score while the score of interface similarity is still informative indicating that a b and a c exhibit different interaction_modes the homologous relationship between a and a is detected only through the alignment of individual protein_structures therefore one expects that a combination of both types of structural comparisons should provide a more comprehensive description of proteinprotein relationships than using either comparison metric alone toward this direction considerable efforts have been invested recently in classifying proteinprotein_interfaces since two biologically unrelated protein_complexes may display_similar interfaces the question arises in how similar two proteinprotein_interfaces have to be for a reliable prediction on their biological relationship with the p value estimation provided by ialign one can quickly set a suitable p value
