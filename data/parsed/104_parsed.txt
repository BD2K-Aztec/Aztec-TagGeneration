systems_biology a crowd sourcing approach for the construction of species specific cell_signaling motivation animal_models are important tools in drug_discovery and for understanding human_biology in general however many drugs that initially show promising results in rodents fail in later stages of clinical_trials understanding the commonalities and differences between human and rat cell_signaling can lead to better experimental_designs improved allocation of resources and ultimately better drugs results the sbv improver species specific network_inference challenge was designed to use the power of the crowds to build two species specific cell_signaling given phosphoproteo mics transcriptomics and cytokine data generated from nhbe and nrbe cells exposed to various stimuli a common literature inspired reference network with nodes and edges was also provided as prior_knowledge from which challenge participants could add or remove edges but not nodes such a large network_inference challenge not based on synthetic simulations but on real_data presented unique difficulties in scoring and interpreting the results because any prior_knowledge about the networks was already provided to the participants for reference novel ways for scoring and aggregating the results were developed two human and rat consensus networks were obtained by combining all the inferred networks further analysis showed that major signaling_pathways were conserved between the two species with only isolated components diverging as in the case of ribosomal s kinase rps ka overall the consensus between inferred edges was relatively high with the exception of the downstream_targets of transcription_factors which seemed more difficult to predict unveiling the inner workings of cell_signaling is one of the long_standing challenges of systems_biology small_scale versions of these networks have been built edge by edge using classic laboratory_techniques such as immunoprecipitation which has resulted in a large body of literature describing various gene and protein interactions although successful in their initial scope these methods do not scale up to the genome level and are difficult to combine into a larger network because of the different contexts in which they were originally_reported organism cell_type experiment timing and other conditions are crucial for determining whether an edge exists in a signaling_network the advent of large_scale assays that can simultaneously measure the activity of thousands of genes has circumvented these aforementioned issues by enabling purely data_driven methods to infer large_scale networks various algorithms have been developed including models based on bayesian_networks mutual_information regression neural_networks boolean_networks and differential_equations despite these advances there is no clear best method each method has strengths and limitations influenced by how the methodology addresses the fact that network_inference is inherently an underdetermined problem in the majority of cases however it has been observed that the aggregation of different network_inference generates high_quality robust results efforts to catalog and compare network_inference have occurred in the form of data prediction competitions such as the ones organized by the dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods dream consortium

improver is a crowd sourcing based_methodology for the verification of research in an industrial setting in its second installment it challenges the research_community to solve four problems related to the translation of molecular_biology findings between rat and human model systems here we present the analysis of the species specific network_inference challenge part of the sbv improver species translation set of challenges https www sbvimprover com for this challenge participants were asked to infer humanand rat specific networks given phosphoprotein gene_expression and cytokine data the organizers also provided a common reference network from which participants had to generate the two networks by adding and removing edges the purpose of this challenge was to augment and refine the reference_map in a species specific_manner using data_driven approaches the described methodology for building the reference network created a directed graph with nodes and edges organized into cascading layers where the edges are oriented from the top to the bottom layers at the top is the stimulus layer thatcontains a subset of the compounds used to generate the training data followed by receptor adaptor signaling tf target and cytokine layers supplementary it is interesting to note that not all the tfs are reachable from all the stimuli nodes the addition of a top stimuli layer to an otherwise generic network introduces the notion of context to pathways that are only active under certain conditions by mapping the nodes from the reference network to the genes from the canonical pathways listed in the molecular_signature database v we observe a diverse representation of cellular_processes among the most common were cell_growth and survival egf insulin pdgf and ras interleukin il r il and il inflammatory_response nfkb and cell_signaling mapk as shown in the scope of sbv improver species translation challenges was to assess the limits of using rat models to predict human_biology in the specific context of bronchial_epithelial exposed to various stimuli along these lines the rationality behind the network_inference challenge was to build two species specific cell_signaling starting from a generic literature inspired network and using high_throughput and transcriptomics_data to add or reject edges this challenge differed from other challenges because it did not come with a gold_standard i e the true human and rat networks are unknown and this posed difficulties in scoring and interpreting the results the current work details how the aforementioned issues were addressed together with the lessons_learned from organizing and curating such a challenge despite the apparent top_down organization of the reference network some feedback_loops were present consistent with the structure of known pathways however the challenge experiments were designed to capture a broad_area of the signaling_network and not feedback_mechanisms the latter would have required a different experimental_setup with more samples collected at later time points as feedback_loops tend to be more prominent at longer time scales without a gold_standard individual scoring criteria can potentially be useful in separating poor performers from good performers but can also have flaws the silver standard is biased by the choice of algorithm used to generate it and the quality of the write ups does not always predict the best performing algorithms it is thus advisable to combine the rankings resulting from individual scoring_methods to reduce bias the best performers obtained in this manner were the same as the ones obtained by comparing predictions with a consensus network built by aggregating the submissions from all participants this result suggests that consensus scoring could be used as a legitimate scoring strategy for future challenges where a gold_standard is absent the network aggregation procedure described in this article provides a statistically sound way of merging predicted networks or any other binary predictions given a sufficiently_large sample space this is especially useful when a clear way of assessing the best performing method is absent however even when one can accurately determine the best algorithm for performing a specific task the result might be context dependent it has been shown that disease classifiers vary_greatly in performance when applied to different datasets aggregating multiple predictions has been proven to generate a more robust outcome on par with the best performing methods the generation of a consensus prediction can potentially have benefits beyond that of robustness and performance particularly in the absence of a gold_standard the data shown in supplementarysuggest that predictions can be scored against a consensus network instead of using a silver standard with similar top rankings when an appropriate threshold is used consensus scoring can thus avoid any bias caused by the choice of algorithm for the silver standard however it could be sensitive to outliers e g predictions that are much better than the rest or multiple correlated predictions caused by collaborating teams or the use of similar methods the predicted networks were aggregated using a mixture of two beta_binomial distributions as shown in section to find the optimal threshold for determining the existence of an edge a two step process was used first the distribution in equation was fitted to the consensus data then the minimum number of teams k was determined for which pr y jx k pr y jx k from the first step the value of the mixture constant pr y equation can give an indication of the proportion of true edges in the reference network which in this case was despite this the solution to the second step resulted in consensus networks with edges for human and edges for rat out of all the reference network edges this result suggests that less than half of the potential regulatory connections were discovered and more challenge participants were needed to increase_statistical and reconcile the two estimates of the number of true edges despite these limitations the consensus network shown in supplementarydisplays some interesting patterns some of which are shown_inand b overall the camp_responsive also known as creb showed the best consensus for the edges upstream of it supplementary but with a couple of differences between human and rat the connection from rps ka was present only in the human consensus network whereas the connection from prkaca was present only in the rat consensus network the prevalence of rps ka a k a rsk interactions in human supplementary might be explained by the fact that human isoforms of rsk have functional_redundancy i e rps ka rps ka and rps ka in contrast this is most likely not the case in rodents reported that the mouse rsk and rsk genes may not be able to fully compensate for the lack of rsk function the consensus results also suggest a preference for jak activation through egfr for human and the pdgfr complex for rat direct interaction between jak and irs has been reported in cultured_human peripheral_blood t cells in rat however the interaction seems to be indirect through proteins socs socs and jak other conserved interactions include ifngr to jak and jak to stat a which are parts of the interferon_gamma pathway known to be conserved across vertebrate_species additional references are provided for the majority of edges from the consensus networks and are available as supplementary_material these references are categorized by organism and tissue context as follows airway cells non lung cells and lung_cancer epithelial_cells although numerous pathway_databases are widely available they are too generic and lack specific context when displaying an interaction the purpose of this challenge was to fine_tune one of these generic networks based on data collected from bronchial primary cells exposed to specific stimuli compounds when comparing the resulting consensus network to networks obtained from the ingenuity_pathway tool ipa www ingenuity com we observe a steady_increase in precision as the number of votes required for an edge increases supplementary culminating at eight votes as predicted by the model in equation the maximum precision obtained is for the human network and for the rat network however this could be explained by the relatively few edges identified in ipa for human and especially rat the number of edges drastically decreased if a filter on cell tissue type was applied as well as the lack of proper context provided by tissue_specificity and stimuli the ipa networks as well as the consensus networks are available as supplementary_material
