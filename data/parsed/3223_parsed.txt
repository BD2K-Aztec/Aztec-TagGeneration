netexplore a web_server for modeling small network_motifs motivation quantitative and qualitative_assessment of biological data often produces small essential recurrent networks containing components called network_motifs in this context model solutions for small network_motifs represent very high interest results software_package netexplore has been created in order to generate classify and analyze solutions for network_motifs including up to six network_components netexplore allows plotting and visualization of the solutions phase spaces and bifurcation diagrams availability_and the current version of netexplore has been implemented in perl cgi and is accessible at the following locations http line bioinfolab net nex netexplore htm andthe analysis of biological_systems using quantitative and experimental methods often produces small gene_regulatory or network_motifs which perform critical_functions network_motifs including nodes became the major subjects of modeling and analysis many types of network_motifs have been identified and described however even motifs with identical topologies order of regulatory links may produce surprisingly rich spectrums of dynamic solutions constraining network parameters given biological data is routinely used to model networks and network_motifs this approach has advantages and limitations major limitations include i the availability of adequate biological data to fit the network parameters ii overfitting problems caused by imbalance between the amount of experimental_data and the number of unknown_parameters constraining parameters may produce many alternative solutions recent_progress in genomics and the accumulation of large_amounts of high_throughput data allows reconstruction of gene_regulatory grns and finding essential network_motifs in silico collection of data and validation of these predicted network_motifs is difficult but prediction of their likely behavior is desirable solutions may be obtained by assigning random sets of parameters centered on biologically_relevant parameter_values collection and classification of many emitted random solutions predicts probable behavior of network_motifs
