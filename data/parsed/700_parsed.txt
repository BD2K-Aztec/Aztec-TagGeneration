systems_biology beams backbone extraction and merge strategy for the global many to many alignment of multiple ppi_networks motivation global many to many alignment of biological_networks has been a central problem in comparative biological_network studies given a set of biological interaction networks the informal goal is to group together related nodes for the case of proteinprotein_interaction such groups are expected to form_clusters of functionally orthologous_proteins construction of such clusters for networks from different species may prove useful in determining evolutionary_relationships in predicting the functions of proteins with unknown_functions and in verifying those with estimated functions results a central informal objective in constructing clusters of ortho logous proteins is to guarantee that each cluster is composed of members with high homological similarity usually determined via sequence_similarities and that the interactions of the proteins involved in the same cluster are conserved across the input networks we provide a formal definition of the global many to many alignment of multiple proteinprotein_interaction that captures this informal objective we show the computational intractability of the suggested definition we provide a heuristic_method based on backbone extraction and merge strategy beams for the problem we finally show through experiments based on biological significance_tests that the proposed beams algorithm performs better than the state of the art approaches furthermore the computational_burden of the beams algorithm in terms of execution speed and memory_requirements is more reasonable than the competing algorithms availability_and supplementary_material including code implementations in leda c experimental_data and the results are available atproteins and their interactions are at the core of almost every biological_process in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks nodes represent the proteins and the edges correspond to interactions between pairs of proteins several high_throughput techniques together with novel computational methods_gave rise to extraction of large_scale ppi_networks for many organisms in recent_years parallel to this enormous growth in data several problem formulations related to the analysis of such networks have been proposed and many computational_methods have been developed for their comparative_studies in particular biological network_alignment has been of particular interest the main motivation behind the problem is to detect functionally orthologous_proteins across given networks from several organisms two types of biological_network alignments have been covered in literature local network alignments and global network alignments the former aims to extract local network_motifs subnetworks from input networks the motifs are expected to bear reasonable similarity both in terms of sequence and local network_topologies global_network on the other hand treats the problem globally and aims to find functionally orthologous mappings across all networks and proteins some of the proposed global alignment_algorithms such as mi_graal and spinal perform these alignments only for pairwise networks whereas others such as isorank and isorankn perform alignments on multiple_networks additionally global alignment_algorithms may also differ with respect to the types of mappings they provide one to one alignment approaches aim to generate alignments where the output alignment either maps a protein in a network to exactly one protein from one of the networks or leaves the protein unmapped one to many alignments have been proposed for the global_alignment of other biological_networks including metabolic_pathways where each metabolic reaction in a pathway is mapped to a subset of reactions from another pathway finally for many to many alignments the goal is to extract clusters of proteins where each cluster may include any number of proteins from the input networks the proteins mapped to the same cluster as a result of the alignment are all expected to compose a functionally orthologous group among all three versions of the global network alignments the many to many version is the most general furthermore as far as constraints from evolutionary molecular_biology are concerned it provides a more intuitive definition the evolutionary distance between organisms under study may have large variations leading to different numbers of proteins functioning similarly when considered in different networks the focus of this article is on global many to many alignment of multiple ppi_networks from different species we first provide to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com a formal combinatorial definition of the problem we proceed with proving its computational intractability even in a restricted case we next provide a general framework for the problem where we decompose the original problem into two subproblems that of backbone extraction and backbone merging informally each backbone in this framework corresponds to a closely_related central group of proteins at most one from each network once all the backbones are determined the latter subproblem involves merging together the backbones with higher chances of coexistence in a cluster of orthologous_proteins we provide heuristic methods for both subproblems that together form our proposed algorithm based on backbone extraction and merge strategy beams we experimentally evaluate the algorithm with regards to several biological_significance metrics proposed in literature and compare it against one of the most popular global manyto many alignment_methods isorankn and a recently_proposed state of the art alignment algorithm smetana the experimental_results indicate that beams alignments on real network data provide more consistent clusters than those of isorankn and smetana furthermore considering the heavy computational load of the problem the exceptional running time and memory_requirements of beams is a further improvement resulting from the provided framework and the algorithm
