memloci predicting subcellular_localization of membrane_proteins in eukaryotes motivation subcellular_localization is a key feature in the process of functional_annotation of both globular and membrane_proteins in the absence of experimental_data protein_localization is inferred on the basis of annotation transfer upon sequence similarity_search however predictive tools are necessary when the localization of homologs is not known this is so particularly for membrane_proteins furthermore most of the available predictors of subcellular_localization are specifically trained on globular_proteins and poorly perform on membrane_proteins results here we develop memloci a new support_vector based tool that discriminates three membrane_protein localizations plasma internal and organelle membrane when tested on an independent set memloci outperforms_existing reaching an overall accuracy of on predicting the location in the three membrane types with a generalized correlation_coefficient as high as availability the memloci server is freely_available on the web at knowledge of protein subcellular_localization is crucial for unraveling its cellular function s different membrane types partition eukaryotic_cells into functional compartments and mediate exchange of matter energy and information biological_activity within the different compartments strictly depends on proteins that are associated to their surrounding membranes and in turn knowing the subcellular_localization of a given membrane_protein helps in elucidating its functional role about of the human proteins included in the swissprot database are annotated as interacting with membranes out of in release nearly of these are integral_membrane also known as transmembrane_proteins that span the lipid bi layer either with helical or barrel domains the remaining portion consists of peripheral membrane_proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed associated to membranes with different mechanisms that includes i posttranslational covalent_attachment to lipid anchors such as glycophosphatidylinisitol gpi anchors palmitoyl anchors and myristoyl anchors ii interaction between the phospholipid bilayer and specific membrane targeting domains exposed on the protein surface and iii association with proteins that directly interact with membranes the interaction of any single protein with a specific membrane can involve more than one of the above mechanisms eukaryotic cell_membranes can be divided_into two main classes on the basis of both functional and phylogenetic considerations the endomembrane system and the organelle membranes the endomembrane system comprises the plasma_membrane the endoplasmic_reticulum er the golgi_complex the nuclear_envelope the vesicles the lysosomes and the vacuoles these membranes are thought to have originated from invaginations of the ancestral prokaryotic plasma_membrane moreover they form a single functional system since they are either directly connected or communicate with each other through the vesicle_transport system the plasma_membrane holds a special role in the endomembrane system being the interface between the cell and its external environment the other class of membranes comprises the inner and outer_membranes of mitochondria chloroplasts and other plastids that do not exchange materials through the vesicle_transport and that are likely to have an independent phylogenetic origin the trafficking of membrane_proteins from ribosomes to their final localization is a complex process that involves several molecular_mechanisms only partially unraveled the best known is the recognition of specific_targeting peptides that are present in the n or c terminal segments of the sequence the most investigated among them are i n_terminal signal_peptides targeting the proteins towards the er from where they are re directed to the rest of the endomembrane system and to the secretory_pathway ii n_terminal transit peptides targeting the proteins towards the intracellular_organelles namely mitochondria and plastids page
