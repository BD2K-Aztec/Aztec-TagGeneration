sequence_analysis discovering approximate associated sequence_patterns for protein_dna motivation the bindings between transcription_factors tfs and transcription_factor tfbss are fundamental protein_dna in transcriptional_regulation extensive efforts have been made to better understand the proteindna_interactions recent mining on exact tftfbs associated sequence_patterns rules has shown great potentials and achieved very promising results however exact rules cannot handle variations in real_data resulting in limited informative rules in this article we generalize the exact rules to approximate ones for both tfs and tfbss which are essential for biological_variations results a progressive approach is proposed to address the approximation to alleviate the computational requirements firstly similar tfbss are grouped from the available tftfbs data transfac database secondly approximate and highly_conserved binding cores are discovered from tf sequences corresponding to each tfbs group a customized algorithm is developed for the specific objective we discover the approximate tftfbs rules by associating the grouped tfbs consensuses and tf cores the rules discovered are evaluated by matching verifying with the actual proteindna binding pairs from protein_data pdb d structures the approximate results exhibit many more verified rules and up to better verification ratios than the exact ones the customized algorithm achieves over better verification ratios than traditional_methods approximate rules are shown statistically_significant detailed variation analysis and conservation verification on ncbi records demonstrate that the approximate rules reveal both the flexible and specific proteindna_interactions accurately the approximate tftfbs rules discovered show great generalized capability of exploring more informative binding rules availability supplementary data are available on bioinformatics online and http www cse proteindna_interactions in transcriptional_regulation are first introduced followed by the brief review on existing bioinformatics_methods to study proteindna_interactions the layout of the article is finally presented
