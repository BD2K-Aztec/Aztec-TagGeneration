sequence_analysis machine_learning prediction for peptide drift times in ion_mobility motivation ion_mobility ims has gained significant traction over the past_few for rapid high_resolution separations of analytes based upon gas_phase ion structure with significant potential_impacts in the field of proteomic_analysis ims coupled_with ms affords multiple improvements over traditional proteomics techniques such as in the elucidation of secondary_structure information identification of post_translational as well as higher identification rates with reduced experiment times the high_throughput nature of this technique benefits from accurate calculation of cross_sections mobilities and associated drift times of peptides thereby enhancing downstream data analysis here we present a model that uses physicochemical_properties of peptides to accurately_predict a peptides drift time directly from its amino_acid this model is used in conjunction with two mathematical techniques a partial_least and a support_vector setting results when tested on an experimentally created high_confidence database of peptide_sequences with measured drift times both techniques statistically significantly_outperform the intrinsic size parameters based calculations the currently held practice in the field on all charge states and availability the software executable impredict is available for download fromthe capability of ion_mobility coupled_with ims ms to characterize biological mixtures has been extensively reported ims offers fast separation times as well as additional information on ion structure that can assist e g identification of post_translational as well as gas_phase collision cross to whom correspondence should be addressed sections of peptides determination of collision cross_section can aid structural studies and provide_clues to understanding protein_function calculating the collision cross_section also facilitates peptide_identification and allows the reduction in false_discovery fdrs investigated the use of intrinsic size parameters isps for prediction of peptide ion cross_sections in ims while the results reported for this technique were promising the application of such a technique to high_throughput data analysis is challenging due to modeling the geometry of the ion which is required to solve a series of transport equations to determine the potential of interaction between the buffer gas atoms and the ion one of the first efforts for computationally calculating collision cross_sections and ion_mobility drift times was based on determination of the isps of amino_acid using calculations that were based on the stoichiometry of each residue the isp technique is based on the assumption that all peptides are closely_packed without major internal cavities and are near spherical in shape as a result the volume and thus the cross_section of a peptide is directly proportional to the sum of the areas of the constituent atoms divided by the total mass the use of the isp technique facilitates computational calculation of collision cross_sections and hence allows determination of ion mobilities and peptide drift times the prediction of peptide drift times has practical_application in peptide_identification and may assist in the reduction of fdrs in high_throughput ims experiments the isp method was tested on singly protonated peptides from the original peptides published in while the results of this calculation are accurate for this dataset the technique has not been tested on datasets containing higher charge states peptides a recent meeting abstract uses an artificial_neural to predict peptide drift times directly without calculating cross_sections and claims prediction_performance of over on charges peptides and peptides while reporting a performance on charge data peptides prediction_performance in a regression setting is calculated by selecting an error threshold and counting predictions within the error threshold as true predictions and those outside the threshold as false predictions a more recent method proposed bydeveloped quantitative structureproperty relationships qspr to predict the drift times for a set of peptides using information derived from molecular_structures additionally theygiven the increased application of ims to biological separations and proteomics research there is a need for a high_throughput fast computational_method to predict ion_mobility drift times
