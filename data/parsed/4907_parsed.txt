weighted pooling practical and cost_effective techniques for pooled high_throughput motivation despite the rapid decline in sequencing_costs sequencing large cohorts of individuals is still prohibitively_expensive recently several sophisticated pooling designs were suggested that can identify carriers of rare alleles in large cohorts with a significantly_smaller number of pools thus dramatically reducing the cost of such large_scale sequencing_projects these approaches use combinatorial pooling designs where each individual is either present or absent from a pool one can then infer the number of carriers in a pool and by combining information across pools reconstruct the identity of the carriers results we show that one can gain further efficiency and cost reduction by using weighted designs in which different individuals donate different amounts of dna to the pools intuitively in this situation the number of mutant reads in a pool does not only indicate the number of carriers but also their identity we describe and study a powerful example of such weighted designs using non overlapping pools we demonstrate that this approach is not only easier to implement and analyze but is also competitive in terms of accuracy with combinatorial designs when identifying rare_variants and is superior when sequencing common_variants we then discuss how weighting can be incorporated into existing combinatorial designs to increase their accuracy and demonstrate the resulting improvement using simulations finally we argue that weighted designs have enough power to facilitate detection of common_alleles so they can be used as a cornerstone of whole_exome projects the need for low_cost large_scale rare mutation screens is on the rise with the current shift of genome_wide towards rare_variants another major application of rare_variants genotyping is in prenatal screens for rare_genetic for example the israeli ministry of health sponsors carrier screening_tests for a list of severe and frequent genetic_diseases with prevalence higher than in live_births in different localities communities the israeli ministry of health also provides free of charge screening for taysachs a recessive neurodegenerative_disorder which is fatal by the age of to couples of jewish descent as well as screens for thalassemia an inherited autosomal_recessive blood disease to all the arab and druze populations to whom correspondence should be addressed and jews of mediterranean or asiatic descent recent_studies have described how sophisticated pooling designs for high_throughput hts technologies can be used to dramatically reduce the number of pools required for carrier identification and therefore can reduce the costs of such large_scale carrier screens drastically the cost reduction is accomplished because most of the cost of such projects is typically in the capture stage which has to be performed only once per pool reducing the capture cost even at the price of increasing the amount of sequencing can lead to very significant decrease in overall cost see typical calculations in section below using a smaller number of pools reduces the overall ability to reconstruct the genomes but the theory of sparse signal recovery also known as compressed_sensing guarantees that with high_probability the carriers of rare_mutations can be identified in the traditional pooled testing setup the result of testing each pool is a true false value this is the framework adopted bywho use the number of wild_type and mutant_allele reads in each pool to infer whether a pool contains carriers or not however the information obtained by sequencing a pool of mixed dna is not limited to a true false indication as to the presence of a carrier in the pool the number of mutant and wild_type allele reads can be used to infer the number of carriers within each pool where a high number of mutant reads is an indication of a high proportion of mutant allele_carriers in the pool this difference between the typical pooled testing scenario and the technology scenario was the basis of several recent works which suggested more complicated designs that take the specific scenario into account and design more efficient pooling and decoding strategies for identification of rare allele_carriers take a random design approach to identify extremely_rare carriers whiletake a more structured_approach and use a design based on the chinese reminder theorem crtd to identify rare allele_carriers these designs allow for the identification of multiple carriers another design which has been used in similar contexts is the shifted transversal design std one common_feature of these designs is that they are all combinatorial each individual is either present in a pool or absent from it using this combinatorial_approach one can at best hope to infer the number of carriers in a pool but not their identity this information is accumulated across the overlapping pools and the identity of the carriers is then decoded in a manner reminiscent of the way one solves a sudoku puzzle consider the following interesting riddle you are given a set of n coins one of which is counterfeit and therefore has a lighter weight what is the minimal number of weighing required to identify the counterfeit coins using a spring scale such spring scale riddles were studied extensivelyfor an overview and for simple versions of this riddle the solution generally requires o d log n weighings where n is the number of coins and d is the known number of counterfeit coins next consider a well known but less studied variation of this riddle instead of n coins we now have n coin piles one of which contains counterfeit coins in this case the counterfeit pile can be found with a single weighing by taking i coins from the i th pile and weighing all the selected coins together even if the number of counterfeit piles is unknown they can all be identified with a single weighing this requires taking a i coins from the i th pile such that the sequence a i n i is a subset sum distinct sequence a straightforward solution is to take i coins from the i th pile but denser subset sum distinct solutions exist such as the conwayguy sequence these riddles demonstrate the power of weighted designs the former riddle is solved using combinatorial designs where each coin is either included of excluded from each weighting the latter riddle allows us to take a different number of coins from each pile to and construct a much better strategy the fact that we use a different number of coins from each pile allows us eventually to identify any number of counterfeit coin piles with a single weighing the pooled sequencing scheme resembles the coin piles problem in the fact that we can pool different amounts of dna from each individual similarly to the way we take a different number of coins from each pile however there are two important differences first with pooled sequencing our measurements are noisythe proportion of mutant reads does not correspond directly to the proportion of mutant reads in the pool second the number of carriers in a group follows a binomial_distribution with the parameter p being the minor_allele maf which is either known or unknown depending on the exact scenario however in the following sections we demonstrate how taking the weighted approach can dramatically_increase the power of pooling designs just as it did for the riddles described above we start by analyzing nwds as discussed earlier we use a conservative error_rate of and an average coverage of i e r while this coverage is high for whole_genome sequencing_projects it is very reasonable when targeting a small number of genes or several known mutation loci as is the case in prenatal_screening we start by limiting the discussion to carrier screens that is the probability of observing a mutant homozygous individual is as discussed earlier this is the case when screening for lethal recessive mutants but also when sequencing mitochondrial_dna sex_chromosomes in males or monoploid organisms we relax this assumption in section we computed the optimal nwds and their corresponding values of p suc for d using to simulate the case of taysachs carrier screening in the jewish ashkenazi population the performance of these designs as a function of the actual carrier prevalence in the populationis given in our simulations show that for low compression levels d there is hardly any loss of p suc even for more common mutations the baseline for comparison is defined as the p suc obtained by assigning the wild_type genotype to all the individuals that is we then used numerical optimization to find the optimal nwd for various prevalence values compares the performance of the optimal nwd for each value of the optimal nwd for and the fair nwd for as described in section while the optimal nwd does outperform the other designs when as expected the differences between its performance and the performance of the taysachs optimal_design are small the fair design does not perform as well but this is expected given that it was not optimized with respect to p suc as means of comparison to the combinatorial designs we chose to focus on crtd and std and a cohort size of n individuals for the crtd we used windows of yielding a compression_rate of while for the std we used p and five windows yielding a compression_rate of the performance of these designs was estimated by running simulations for each prevalence value and calculating the empirical p suc the decoding was done by belief_propagation using iterations with a high damping factor to alleviate oscillation issues and by using x map instead of x since finding the latter is intractable for such cohort sizes the performance of these designs is compared to taysachs nwds with d in the combinatorial designs which rely on the principles of compressed_sensing display a near perfect reconstruction rate when the prevalence of carriers is small and therefore the signal is indeed sparse however as the prevalence increases the performance of the combinatorial designs quickly deteriorates and for prevalence higher than the signal is too dense to reconstruct and the performance of the designs is roughly_equivalent to simply assigning the wild_type allele to the entire group the nwds do not display this characteristic phase_transition but rather show a slow decline in performance with much better performance than combinatorial designs once for prevalences above to study the performance of hybrid designs we focused on hybrid designs with only two different weights which allows us to quantify their performance as a function of one parameterthe ratio of the weights w w we used a grid of values of w w and estimated the performance of the hybrid designs for a prevalence of using simulations each time the optimal weight ratio in both designs was w w and using w w that is resorting to the combinatorial designs displayed very poor_performance as can be seen in we then studied the performance of hybrid crtd and std using the optimal ratio as well as and and compared their performance to the corresponding combinatorial designs to do so we ran simulations for each of the ratios for each of the designs and for prevalence ranging from to using step_size of the results for crtd and std are displayed inand respectively and show a clear improvement in performance when weighting is used for example one can look at the minimal prevalence of carriers in the population such that p suc the combinatorial std crosses this threshold for prevalence of while for the hybrid designs with weight_ratios and this happens for prevalence of and respectively similarly one can look at the minimal prevalence such that the design underperforms the baseline which happens for prevalence of for the combinatorial std and for prevalence of and for the hybrid stds with weight_ratios and respectively results are qualitatively_similar for crtd encouraged by the significant_improvement in the performance of the combinatorial designs due to the introduction of two weights we studied the impact of adding a third weight we used a grid searchone two and three weights as well as a robust version of the three weights design with larger minimal weight to find the optimal weight_ratios for std with three weights for a population with carriers which was approximately w w and w w and estimated the performance of this design in the same manner as before the results show that the additional weight improves the performance of the design even further it might seem counterintuitive at first that assigning such small weights to some of the individuals improves the overall performance of hybrid designs the key to understanding this is that the decoding process crosses information between overlapping pools individuals with small weights in certain pools will have high weights in other pools and in these pools there would be less uncertainty regarding the identity of the carrier while each pool provides less information regarding the individuals with low weights it provides much more information regarding the individuals with high weights narrowing down the list of possible carriers by a factor of the number of weights for example with one carrier in a pool of combinatorial designs would only allow us to infer that one individual out of the in the pool is a carrier while a hybrid design with three weights would narrow the list down to possible carriers if the carrier is not assigned a small weight so pools where an individual has a small weight provide less information regarding this individual while pools where the individual has a larger weight provide more information and due to the design of overlapping pools this information can be used for better decoding the fact that this tradeoff is beneficial might seem less surprising when one thinks about the convexity property of the mutual_information mutual_information is a concept from information_theory that captures the reduction in uncertainty regarding the true value of one random variable x when we observe the value of a different variable y and is denoted i x y in our i
