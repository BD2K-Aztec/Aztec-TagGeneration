sparse multitask regression for identifying common mechanism of response to therapeutic_targets motivation molecular association of phenotypic_responses is an important step in hypothesis_generation and for initiating design of new experiments current_practices for associating gene_expression data with multidimensional phenotypic_data are typically i performed one to one i e each gene is examined independently with a phenotypic index and ii tested with one stress_condition at a time i e different perturbations are analyzed_separately as a result the complex coordination among the genes responsible for a phenotypic profile is potentially lost more importantly univariate_analysis can potentially hide new insights into common mechanism of response results in this article we propose a sparse multitask regression_model together with co clustering analysis to explore the intrinsic grouping in associating the gene_expression with phenotypic signatures the global structure of association is captured by learning an intrinsic template that is shared among experimental_conditions with local perturbations introduced to integrate effects of therapeutic_agents we demonstrate the performance of our approach on both synthetic and experimental_data synthetic data reveal that the multi task regression has a superior reduction in the regression error when compared with traditional l and l regularized_regression on the other hand experiments with cell_cycle inhibitors over a panel of breast_cancer demonstrate the relevance of the computed molecular predictors with the cell_cycle as well as the identification of hidden_variables that are not captured by the baseline regression_analysis accordingly the system has identified clca as a hidden transcript and as a common mechanism of response for two therapeutic_agents of ci and iressa which are currently in clinical use genome_wide of expression and phenotypic_data are becoming a routine methodology for identifying potential biomarkers while the literature is rich with supervised or unsupervised_clustering of genomic_information methods for studying the relationships between genomic and phenotypic_data remain relatively limited existing association methods are typically based on the univariate correlation_analysis which either correlates a single gene to the resultant phenotype s or vice_versa this is known as the gene and phenotype based_approaches respectively more recently quantized large number of transcript data through clustering and associated them with physiological_responses or clinical metadata in contrast another group of researchers have taken a new direction by first clustering morphometric_data and then associating with the transcript data han to whom correspondence should be addressed however in both cases correlation is based on the independent pairwise univariate_analysis pairwise univariate correlation_analysis can quickly provide important association information as well as candidates for further screening however it treats the genes and the phenotypes as independent and isolated units therefore the underlying interacting relationships between the units might be lost it is well known that some transcripts act as regulatory nodes driving other transcripts in a coordinated manner to determine the phenotypic profile additionally incubation with each therapeutic reagent simultaneously interferes with a subset of genes here we hypothesized that simultaneous incorporation of genomewide expression data coupled with phenotypic_data computed from multiple perturbation conditions each targeting a different molecular region can elucidate a common mechanism of response that may be hidden otherwise in fact perturbation and molecular_diversity of the model system have shown to be capable of reducing the samples needed for biological inference thus enhancing robustness of biological conclusion thus we ask the following questions how can traditional univariate associations be modeled simultaneously and in the absence of a correlation threshold how can the inherent sparsity of association be formalized within an optimization framework how can one compensate for the lack of replicates due to the high experimental cost associated with gene_expression to address_these we have developed an integrated platform that simultaneously and systematically takes_into an ensemble of gene and phenotypic signatures such an enterprise must incorporate an experimental_design with sufficient degree of molecular_diversity for increased computational robustness in this context molecular_diversity is achieved by using a panel of breast_cancer that are well characterized and readily available through american_type collection our computational framework consists of two major_steps first a vector valued multitask regression formulation is adopted to model the relationships between transcripts and phenotypes under multiple experimental_conditions in particular the regression_coefficients are factorized into two parts one part is a shared template that suggests a common mechanism of action under various treatments the second part is related to the perturbation that is induced locally in the transcript network under individual perturbation the regression has to be sparse because only a subset of genes is typically involved in a specific phenotypic response sparsity is enforced through l norm regularization which inherently removes outliers and irrelevant associations the end result is a sparse regression matrix that captures intrinsic_properties of genephenotype association this matrix is reordered for improved visualization of the gene phenotype grouping where the reordering aims at an optimum permutation of rows and columns of the regression matrix such thatour proposed method has been tested with both synthetic and experimental_data the synthetic data is used for method validation and profiling against other known techniques our studies with experimental_data identified molecular predictors of cell_cycle data from baseline gene_expression data our experiments with synthetic data have clearly demonstrated that multitask_learning offers the following advantages over independent l regression i regression is less noisy ii regression error is reduced as a function of the number of tasks and iii hidden_variables are revealed since traditional l regression can push non zero coefficients to zero and vice_versa therefore the bulk of the discussion in this section is devoted to the experimental_data by focusing on a few important genes and their independent analysis through ingenuity_pathway ipa and pathway studio i clca is a hidden variable that has been identified through multitask regression and is shown to be negatively associated with the s phase we hypothesized that clca is a common mechanism of response for inhibitors ci and iressa this gene is known to be downregulated in breast_cancer in addition to being a p client its knockdown leads to increased invasiveness and it is epigenetically regulated it is also a tumor_suppressor that may be a potential target for therapy it is likely that clca acts as a common molecular_switch to inhibit dna_synthesis and initiate apoptosis as a result of treatment with either therapeutic_agent therefore it not only serves as a therapeutic_target but can also be used in combination with other therapeutic_targets used today for improved lethality ii nlrp is regulated by nfb and is shown to be expressed in mda_mb and mcf breast_cancer this particular gene appears in both independent and multitask regression furthermore the gene_ontology indicates that nlrp is in involved in caspase activities and apoptosis we hypothesized that strong g arrest and complementary negative correlation with cells being in s is the result of treatment with the therapeutic_agent this particular gene is reflected in multitask regression and independent regression_analysis corresponding to ci and iressa it is also a potential common mechanism of response for further analysis iii cdkn a also known as p expression is positively associated with g arrest in normal cells and tissues but is negatively associated with the s phase in our analysis of the human i breast_tumor cell_lines in both the independent regression ofand the multitask regression of this discrepancy is likely explained by the fact that most of the malignant cell_lines in the panel have aberrations in downstream_effectors of the product of this gene the aberrations result in continued proliferation in the presence of p expression that ordinarily would yield cell_cycle and senescence iv csta is involved in apoptosis and differentiation and is normally regulated by jun and fos whose gene_products together constitute the ap transcription_factor ap drives the expression of a number of genes that are necessary for cell_cycle the relationships between these proteinprotein_interactions are shown in this gene appears in multitask and one of the independent regression_analysis v ca is an example of the gene that is reported by both independent association of gene_expression data with ci and the multitask regression_analysis ca is ordinarily involved in differentiation and apoptosis overexpressed in mcf and mda_mb and negatively_correlated with the s phase in the drug treated cells sirna_mediated interference with human ca gene_expression has been shown to decrease survival of mda_mb cell_lines finally we performed an independent analysis by using ingenuity_pathway and pathway studio scientific software that helps researchers more effectively search explore visualize and analyze biological and chemical findings related to genes proteins and small_molecules we selected the set of genes that was correlated with the s phase and uploaded them into ipa and pathway studio the ipa analysis indicated that this group of genes is largely involved in i cell_cycle and signaling_networks and ii cancer the net result is a more substantial support for gene by gene analysis similar results have been obtained from pathway studio which provides gene_set gsea and identifies common regulators with the user_defined number of neighbors gene enrichment_analysis revealed that predicted gene groups are involved in response to toxin drug negative regulation of cell_proliferation negative regulation of peptidase activity where s phase is one of them and apoptosis among top_ranked groups furthermore a number of common regulators with high p values were also inferred that are associated with the cell_cycle shows three regulators of mapk jun fos and gf and their target entities in summary multitask_learning has the potential to summarize a vast amount of data compute biologically_relevant markers and identify hidden_variables that traditional regressors may fail to capture although the technique is currently applied for integration of gene_expression data with cell_cycle data it can also be used for other integrative biology applications
