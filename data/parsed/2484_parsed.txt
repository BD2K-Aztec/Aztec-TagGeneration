sequence_analysis insect in silico search for co occurring transcription_factors motivation transcriptional_regulation occurs through the concerted actions of multiple transcription_factors tfs that bind cooperatively to cis_regulatory crms of genes these crms usually contain a variable number of transcription_factor tfbss involved in related cellular and physiological_processes chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq has been effective in detecting tfbss and nucleosome location to identify potential crms in genome_wide studies although several attempts were previously_reported to predict the potential binding of tfs at tfbss within crms by comparing different chip_seq these have been hampered by excessive background usually emerging as a consequence of experimental_conditions to understand these complex regulatory_circuits it would be helpful to have reliable and updated user_friendly tools to assist in the identification of tfbss and crms for gene s of interest results here we present insect in silico search for co occurring transcription_factors a novel web_server for identifying potential tfbss and crms in gene sequences by combining several strategies insect provides flexible analysis of multiple co occurring tfbss by applying differing search schemes and restriction parameters availability_and insect is freely_available as a web_server atregulation of transcription occurs through the concerted actions of multiple_tfs that bind to cis_regulatory crms experimental_techniques such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq have provided valuable insight into the mechanisms_governing gene_regulation however these techniques produce large_amounts of data of variable quality inherent to the complex experimental_conditions used the inconvenience together with high data analysis costs makes this strategy unappealing without specific information to help reduce the dataset before performing experiments the availability of more efficient sequencing_techniques together with the growing number of genomes deposited on public_databases provides an ideal scenario for development of bioinformatics_tools facilitating design of future_experiments in this field several tools have been recently_developed to search and characterize the transcription_factor tfbss of crms by dissecting relationships among them van currently available tfbss search tools can be grouped into two major approaches i motif_discovery tfbss are inferred by analyzing a group of sequences that are considered to be under the regulation of a particular transcription_factor tf and ii motif search to determine the location where a tf is more likely to bind by searching its corresponding tfbs over sequence_datasets the constant progress in experimental_technologies and the establishment and execution of initiatives such as the encode_project have helped to characterize large sets of tfbss thus a considerable amount of position_weight pwms i e elements that represent a group of sequences that are recognized by a specific tf has been deposited on databases such as transfac jaspar and uniprobe such matrices derived from alignment and processing of target_sequences can be used to search potential tfbss over genomes and sequences as well as to establish potential sites of gene_regulation an important limitation of this methodology is its high false_positive fpr according to the futility theorem the presence of non functional_binding for a given tf can be three orders_of higher compared with the actual number of functional sites of genomes fpr reduction without compromising the sensitivity of the method is challenging and several strategies have been designed to tackle this problem however many of these tools are organism specific i cistarget dire discontinued in their maintenance mscan cis analyst outdated moduleminer tfbscluster premod or lack flexibility and are difficult to use by non computational scientists as reviewed by van importantly most of these tools do not allow implementation of rules regarding the relationships between the individual tfbss of a particular crm this caveat represents a significant limitation during crm screening nevertheless most of these tools have to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as proven quite valuable to the scientific_community assisting in the characterization and study of crms here we present insect in silico search for co occurring transcription_factors a novel motif search web_tool for identification of potential tfbss and crms by combining different strategies insect allows for complete and flexible analysis of multiple co occurring tfbss we have compared insect performance with other tools analyzing experimental_data related to the regulation of genes by sox and oct tfs in embryonic_stem escs the regulatory_networks of mouse and human esc properties have been studied extensively many target_genes of the sox and oct tfs have been identified using genome_wide chip followed by dna microarray_analysis these tfs in addition to an additional tf nanog appear to act in concert to regulate a limited repertoire of target_genes tightly regulating the escs pluripotent_state insect was tested by searching two experimental_datasets for tfbss of sox and oct two tfs involved in maintaining pluripotency in escs in the rodda dataset analysis crms composed by sox and oct binding_sites were searched over potential regulatory_sequences corresponding to six genes that were experimentally demonstrated to have these tfbs by we compared insect results and performance with three existing motif search tools we show that insect outperformed the other tools in almost every analysis in the boyer dataset analysis sox and oct co occurrences were analyzed in gene sequences from a chip experiment reported by a sliding_window search for three co occurring tfbss with spacing restriction set by a window_size of n bp b master driven search for a master tf and two co occurring tfs with differing maximum spacing restrictionsinsect is designed as a user_friendly interface to minimize tool usage complexity along with integration of several methods that aim to assist in visualization and analysis of results insect dynamically generates tracks that can be submitted and automatically opened within the ucsc_genome to analyze the detected crms and their relationship to surrounding genomic_regions in this context insect tracks can be analyzed along with tracks as the chip_seq dnase_i rnaseq dna_methylation information and many other features provided by the encode_project on the ucsc_genome while insect only provides in silico estimation the information generated using this tool may be a valuable guide for experimentation design and hypothesis construction for example it was previously_suggested that the relative orientation between sox and oct binding_sites is critical based on structural analysis of ternary_complex among these two factors and dna insect is the only solution among the tools evaluated here that can apply the strand restriction and restrict relative orientations between tfbss within crms we have demonstrated how insect facilitates crm search analysis on experimental_data derived from different biochemical_techniques in the rodda dataset we found that insect outperforms other tools in terms of sensitivity_and in cases where the true_positive is known a priori we also showed a more real exploratory_analysis with chip data from the boyer dataset finally we analyzed the genomic environment of different crms detected by displaying them in the ucsc_genome as a custom track to detect those genes with more promising tfbs hits analysis accounted for whether crms were located on regions corresponding to the encode tfs chip_seq histone_marks and regions of high transcriptional_activity many tools were developed to search for potential tfbss within crms by implementing pwms however there are differing criteria for scoring and determining whether a given subsequence is a potential tfbs or not a group of tools statistically decides whether a substring constitutes a possible tfbs comparing its enrichment within a promoter_region with respect to a background set and the subsequent calculation of p values there are several ways of achieving this comparison as seen in the implementation of tools such as cpmodule motifviz and cluster buster as p value based_algorithms require a background set for comparison there are many variables that can affect results that are not inherent to the pwm definition itself but the background some parameters such as the length of the analyzed sequences number of random pwm used to measure enrichment or even the motif lengths represented by the pwms can affect the results obtained by p value based_methods we considered that normalization of pwm scores by mmsc eliminates this problem given that determination of quality for a site does not rely on comparison with random_sequences but the pwm itself the latter relies on the hypothesis that if the pwm is representative of the real motif the mmsc value potentially has a more relevant_biological meaning as it relates directly to the affinity between tfs and their dna target_sites we have built a flexible method that allows researchers to define parameters to find potential crms instead of isolated insect visualization in ucsc_genome for hoxb along with histone markers and tfs chip_seq tracks from encode sets of tfbss by adding the phylogenetic_footprinting search option insect makes crm identification more robust we confirmed the search and result display capabilities of insect in two different datasets the ability to perform analyses that are usually difficult or not possible with most of the available tools because they are not available fully as web_servers command_line programs are difficult to use or they do not offer the insect web_server functionality demonstrates the advantages of having an integrated motif search tool
