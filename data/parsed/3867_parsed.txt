ranking models of transmembrane barrel proteins using z coordinate predictions motivation transmembrane barrels exist in the outer_membrane as well as in chloroplast and mitochondria they are often involved in transport_processes and are promising antimicrobial drug_targets structures of only a few barrel protein_families are known therefore a method that could automatically generate such models would be valuable the symmetrical arrangement of the barrels suggests that an approach based on idealized geometries may be successful results here we present tobmodel a method for generating d models of barrel transmembrane_proteins first alternative topologies are obtained from the boctopus topology predictor thereafter several d models are constructed by using different angles of the sheets finally the best model is selected based on agreement with a novel predictor zpred which predicts the distance from the center of the membrane for each residue i e the z coordinate the z coordinate prediction has an average_error of tobmodel predicts the correct topology for of the proteins in the dataset which is a slight improvement over boctopus alone more importantly however tobmodel provides a c template with an average rmsd of from the native_structure availability tobmodel is freely_available as a web_server at http tobmodel cbr su se the datasets used for training and evaluations are also available from this site there are two classes of integral transmembrane membrane_proteins helical proteins and barrels helical transmembrane_proteins constitute of a typical genome the transmembrane barrels which are the focus of this article are less abundant and only found in the outer_membrane chloroplast and mitochondria although less abundant transmembrane barrels are known to play_a in the transport over the membrane and additionally in pore_formation they are also candidate targets for the development of antimicrobial_drugs the experimental determination of the structure of transmembrane_proteins is fraught with difficulties and thus computational_methods are essential for identification and structural prediction in particular such predictions can be used for further to whom correspondence should be addressed experimental_investigations and might aid in elucidating the function of these proteins given the symmetrical structure of barrels it is possible to generate models directly from a theoretical description of a barrel obviously these structural_models might provide insights into the interactions between residues further a d model can be used to design sitedirected mutagenesis experiments and can be used in the modeling of large membrane protein_complexes such as the tom complex of the mitochondrial_outer many methods have been developed for the prediction of barrel transmembrane_protein topology in addition methods like partifold and tmbpro predict the inter strand residue_contacts however to our knowledge only two methods predict a full d model tmbpro and d spot in fact the latter requires the protein topology as input so it is only tmbpro that provides the full sequence to structure_prediction tmbpro is based on secondary_structure and prediction of residue_contacts in potential transmembrane barrels tmbpro uses templates derived from known transmembrane barrels and aligns the predicted_secondary to one of the predefined templates based on the number of predicted strands however as discussed by template based_methods cannot be applied to novel folds such as transmembrane barrels with an odd number of strands d spot is based on optimizing hydrogen_bonds and side chain interactions between adjacent strands three different types of bonds are taken into account strong hydrogen_bonds weak hydrogen_bonds and side chain interactions during optimization adjacent strands are shifted up and down to obtain the lowest energy arrangement the final model is then built using an intertwined coil geometric model where each strand is represented by a coil wrapped around a hypothetical cylinder and each coil is separately modeled finally main_chain atoms are added to the c trace using an algorithm developed by here we present tobmodela computational_method for modeling of transmembrane barrels the workflow of tobmodel is outlined in as shown first boctopus is used to generate a set of potential topologies for a given protein_sequence the second step is to generate a set of alternative d models using barrels with idealized geometries for each topology finally to rank the models we developed a novel is used to generate topologies thereafter d c models are generated using the predicted topologies and different shear numbers finally zpred is used to predict the z coordinate of each residue then the models are ranked based on the lowest z coordinate error z coordinate predictor zpred the ranking is determined by the agreement between on the one hand the z coordinate predictions from zpred and on the other the z coordinates from the model further tobmodel provides better topologies than tmbpro based on a fold_cross test the quality of the final model generated by tobmodel is comparable to the final tmbpro model while d spot seems to generate better models here we present a novel method tobmodel that given the amino_acid for a barrel membrane_protein generates a c model first hundreds of alternative topologies are produced by means of our barrel topology predictor boctopus subsequently many alternative c models are generated for each topology finally the best of all these models is selected based on the agreement between a model and the predicted distance z coordinate from the center of the membrane this distance is predicted using a novel support_vector based predictor zpred the selection procedure results in a slightly_higher number of correct topologies compared to boctopus alone tobmodel performs well compared to available methods although the quality of the models generated by tobmodel is somewhat worse than models generated by d spot it is on par with models by tmbpro the only previously_published method for barrel membrane_protein prediction that takes protein_sequences as input rather than precomputed topologies further the average rmsd of top ranking models generated by tobmodel is taken together our results indicate that the inclusion of z coordinate errors in the modeling of transmembrane barrels is a promising new direction and further suggest that additional selection_criteria and more accurate modeling may further improve our method
