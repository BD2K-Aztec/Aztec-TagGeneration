databases_and gossto a stand alone application and a web_tool for calculating semantic similarities on the gene_ontology we present gossto the gene_ontology semantic_similarity tool a user_friendly software system for calculating semantic similarities between gene_products according to the gene_ontology gossto is bundled with six semantic_similarity including both term and graph_based measures and has extension capabilities to allow the user to add new similarities importantly for any measure gossto can also calculate the random_walk contribution that has been shown to greatly improve the accuracy of similarity_measures gossto is very fast easy to use and it allows the calculation of similarities on a genomic_scale in a few minutes on a regular desktop machine contact alberto cs rhul ac uk availability gossto is available both as a stand alone application running on gnu linux windows and macos from www paccanaro lab org gossto and as a web_application from www paccanarolab org gosstoweb the stand alone application features a simple and concise command_line for easy integration into high_throughput data_processing pipelines semantic_similarity have become important in bioinformatics as they provide a way of quantifying the functional relatedness between genes that is complementary to both experimental information and sequence based_approaches this is done by annotating genes to the terms of a chosen ontology and then quantifying the similarity between these terms among the ontologies the gene_ontology go has become a standard and is the focus of this work several semantic_similarity have been proposed for example those by jiang and conrath and lin are based on the information content of the lowest_common of pairs of terms and are often referred to as term based simui and simgic and grasm compare sets of terms rather than single terms using graph comparison approaches and are often referred to as graph_based an important recent development has been the introduction of the random_walk contribution which greatly_improves semantic_similarity in their paper the authors argued that existing_measures have two important deficiencies first they do not take into account the descendants of the terms second they do not model the inherent uncertainty in the current annotations and ontology structure the random_walk contribution is a kind of add on for existing similarity_measures that enhances them to correct these two issues few software_tools have been proposed for calculating semantic similarities including proteinon it gom and g sesame however none of them can combine the random_walk contribution proposed by moreover tools provided as stand alone applications are not readily extendable with new semantic_similarity or are available only as packages running within environments such as r or matlab other tools are exclusively available online and their use is impractical for high_throughput analysis on large bodies of data most tools do not allow for a straightforward calculation of semantic similarities for a whole_genome or an easy updating of the go annotations in this article we present gossto gene_ontology semantic_similarity tool a new tool for calculating semantic similarities that overcomes all of the above limitations gossto includes the random_walk contribution byand it supports both term and graph_based similarity_measures gossto is available in downloadable binary form with the entire source_code released under gplv gossto is easy to use and very fasttable shows the time required for calculating the resnik semantic_similarity including the random_walk contribution for a few model_organisms gossto features a simple and concise command_line and an application_programming api for easy integration into highthroughput data_processing pipelines gosstos design allows for user provided similarity_measures to be independently to whom correspondence should be addressed
