the assembly of mirna mrna protein regulatory_networks using high_throughput expression data motivation inference of gene_regulatory from high_throughput measurement of gene_and is particularly attractive because it allows the simultaneous discovery of interactive molecular signals for numerous_genes and proteins at a relatively low_cost results we developed two score based local causal learning algorithms that utilized the markov blanket search to identify direct regulators of target_mrnas and proteins these two algorithms were specifically_designed for integrated high_throughput rna and protein data simulation_study showed that these algorithms outperformed other state of the art gene_regulatory learning algorithms we also generated integrated mirna mrna and protein expression data based on high_throughput analysis of primary trophoblasts derived from term human_placenta and cultured under standard or hypoxic_conditions we applied the new algorithms to these data and identified gene_regulatory for a set of trophoblastic proteins found to be differentially_expressed under the specified culture_conditions complex and adaptive biological_systems exhibit homeostatic resilience they are also capable of adopting a new steady_state in response to endogenous or exogenous cues and must therefore harbor robust transcriptional and translational regulatory_networks network signals are transmitted within the cell tissue or organismal environment microrna regulatory_networks represent an important component of the adaptive cellular response de lella there are extensive descriptions of the derivation of mirna_regulatory using experimental or computational_methods experimental_approaches are based on profiling and manipulation of signals such as mirnas knockdown overexpression and assessment of mrna_expression changes or on enrichment approaches where mirnas and mrnas are pulled down with the argonaute protein as in hits_clip or par_clip experiments these approaches are used for searching mirna mrna binding_sites and the interactions among the selected transcripts computational_methods such as targetscan mirdb and pictar are largely based on in silico strategies where the mirnas mrna_targets are predicted by thermodynamic_analysis of mirna sequence and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com evolutionary_conserved potential_binding e g in the utr with the mrna_transcripts each of these approaches has advantages_and for example the experimental_approaches can definitively address the regulatory relations between mirnas and target_mrnas and hence tend to serve as a gold_standard yet they are also expensive and tedious in addition enrichment for mirna and mrna by pull_down approaches may not imply a functional interaction in silico approaches are fast and relatively cheap but may provide an extensive list of possible mirna mrna interactions and fall short of inferring dynamic relations between mirnas and mrnas in any specific cell_type or tissue unlike the experimental and the in silico approaches the statistical_approaches derive regulatory relations among mirnas and mrnas through analysis of mirna and mrna_expression data in particular linear_regression based_methods have been employed in the search of mirnas that directly regulate targeted mrnas in a specific system in these methods the log expression of an mrna is assumed to be expressed as a linear combination of the log expression of mirnas targeting that mrna and or the product of the log expression of the targeting mirnas and argonaute transcripts various model_selection methods including stepwise model_selection using information criterion score l norm regularization based lasso algorithm can be used to identify_mirnas that are significant predictors of target_mrnas these selected mirnas are assumed to be regulators of the target_mrna the main advantages of these regression based_methods are that i they can utilize observational expression data that were generated for other purposes in order to derive the mirna regulatory_network for a particular system and ii they can be used with little or no modification to identify the targets of any non_coding ncrnas however a major weakness inherent to the implementation of these methods to mirna_regulatory is their inability to distinguish between partial_correlation and causation therefore even when the assumptions of these algorithms were satisfied mirnas discovered using these algorithms will not only contain species that regulate target_mrnas but also mirnas concomitantly regulated with the target_mrna or with the protein product of the target_mrna see a hypothetical mirna mrna protein regulatory_network in supplementary in the past two and half decades there have been rapid developments in research on learning causal_relations from observational_data a variety of causal learning algorithms have been proposed including score based_algorithms constraint based_algorithms local learning algorithms algorithms allowing latent_variables cyclic causal_relations time series data and non gaussian numeric data these causal learning algorithms seem particularly suitable for inferring_gene from high_throughput however applying causal learning algorithms to the construction of gene_regulatory raises two major_obstacles i the regulatory_networks are extremely_complex involving thousands of mrnas ncrnas proteins and other molecular_species and ii the sample_size of the ncrna mrna_and data may be small often magnitudes less than the number of analyzed variables in this article we propose two new causal learning algorithms for inference of local ncrna mrna protein regulatory_networks given a target_mrna protein these algorithms identify the molecular_species that directly regulate the target and the molecular_species that are directly regulated by the target these algorithms use a score based local learning_strategy to address the challenges of a large number of ncrna mrna protein_sets in the network the first algorithm called the markov blanket search for mrna regulatory_networks mbsmrn requires knowledge of the molecular_species that are directly regulated by the target_molecule and is specifically_designed for identifying direct regulators of mrnas the second algorithm called the markov blanket search for non gaussian integrated genomic_data mbsnig requires the expression data for the target molecular_species to be count_data e g sequencing count_data for mirna mrna_expression and mass_spectral count_data for protein expression and can be applied to ncrna mrna protein expression data generated from most experimental_designs we evaluated the performance of these two algorithms using simulated_data and compared them with two representative algorithms the general_purpose max min hill climbing mmhc algorithm for local causal discovery and the lasso regression_based algorithm for mirna_regulatory the mmhc algorithm starts with a constraint based local learning algorithm maxmin parents and children to derive for each variable a list of candidate parents and children cpc of that variable this algorithm then orients and possibly trims the edges connecting the target variable and its cpc using a score based hill climbing algorithm the lasso regression_based algorithm selects a set of mirnas and proteins that best predict the expression of the target_mrna protein using the lasso based feature_selection method the selected mirnas proteins are considered the direct regulators of the target_mrna protein we also applied our new algorithms to an integrated mirna mrna protein expression data_set from experiments using primary human_placental trophoblasts that were exposed for h to standard culture_conditions or to hypoxia o which mimics physiologically_relevant placental injury we selected target_mrna protein pairs and for each of them identified the mirnas and proteins that directly regulated the target_mrna and protein from the integrated mirna mrna protein dataset for trophoblasts cultured in standard or hypoxic_conditions we detected the expression of mirnas mrnas and lincrnas and proteins among them we identified mirnas and mrnas and lincrnas that were differentially_expressed during the time course and or between standard or hypoxic culture_conditions using the generalized_linear effect model we also found differentially_expressed the heatmaps for these differentially_expressed mrnas and proteins are shown in supplementary the clustering of differentially_expressed mrnas proteins revealed common expression_patterns relative to time some mirna mrna protein_sets were up regulated throughout the experimental time course in both standard and hypoxic_conditions while others were down_regulated under both conditions other sets were down_regulated under standard conditions but up regulated in hypoxia and some were up regulated in standard conditions but down_regulated in hypoxia a pathway analysis of these different groups of proteins revealed the enrichment of network functions involved in energy_production lipid_metabolism and small_molecule biochemistry among molecular and cellular_functions the most abundant were cellular_growth and proliferation of proteins analyzed by interactive pathways analysis ingenuity systems the multi dimension scaling plots of all expressed mirnas mrnas and proteins highlighted patterns of mrna protein expression_profiles in trophoblasts cultured in standard or hypoxic_conditions over the time course supplementary we selected proteins that were differentially_expressed over the time course and or between the standard and hypoxic_conditions by both the generalized linear_mixed and the maanova algorithm they all had a minimal average spectral count of over all protein samples we generated an integrated regulatory_network for each of these proteins and their respective mrna_transcripts using the mbsmrn and mbsnig algorithms representative networks are shown in supplementary supplementaryprovides plots of the expression of the mirnas mrnas and proteins in thesethe pr curves and roc_curves of the competing regulatory_network learning algorithms for direct
