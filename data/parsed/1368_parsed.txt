data_and determining conserved metabolic biomarkers from a million database queries motivation metabolite databases provide a unique window into metabolome research allowing the most commonly searched biomarkers to be catalogued omic scale metabolite_profiling or metabolomics is finding increased utility in biomarker_discovery largely driven by improvements in analytical technologies and the concurrent developments in bioinformatics however the successful translation of biomarkers into clinical or biologically_relevant indicators is limited results with the aim of improving the discovery of translatable metabolite biomarkers we present search analytics for over one million metlin metabolite database queries the most common me tabolites found in metlin were cross correlated against xcms online the widely used cloud_based data_processing and pathway analysis platform analysis of the metlin and xcms common metabolite data has two primary implications these metabolites might indicate a conserved metabolic_response to stressors and this data may be used to gauge the relative uniqueness of potential biomarkers availability_and metlin can be accessed by logging on to https search analytics is now regularly utilized as an unbiased and anonymous method to survey populations in a sense each query is a report of some circumstance or set of circumstances that has lead the user to carry out a search for instance the user might be searching a symptom they are experiencing or the search may reflect a personal bias in either case this information can be informative within the context of a community recent examples_include the use of search data to model influenza outbreaks and in another case researchers were able to design a rough measure with this in mind and starting from the premise that the majority of users searching the metlin database are from the population engaged in metabolomic_studies we set out to use analytics to survey the broad range of metabolomics research reflected in metlin search data and reveal the most commonly_encountered biomarkers the potential impact of biomarker_research is far reaching involving diagnosis prognosis drug efficacy and the development of personalized_medicine one particularly intriguing aspect of biomarker_discovery is the prospect of reducing the overall cost of health_care by increasing the level of medical_care through early_diagnosis or through the development of patient specific_therapies it is therefore understandable that a significant effort has been dedicated to the discovery of unique disease specific molecules as evidenced by the thousands of biomarker related papers the importance of biomarker_discovery coupled to the accessibility of new high_sensitivity analytical technology has contributed to this broad interest however a lack of standard best practices has meant that discoveries often have very little practical value the thousands of papers that have been published on biomarkers have yielded relatively little success for example while the number of biomarker publications have increased by over each year the number of patent applications for clinical biomarkers remains level metabolomics based biomarker_discovery publications are progressively contributing to this body of work and also show the same trends with the exception of the robust inborn_errors screens there are relatively few new clinical metabolite based tests metabolomic experiments whether they are accomplished through the use of traditional gc_ms technologies first demonstrated in the early s by linus pauling and horning or current liquid_chromatography lc_ms instrumentation are well suited for gaining a comprehensive and quantitative view of the metabolome these approaches have the ability to detect thousands of metabolites from biological_samples with high_resolution high_sensitivity and a dynamic range typically exceeding four orders_of as a result it is possible to quickly generate datasets rich in metabolite information a typical workflow for metabolomics involves several steps first mass_spectral is collected for each sample in each sample group next the data is analyzed by any number of data_processing platforms including metabolic profiler bruker simca p umetrics markerlynx waters mass profiler pro agilent metalign mzmine maven metaboanalyst and xcms online to identify the features that significantly change between sample groups the significantly dysregulated features are then given a putative identification by searching metabolite databases such as metlin supplementary metlin is a highly accessed database used for metabolite_identification since its inception in metlin has grown to contain over metabolites of which also have ms_ms data in both positive_and ionization modes at four different collision energies supplementary more than users and over citations of the original publication are indicators of its wide_application in addition metlin has been integrated with xcms online providing metabolite identifications for the users of this cloud_based data_processing platform the consistent increase in metlin use supplementary is largely due to the wide_spread adoption of mass_spectrometry as an exploratory tool by biologists and biochemists this has been facilitated by the increased access to mass_spectrometry technologies that are sensitive and easy to use furthermore the development of userfriendly bioinformatic platforms and integrated statistical_tools mentioned earlier has removed a significant technical barrier technology has also leveled the playing field so that researchers are typically using similar tools which for the most part are composed of liquid_chromatography to an atmospheric_pressure ionization source and either time of flight tof quadrupole timeof flight qtof or quadrupole orbi trap q exactive mass analyzers with a consistent degree of quantitative and mass accuracy thus the masses searched in metlin provide a representation of the discriminatory metabolites from metabolomic experiments here in order to gain a perspective on the metabolites being searched metlin archival data was searched and examined to determine commonly observed metabolites across one million queries
