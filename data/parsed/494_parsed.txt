asdb a resource for probing protein functions with small_molecules identifying chemical probes or seeking scaffolds for a specific biological target is important for protein_function studies therefore we create the annotated scaffold database asdb a computer readable and systematic target annotated scaffold database to serve such needs the scaffolds in asdb were derived from public_databases including chembl drugbank and tcmsp with a scaffold based classification approach each scaffold was assigned with an inchikey as its unique_identifier energy minimized d conformations and other calculated properties a scaffold is also associated with drugs natural_products drug_targets and medical indications the database can be retrieved through text or structure query tools asdb collects scaffolds which are associated with targets the scaffolds consist of scaffolds derived from drugs and scaffolds derived from natural_products for given scaffolds scaffold target networks can be generated from the database to demonstrate the relations of scaffolds and targets availability_and asdb is freely_available www rcdd org cn asdb with the major web_browsers medicinal chemists phytochemists and chemical biologists are seeking novel chemical scaffolds or probes for a specific biological target mainly a protein therefore great attention has been paid in developing methods and resources to discover new chemical scaffolds or probes associated with biological_targets in the high_throughput synthesis and screening campaigns privileged scaffolds were identified to establish structure activity relations sar for further property and activity optimizations small chemical scaffolds have been studied for many years and resulted in many scaffold oriented techniques including scaffold_hopping virtual_screening and diversity oriented synthesis bemis and murcko are the pioneers in chemical scaffold concept used the scaffold concept to classify compounds and measure molecular_diversity bajorath and colleagues studied scaffolds and activity cliffs relations scaffolds and activities these scaffold related studies generated new needs for chemical scaffold resources shen and coworkers developed a scaffold database for scaffold_hopping studies to systematically study current chemical scaffolds associated with biological_targets we created an annotated scaffold data base asdb asdb collects chemical scaffolds derived from the major databases for medicinal_chemistry or chemical_biology the scaffolds have been databases and can be retrieved through structural query or text query tools to demonstrate scaffold target and scaffold scaffold relations asdb provides a network viewing tool to present the database_search hits
