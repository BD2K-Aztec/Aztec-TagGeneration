bayexer an accurate and fast bayesian demultiplexer for illumina sequences demultiplexing is used after high_throughput to in silico assign reads to the samples of origin based on the sequenced_reads of the indices existing demultiplexing tools based on the similarity between the read index and the reference index sequences may fail to provide satisfactory_results on low quality datasets we developed bayexer a bayesian demultiplexing algorithm for illumina sequencers bayexer uses the information extracted directly from the contaminant sequences of the targeting reads as the training_dataset for a navenave bayes classifier to assign reads according to our evaluation bayexer provides higher capability accuracy and speed on various real_datasets than other tools although the rapid_improvement of next_generation is dramatically increasing data output and reducing sequencing_costs multiplexing which allows large_numbers of samples to be sequenced simultaneously during a single sequencing run is also raising sample_throughput commonly multiplexing is achieved by adding different specifically_designed short_sequences referred to as indices to the sequencing adapters of each sample the in silico process after sequencing to determine the origin sample of each read by comparing the sequenced indices sis with the reference indices ris is called demultiplexing because sequencing_errors occur sis do not always perfectly match the ris the demultiplexers casava bcl fastq provided by illumina allow for or hamming distances between the sis and ris splitaake https github com faircloth lab splitaake and deindexer https github com ws deindexer use levenshtein distances to tolerate the in del insertion and deletion errors in the separate index reads as observations based on this idea we developed a novel application bayexer which applies a navenave bayes classifier nbc to the demultiplexing of illumina sequences bayexer extracts training_datasets directly from the contaminant sequences of targeting reads and then uses them to train the nbc and assigns the reads the evaluation on real sequencing_datasets showed the great advantage of bayexer compared with other tools bayexer is compatible with both single index and dual index sequencing and supports various illumina sequencers
