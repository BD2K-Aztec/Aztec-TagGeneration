systems_biology integrative gene network construction for predicting a set of complementary prostate cancer_genes motivation diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and understanding oncogenesis within the context of biological_pathways is one of the most important research_areas in bioinformatics recently there have been several attempts to integrate interactome and transcriptome_data to identify subnetworks that provide limited interpretations of known and candidate cancer_genes as well as increase classification_accuracy however these studies provide little information about the detailed roles of identified cancer_genes results to provide more information to the network we constructed the network by incorporating genetic_interactions and manually_curated gene regulations to the protein_interaction to make our newly constructed network cancer specific we identified edges where two genes show different expression_patterns between cancer and normal phenotypes we showed that the integration of various datasets increased classification_accuracy which suggests that our network is more complete than a network based solely on protein interactions we also showed that our network contains significantly more known cancer_related than other feature_selection through observations of some examples of cancer specific subnetworks we were able to predict more detailed and interpretable roles of oncogenes and other cancer candidate_genes in the prostate cancer_cells diagnosis and prognosis of cancer is one of the most important research_areas in bioinformatics enormous efforts have been made to identify_biomarkers of cancer and have predominantly focused on the analysis of transcriptome_data recently diagnostic and prognostic predictive performances have been improved by incorporating interactome data incorporating interactome data has the additional benefit that it can suggest detailed roles of potential cancer_related showed that with metastasis of breast_cancer integration of interactome and transcriptome_data can be useful to to whom correspondence should be addressed extract coexpressed functional subnetworks as well as to obtain higher classification_accuracy these subnetworks contain many known breast cancer_genes that could not be detected in previous_studies which analyzed only transcriptome_data that the organization of interactome data is changed by altered gene_expression in breast_cancer which affects disease outcome to accommodate for this they searched for changes in global modularity in protein_interaction they calculated the average pearson_correlation pcc of a hub protein and its interacting_partners and revealed many interactions that displayed altered pccs as a function of disease outcome their analysis is based on the concept of date and party hub a date intermodular hub shows low correlation of coexpression with its interacting_partner and acts as a global connector in the protein_interaction while a party intramodular hub shows high correlation of coexpression and acts as a local connector they found that intermodular hub proteins tend to have more partners which form altered interactions than intramodular hub proteins analyses of coexpressed subnetworks or hub proteins have been helpful for the understanding of the metastasis of cancer at the molecular level however providing interpretability to a gene or protein network would also be valuable for example if the network could provide information on what makes networks change and what the effects of the changes are then candidates to be validated or methods to validate would be more specific and more effective targeting for therapies or drugs would be possible to achieve_this we integrated genetic_interactions and gene regulatory_pathways based on previous_studies using proteinprotein_interactions and gene_expression functional dependencies revealed by genetic_interactions are known to provide abundant information regarding biological_pathways recently lin et_al constructed genome_wide maps of human genetic_interactions using radiation hybrid genotyping_data they suggested that their genetic interaction_network approached saturation suggesting the network did not show a scale_free distribution of connectivity but was gaussian like thus we can expect that the addition of genetic_interactions would help make the network more global provide functional dependencies between genes at a genome_wide level and give more accurate and abundant explanation to each individual pathway the other dataset we used for our network is gene_regulation information gene regulatory_pathways give more detailed explanations of cancer_genes and their oncogenesis combinatorialpage first we performed experiments to obtain the optimal threshold for each type of interactions then we constructed a tumor specific gene network using optimal thresholds and performed independent and comparison tests lastly we analyzed our network with the known cancer related gene_list
