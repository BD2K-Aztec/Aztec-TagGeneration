structural_bioinformatics information_theoretic analysis and prediction of protein atomic burials on the search for an informational intermediate between sequence and structure motivation it has been recently suggested that atomic burials as expressed by molecular central distances contain sufficient information to determine the tertiary_structure of small globular_proteins a possible approach to structural_determination from sequence could therefore involve a sequence to burial intermediate prediction step whose accuracy however is theoretically limited by the mutual_information between these two variables we use a non redundant set of globular protein_structures to estimate the mutual_information between local amino_acid and atomic burials discretizing central distances of c or c atoms in equiprobable burial levels we estimate relevant mutual_information measures that are compared with actual predictions obtained from a naive bayesian_classifier nbc and a hidden_markov hmm results mutual_information density for amino_acids and two or three burial levels were estimated to be roughly of the unconditional burial entropy density lower estimates for the mutual_information between local amino_acid and burial of a single_residue indicated an increase in mutual_information with the number of burial levels up to at least five or six levels prediction schemes were found to efficiently extract the available burial information from local sequence lower estimates for the mutual_information involving single burials are consistently approached by predictions from the nbc and actually surpassed by predictions from the hmm near optimal prediction for the hmm is indicated by the agreement between its density of prediction information and the corresponding density of mutual_information between input and output representations availability the dataset of protein_structures and the prediction implementations are available at http www btc unb br in software it has been a common statement in biology that amino_acid contain sufficient information to determine protein tertiary_structures fulfilment of the implied possibility of structure_prediction from sequence is actually considered one of the most important unsolved_problems of molecular biophysics as reviewed by different groups such an intrinsically informational assertion however has only more recently been extensively investigated within the context of shannons information_theory although informational concepts have been used in algorithms for secondary_structure from local sequence since the s for example the limit imposed on prediction by the mutual_information between these two quantities was estimated only a few years_ago incidentally an informational analysis of backbone dihedral_angles has also exposed the unfeasibility of tertiary structure_determination from an even perfect three state secondary_structure the recurrent utilization of statistical_potentials in computational_biology has also been interpreted explicitly in informational terms a particularly relevant example is the analysis of pairwise contact potentials which revealed a surprisingly modest mutual_information between contact partners general distance constraints have also been investigated at least in the context of minimalist protein models contrasting with secondary_structure atomic burials appear to encode sufficient information for structural_determination contrasting with pairwise contacts they have a much better chance of being adequately estimated from sequence_information monte_carlo of geometrically realistic protein models using native burial information as expressed by atomic distances from the molecular center have successfully recovered the tertiary_structure of small globular_proteins pereira a simple computational experiment combining molecular_dynamics of similar models with discretized burial levels has additionally provided an upper_bound for the amount of required burial information it actually turned out to be comparable to and therefore encodable by the information_entropy of local protein_sequences pereira de araujo the observed discriminatory difference between to whom correspondence should be addressed the dependence on n of the estimates for mutual_information between n blocks of burials and central residue identities iq b n is shown infor two and three levels of c burials analogous results for c burials are shown in the supplementary_information mutual_information density iq b iq b was obtained by extrapolation from exponential or sigmoidal fits to the points before saturation as indicated by solid lines and shown infor amino_acid letters and different numbers of burial levels of c atoms positional_mutual is essentially for burial and identity pairs separated by more than residues we therefore use the sum p n i iq i b with n as a reasonable approximation ofwhich as indicated in the supplementary_information is expected to be a lower_bound for iq b we were also able to explore the effect of many burial levels on iq b as shown in iq b for c increases significantly from two layers to five layers approximately from to bit but only slightly for additional layers with asymptotic limit close to bit qualitatively similar_results for c atoms but mutual_information between single burials and local sequence tends again to be smaller in this case when compared with c atoms although the difference is smaller than for mutual_information density as also seen in we also show for comparison in the same table the mutual_information between single letters i q b the performance of two layer c burial prediction is summarized in analogous results for c burials are shown in the supplementary_information prediction_accuracy a a b and prediction information i p c d as determined byequations s and s of the supplementary_information are plotted as a function of window_size for the nbc a c and as a function of fragment_size for the hmm b d in addition to the complete alphabet of amino_acids tests were also performed using the hp and hpn reduced alphabets for the nbc we report results for the simpler variation provided by equation s of the supplementary_information nbc non shaded symbols and also for the variation using positional probabilities conditional to central residue identity as provided by equation s of the supplementary_information nbc shaded symbols both accuracy and information increase significantly as the window grows from one to nine residues but not perceptibly for longer windows overall performance is higher for c than for c atoms for amino_acids accuracy increases from to above for c atoms and from around to above for c these few percentage_points in accuracy improvement actually correspond to around increase in prediction information from around to above centibits andthe mutual_information iq b n between a single central amino_acid q and n blocks of burials b n as a function of block size n for two a and three b levels of c burials different sets of points correspond to different alphabets of amino_acid lines represent exponential or sigmoidal

combinations of identity alphabet and number of burial layers as indicated in the first two columns error in the last significant digit is shown in parentheses letter entropy h x and mutual_information between adjacent letters ix i x i are in bits entropy density h x in bits letter and corresponding excess entropy e x in bits were obtained from data fits shown inor in the supplementary_information each line corresponds to a different alphabet of amino_acid or burials as indicated in the first column error in the last significant digit is shown in parentheses from around to above centibits for c and c respectively for nbc further improvement provided by nbc although hardly perceptible in the accuracy measure is consistently observed for prediction information accounting for more than centibit of additional information for amino_acids while sampling error is of the order of millibits for the hp and hpn alphabets both nbc and nbc predictions agree within sampling error with the corresponding lower_limits provided by iq b while for amino_acids this is the case for nbc for the hmm tested fragment_lengths ranged from to but some configurations could not be tested due to hardware constraints related to computer memory_usage with many hidden_variables it is clear in the plots ofand d that the fragment length has a direct correlation with the quality of results for hmm prediction especially when the full letter alphabet is used to represent amino_acid the connections between burial levels and secondary_structures shaded symbols and between burial levels and two possible side chain orientations obtained from the comparison between c and c burials and represented as half shaded symbols were also investigated by incorporating the corresponding hidden_variables into the hmm states both approaches were successful in improving the prediction of burial levels and the usage of secondary_structures was slightly more effective than that of side chain orientations incidentally it was found that not only the prediction_accuracy of burial levels but also that of secondary_structures is improved when both features are considered together data not shown our most accurate results for burial prediction were around and of correctly_classified residues respectively for c and c corresponding prediction information values of and bit are higher than the lower_limits provided by iq b as was consistently observed for the hmm algorithm particularly with the configurations that employed additional descriptors to the hidden_variables and fragment sizes of at least six to seven residues as with the nbc prediction of c was generally better than that of c since the hmm algorithm works with relative probabilities of fragments of burial levels it is meaningful to estimate the density of prediction information i p according to equation s of the supplementary_information i e the amount of new prediction information discovered for each new residue once the previous burials have already been established shows h n bjbq a equation s of the supplementary_information for the various hmm prediction schemes for c burials as well as corresponding values of h n b equation s of the supplementary_information computed from block entropies shown in the difference between these quantities is the estimate for the prediction information density i p equation s of the supplementary_information which is shown in b our results can be compared with the corresponding estimates for the mutual_information density between sequences and burials ib q from also displayed in b as dotted horizontal lines which should act as effective upper limits on prediction quality analogous results for c burials are shown in the supplementary_information since i p for n agrees within sampling error with ib q it is suggested that our best overall results for two burial levels are extracting virtually all of the burial information that is available in local sequences compares the prediction information achieved when the nbc and hmm methods are applied to predict discrete c burials into more than two layers analogous results for c are shown in the supplementary_information in all cases it is clear that the quality of prediction is improved when the number of and prediction information i p c d for two levels of c burials with different identity alphabets plots in the first column a c show results for nbc predictions the second column b d refers to the hmm results the nbc method is bounded within error to the limits established by corresponding iq b estimates dotted horizontal lines while the same limits are surpassed by the hmm method d in all plots unshaded symbols represent the simplest version of each algorithm nbc or hmm with nothing but burial levels encoded into the hidden_variables and shaded symbols represent improved versions nbc or hmm with secondary_structures for hmm half shaded symbols represent the version that used side chain orientationsb between amino_acid at position i q i within the n block of identities q n and central c burial b for amino_acid letters and various numbers of burial levels a and limiting behavior for the sum of positional_mutual terms obtained with fixed block size n as a function of the number of burial levels for c and c atoms b layers is increased up to a number of the rise in quality for five or six layers however is less significant suggesting an upper_limit for the number of layers into which it is useful to split a protein for burial level prediction as already observed for two burial layers prediction information tends to be larger for c when compared with c atoms furthermore for hmm results the density of prediction information i p can be calculated as the difference between an n dependent estimate for the entropy density of burial levels h n b equation s of the supplementary_information shown as a solid line in a and an analogous estimate for the entropy density conditional to prediction h n bjbq equation s of the supplementary_information shown as points in a resulting differences are plotted in b in comparison to the upper_limit provided by the observed existing mutual_information density between burials and sequences ib q horizontal dashed lines the results for c predictions are shown here analogous results for c predictions are shown in the supplementary_information point symbols are encoded similarly toincreases the quality of prediction as measured by the prediction information i p also improves at least up to four to five layers the results are shown for nbc and hmm c predictions analogous results for c are shown in the supplementary_information window_size of and fragment_size of were used for nbc and hmm respectively hmm predictions were performed with no additional descriptors to the hidden_variables dotted error_bars represent the estimated lower bounds for the mutual_information between single burial and sequence of identities iq b presently investigated burial levels defined by equiprobable layers of central distances display some qualitative similarity with burial levels defined from accessible surface areas as reported by oscillations in positional_mutual observed in reflecting secondary_structure exposure periodicity are also observed in analogous plots involving burials in that previous_investigation although not for identities or secondary_structure assignments notably however single amino_acid appear to be more informative about accessible surfaces than about central distances while single_residue mutual_information between identity and two bins of burials reported by is bit our presently estimated value for iq b is only bit or about half of the corresponding density iq b as shown in correlations between adjacent central distances on the other hand appear to be larger as shown by larger values of ib i b i inwhen compared with values reported in that previous_investigation these discrepancies might be partly associated to different procedures for determination of burial levels while levels of accessible surfaces were explicitly determined from mutual_information maximization our levels of central distances simply maximize unconditional uncertainty it is possible nevertheless that intrinsic physical differences between the two measures are also involved although correlated in globular_proteins it is apparent that accessible_surface should be affected more directly by residue hydrophobicity while being somewhat less dependent on adjacent residues it is not presently clear how much information could be expected from actual predictions of accessible areas from local sequence since mutual_information densities have not been reported weaker correlations when compared with central distances however are indicative of a less pronounced increase in prediction information with additional local environment beyond single_residue in any case even if eventually more predictable than central distances it remains to be shown if accessible areas can be as efficient in tertiary structure_determination our prediction results indicate that most of the burial information shared by local sequences is easily captured by simple statistical prediction schemes based on hmm or to a lesser extent nbc interestingly iq b is approached by the nbc algorithm which neglects most identity correlations conditional to single burials and actually surpassed by the hmm algorithm which appropriately accounts for such correlations furthermore near optimal prediction for hmm algorithms is indicated by the corresponding mutual_information density approaching our present estimate for i q b from the results with reduced identity alphabets it is apparent that only about half of the burial information extractable from local sequence using all amino_acid letters is still extractable when the hp reduced alphabet is used instead the significant_improvement provided by the hpn alphabet with just a single additional letter indicates however that judiciously chosen reduced alphabets might still be useful in actual prediction particularly in situations in which the size of the training_set might become a limiting_factor in the opposite situation when the training_set is sufficiently_large prediction could be improved by increasing the number of burial levels as indicated by or by including more hidden_variables in the hmm in any case independently of the size of the databank burial prediction information is unavoidably restricted within a small fraction of the unconditional burial uncertainty as provided by the density of mutual_information between identities and burials i q b even considering the possibility of judicious partitioning of the databank such as according to chain size or structural_class the basic situation is unlikely to change significantly as has been previously_noted a small amount of mutual_information between local sequence and structural_descriptors when compared with the descriptor entropy density indicates that local structure as reflected in secondary_structure or burials must be largely determined by non local information it is useful however to distinguish between sequence_dependent and sequence_independent non local information after all a large amount of structure determining information is provided by sequence_independent constraints analogous to grammatical rules of human languages pereira de araujoaraujo and the information to be obtained from sequences corresponding in the same analogy to the actual literature codified in written texts should actually be much smaller the distinction between sequence_dependent and sequence_independent information is already apparent locally the uncertainty of bit for two burial levels of a single c atom for example diminishes to bit due to sequence_independent local information or a reduction of bit while around bit is resolvable by sequence_dependent local information a particularly interesting possibility from the predictors perspective would correspond to sufficient sequence_dependent information for tertiary structure_determination being exclusively local while non local information would be sequence_independent a large amount of sequence_independent non local structural_information is actually inferred from the small expected total number of protein shapes s which has been estimated by different groups to be in the order of several thousands if s is assumed to be for example the corresponding entropy would be limited from above by log s and could not be more than around bits per structure or only bit residue for a putative typical length of residues bit residue for residues this would be the uncertainty about whole structures and therefore burials to be resolved from sequence the large remaining single burial uncertainty e g bits residue for two c burial levels must therefore be resolvable by sequence_independent information both local bits residue as discussed above and non local bits residue as a consequence note that even if the total effective number of structures turns out to be larger or smaller by up to two orders_of the estimated amount of sequence_dependent structural_information could not change by more than a couple of centibits residue it is interesting that an independent argument based the thermodynamic_stability of globular_proteins provided a compatible entropy estimate bits per macromolecule this small amount of sequence_dependent information literature when compared with the large amount of sequenceindependent constraints grammar is an unavoidable consequence of a modest total number of structures when compared with possible sequences it is also clearly consistent with the sound elusiveness of possible solutions for the problem of ab_initio protein_structure contrasting to significant success in homology_modeling note that the entropy of whole amino_acid must indeed be much larger than structural entropy since many sequences fold to each single structure although smaller and less trivial than estimated from local statistics long_range sequence correlations have been detected and must produce deviations from markovicity contributing not only to reduce the entropy but also to destroy its linear dependence on chain_length crucially in any case the presently reported small information for burial predictions can still turn out to be sufficient for structural_determination when combined to appropriate sequence_independent constraints knowledge about atomic burial levels has been previously shown to be both sufficient for structural_determination of small globular_proteins and entropically compatible with amino_acid our present results however indicate that only a fraction around at least for c and c atoms of burial uncertainty is resolvable by local amino_acid on the bright side most of this sequence_dependent burial information is easily extractable by simple prediction schemes such as the presently implemented nbc and hmm most importantly these predictions provide parameters for future folding simulations completely_independent of knowledge about the native_structure the possibility of structural prediction of globular_proteins from amino_acid using atomic burials as informational intermediates including a possible combined improvement of sequence_independent constraints and burial prediction schemes can now be investigated directly
