databases_and irview a database and viewer for protein interacting regions proteinprotein_interactions ppis are mediated through specific regions on proteins some proteins have two or more protein interacting regions irs and some irs are competitively used for interactions with different proteins irview currently contains data for irs in human and mouse proteins the data were obtained from different sources and combined with annotated region data from interpro information on non_synonymous polymorphism sites and variable_regions owing to alternative mrna_splicing is also included the irview web_interface displays all ir data including user uploaded data on reference_sequences so that the positional relationship between irs can be easily understood irview should be useful for analyzing underlying relationships between the proteins behind the ppi_networks availability irview is publicly_available on the web atproteinprotein interactions ppis and their networks play_central in governing cellular_processes recently much effort has been put in to collecting binary interaction data e g to dissect ppi_networks these interaction data have been compiled in public biomolecular interaction_databases for example biogrid and intact are major molecular interaction_databases of ppis these databases primarily contain ppi data at the protein level namely pairs of protein_names two recent_articles one of them from our group have reported large_scale experimental_data on region or domain based protein interactions determined by high_throughput methods in human and in caenorhabditis_elegans usually proteins interact with other proteins through regions the interacting regions irs that are specific to each interaction therefore simultaneous interactions with multiple proteins are possible furthermore some irs are competitively involved in interactions with different proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed to comprehend the complicated relations underlying ppis in more detail further refined interaction data are required in this article we describe irview a database and viewer for irs of proteins which focuses on the regions required for ppis irview contains as a primary data source irs that were determined using the in vitro virus ivv method human data and the yeast_two y h method domino is a database of domain domain interactions that is similar in scope to irview domino stores data on irs described in the scientific_literature and applies the existing domain motif names from the interpro database to each of the irs the ir data in irview include interpro domain motif regions but are not restricted to the interpro annotations users can also compare irs with variable_sites susceptible to non_synonymous nssnps and variable_regions arising from alternative mrna_splicing irview also supports a viewer that allows users to compare the positional relationships of irs in protein reference_sequences and in d structures when available irview should be useful for investigating the hidden relationships between the proteins behind protein_interaction
