cellular_phenotype database a repository for systems microscopy data motivation the cellular_phenotype database cpd is a repository for data derived from high_throughput systems microscopy studies the aims of this resource are i to provide easy access to cellular_phenotype and molecular localization data for the broader research_community ii to facilitate integration of independent phenotypic studies by means of data aggregation techniques including use of an ontology and iii to facilitate development of analytical_methods in this field results in this article we present cpd its data_structure and user_interface propose a minimal set of information_describing rna_interference experiments and suggest a generic schema for management and aggregation of outputs from phenotypic or molecular localization experiments the database has a flexible structure for management of data from heterogeneous sources of systems microscopy experimental outputs generated by a variety of protocols and technologies and can be queried by gene reagent gene attribute study keywords phenotype or ontology_terms availability_and cpd is developed as part of the systems microscopy network of excellence and is accessible ata novel systems microscopy research strategy has emerged during the last decade that exploits recent_developments in automated microscopy cell microarrays image_analysis data_mining statistics and modelling a wide_range of methodologies is available to the scientific_community for the characterization of cellular_processes like mitosis or cell_migration for example rna_interference rnai screening approaches deliver diverse sets of cell loss of function phenotypes assigned manually or automatically using various methodologies and processing pipelines as part of the systems microscopy network of excellence project we have developed the cellular_phenotype database cpd for management of data derived from high_throughput phenotypic studies reference studies like mitocheck andcellmorph provided use cases and initial datasets for cpd development in total data from studies have been loaded into the database the database has been released to the public across these studies we have observed high phenotypic heterogeneity both in terms of the criteria used to assign phenotypes via manual or automatic_annotation and the terminology used for phenotypic annotations phenotypes observed can be specific to a given study or common across several studies in the latter case terms used to describe phenotypes can be harmonized via a common ontology to achieve this the cellular microscopy phenotype ontology cmpo
