systems_biology narromi a noise and redundancy reduction technique improves accuracy of gene_regulatory motivation reconstruction of gene_regulatory grns is of utmost interest to biologists and is vital for understanding the complex regulatory_mechanisms within the cell despite various methods developed for reconstruction of grns from gene_expression they are notorious for high false_positive owing to the noise inherited in the data especially for the dataset with a large_number but a small number of samples results in this work we present a novel method namely narromi to improve the accuracy of grn_inference by combining ordinary_differential based recursive optimization ro and information_theory based mutual_information mi in the proposed algorithm the noisy regulations with low pairwise_correlations are first removed by using mi and the redundant regulations from indirect regulators are further excluded by ro to improve the accuracy of inferred grns in particular the ro step can help to determine regulatory directions without prior_knowledge of regulators the results on benchmark_datasets from dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods challenge and experimentally_determined grn of escherichia_coli show that narromi significantly_outperforms other popular_methods in terms of false_positive and accuracy availability all the source data and code are available at http csb a major_issue in systems_biology is to construct and understand the gene_regulatory grns which explicitly characterize regulatory_processes in the cell the development of high_throughput has produced tremendous amounts of gene_expression data which provide insights into the underlying regulatory_mechanism of cellular machines the reconstruction or reverse_engineering of grns which aims to dissect the underlying_network of gene_gene from the measurement of gene_expression is still a challenging_task for this reason the dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods dream project was established to encourage researchers to develop new efficient computation methods to infer robust grns recently various approaches have been developed to infer grns from gene_expression data with the motivation of improving the accuracy and scalability of network_inference in general these grn_inference methods fall into two categories namely model based_approaches and machine_learning based_approaches for the model based_methods chemical_reaction of transcription and translation as well as other cellular_processes are described as linear or non linear differential_equations in which the parameters represent the regulation strengths of the regulators representative algorithms in this category include multiple_linear singular_value method di network_component and linear_programming lp for the machine_learning based_approaches the network is inferred through measuring the dependences or causalities between transcriptional_factors tfs and target_genes popular_methods in this category include partial correlation_coefficient bayesian network_analysis mutual_information mi and conditional mutual_information cmi as one of the most popular_methods mi has been widely used to construct grns because it provides a natural generalization of correlation owing to its capability of characterizing non linear dependency furthermore mi is able to deal with thousands of variables genes in the presence of a limited number of samples despite these advantages mi fails to distinguish indirect regulators from direct ones i e it tends to overestimate the number of regulators targeting the gene in a grn the indirect regulations are the main source of false_positives although some methods have been developed recently to remove these redundant indirect regulations such as cmi and cmi based path consistensy algorithm pca cmi the high_computational makes them infeasible while calculating the high order mis another limitation of mi is that it only describes the correlation between two genes but is unable to determine the regulatory directions different from the methods based on information_theory the model based_methods have the advantage of describing the regulatory dynamics and detecting the direction of regulations furthermore prior information such as experimentally_verified regulations can be easily included in these models to improve the accuracy of network_inference moreover model based_methods are found useful to remove possible redundant indirect regulations by forcing sparseness on the model such as the shortcut removing technique that has been proved to be efficient in grn_inference in this work we propose a novel method namely narromi to improve the accuracy of grn_inference from gene_expression data using a noise and redundancy nar reduction technology by combining ordinary_differential ode based recursive optimization ro and informationtheory based mi and therefore it has the advantages of both model based and machine_learning based_methods specifically the noisy regulations and partial significant indirect regulations can be firstly deleted and filtered using mi as a measure of dependence and the redundant indirect regulations are subsequently removed gradually by the ro algorithm thereby reducing both false_positives in addition our method can determine regulatory directions without prior information of regulators the results on simulation datasets from dream_challenge and experimentally confirmed network in escherichia_coli with real_gene show that our method significantly_outperforms other popular_methods in terms of false_positives and accuracy to validate our method narromi was applied to several simulation datasets and a real gene_expression dataset as for simulation_data the method was tested on the simulated benchmark grns with synthetic linear expression data and the widely used reference network in yeast with synthetic non linear expression data from dream_challenge as for real_gene we applied our method to the experiment confirmed network in e coli with real_gene the predictive results were evaluated by following measures i e sensitivity or true_positive tpr false_positive fpr positive_predictive ppv accuracy acc and matthews coefficient constant mcc mathematically they are defined aswhere tp fp tn and fn are the numbers of true_positives false_positives true_negatives and false_negatives respectively tpr and fpr are also used to plot the receiver_operating roc_curves and the area_under auc is calculated to evaluate the performance of narromi we compared it with several popular_methods including lp ro regression_model based lasso mi based aracne and random_forest based genie huynh where the two alternatives with parameters sqrt and all in genie were considered here as they performed best in the dream challenges supplementary_material for all the methods in comparison the default values of parameters were set to run the algorithms for example the regularization_parameter of methods lp ro and narromi was set to the ensemble parameter of method genie was set to the threshold of mi filtering in method narromi was set to we proposed a novel method narromi to improve the accuracy of grn_inference by simultaneously implementing the nar regulation reduction in this algorithm the noisy regulations with low pair_wise correlations and the redundant regulations from indirect regulators are removed with mi and ro respectively moreover the dimension shrinking of the technique improves the efficiency of optimization and further increases the accuracy of network_inference the method was validated on the simulated benchmark grns from dream_challenge and the experimentally_verified network in e coli with real_gene the cross_validation results confirmed the effectiveness of our method narromi which outperformed previous methods
