ibd groupon an efficient method for detecting group wise identity by descent regions simultaneously in multiple_individuals based on pairwise_ibd relationships motivation detecting ibd_tracts is an important problem in genetics most of the existing_methods focus on detecting pairwise ibd_tracts which have relatively low power to detect short ibd_tracts methods to detect ibd_tracts among multiple_individuals simultaneously or group_wise have better performance for short ibd_tracts detection group_wise can be applied to a wide_range such as disease mapping pedigree reconstruction and so forth the existing group wise ibd tract detection method is com putationally inefficient and is only able to handle small_datasets such as individuals with hundreds of snps it also requires a previous specification of the number of ibd groups or partitions of the individuals where all the individuals in the same partition are ibd with each other which may not be realistic in many cases the method can only handle a small number of ibd groups such as two or three because of scalability issues what is more it does not take ld linkage dis equilibrium into consideration results in this work we developed an efficient method ibd groupon which detects group_wise based on pairwise_ibd relationships and it is able to address all the drawbacks aforementioned to our knowledge our method is the first practical group_wise detection method that is scalable to very large_datasets for example hundreds of individuals with thousands of snps and in the meanwhile it is powerful to detect short ibd_tracts our method does not need to specify the number of ibd groups which will be detected automatically and our method_takes ld into consideration as it is based on pairwise ibd_tracts where ld can be easily incorporated two or more alleles are identical by descent ibd if they are identical copies of the same ancestral allele ibd_tracts are regions shared between two or more individuals if they inherit identical nucleotide_sequences in the regions from common_ancestor ibd detection has been applied to a wide_range such as detecting relatedness of unknown individuals reconstructing pedigrees phasing haplotypes disease mapping and so forth recently many methods have been developed to detect ibd_tracts between pairs of individuals based on genotype data or haplotypes proposed relate which uses a continuous_time model where the hidden_states are the number of alleles shared ibd between pairs of individuals at a given position proposed plink which detects extended chromosomal segmental ibd_sharing between pairs of distantly_related individuals by use of a hidden_markov hmm in which the underlying hidden ibd state is estimated given the observed ibs identity by state sharing and genome_wide level of relatedness between the pair proposed a program germline based on a dictionary of haplotypes that is used to efficiently discover short exact_matches between individuals these matches are then expanded using dynamic_programming to identify long nearly identical segmental sharing that is indicative of relatedness browning and browning implemented an algorithm fastibd in the program beagle which is based on estimating frequencies of shared haplotypes because a shared common_haplotype is unlikely to reflect recent ibd whereas a shared haplotype that is rare is likely to be identical by descent a fixed number of haplotype pairs are sampled for each individual from the posterior haplotype distribution each sampled haplotype corresponds to a sequence of hmm states the fastibd algorithm searches for pairs of sampled haplotypes sharing the same sequence of hmm states for a set of consecutive markers overlapping shared haplotype tracts are merged and the merged shared haplotype tract is a mosaic of pairs of sampled haplotypes a fastibd score is calculated for each merged tract and if the score is below a user specified threshold the tract is reported as ibd these methods have been shown to be powerful to detect long pairwise ibd_tracts however they generally suffer from low power to detect relatively short ibd_tracts for example ibd_tracts of length mb and they all aim to detect pairwise ibds only methods to use group wise ibd relationships or ibd_tracts shared by multiple_individuals to increase the power for short ibd_tracts detection have been proposed have proposed methods to detect group_wise for cases in which some pedigree_information or information about ibd_sharing is available proposed a more general markov_chain mcmc method where it does not assume any previous information about ibd_sharing patterns groupwise ibds are detected directly from unphased genotype data using an hmm_model where the states are possible ibd_tracts among the given set of individuals an mcmc approach is developed to infer relevant_information about the parameters of the hmm_model besides the capability to report group_wise it is also shown that the mcmc approach has relatively the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com high power to detect short ibd_tracts compared with the pairwise ibd_tracts detection methods the mcmc method however suffers from intensive computation therefore it can be only applied to small_datasets for example individuals with snps and the mcmc method_takes tens of hours even on these small_datasets it also requires a previous specification of the number of ibd groups or partitions of the individuals where all the individuals in the same partition are ibd with each other the number of ibd groups needs to be small such as two or three this is unrealistic in many cases what is more the mcmc method does not take linkage_disequilibrium ld into account which is common in the genotype data to address all the drawbacks of the mcmc method we developed a method ibd groupon which detects group_wise based on pairwise ibd_tracts we first use beagle to detect pairwise ibd_tracts as beagle allows us to adjust a threshold to detect short ibd_tracts with the side_effects of obtaining many false_positive ibd_tracts then we construct an hmm to select the most likely group_wise to eliminate false_positive ibd_tracts based on the assumption that the length of a false_positive ibd tract is generally smaller than that of the true_positives and thus false_positives generally have lower likelihoods we also developed a depth first search algorithm as well as a shortest_path algorithm to effectively select the possible values of the states of the hmm such that our method is scalable to large_datasets ibd groupon does not require any specification of the number of ibd groups and the length of the ibd_tracts which will be detected automatically using both simulated_and we show that our method is not only much more efficient than the mcmc method but also much more accurate in that it has much lower false_positive and to our knowledge it is the first practical method that is able to detect group_wise on large_datasets for example hundreds of individuals with thousands of snps and in the meanwhile it does not assume any previous information of the ibd_sharing patterns it also takes ld into consideration as beagle considers ld for pairwise_ibd detection proposed a method dash that identifies pairwise ibd_tracts using germline first and then conducts an iterative minimum cut algorithm to identify densely_connected components as ibd clusters the method cuts the haplotypes into windows and the min cut algorithm runs recursively until it identifies a subgraph of desired density or a trivial subgraph that contains no edges to be cut the idea is similar to ibdgroupon but with the following significant differences i dash takes the density threshold of the subgraphs as well as the length of the windows as the parameters of input ibdgroupon uses an hmm to determine the cliques and the length of the identified ibd_tracts automatically ii dash identifies the ibd clusters in each window independently ibdgroupon builds a global probabilistic_framework to combine_information cross windows indeed dash can be considered as a special_case of ibd groupon where there is one hmm state for each window but with one value for each state we show in our experiments that compared with dash not only ibd groupon requires no parameter_tuning but also it produces more accurate results and the two methods have similar execution time in this work we proposed an efficient method ibd groupon to detect group wise ibds in multiple_individuals simultaneously based on pairwise_ibd relationships an hmm is created and the values of the states are efficiently generated using depth first search and shortest_path algorithms our method is the first practical method to handle large_data with hundreds of individuals and thousands of snps and in the meanwhile has good performance for both long and short group_wise it is shown that our method is not only much more efficient but also reports much fewer false_positives than thenote the top values are saved for each state we only consider pairwise ibd_tracts threshold for beagle is e and for ibd groupon is e
