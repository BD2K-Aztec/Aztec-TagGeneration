genetics_and testing multiple gene interactions by the ordered combinatorial partitioning method in case_control motivation the multifactor_dimensionality mdr method has been widely used in multi_locus interaction analysis it reduces dimensionality by partitioning the multi_locus genotypes into a high_risk group and a low_risk group according to whether the genotype specific risk ratio exceeds a fixed threshold or not alternatively one can maximize the value exhaustively over all possible ways of partitioning the multi_locus genotypes into two groups and we aim to show that this is computationally_feasible methods we advocate finding the optimal mdr omdr that would have resulted from an exhaustive_search over all possible ways of partitioning the multi_locus genotypes into two groups it is shown that this optimal mdr can be obtained efficiently using an ordered combinatorial partitioning ocp method which differs from the existing mdr method in the use of a data_driven rather than fixed threshold the generalized extreme value distribution gevd theory is applied to find the optimal order of gene combination and assess_statistical of interactions results the computational_complexity of ocp strategy is linear in the number of multi_locus genotypes in contrast with an exponential order for the naive exhaustive search_strategy simulation_studies show that omdr can be more powerful than mdr with substantial power gain possible when the partitioning of omdr is different from that of mdr the analysis results of a breast_cancer dataset show that the use of gevd accelerates the determination of interaction order and reduces the time cost for p value calculation by more than fold availability c program is available atanalysis of genegene_interaction is of great_concern in modern genetic_studies with a large_number classical statistical_methods such as the logistic_regression and pearsons test may not be appropriate due to high degree of to whom correspondence should be addressed freedom involved methods that can detect multi_locus interacting genes that may have been overlooked by a single locus analysis are of central importance in genetic_association multifactor_dimensionality mdr is a non parametric and model free method that was developed for detecting highorder genegene_interaction in the absence of marginal_effects operationally the mdr method divides the multi loci genotype combinations into high and lowrisk groups according to whether the ratio of cases to controls exceeds a fixed threshold or not as noted by this is a constructive induction method that changes the representation space of the data by reducing recoding the single_nucleotide snp combinations to a single binary attribute this results in a contingency_table and the sparsity and the high_dimensionality problems are greatly alleviated the pearsons statistic is calculated but with p value determined using a permutation procedure rather than from a distribution with one degree of freedom df empirical_studies show that the mdr method is a useful tool for testing high order genegene_interaction since it was proposed the mdr method has been widely_applied to multi_locus association studies many efforts have been made to improve the power of mdr such as the extended mdr emdr of modified mdr methods based on balanced accuracy likelihood_ratio and normalized_mutual or other evaluation measures some other extensions of mdr such as the odds_ratio based mdr or mdr model based mdr mb_mdr log linear_model based mdr lm mdr and generalized mdr gmdr were also developed these extensions make the mdr more flexible in applications in recent_years many other data_mining algorithms for detecting high order genetic_interactions such as classification trees random_forests and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars have been proposed developed a powerful multi_locus parametric test based on tukeys df model of interaction proposed the focused interaction testing framework fitf the performance of neural_networks evolved from genetic_programming is studied bycompared the performances of six methods for testing main effects and interactions the six methodspage in this section we first show some simulation_results then we apply our method to a real_dataset mdr is a powerful non parametric method in genetic_interaction studies many empirical computer studies and real_data have demonstrated the impressive capability of mdr in detecting high order interactions the key idea of mdr is the pooling of high_dimensional predictors into two distinct groups which reduces dimensionality and alleviates the sparsity problem we observe that the power can be further improved by introducing the exhaustive search_strategy in this study an ocp based search_strategy is proposed for finding the optimal contingency_table with largest statistic which has computational_complexity that is dramatically lower than that of the exhaustive_search method the gevd theory is employed to further reduce computational_cost both simulation_studies analysis show that the gevd approximation is rather accurate and much more computationally_efficient than using the permutation distribution simulation_studies inshow that the mdr method performs robustly in the presence of noise due to genotype error and missing_data but may lose power substantially in the presence of phenocopy proposed a genegene_interaction detection approach based on the support_vector and demonstrate several advantages of their machine_learning by simulation_studies especially the strong ability e g power and model stability to handle sample noise since the omdr method always leads to higher drs than mdr it is conceivable that our omdr method can deal properly with this noise while mdr does not the performance of omdr in the presence of these sources of noise will be explored in future_studies and compared withmethod another important issue is the class imbalance problem in gene_gene detection the generalization ability of many classification methods such as logistic_regression will be weakened by extremely imbalanced datasets in balanced casecontrol design the threshold used by mdr is which can be naturally adjusted by the ratio of cases to controls when the design is unbalanced proposes the balanced accuracy function defined as the arithmetic mean of sensitivity_and to substitute the accuracy function such as cross_validation consistency and prediction_error used in previous_literature simulation shows that the power of the mdr method using this balanced accuracy function with the adjusted threshold can be elevated efficiently since the variable threshold used in omdr is data_driven our omdr method can also be applied without modification to detect genegene_interactions in unbalanced casecontrol_studies
