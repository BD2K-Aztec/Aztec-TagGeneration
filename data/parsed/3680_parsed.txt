structural_bioinformatics prediction of protein rna binding_sites by a random_forest method with combined features motivation proteinrna interactions play_a in a number of biological_processes such as protein_synthesis mrna_processing mrna assembly ribosome_function and eukaryotic spliceosomes as a result a reliable identification of rna binding_site of a protein is important for functional_annotation and site_directed accumulated data of experimental proteinrna interactions reveal that a rna_binding residue with different neighbor amino_acids often exhibits different preferences for its rna partners which in turn can be assessed by the interacting interdependence of the amino_acid fragment and rna nucleotide results in this work we propose a novel classification_method to identify the rna binding_sites in proteins by combining a new interacting feature interaction propensity with other sequence and structure based features specifically the interaction propensity represents a binding_specificity of a protein residue to the interacting rna nucleotide by considering its two side neighborhood in a protein residue triplet the sequence as well as the structure based features of the residues are combined together to discriminate the interaction propensity of amino_acids with rna we predict rna interacting residues in proteins by implementing a well built random_forest the experiments show that our method is able to detect the annotated proteinrna interaction sites in a high_accuracy our method achieves an accuracy of f measure of and auc of prediction of the rna_binding residues for a dataset containing non homologous rna_binding and also outperforms several existing rna_binding residue predictors such as rnabindr bindn rnaprob and pprint and some alternative machine_learning such as support_vector naive_bayes and neural_network in the comparison study furthermore we provide some biological_insights into the roles of sequences and structures in proteinrna interactions by both evaluating the importance of features for their contributions in predictive_accuracy and analyzing the binding_patterns of interacting residues availability all the source data and code are available atrna undergoes diverse post_transcriptional including regulation of its transportation localization and decay in many cases such a process occurs through elements on the rna_molecule that interact with hundreds of rna_binding existing in the cell interactions among proteins and rna_molecules play_an in a variety of biological_activities within a cell such as the post_transcriptional alternative_splicing translation and infections by rna_viruses therefore it is important to understand the principle of protein_rna and identify their interaction sites when selecting activators and inhibitors in rational_drug it is commonly believed that rna recognition by proteins is primarily mediated by certain classes of rna binding_domains and motifs specifically the correlated pattern of sequence and structure in a rna_binding can be recognized and bound by a specific rna_sequence and then the resulting proteinrna complex performs important functions somewhere in recognition of rna functional_importance in living molecules and close association with protein in its activities experimental and computational studies of proteinrna complexes have been substantially increased recently a variety of approaches have been proposed to study proteinrna interactions though some improvement has been obtained the precise mechanisms of the proteinrna interaction are far from being fully understood in particular there is no efficient way to experimentally identify proteinrna binding_sites that play_a in forming proteinrna interactions hence it is strongly demanded to develop a reliable computational_method to accurately_predict proteinrna interacting sites by exploring the accumulated data of proteinrna complexes many studies indicate that there is a strong relationship between interaction residues and their compositions in protein_rna a number of machine_learning have been applied to detect rna_binding residues in protein_sequences for instance bindn uses an svm based_classifier to predict potential rna or dna_binding residues in proteins by sequence_features rnaprob page knowledge regarding how proteins interact with each other and with other molecules is essential in the understanding of cellular_processes here we proposed a novel method to predict rna_binding residues in proteins using a rf based method by the integrated features we encoded the residue features into a vector so as to represent the sp of binding features of residues in proteins our method is mainly based on the mutual interaction propensity defined between the interacting residues of protein and rna in addition we also combined various sequenceand structure derived features together to represent the interaction propensity of the amino_acid and its partner nucleotides the learning and validation processes in the proteinrna complexes confirm the effectiveness of our method the comparison with existing_methods and other classifiers further show the advantages of the proposed method the importance and contribution of these features were also evaluated the identified binding features underlying the protein will have implications of proteinrna binding in the same manner our method can be extended to identify the structure motifs in the rna_binding as well as the rna_binding sp in protein_structures in future
