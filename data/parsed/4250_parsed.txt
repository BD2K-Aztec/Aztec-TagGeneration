simlord simulation of long_read data motivation third generation sequencing methods provide longer_reads than second generation methods and have distinct error characteristics while there exist many read simulators for second generation data there is a very limited choice for third generation data results we analyzed public data from pacific_biosciences pacbio smrt_sequencing developed an error_model and implemented it in a new read simulator called simlord it offers options to choose the read length_distribution and to model error probabilities depending on the number of passes through the sequencer the new error_model makes simlord the most realistic smrt read simulator available availability_and simlord is available open_source atthird generation sequencing_technologies like smrt single_molecule real_time sequencing are increasingly used because they yield considerably longer_reads than second generation methods the error characteristics of smrt are fundamentally different from previous technologies the basic error_rates are higher but errors are considered unbiased and uniformly_distributed which means that they can be reduced by sequencing a molecule several times as more bioinformatics applications are developed for sequence_analysis tasks from smrt data or hybrid data e g genome_assembly snp_calling structural variant discovery authors of such tools will benefit from read simulators that take into account the specifics of the smrt technology the existing manifold simulators for second generation technologies such as art for illumina and solid reads do not do this there are few simulators designed for smrt_reads e g pbsim fastqsim and alchemy from the blasr package the latter now being deprecated along with the bas h format pbsims defaults are based on now outdated chemistry and cannot be completely re configured even if the read_length is adapted the conditional read quality distribution does not match well existing data and supplement also pbsim does not provide sam formatted alignments between the reference and the simulated reads fastqsim is a general_purpose tool for both read analysis and simulation in particular it provides pre set parameters for smrt simulation but also allows to analyze an existing dataset with regard to its properties and simulate accordingly however it is unable to provide mapping information or alignments of simulated reads and it simulates reads rather slowly n crassa reads with cores took min the simulated length quality distributions do not agree well with data and supplement and it is difficult to change parameters directly to improve upon the existing solutions we developed a new read simulator called simlord simulation of long_read data that is convenient to use and easily re configured when technical specifications change the default values provide realistic simulation_results according to the current state of the smrt technology see
