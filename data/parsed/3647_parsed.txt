sequence_analysis predicting post_translational lysine_acetylation using support_vector motivation lysine_acetylation is a post_translational protein_modification and a primary regulatory_mechanism that controls many cell signaling_processes lysine_acetylation sites are recognized by acetyltransferases and deacetylases through sequence_patterns motifs recently we used high_resolution to identify lysine_acetylation sites on human proteins covering most of the previously annotated sites and providing the most comprehensive acetylome so_far this dataset should provide an excellent source to train support_vector svms allowing the high_accuracy in silico prediction of acetylated lysine_residues results we developed a svm to predict acetylated residues the precision of our acetylation site predictor is at recall on input_data containing equal numbers of modified and non modified residues availability the online predictor is available atpost translational protein_modification ptm is a fundamental regulatory_mechanism that controls many cell signaling_processes lysine_acetylation is a reversible ptm with a well known role in regulating gene_expression through the modification of core histone_tails individual reports have shown that lysine_acetylation is also involved in other diverse_biological suggesting a broader regulatory_function however technological limitations have prevented a global analysis of lysine_acetylation until recently our study on the human in vivo acetylome provided a global picture of lysine_acetylation we used highresolution mass_spectrometry to identify lysine_acetylation sites on proteins and found that lysine_acetylation targets large macromolecular_complexes that are involved in diverse_cellular predominantly in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm consensus sequence_analysis revealed stringent constraints on the to whom correspondence should be addressed local sequence_context around the acetylation sites for example amino_acids with a bulky side chain were enriched in the and positions which is in agreement with the frequent occurrence of acetylated lysines in ordered regions of proteins in contrast positively_charged were almost completely excluded from the position these observations suggest that such patterns in the primary sequence may allow the differentiation between acetylated and non acetylated lysines as a basis for in silico prediction various algorithms have already been applied to the prediction of other post_translational for example for the prediction of phosphorylation_events netphos uses neural_networks whereas scansite employs a profile method in previous_studies we constructed speciesspecific phosphorylation_site predictors on the basis of support_vector svm these svm based predictors are part of the analysis toolkit of the phosida database the basic idea of svms is to transform observed features of a given instance into a vector based feature_space each dimension of this feature_space reflects a certain attribute after the transformation of positive e g acetylated lysines and negative instances e g non acetylated lysines into the vector space a maximum margin hyperplane that separates the two datasets is created here the feature_space is the sequence_context of the acetylation site for the classification of a new instancein this case the sequence to be analyzed for possible acetylationit has to be transformed into the feature_space and categorized depending on the vector localization relating to the separating hyperplane we took advantage of the large number of in vivo acetylation sites from our human dataset to create the first high_accuracy acetylation site predictor and make it publicly_available via phosida
