structural_bioinformatics prediction and analysis of nucleotide_binding residues using sequence and sequence derived structural_descriptors motivation nucleotides are multifunctional molecules that are essential for numerous biological_processes they serve as sources for chemical_energy participate in the cellular_signaling and they are involved in the enzymatic_reactions the knowledge of the nucleotideprotein interactions helps with annotation of protein functions and finds applications in drug_design results we propose a novel ensemble of accurate high_throughput predictors of binding residues from the protein_sequence for atp adp amp gtp and gdp empirical tests show that our nsitepred method significantly_outperforms existing predictors and approaches based on sequence_alignment and residue conservation scoring the nsitepred accurately finds more binding residues and binding_sites and it performs particularly well for the sites with residues that are clustered close together in the sequence the high predictive quality stems from the usage of novel comprehensive and custom_designed inputs that utilize information extracted from the sequence evolutionary profiles several sequence predicted structural_descriptors and sequence_alignment analysis of the predictive_model reveals several sequence derived hallmarks of nucleotide_binding residues they are usually conserved and flanked by less conserved_residues and they are associated with certain arrangements of secondary_structures and amino_acid in the specific neighboring positions in the sequence nucleotides are multifunctional molecules that are essential for numerous biological_processes the nucleotides are structural_units of nucleic_acid chains and they serve as sources for chemical_energy participate in the cellular_signaling and they are involved in the enzymatic_reactions as of june proteins in the protein_data pdb are annotated as nucleotide_binding and nucleotides constitute of biologically_relevant ligands included in this database to whom correspondence should be addressed this demonstrates the ubiquity and the substantial interest in the proteinnucleotide interactions past_two observed a substantial effort in identification and characterization of the nucleotide binding_sites most of these approaches are based on the analysis of known nucleotidebinding sequences and structures which were used to identify conserved_motifs in protein_sequences and structures for instance the walker a and b sequence_motifs were identified for the adenine_nucleotide binding_proteins a fuzzy recognition template was proposed for the characterization of the adenylateprotein interactions the johnson motif was reported to cover one third of the adenine mononucleotide binding_proteins proposed a motif that interacts with the adenine and is shared by five different protein_folds thorntons group applied structural_motifs in identification and prediction of adenine binding_sites for functionally uncharacterized_proteins moreover an empirical scoring_function was developed for prediction of the nucleotide binding_sites in protein_structures the above methods characterize the sequence_motifs for a relatively narrow range of the nucleotide protein interactions usually only for a selected interaction mode for a single nucleotide type or they require tertiary protein_structure as the input which substantially limits their utility the large number of protein_chains with unknown structure motivates the development of computational_tools for high_throughput sequence_based annotation of the nucleotide_binding residues for a wide_range of the nucleotides currently there is only one method for the prediction of binding_sites residues from the protein_sequence for a comprehensive set of nucleotides two other methods predict the atp and gtp_binding residues respectively these two methods input information extracted from the sequence and the corresponding sequence_profile using a window centered on the predicted residue into a machine_learning classifier that predicts propensity of this residue to interact with the atp or gdp we propose an ensemble of predictors of binding residues for five common nucleotides in the pdb including atp adp amp gtp and gdp each of these nucleotides binds to at least diverse proteins i e their chains share pairwise sequence_similarity at which means that they cannot be easily annotated using the sequence_alignment at the same time availability of chains provides sufficient amount of annotated interactions to build a well performing predictor although the interaction_modes for some
