approximate probabilistic analysis of biopathway dynamics motivation biopathways are often modeled as systems of ordinary_differential odes such systems will usually have many unknown_parameters and hence will be difficult to calibrate since the data available for calibration will have limited precision an approximate representation of the odes dynamics should suffice one must however be able to efficiently construct such approximations for large models and perform model calibration and subsequent analysis results we present a graphical processing unit gpu based scheme by which a system of odes is approximated as a dynamic_bayesian dbn we then construct a model checking procedure for dbns based on a simple probabilistic linear time temporal logic the gpu_implementation considerably extends the reach of our previous pc cluster based implementation liu et_al b further the key components of our algorithm can serve as the gpu kernel for other monte_carlo based analysis of biopathway dynamics similarly our model checking framework is a generic one and can be applied in other systems_biology settings we have tested our methods on three ode_models of bio pathways the epidermal growth factornerve growth_factor pathway the segmentation clock network and the mlc_phosphorylation pathway_models the gpu_implementation shows significant_gains in performance and scalability whereas the model checking framework turns out to be convenient and efficient for specifying and verifying interesting pathways properties availability the source_code is freely_available www comp nus edu sg rpsysbio pada gpu the modeling and analysis of biopathways dynamics is a core activity in systems_biology a standard approach is to view a biopathway as a network of biochemical_reactions and to model the network as a system of ordinary_differential odes since biopathways often involve a large number of reactions the corresponding ode systems will not admit closed form solutions and one will have to resort to numerical_simulations however the ode systems will often contain many to whom correspondence should be addressed unknown_parameters rate_constants and initial concentration levels which will first have to be estimated using meager data of limited precision consequently for large pathways model construction and analysis are difficult_problems with this as motivation a probabilistic approximation_method was developed inby which an ode system is reduced to a dynamic_bayesian dbn parameter_estimation followed by sensitivity analysis is then carried_out on this simpler model using standard bayesian_inference techniques this method is promising in terms of efficiency accuracy and applicability b our goal here is to extend this scheme in two significant ways the core_features of these two extensions are of independent interest and can be deployed in other settings involving biopathways models the first extension is a parallel implementation of the dbn approximation scheme using graphical processing units gpus it is computationally_intensive to construct the dbn from a system of odes in our experience a single pc is hopelessly inadequate while even a pc cluster quickly runs into scalability issues on the other hand a supercomputing facility may not be available or affordable in comparison gpus provide an excellent combination of cost and performance however not all algorithms map well onto a gpu platform due to its memory hierarchy specifically one must carefully balance parallelism with memory accesses to obtain good performance in our dbn constructionexplained in more detail in the next sectiona computationally intensive_phase is the generation of a large number of trajectories using numerical_simulations this can be done in parallel and hence the gpu platform is a natural choice however each variable can appear in multiple equations hence to generate a trajectory one must in principle access all the equations in each integration step further the threads generating the trajectories will have to record a good deal of intermediate information to construct the conditional_probability tables cpts of the dbn for large ode systems the intermediate data generated will be too large to be stored in the fast local memory one will instead have to use the slow global memory for this purpose this can lead to a severe degradation in performance to get around this we create a heterogeneous pool of threads in which each trajectory is computed in a distributed fashion whereas a second group of threads manage the data movement there are other settings in which a set of trajectories is generated which is then subjected_to to derive system properties in such applications too our compilation strategy will likely lead to high performance gpu implementations the second major_contribution of the article is a probabilistic_model checking procedure for dbns we use a simple probabilistic variant of linear time temporal logic ltl in whichhere we present our results concerning the gpu_implementation and the probabilistic_model checking method approximating the ode based biopathway dynamics as a dbn allows model analysis tasks such as parameter_estimation sensitivity analysis and probabilistic verification to be efficiently carried_out in this article we have presented a gpu based implementation for constructing the dbn approximations the significant read sharing in the algorithm will prevent a nave implementation from scaling upto large biopathways models to overcome this we have proposed a compilation strategy in which heterogeneous threads consisting of trajectory computing threads and global memory access threads are suitably folded into warps further load balancing was achieved using a simple timing model in our experiments we were able to achieve significant speedup compared with a cpu cluster implementation furthermore our method scales well whereas the cluster based implementation begins to consume infeasible amounts of resources for large models we have also formulated a simple pctl and constructed an approximate but efficient model checking procedure though probability enters the picture solely via atomic propositions one can still formulate many interesting dynamic_properties of pathway_models further due the fact that there is a single finite run the model checking procedure is particularly simple admittedly it is an approximate procedure however one can begin with our method to get a preliminary feel for the dynamics and in case a biologically
