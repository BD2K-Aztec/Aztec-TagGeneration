gromacs molecule liquid database motivation the molecular_dynamics package gromacs is a widely used tool used in a broad range of different applications within physics chemistry and biology it is freely_available user_friendly and extremely efficient the gromacs software is force_field agnostic and compatible with many molecular_dynamics force_fields coarse_grained unified atom all atom as well as polarizable models based on the charge on a spring concept to validate simulations it is necessary to compare results from the simulations to experimental_data to ease the process of setting up topologies and structures for simulations as well as providing pre_calculated physical_properties along with experimental values for the same we provide a web_based database containing organic_molecules at present results liquid properties of organic_molecules have been simulated using two different force_fields opls all atom and generalized amber force_field so_far eight properties have been calculated the density enthalpy of vaporization surface_tension heat_capacity at constant_volume and pressure isothermal compressibility volumetric expansion coefficient and the static dielectric_constant the results together with experimental values are available through the database along with liquid structures and topologies for the molecules in the two force_fields availability the database is freely_available under http molecular_dynamics simulations can be a very useful tool in understanding fundamental interactions in simple molecular liquids and crystals as well as complex biomolecular systems the accuracy of predictions based on molecular_dynamics simulations are limited by the applied force_field force_fields are normally developed to reproduce certain specific experimental properties such as density or energies or to reproduces known molecular_structures a model that captures the basic physics underlying the atomic interactions can in principle be used to predict outside the realm of parameterization and this is in fact often done in order to validate the predictions based on force_fields we have recently performed force_field benchmarks of proteins and liquids to whom correspondence should be addressed the latest incarnation of the gromacs software was described bywhile a recent overview paper van_der describes future_prospects for the software_suite here we present a database holding simulation resources namely liquid structures and topology files the construction of molecular topologiesdescribing connectivity atom types and partial chargesis unfortunately still cumbersome there is a large user base for the gromacs softwareover people that subscribe to a mailing listand therefore we envision that there will be a significant demand for the kind of service the molecule liquid database provides since questions about topology building are among the most common ones on the mailing list the molecular_modeling community has a lot to gain from easy access to pre equilibrated simulation structures and topologies thatare validated against experimental_data the gromacs molecule liquid database freely provides this for a set of over a hundred molecules an example molecule entry being shown in presently two of the most widely used force_fields for organic_molecules gaff and opls aa are supported and there are plans to include models based on the charmm generalized force_field as well the expectation is that this test_set will help users to establish how good these force_fields are not only for the molecules included but also for similar molecules for this reason the test_set was picked such that it would include a large variety of chemical moieties all topologies and structures available have been checked manually and calculated physical_properties along with experimental_data are provided for each of the the molecules including corresponding experimental_data which is fully referenced a similar effort providing input_files for molecules based on the gromos force_field van was announced recently further molecules simulation_results and corresponding experimental_data will be added to the database in the future the ultimate_goal with this work is to build up a large database that can be used both for getting reliable topologies and liquid structures and to provide a list of relevant physical_properties for comparison to experiments the reference_values provided can also serve as a benchmark for force_field improvements for instance using polarizable models van maaren and van_der
