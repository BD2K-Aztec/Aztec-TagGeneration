proteny discovering and visualizing statistically_significant syntenic clusters at the proteome level background with more and more genomes being sequenced detecting synteny between gen omes becomes more and more important however for microorganisms the genomic divergence quickly becomes large resulting in different codon_usage and shuffling of gene_order and gene elements such as exons results we present proteny a methodology to detect synteny between diverged genomes it operates on the amino_acid level to be insensitive to codon_usage adaptations and clusters groups of exons disregarding order to handle diversity in genomic ordering between genomes furthermore proteny assigns significance_levels to the syntenic clusters such that they can be selected on statistical grounds finally proteny provides novel ways to visualize results at different scales facilitating the exploration and interpretation of syntenic regions we test the performance of proteny on a standard ground_truth dataset and we illustrate the use of proteny on two closely_related genomes two different strains of aspergillus_niger and on two distant genomes two species of basidiomycota in comparison to other tools we find that proteny finds clusters with more true homologies in fewer clusters that contain more genes i e proteny is able to identify a more consistent synteny further we show how genome_rearrangements assembly errors gene_duplications and the conservation of specific genes can be easily studied with proteny availability_and proteny is freely_available at the delft bioinformatics lab website_http bioinformatics tudelft nl dbl software a synteny analysis is a useful way to compare organisms that allows us to study the evolution between genomes make claims about functional_conservation identify genome_rearrangements aide genome_annotation and even predict genome_assembly errors numerous tools are already available to detect synteny tools like mugsy mauve multiz and sibelia focus only on highly related genomes orthocluster and symap operate at the dna level and discover groups of genes with their gene_order being conserved these assumptions are too strict when considering more distant genomes see_supplementary s i adhore works at the protein level and builds a homologous_gene matrix based on proteinprotein alignments detecting clusters of genes by identifying diagonal groups of genes we presented proteny a methodology which identifies significant conserved syntenic clusters of exons between two genomes through a novel method for cutting dendrograms and a new dynamic multiple_testing algorithm knowledge of the discovered clusters allow us to uncover genome rearrangement events as shown for both the a niger strains and the basidiomycota make more motivated statements about functional_conservation as for s commune identify possible errors in the assembly of related genomes like in a niger and study the evolution between species as in looking at the cytochrome_p monooxygenases in a bisporus and s commune when comparing with i adhore the most competitive tool on a ground_truth dataset we find proteny outperforms i adhore qualitatively we observe that i adhore finds more clusters covering fewer genes than proteny clusters proteny finds gene dense clusters of high_quality as verified by the cluster scores achieved by proteny on the ygob dataset this can be attributed to the statistical_testing procedure and the conservation ratio we enforce in proteny one practical advantage of proteny over other synteny tools is that besides the blastp settings for which we used default values in our experiments it only requires specifying a significance threshold which can be set by statistical reasoning and a conservation ratio parameter s it should be noted that proteny could work with other aligners also and that blastp could be replaced by other protein_sequence aligner on the other hand i adhore and many other tools are able to perform an analysis on more than two genomes at a time proteny could be generalized towards any number of species by a progressive heuristic similar to the star multiple_alignment heuristic which uses a central sequence with pairwise sequence_alignments to guide the multiple_alignment it is important to note that the cluster score of proteny does not account for the conservation of the order of the exons within the cluster this can most prominently be seen in the synteny between scaffold of s commune and scaffold of a bisporus and b where the order of the hits is scrambled although the ordering of the exons does play a role when constructing the dendrogram nearby hits are merged first we chose that the ordering should not play a role when scoring the clusters this was a deliberate choice since proteny was designed to find synteny between relatively divergent organisms in a microbiology context where evolution is fast insertions inversions strand changes and gene shuffling occur frequently clearly in other problem settings the order may be important in which case the cluster score in proteny should be adjusted however one should be careful when designing a corresponding permutation scheme e g a circular permutation of hit scores to preserve the order of hits in that set as this might result in computational difficulties as e g the clt approximation will not hold anymore by searching for synteny at the exon level we exclude the influence of noncoding_regions of the genome which are typically not well conserved between divergent genomes while an analysis at the gene level is interesting we reasoned that it makes more sense to look at the conservation of individual exons within the gene the region level visualizations indeed show that conservation is higher at the exon level than at the gene level i e some exons may be missing making the gene less conserved while individual exons are conserved the ability to give each cluster a p value is an important contribution however the null_distribution assumes that there is a completely random relationship between the organisms which is not true currently the s parameter representing a lower_bound on their conservation ratio in terms of the ratio of conserved and non conserved exons is used to regulate the clusters future contributions could develop a null_model which takes_into evolution between two species for example a better permutation may shuffle groups of exons genes rather than individual exons yet as indicated earlier this will give rise to computational difficulties another important consideration is that exons which do not have a hit with the other organism increase the distance between hits when constructing the dendrogram but they do not penalize the cluster score again this was a deliberate choice to be less sensitive to evolutionary insertions_and but could be changed by using a different distance measure altogether proteny is a powerful_tool which can detect synteny between relatively divergent genomes at the amino_acid level it detects clusters of exons based on a significance_test and provides a rich visualization which supports the interpretation of the detected syntenic regions
