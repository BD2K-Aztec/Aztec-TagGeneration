databases_and drophea drosophila phenotype enrichment_analysis for insect functional_genomics drophea is a core module of a web_application that facilitates research in insect functional_genomics through enrichment_analysis on mutant phenotypes of fruit_fly drosophila_melanogaster the phenotypes investigated in the analyses can be predefined by flybase or customized by users drophea allows users to specify mutation or ortholog types displays enriched term results in a hierarchical_structure and supports analyses on gene_sets of all insect_species with a fully sequenced_genome enrichment_analysis is a promising strategy for investigators to biologically interpret gene_lists obtained from high_throughput studies in the post genomic era among the backend annotations employed in different enrichment tools see review in mutant phenotype annotation is unique because it represents the consequence of altering the information output of a gene therefore annotations of phenotypes are an ideal means to aid in the understanding of how a set of genes function within the context of the whole organism studies in fruit_fly biology were first documented in the early s over the last century drosophila has become one of the most widely used model_organisms for animal genetics and developmental_biology as an insect_species in addition to basic genetics studies drosophila has served as a model to assist in agricultural and epidemiological_investigations the richness and comprehensiveness of fly omics_data have been invaluable to many fields of biology currently the proportion of mutated and phenotyped fly genes of genes mapped to the genome is approaching that of the house mouse mus_musculus of the genes comprising the mouse_genome have been phenotyped however with the exception of the house mouse an enrichment tool based on mutant phenotypes of another species has never been developed some bioinformatic_tools for insect genomics such as flymine to whom correspondence should be addressed do not implement mutant phenotype data insects and mammals diverged from each other million_years due to the substantial anatomical physiological developmental and behavioral_differences between insects and mammals it is challenging to utilize mammalian phenotypes to explore insect functional_genomics we therefore developed drophea drosophila phenotype enrichment_analysis similar to mamphea a phenotype enrichment tool for analyses on mammalian genes drophea provides several useful features first drophea allows enrichment_analysis not only on phenotypes predefined by flybase http flybase org but also on customized phenotypes to study complex_traits second different types of mutations exhibit distinct impacts on protein_function to remove potential_biases caused by the use of data derived from differential mutagenesis approaches drophea enables users to perform analyses that exclude phenotypes derived from gain_of third drophea generates graphical and downloadable output displaying the enriched or depleted phenotypes according to the hierarchical_structure of the phenotypic classification finally due to the paucity of phenotypic_data in insect_species other than drosophila_melanogaster drophea supports analyses of genes orthologous to d melanogaster for all insect_species with a fully sequenced_genome to date through integration with mamphea drophea is also capable of analyzing mammalian genes
