pancghweb a web_tool for genotype_calling in pangenome cgh data a pangenome is the total of genes present in strains of the same species pangenome microarrays allow determining the genomic content of bacterial_strains more accurately than conventional comparative_genome microarrays pancghweb is the first tool that effectively calls genotype based on pangenome microarray_data availability pancghweb the web_tool is accessible from pangenome microarrays contain probes that target all known genes within related strains of the same species when compared to conventional comparative_genome cgh microarrays that target the gene content of a single species they allow to more accurately determine the genotype of a given bacterial_strain in pangenomes orthologous_genes can be defined as homologous_genes derived by a strain divergence event from a single ancestral sequence these orthologous_genes strain orthologs share different levels of nucleotide_sequence with paralogous genes homologous_genes derived by a duplication event from a single_sequence effective genotyping can be achieved by grouping genes into ortholog groups ogs and subsequently genotyping at the level of ogs recently we published an algorithm pancgh that effectively deals with assigning og presence absence to each strain analyzed by pangenome microarrays here we describe a web toolpancghwebthat uses this algorithm to effectively genotype strains based on pangenome microarray_data
