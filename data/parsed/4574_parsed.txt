sequence_analysis the bio community perl toolkit for microbial_ecology the development of bioinformatic solutions for microbial_ecology in perl is limited by the lack of modules to represent and manipulate microbial_community profiles from amplicon and meta omics studies here we introduce bio community an open_source collaborative toolkit that extends bioperl bio community interfaces with commonly used programs using various file_formats including biom and provides operations such as rarefaction and taxonomic summaries bio community will help bioinformaticians to quickly piece together custom analysis_pipelines and develop novel software availability an implementation bio community is cross_platform perl code available from http search cpan org dist bio community under the perl license a readme file describes software installation and how to contribute sequencing is common in most fields of biological_research and the throughput of modern platforms is orders of magnitudes higher than traditional_sanger the bioperl bioinformatic toolkit has attracted a large community of users and developers and has become critical in many sequencing_projects by allowing quick code development and interaction between programs using incompatible file_formats in microbial_ecology sequencing is used routinely for s rrna gene amplicon surveys metagenomics and metatranscriptomics because most microorganisms remain uncultivated rappend culture independent molecular surveys are essential for the characterization of environmental microbial_communities however they require large computational_resources novel bioinformatic_tools and elaborate pipelines many tools have been developed to analyze the resulting sequence_data for example libraries written in python and r provide blocks for building bioinformatic software qiime and mothur are dedicated packages with scripts to build complete analysis_pipelines but they use incompatible file_formats here we introduce bio community a set of format agnostic modules and scripts to parse and manipulate taxonomic or functional microbial_community profiles
