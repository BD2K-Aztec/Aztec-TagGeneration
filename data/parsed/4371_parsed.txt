genetics_and splatche a spatially_explicit simulation framework for complex demography genetic admixture and recombination splatche is a program to simulate the demography of populations and the resulting molecular_diversity for a wide_range of evolutionary_scenarios the spatially_explicit simulation framework can account for environmental heterogeneity and fluctuations and it can manage multiple population sources a coalescent based_approach is used to generate genetic_markers mostly used in population_genetics studies dna_sequences snps strs or rflps various combinations of independent fully or partially linked genetic_markers can be produced under a recombination model based on the ancestral recombination graph competition between two populations or species can also be simulated with user_defined levels of admixture between the two populations splatche may be used to generate the expected genetic_diversity under complex demographic scenarios and can thus serve to test null_hypotheses for model parameter_estimation splatche can easily be integrated into an approximate_bayesian abc framework availability_and splatche is a c program compiled for windows and linux platforms it is freely_available at www splatche com together with its related documentation and example data splatche for spatial and temporal coalescences in heterogeneous environments version is derived from the program splatche released in this coalescent_based program has been developed to model complex and spatially_explicit demographic scenarios such as range expansions in a heterogeneous and dynamic_environment and to simulate the resulting molecular_diversity of sampled individuals at arbitrary locations it thus makes it possible to realistically model the environment in order to study the impact of ecological_factors on the genetic_structure of populations this approach has already proved to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as invaluable to study the patterns of genetic_variation in spatially_explicit contexts or the genetic consequences of range expansion many improvements and new functionalities have been added here as compared to the original_version of splatche allowing the simulation of a much wider_range of evolutionary_scenarios some of these new features have already been used in published_studies such as the simulation of admixture and competition between populations or the possibility of defining multiple source_populations those extensions have now been incorporated into splatche together with the ability i to simulate linked or partially linked loci ii to have multiple coalescent events per generation and iii to generate single_nucleotide snps moreover splatche is also available as a non graphical console program that can be used on computer clusters here we briefly describe the main features of splatche noting that a more detailed_description can be found in a user_manual splatche can be used to simulate complex and realistic demographic models and to generate the associated molecular_diversity of sampled individuals alternative population or environmental histories can be modelled and compared through their impacts on resulting genetic_diversity due to its explicit handling of spatial_information and of environmental and temporal heterogeneities splatche is particularly well suited for studying spatially_distributed population samples over relatively short evolutionary time scales i e a few thousand generations
