similarity based prediction for anatomical_therapeutic classification of drugs by integrating_multiple data_sources downloaded from motivation anatomical_therapeutic atc classification system widely_applied in almost all drug_utilization studies is currently the most widely_recognized classification system for drugs currently new drug entries are added into the system only on users requests which leads to seriously incomplete drug coverage of the system and bioinformatics prediction is helpful during this process results here we propose a novel prediction model of drug atc_code associations using logistic_regression to integrate_multiple heterogeneous_data including chemical_structures target_proteins gene_expression side_effects and chemicalchemical associations the model obtains good performance for the prediction not only on atc_codes of unclassified drugs but also on new atc_codes of classified drugs assessed by cross_validation and independent test_sets and its efficacy exceeds previous methods further to facilitate the use the model is developed into a user_friendly web_service space similarity based predictor of atc_code which for each submitted compound will give candidate atc_codes ranked according to the decreasing probability score predicted by the model together with corresponding supporting evidence this work not only contributes to knowing drugs therapeutic pharmacological and chemical_properties but also provides clues for drug_repositioning and side effect discovery in addition the construction of the prediction model also provides a general framework for similarity based data_integration which is suitable for other drug related studies such as target side effect prediction etc availability_and the web_service space is available atthe anatomical_therapeutic atc classification system developed and maintained by the world_health collaborating center for drug statistics methodology whocc is currently the most widely_recognized classification system for drugs and has been widely used in almost all drug_utilization studies it divides drug_substances into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic pharmacological and chemical_properties the atc classification system has five levels representing finer and finer classification for drugs in which the first level has anatomical groups with pharmacological therapeutic subgroups as the second level the third and fourth levels are chemical pharmacological therapeutic subgroups and the fifth level is the chemical substance http www whocc no atc structure and principles for example a complete classification of acetylsalicylic_acid is b blood and blood forming organs first level b anti_thrombotic agents second level b a anti_thrombotic agents third level b ac platelet_aggregation inhibitors excl heparin fourth level and b ac acetylsalicylic_acid fifth level a drug can be assigned more than one atc_code when it has multiple different therapeutic uses for example besides as a platelet_aggregation inhibitor b ac mentioned above acetylsalicylic_acid is also used as a drug for local oral treatment a ad and used as an analgesic and antipyretic n ba currently whocc establishes new drug entries in the atc classification system only on requests from the users including manufacturers regulatory_agencies and researchers which leads to serious incompletion of the drug coverage of the system http www whocc no atc structure and principles recently as the emergence and accumulation of various data_sources in drug studies such as chemical_structures target_proteins side_effects and drug_induced gene_expression bioinformatics prediction of atc classification of drugs becomes feasible the prediction of atc classification of drugs not only contributes to the understanding of drugs therapeutic pharmacological and chemical_properties but also provides valuable information for drug side effect discovery and drug_repositioning meanwhile atc classification prediction for chemical_compounds is also helpful for new drug_development especially complementing with other virtual_screening methods recently several computational_methods have been proposed to predict atc classification of drugs based on different data_sources presented the first one to predict atc_codes based on chemical_structures the assumption of which is that structurally_similar compounds tend to have similar medical indication areas and the method was developed into a web_service called superpred the isea indication similarity ensemble approach method also correlated a drug and an atc class based on the drugs chemical fingerprint similarity with all drugs belonging to this atc class expect chemical_structures successively introduced chemical chemical associations and chebi ontology to predict atc classification assigned drugs to atc classes based on text_mining information netpredatc method used svm support_vector to integrate chemical_structures and target_proteins for atc_code prediction although these methods obtained certain efficacy on atc_code prediction there are still some limitations i most of these approaches were only based on a single or two data_sources different data_sources provide_supporting for atc_code prediction from different perspectives which usually have some complementarity the performance of the prediction method is supposed to be further improved if multiple heterogeneous_data are efficiently integrated ii all these jobs only assessed the efficacy of methods on a certain atc classification level or a certain atc category e g only validated their method on the class of cardiovascular system one of the main atc groups and the prediction_performance of atc_codes of unclassified drugs whose atc_codes are unknown and that of new atc_codes of classified drugs whose atc_codes are partly known were not distinguished iii except superpred mentioned above all other methods havent provided user_friendly program package or been developed into a web_service which severely restricts the utility of these methods to eliminate these limitations in this article we propose a novel prediction model for atc classification prediction using logistic_regression lr framework to integrate_multiple heterogeneous_data including chemical_structures target_proteins drug_induced gene_expression side_effects and chemicalchemical associations and comprehensively assesse its efficacy and then compare it with previous methods aiming to further improve the performance of atc_code prediction further to facilitate the use the proposed method is developed into a user_friendly web_service space similarity based predictor of atc_code
