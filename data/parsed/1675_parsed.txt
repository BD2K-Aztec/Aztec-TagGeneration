examl version a tool for phylogenomic analyses on supercomputers motivation phylogenies are increasingly used in all fields of medical and biological_research because of the next_generation revolution datasets used for conducting phylogenetic_analyses grow at an unprecedented pace we present examl version a dedicated production level code for inferring phylogenies on whole transcriptome and whole_genome alignments using supercomputers results we introduce several improvements and extensions to examl extensions of substitution models and supported data types the integration of a novel load balance algorithm as well as a parallel i o optimization that significantly improve parallel efficiency and a production level implementation for intel mic based hardware platforms examl exascale maximum_likelihood is a relatively new code for large_scale phylogenetic_analyses on supercomputers it implements the raxml search algorithm and replaces raxml light which was inefficient for large partitioned phylogenomic datasets that currently represent the typical use case hence in examl v we implemented a radically different parallelization approach that improved parallel efficiency by up to a factor of and also increased scalability for two large_alignments that were recently_published in science we identified and resolved further performance bottlenecks note that examl can also be used for analyzing datasets with genes and up to taxa but scalability will be limited to at most cores for examl v we developed and integrated algorithms for improved load balance and also optimized the parallel i o for reading multiple_sequence we also started exploring if and how examl can be ported to the intel mic many integrated core hardware architecture in a proof_of setting here we present examl v which offersapart from new models and data typesa production level implementation for the intel mic architecture that required a substantial amount of reengineering we also present a novel parallel alignment i o method finally we completely re wrote the user_manual examl is a stable and well documented code for large_scale phylogenetic_inference on x linux mac clusters compiles with gcc icc clang it addresses and provides generally_applicable solutions for several performance bottlenecks in parallel phylogentic likelihood calculations on partitioned alignments
