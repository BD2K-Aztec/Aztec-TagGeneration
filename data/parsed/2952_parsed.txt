sequence_analysis mfcompress a compression tool for fasta and multi fasta data motivation the data deluge phenomenon is becoming a serious problem in most genomic centers to alleviate it general_purpose tools such as gzip are used to compress the data however although pervasive and easy to use these tools fall short when the intention is to reduce as much as possible the data for example for medium and long_term storage a number of algorithms have been proposed for the compression of genomics data but unfortunately only a few of them have been made available as usable and reliable compression tools results in this article we describe one such tool mfcompress specially_designed for the compression of fasta and multi fasta files in comparison to gzip and applied to multi fasta files mfcompress can provide additional average compression gains of almost i e it potentially doubles the available storage although at the cost of some more computation time on highly redundant datasets and in comparison with gzip fold size reductions have been obtained availability both source_code for several operating_systems are freely_available use atsaying that the volume of genomic_data produced every day is large is clearly a euphemism with the dramatic drop in price of the sequencing_machines the limit for sequencing a human_genome will be history shortly virtually everyone will want to sequence everything unfortunately the pace at which storage and communication resources are evolving is not enough and the genomic_data centers are being flooded with data it is a data deluge the interest for dna compression was started with the biocompress algorithm of the subsequent two decades have seen the publication of a considerable number of algorithms for compressing dna_sequences and several other forms of genomic_data e g although usually aiming more at proving the concept than at providing usable compression tools for example the majority of these algorithms assume data drawn from the four letter alphabet acgt ignoring other letters that can be found in dna data sequences no doubt that for the purpose of showing the potentialities of the algorithms this is often a fair approach because those letters outside the main alphabet are usually rare and therefore represent only a small fraction of the bits required to represent the sequence however a usable lossless_compression tool needs to be capable of handling every letter that it finds in the file and to reproduce it exactly during decompression moreover genomic files rarely contain only sequence_information usually they also include additional data such as headers quality_scores and alignment information therefore the compression tools need to compress these data as well in an efficient way in this article we describe mfcompress a tool for compressing fasta and multi fasta files recently proposed deliminate also a compression method for fasta and multi fasta files which relies on a preprocessing stage where header and sequence_data are separated and transformed followed by a general_purpose compressor zip the mfcompress tool described here provides better compression than deliminate for the large majority of the files used in the benchmarking dataset at a similar compression and decompression time this dataset is an extended version of the benchmarking dataset used by to which we added some larger files due to its increasing importance and commonness mfcompress relies on multiple competing finite context models and arithmetic coding a powerful approach for dna data compression
