spacem a software for biological module detection when data is incomplete high_dimensional and dependent among classical_methods for module detection spacem provides ad_hoc algorithms that were shown to be particularly well adapted to specific features of biological data high_dimensionality interactions between components genes and integrated treatment of missingness in observations the software currently in its version is developed in c and can be used either via command_line or with the gui under linux and windows environments availability the spacem software a documentation and datasets are available from http spacem few of the module detection_algorithms made available to scientists for molecular_biology data analysis see and references therein for a representative list directly model observations as measures carried_out on individuals and integrate interaction data generally either the latter is omitted i e individuals are considered as independent or individual observations are transformed into a pairwise metrics the choice of which is intricate and can have a terrible impact on downstream_analysis the spacem software spatial clustering with em and markov_models provides efficient statistical_tools to deal with hightroughput biological data such as gene_expression data its main advantages are i the possibility to handle missing observations and ii the possibility to integrate available interaction_network information in a gene_expression context such interactions either come from prior_knowledge or from measures like two hybrid experiments the integrated markovian approach which is at the heart of the software is presented in section an example of application follows in section spacem provides a stand alone analysis tool to retrieve meaningful modules of biological objects it relies on powerful recent_developments on algorithms devoted to the inference of probabilistic_graphical so that complex individual and interaction biological data can be modelled together as shown in blanchet and vignes and vignes and forbes the gui makes it easy for biologists to use further developments of the software will follow theoretical work under progress to deal with additional features of biological data possibly spurious interactions in databases and application to genetical genomics to reconstruct biological_networks
