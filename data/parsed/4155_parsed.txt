genetics_and scrm efficiently simulating long_sequences using the approximated coalescent with recombination motivation coalescent_based simulation software for genomic_sequences allows the efficient in silico generation of short and medium_sized genetic_sequences however the simulation of gen ome size datasets as produced by next_generation is currently only possible using fairly crude approximations results we present the sequential coalescent with recombination model scrm a new method that efficiently and accurately approximates the coalescent with recombination closing the gap between current approximations and the exact model we present an efficient implementation and show that it can simulate genomic_scale datasets with an essentially correct linkage structure availability_and the open_source implementation scrm is freely_available at https scrm github io under the conditions of the gplv coalescent_simulation is a valuable_tool to investigate population_genetic data and the demographic_processes that shaped them simulation programs based on the coalescent with recombination cwr such as ms support a wide_range of evolutionary_scenarios and are extremely efficient for short and mediumsized sequences as the number of recombination_events grows exponentially with increasing sequence_length it is however infeasible to simulate whole chromosomes using these methods this prevents many methods relying on simulations from being applicable to nextgeneration sequencing_datasets in order to resolve this problem mcvean andintroduced the sequentially markov coalescence smc model a method that approximates the cwr by partially ignoring genetic_linkage between simulated sites subsequently marjoram andproposed a modification of this model termed smc which improved accuracy the simulation programs macs and fastsimcoal implement smc and allow rapid simulation of chromosome sized datasets however found that the decrease in genetic_linkage depends on the simulated evolutionary model which led them to conclude that smc might not be suitable under certain conditions and suggested that the effect of the approximation needed to be investigated carefully in each application we have developed a novel approximation of the cwr called the sequential coalescent with recombination model scrm besides algorithmic optimization it allows for user controlled arbitrary precision ranging continuously from smc to the full cwr we here present an efficient implementation of this model termed scrm and show that by using an intermediate approximation level it allows the simulation of sequences of arbitrary length with an essentially correct linkage structure
