using association_rule to determine promising secondary phenotyping hypotheses motivation large_scale phenotyping projects such as the sanger mouse genetics project are ongoing efforts to help identify the influences of genes and their modification on phenotypes genepheno type relations are crucial to the improvement of our understanding of human heritable diseases as well as the development of drugs however given that there are genes in higher vertebrate gen omes and the experimental_verification of genephenotype relations requires a lot of resources methods are needed that determine good candidates for testing results in this study we applied an association_rule approach to the identification of promising secondary phenotype candidates the predictions rely on a large genephenotype annotation set that is used to find occurrence patterns of phenotypes applying an association_rule approach we could identify secondary phenotype hypotheses that cover genes and phenotypes using two automated and one manual evaluation strategies we demonstrate that the secondary phenotype candidates possess biological_relevance to the genes they are predicted for from the results we conclude that the predicted secondary phenotypes constitute good candidates to be experimentally tested and confirmed availability the secondary phenotype candidates can be browsed through ata causative_gene has not yet been identified for almost half of the existing human heritable diseases without the knowledge of the molecular basis of a disease treatment possibilities are limited to treating symptoms instead of curing the underlying defects in order to be able to find cures and prevention mechanisms for human genetic_disorders we need to comprehensively understand how each disease originates and progresses over time a collection of human_diseases together with confirmed and speculative causes is available from resources such as the online_mendelian omim or orphanet database in the quest for identifying causative_genes for human genetic_disorders model_organisms have gained increasing importance due to the opportunities arising from targeted gene modifications for example the mouse shares of genes with humans and gene modifications leading to phenotypes characteristic for a disease may offer clues to the origins of this disease experimental_results of mutagenesis experiments are stored in species specific model_organism database mod s e g the sanger mouse genetics project sanger mgp wormbase the mouse genome_database mgd or flybase the sanger mgp is part of the international mouse phenotyping consortium impc project that aims to identify the phenotypic implications of genes by in the framework of this project genetically_modified mouse_models are assessed according to pre defined standard_operating sops that are linked to measurable physical_parameters to ascertain the implications of genetic_mutations on phenotypes an example of a sop is the assessment of the grip_strength of mice at the age of weeks to assess their neuromuscular_function as muscle_strength https www mousephenotype org impress protocol mammalian phenotype ontology mp annotations are assigned using a reference range method followed by an expert_review later studies explore the application of other statistical_methods to assign mp phenotype annotations based on the obtained parameter readings however these methods only cover a subset of the phenotypes covered by the sops the process of assessing physical_measurements in accordance with the pre defined sops is referred to as primary phenotyping according to the european mouse disease clinic eumodic web_page http www eumodic org a distributed network of centres with in depth expertise in a number of phenotyping domains will undertake more complex secondary phenotyping screens and apply them to a subset of the mice which have shown interesting phenotypes in the primary screen however with the increasing amount of genes being assessed in the primary phenotyping screen a manual investigation for interesting_results from the primary screens becomes impossible in addition the manual assessment of experimental_results is time consuming expensive and requires trained biologists therefore automated methods enabling the search for promising secondary phenotypes are needed to complement the results obtained from the primary screens existing automated solutions include the prediction of phenotypes based on orthologous_genes as well as functional_annotations of genes to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com however orthologous_genes do not necessarily exhibit the same function or expression_patterns across different species and therefore do not always provide reliable answers a solution relying only on existing phenotype annotations could overcome the problem in differing gene function and resulting phenotypes across different species to the best of our knowledge the prediction of secondary phenotypes from primary screen annotations in combination with literature curated phenotypes in mouse has not been addressed before here we present an association_rule approach that enables the identification of potential secondary phenotype screens in mouse using data from mgd and complementing the primary phenotype screens in sanger mgp applying association_rule we were able to discover rules covering phenotypes and leading to predictions for secondary phenotypes for genes contained in the sanger mgp database these suggested genephenotype associations include unique phenotypes for which new assays can be defined for the predicted associations are neither contained in mgd nor sanger mgp we automatically as well as manually evaluated the secondary phenotype predictions and can demonstrate that our results show viable candidates in conclusion we believe that novel biological_hypotheses and secondary phenotype screens can be formulated from the predicted secondary phenotypes illustrates the overall workflow of this study the following subsections describe the prediction approach and the utilized datasets in detail applying association_rule we were able to identify rules provided in supplementary_material s that lead to secondary phenotype hypotheses for sanger mgp genes in total we could predict novel genephenotype associations containing unique phenotypes that are not contained in mgd out of these genephenotype relationships were covered by the taxonomy of the ontology i e the predicted phenotypes were ancestor concepts of annotations already used for one particular gene the unique phenotype concepts span of mgds top level phenotypes such as tumorigenesis mp nervous_system phenotype mp or muscle phenotype mp showing the diversity of phenotypes that could be added to the annotation of genes the phenotypes also cover different hierarchy levels in the ontology spanning from the second to the th level with the highest group falling into level all measured as shortest distance from the root node of the mp ontology for example adenohypophysis hypoplasia mp as well as abnormal cranium size mp are suggested as secondary phenotypes in general the deeper an ontology term is the more specific is the concept it is representing this means that the predictions not only span a variety of different high_level phenotypes but also add detailed information to the genes they are associated with which allows for a better characterization of individual genes supplementary_material s provides all the predicted secondary phenotype annotations together with additional information such as the high_level phenotype term name and frequency of occurrence in the prediction dataset in this study we applied an association_rule approach to mine secondary phenotypes and computationally verify their biological validity using two automated and a limited manual evaluation we used the manually assigned phenotype annotations contained in mgd for learning phenotype co occurrence patterns and merged the identified patterns with phenotypes that were experimentally_verified in primary screens and are available from the sanger mgp using data from particular resources creates dependencies towards those data resources for example annotation guidelines such as those employed by mgd ensure a consistency of human annotators but can also create artefacts in the predictions generated from the data in our particular case we may find phenotype co occurrence patterns that are intrinsic to annotation guidelines and not purely due to their co occurrence this may occur when the annotation guidelines cover rules that enforce a set of phenotypes to be annotated in particular circumstances instead of only one however as these guidelines exist to ensure biological correctness of the data we expect that those cases still constitute biologically_interesting though known connections between individual phenotypes the implementation of the secondary phenotype prediction pipeline relies solely on an association_rule approach using the pipeline in conjunction with unique phenotypes see section the obtained result of new rules seems comparatively_small as the number of rules is directly related to the settings for the apriori software the number of potential hypotheses may be increased by changing these parameters however and as with any prediction_tool we applied conservative measures that would reduce the likelihood of creating false hypotheses in addition starting with a small subset of rules enables better verification possibilities and selection mechanisms for biological experiment_design potential areas of extension are the incorporation of additional pattern_recognition methods that could then be used to form a support system and provide provenance for identified patterns e g only predictions that are made by a number of systems are more likely to be secondary phenotypes using phenotype patterns to generate secondary phenotype predictions implies that phenotypes that co occur often with each other are likely to always co occur for some biological_phenomena this assumption has been validated e g the correlation of body_weight with bone_density or blood calcium levels given that the secondary phenotypes perform well in the evaluation we feel that the assumption can still be used for forming secondary phenotype hypotheses however in future work we envisage a more complex filtering strategy for assigning phenotype annotations using not only primary phenotypes but also gene function_annotations and diseaseautomatically generating secondary phenotyping hypotheses involvement to reduce the number of falsely associated genes and phenotypes in addition to voting from different prediction_algorithms
