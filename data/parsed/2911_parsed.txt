metanetx org a website and repository for accessing analysing and manipulating metabolic_networks metanetx org is a website for accessing analysing and manipulating genome_scale gsms as well as biochemical_pathways it consistently integrates data from various public resources and makes the data accessible in a standardized format using a common namespace currently it provides access to hundreds of gsms and pathways that can be interactively compared two or more analysed e g detection of dead_end metabolites and reactions flux_balance or simulation of reaction and gene_knockouts manipulated and exported users can also upload their own metabolic_models choose to automatically map them into the common namespace and subsequently make use of the websites functionality availability_and metanetx org is available at http genome_scale gsms consist of compartmentalized reactions that consistently combine biochemical genetic and genomic_information when also considering a biomass reaction and both uptake and secretion reactions gsms are often used to study genotypephenotype relationships to direct new discoveries and to identify targets in metabolic_engineering however a major_difficulty in gsm comparisons and reconstructions is to integrate data from different resources with different nomenclatures and conventions for both metabolites and reactions hence gsm consolidation and comparison may be impossible without detailed biological_knowledge and programming_skills therefore community approaches in form of jamboree meetings were introduced to collect and integrate data to generate consensus reconstructions furthermore model repositories such ascorrelation groups for simulations metanetx org provides a tool set to study reaction fluxes in particular with respect to biomass_production and biomass_production after performing single reaction or single gene_knockouts which are commonly used for model validation in the context of model development a dedicated section of metanetx org allows one to combine gsms with respect to their reaction or protein_sets or with respect to the results of previously performed analyses for example it is possible to create a minimal functional model where every reaction is able to carry a flux at steady_state i e a model without zero flux reactions all available and newly_generated networks as well as the results of their analyses and predictions can be exported as sbml or flat files for documentation and further analyses modifications in external tools such as the cobra toolbox we believe that metanetx org could become a valuable resource for accessing analysing and manipulating gsms especially for users with limited programming_skills or as a resource for independent_validation and testing we expect that the rigorous format requirements enable a standardized way to define and exchange models and that they allow for an effective and efficient benchmark process for future method development projects b main features of metanetx org a flowchart illustrating the structure of metanetx org the website with its common namespace and user workspace connects the repository of publicly_available gsms or user_defined gsms reaction sets with the tools section as well as the view and export functions that enable the users to interactively analyse their results inside or outside of metanetx org b interactive applet viewer showing the network neighbourhood of ethanol across several compartments in a selected escherichia_coli model c comparison of three selected e coli models top using the metanetx org workspace present or absent reactions bottom
