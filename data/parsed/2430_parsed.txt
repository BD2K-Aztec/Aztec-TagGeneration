systems_biology inference of gene_networks application to bifidobacterium motivation the reliable and reproducible identification of gene_interaction represents one of the grand challenges of both modern_molecular and computational sciences approaches based on careful collection of literature data and network topological_analysis applied to unicellular organisms have proven to offer results applicable to medical_therapies however when little a priori_knowledge is available other approaches not relying so strongly on previous_literature must be used we propose here a novel algorithm based_on able to infer the interactions_occurring among genes starting from gene_expression steady_state data results the algorithm was first validated on synthetic and real benchmarks it was then applied to the reconstruction of the core of the amino_acids metabolism in bifidobacterium_longum an essential yet poorly known player in the human_gut intestinal_microbiome known to be related to the onset of important diseases such as metabolic syndromes our results show how computational_approaches can offer effective tools for applications with the identification of potential new biological_information availability the software is available at www bioconductor org and at www picb ac cn clinicalgenomicntw temp html recent_advances in bio technology have provided researchers with several powerful data platforms able to collect biological_molecules activity at the genome_wide level nowadays such an abundance of data potentially allows reconstruction of the complex_interplay among molecules responsible for diverse_cellular network_reconstruction which is a broad_area in modern biology research focuses on two main directions reconstruction of physical networks where the relationships inferred represent actual connections among molecules of a diverse nature i e metabolic_networks and reconstruction of interactions called influence networks physical networks allow to infer precise information to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as but require a priori_knowledge to support initial assumptions an interesting and successful example of physical network_reconstruction application is given in where the authors were able to describe in detail several mechanisms of action occurring in leishmania_major a protozoan that causes cutaneous_leishmaniasis in mammalian_hosts the network was reconstructed with extensive data_collection manual_curation and finally automated topological_analysis very interestingly the whole approach generated hypotheses that were then experimentally_validated to identify therapeutic_targets therefore the application of computational_tools to simpler organisms that are in tight relation with the evolving health_state of more complex organisms like humans can bear fruitful results conversely to physical networks influence networks infer generic connections among genes but require very little preliminary evidence and can therefore be applied to systems for which little a priori_knowledge is available in this work we explore a gene network related to bifidobacterium a crucial player in the gut intestinal gi microbiome the importance of which is becoming more and more central in the onset of several types of diseases despite little knowledge available today the gi_tract with its microbiome in fact is an important organ responsible for digestion absorption and metabolism of dietary nutrients it contributes to of whole_body protein_synthesis and is the most important route of entry for foreign_antigens i e natural toxins invading_pathogens in particular the human_gut is the home of a complex and vast_array of bacterial cells which are estimated to be times more numerous than the total number of cells in the human_body and with a collective genome metagenome that contains at least times as many genes as our own genome comparative_metagenomics has uncovered functional_attributes of the microbiome involved in the metabolism of glycans and amino_acids the production of methane and the biosynthesis of vitamins in particular the amino_acid aa metabolism appears to be a core functional_group highly_consistent across different human_microbiome samples processes performed by the microbiome are strictly intertwined with the host metabolism to the point that life without this contribution may not be possible this concept is summarized in the definition of sym xenobiotic metabolites formed by both gut microbial and host metabolism that cannot be synthesized by either in isolation and which forms no part of the energy_metabolism or biosynthetic machinery of either system in particular bifidobacterium_longum a subspecies of bifidobacteria has been reported to be crucial in a number of functions and is protective against the onset of obesity prodrome of metabolic syndromes see only as an example and our recent validationand the perturbation vector pfor gene i are optimal under the sse i e i tmpa tmpp i i n see section and the supplementary_materials for more details on ntw in given these fact we have chosen to apply our gene network_reconstruction method to the aa metabolism of b longum ncc a particular strain of b longum isolated from infant feces and which genome_sequence was the first completed within the bifidobacterium genus and revised in genbank database accession_number no ae our method network of transcripts wirings ntw is an ordinary_differential ode based model despite prior work showing good performances the superiority of ode_models is far from assessed however ode based_algorithms frame the reverse_engineering problem with the quite flexible identification of a function that describes the variation of gene expression_vector x over time x f x p where x represents the expressions of the n genes involved in the network across m experiments f is the function that models how the transcriptional perturbations p lead to the new equilibria in x as pointed_out in an extensive comparison with previous work is not easy due to the abundance of algorithms produced and the partial availability of data and software and would represent a work in itself nevertheless we describe here some recent or popular approaches we will compare to nir uses a linearized version of this equation leading to the matricial form of the linearized equation ax p where a represents the interaction_network adjacency_matrix nn x the steady_state expression values expression matrix nm and p the transcriptional perturbations a matrix of the same size as x nm under the assumption that transcriptional perturbations triggering the new equilibria are known nir assumes that only a certain number of genes have interactions and minimizes the sum of squared errors sses to get the approximation of gene network matrix recently a parallelized version of nir has been published nirest builds upon the original nir and extends its use to cases in which the perturbations are not known assuming only a few genes are perturbed in each experiment nirest first produces a rough estimation of the gene interaction matrix a it then infers p based on the estimated a and x based on the same ode model other algorithms have been designed for example inthe smallest possible genetic network is obtained from the minimization of a convex cost_function over a convex set of feasible solutions like nir this algorithm requires the transcriptional perturbations to be known combinatorial perturbation based interaction analysis copia uses a non linear function f and minimizes two errors an sse to measure the difference between the model predicted expression values and the corresponding observational values and a structure error which takes_into the number of interaction in the predicted gene network finally in a mixed model is adopted using information_theory mix clr method to extract preliminary knowledge and an ode model to refine it we had also considered this type of approach and tested it using aracne and nir with little success data not published our method ntw is part of this large family of ode methods which make use like nir and nirest of a linearized version of the original equation ax p the major advance offered by our approach compared with the seminal work inpage from the benchmarks validation ntw shows some interesting advantages over other state of the art methods more concretely comparing to nir ntw does not need to know p which can be an important unknown of the system to compute a comparing to nirest ntw directly produces a rough perturbation matrix without computing an estimate of a first and infers a and p by page
