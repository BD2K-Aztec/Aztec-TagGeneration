structural_bioinformatics a method for integrative structure_determination of protein protein_complexes motivation structural_characterization of protein interactions is necessary for understanding and modulating biological_processes on one hand x_ray or nmr_spectroscopy provide atomic_resolution structures but the data_collection process is typically long and the success_rate is low on the other hand computational_methods for modeling assembly structures from individual components frequently suffer from high false_positive rarely resulting in a unique_solution results here we present a combined approach that computationally integrates data from a variety of fast and accessible experimental_techniques for rapid and accurate structure_determination of pro teinprotein complexes the integrative_method uses atomistic models of two interacting_proteins and one or more datasets from five accessible experimental_techniques a small_angle saxs profile d class average images from negative stain electron_microscopy micrographs em a d density_map from single_particle negative stain em residue type content of the pro teinprotein interface from nmr_spectroscopy and chemical_cross detected by mass_spectrometry the method is tested on a docking benchmark consisting of known complex structures and simulated experimental_data the near native model is the top scoring one for up to of benchmark cases depending on the included experimental_datasets in comparison to for standard computational docking we also collected saxs d class average images and d density_map from negative stain em to model the pcsk antigenj fab antibody complex followed by validation of the model by a subsequently available x_ray availability biologists are identifying components of macromolecular assemblies and networks to understand how these assemblies and networks underpin essential_biological and to modulate them for therapeutic purposes we need to describe the structures of both natural and engineered protein interactions owing to the difficulty of determining the atomic_structures of protein_complexes by x_ray and nmr_spectroscopy as well as inaccuracy of alternative_methods such as proteinprotein_docking new techniques are necessary one major computational_approach to predicting structures of protein_complexes relies on molecular_docking of unbound single component structures even for complexes with two proteins docking problem remains_challenging despite recent_advances the major bottlenecks include dealing with protein_flexibility and the absence of an accurate scoring_function pairwise protein_docking methods can be divided_into three classes based on their configurational sampling algorithm i global methods using a fast_fourier fft or geometric matching ii medium range methods such as monte_carlo sampling and iii methods guided by data such as complex refinement based on nmr restraints cross_linking interface prediction or site_directed it is common to begin docking two proteins with an unbiased global search followed by refinement of the best scoring models characterizing the structures of multi subunit complexes benefits from using varied experimental_datasets in this hybrid or integrative approach the datasets are encoded into a scoring_function used to evaluate candidate models generated by a sampling method integrative structure_determination typically iterates through the following stages i gathering information ii designing model representation and evaluation iii sampling good models and iv analyzing models and information here we present an integrative approach to pairwise protein_docking first data from one or more of five different experiment types are translated into the corresponding scoring_function terms these data include i the pair distance distribution function of the complex from a small_angle saxs profile ii d class average images of the complex from negative stain electron_microscopy micrographs em d iii a d density_map of the complex from single_particle negative stain electron_microscopy micrographs em d iv residue type content at the protein interface from nmr_spectroscopy nmr rtc and v chemical_cross detected by mass_spectrometry cxms these five experimental methods were selected because of their feasibility and efficiency of data_collection a saxs profile of the complex in solution can be collected in several minutes a d em density_map can be reconstructed from a smaller sample amount than that for saxs but data_collection process is significantly_longer d class averages can be computed from micrographs more easily and rapidly than performing a full d reconstruction the composition of interface residues from nmr provides information about the interaction interface unlike the saxs and em data and cross_linking data provide information at intermediate resolution imposing an upper distance bound on inter molecular pairs of residues second complex models are sampled relying on efficient global search_methods developed for pairwise protein_docking followed by filtering based on fit to the experimental_data conformational refinement and composite scoring third good scoring representatives of clusters of models are picked as final models to validate this approach we apply the integrative_method in two contexts first we test the method on a large benchmark for protein_docking with simulated experimental_data and known complex structures this test allows a robust assessment of the value of the individual types of experimental_data for specific types of proteins second we also collected saxs em d and em d data to model the pcsk antigenj fab antibody complex followed by validation of the model by a subsequently available x_ray this second test highlights the advantages of the integrative_method that allows computing an accurate model in a timely_manner we developed an integrative_method for docking two protein_structures by combining protein_docking techniques with data from five experimental methods including saxs em d em d nmr rtc and cxms to assess the accuracy of the integrative_method we used a benchmark of complex structures with simulated experimental_data we also applied thescoring cluster representatives red green gold and yellow for integrative docking with saxs em d and em d filters superimposed on x_ray blue the models are superimposed on pcsk prodomain in cyan catalytic_domain in blue and c terminal domain in dark blue c fit of the top scoring cluster representatives to the saxs profile em d class averages and em d density_map method to an antibodyantigen complex relying on experimental_datasets collected specifically for this study additional information such as sequence_conservation and impact of site_directed on complex formation has been used previously to increase the accuracy of pairwise protein_docking here we analyze the improved docking success_rates afforded by data from five accessible experimental methods our integrative framework can be modularly extended to support additional types of experimental_data such as those from footprinting site_directed fret spectroscopy and atomic_force in addition to the data types tested here binding_site residues and distance constraints if available can be added directly to the patchdock input in principle experimental_datasets can be used either to filter docking models or directly to drive the sampling we select the first approach because it allows seamless_integration of any combination of datasets and we can rely on efficient global search_methods already developed for pairwise protein_docking moreover driving the docking with global shape data such as saxs and em d is algorithmically challenging
