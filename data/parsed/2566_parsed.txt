strategies further ms data_acquisition is considered as a new promising strategy to reduce and potentially eliminate the peptide interference effect the next major step in this process is the inference from peptides to proteins measurements of label intensities are assessed at the spectra level and subsequently a summarization strategy is needed to estimate the corresponding protein ratios generally all peptide spectra assigned to a protein are assumed to share the same expression_profile indeed substantial variance heterogeneity is observed due to random and systematic_biases the question arises how a peptide to protein summarization method can appropriately address this existing variance heterogeneity different studies demonstrated that the coefficient of variance is dependent on the absolute signal_intensity suffering from higher variation in low_intensity than in high_intensity data therefore different summarization methods were developed to account for these intensity_dependent effects by filtering for low_intensity peptides weighting peptides according to their absolute intensities or by applying a variance stabilization method other approaches examine the error structure and the underlying ratio distributions and develop noise models accordingly further standard statistical concepts such as averaging by mean or median are still one of the most commonly used methods to find protein ratio estimates from a range of peptide quantities multiple tools and comprehensive itraq quantification pipelines either offer or are exclusively based on simple median or weighted mean calculations for protein ratio inference additionally strategies for filtering outlying peptide ratios are frequently proposed including methods like grubbs and dixons test a different category of approaches requires the integration of replicate samples or spike in proteins to enable an assessment of the internal experimental variation all these summarization methods have in common that they only focus on quantitative peptide information in order to infer protein quantities so_far the main_feature which is extensively_studied and related to the reliability of peptide quantities is the absolute intensity signal however there are several additional characteristics of peptides available which are known to have an impact on the overall reliability of a specific peptide and its measurements in this work we identify and investigate the impact of diverse peptide spectra features such as charge_state sequence_length identification score mass and a distance_metric within uniquely and redundantly measured spectra we examine how these features correlate with the variance heterogeneity and to which extent they are related to quantification accuracy in spectra our aim is to find a combination of feature criteria that allows inferring ratio reliability by using the complementary strength of the features as a result we developed ipqf which integrates the information of peptide spectra characteristics with given quantitative values we show the added value of peptide spectra feature information to improve protein ratio estimation the proposed algorithm can be combined with any purely quantitative approach in addition a fundamental intention was not to disregard any information but rather to keep peptide_spectrum and down weight unreliable spectra according to the features instead of losing information by filtering further no internal replicates or specific sample setup in the design of itraq and tmt experiments is required which may restrict applicability finally we evaluate the performance of our approach on five different published itraq and tmt datasets providing a ground_truth of known peptide and protein quantities thereby we consider three ms datasets with minimal amount of biases one ms dataset showing a high peptide interference effect as well as one ms dataset a comparison study with nine commonly used peptide to protein summarization methods is conducted to our knowledge this is also the most comprehensive comparison study of summarization methods inference of protein ratios based on heterogeneous peptide spectra measurements remains a crucial issue which receives little consideration in most quantification pipelines in this work we present a new summarization strategy ipqf which integrates spectra characteristics with quantitative values for protein ratio estimation we investigate different peptide spectra features and reveal significant correlations between features and quantification accuracy as a result we are able to show the added value of feature information to achieve_improved protein ratio accuracy peptide spectra features contain valuable information in addition to pure quantitative information since no individual feature shows near perfect correlation to quantification error the combination of features can be crucial to compensate for failures of individual_features and to make use of their diverse strengths overall it is unlikely that a peptide spectrum is mischaracterized by a large set of features at the same time in particular proteins with a high_diversity of underlying feature values profit from the approach while feature uniformity naturally reduces the impact by giving similar weights to spectra this is primarily relevant for proteins holding a small to medium number of peptide_spectrum exhibiting ratio variation here particularly benefit of the ipqf approach is shown in cases of large_numbers of peptide spectra the feature impact is decreased and approaches using the mean already perform considerably well another prerequisite for successful protein ratio estimation is that peptide ratio measurements are spread around the true protein ratio value the best protein quantification_method still remains dependent on given peptide quantities and cannot work if peptide values coherently and systematically diverge from the ground_truth feature and quantification error correlation will also not necessarily be sufficiently strong in these divergent cases as the error is strongly biased a major_issue in itraq and tmt datasets is the peptide interference effect which causes the underestimation of ratios and its compression towards one ms data_acquisition has proven to significantly reduce the interference effect evaluation of ipqf approaches also confirms the applicability in ms data settings and still shows a robust performance under interference impact compared to other methods the flexible design of the algorithm enables further extensions one option is to join results of a purely quantitative method with estimations obtained by ipqf to benefit from both strategies here we provide a combination of ipqf with medianpolish and show significant improvements over both individual methods in our results the advantage of a joined approach is that in case of few peptide spectra per protein additional feature knowledge can compensate for the sparse information in the quantitative setup while more sophisticated summarization strategies can be applied with rich quantitative information available further a different option is to exclusively employ the spectra feature_based reliability measure provided by ipqf and integrate it in existing summarization approaches beyond this new and relevant_features of interest can be easily added to the implemented feature framework generally the idea of a feature_based spectra weighting is transferable beyond itraq data while our studies only focus on feature error correlations in itraq and tmt data similar findings are expected for silac as well as label_free data algorithmic steps of ipqf are technically applicable to quantitative_proteomic methods requiring peptide summarization but careful evaluation in the context of the specific experiment is necessary moreover our proposed approach is independent of using replicate samples or spike in proteins independent of the instrument and the selected multiplex further in contrast to modelling approaches mostly requiring larger numbers of peptide spectra ipqf is also applicable in small settings also no assumption concerning underlying ratio distributions or specific data criteria is required hence we also chose replicate independent summarization methods and use corresponding settings in tools such as isobar for evaluation comparison in addition a fundamental intention was to keep peptide spectra by applying a feature_based weighting instead of losing information by filtering filtering of low_intensity spectra or outlier ratios is commonly performed however this significantly_reduces the protein coverage as few peptide readings per protein typically dominate the datasets further defining a cutoff for outlier filtering is a critical issue as important information is potentially discarded overall we provide a broad performance comparison of nine different protein ratio inference methods on five published datasets with predefined ground_truth to the best of our knowledge an overall benchmark study of current methods assessing diverse biases and impact on protein ratio accuracy in itraq tmt data is missing here we also provide a basis for future comparison of summarization methods the goal of the protein quantification process is the inference of protein quantities based on peptide quantities however peptide ratios assigned to a protein exhibit substantial heterogeneity and require clever summarization strategies we present ipqf which integrates peptide spectra characteristics as well as quantitative values for protein ratio estimation the novelty of the algorithm is to weight spectra according to their feature reliability comprehensive evaluation of ipqf in comparison to other summarization methods yields a superior and robust performance as a result the benefit of feature information to achieve_improved protein ratio accuracy is shown
