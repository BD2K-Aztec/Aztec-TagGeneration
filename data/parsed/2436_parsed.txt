systems_biology inference of temporally varying bayesian_networks motivation when analysing gene_expression time series data an often overlooked but crucial aspect of the model is that the regulatory network_structure may change over time although some approaches have addressed this problem previously in the literature many are not well suited to the sequential nature of the data results here we present a method that allows us to infer regulatory network_structures that may vary between time points using a set of hidden_states that describe the network_structure at a given time point to model the distribution of the hidden_states we have applied the hierarchical_dirichlet hidden_markov a non parametric extension of the traditional hidden_markov which does not require us to fix the number of hidden_states in advance the analysis of gene_expression data in the field of systems_biology is a challenging_problem for a number of reasons not least because of the high_dimensionality of the data and relative dearth of data_points a number of approaches have been taken to inferring regulatory_interactions from such data often using graphical_models or sparse regression techniques l bre opgen these problems are further compounded by the nature of the biological_systems under consideration owing to the influence of unobserved actors that may alter the behaviour of the system often experiments are performed for long_periods during which it is natural to expect the regulatory_interactions at work to change the time scales of regulatory responses to stimuli often differ from those of signalling and metabolic_responses and so it may be that responses to stimuli around which experiments are often designed take place in several phases each having different time scales previous_studies have attempted to address this problem by introducing changepoints in the time series allowing the inferred network_structure to differ between the resulting segments of the time series for example in a changepoint model is applied in which dynamic_bayesian are inferred for each segment of the time series however such approaches may place strong prior assumptions on the number of changepoints that can be observed and do not adjust for the complexity of the observed data automatically instead in an allocation sampler is used in combination with bayesian_networks to assign each observation to a group but unlike changepoint models this method treats the observations as being exchangeable ignoring the fact that the data are sequential the similar methodology in ickstadt uses a more flexible non parametric prior on group assignments applied to the modelling of molecular_interactions using bayesian_networks but suffers the same drawbacks in not recognizing the sequential nature of the data a solution to the related but different problem of inferring networks from multiple datasets that may vary in their underlying_structure owing to changes in conditions is presented in by applying a hierarchical_model it is possible to model the interactions that may be shared for a number of different experimental_conditions while also modelling the interactions specific to certain cases however this method treats the whole time series for a condition as a single static network rather than allowing the network_structure to change within a time series here we present a methodology that allows us to infer network_structures that may change between observations in a nonparametric framework while modelling the sequential nature of the data to that end we have used the infinite hidden_markov of also known as the hierarchical_dirichlet hidden_markov hdp hmm in particular the sticky extension of in conjunction with a bayesian_network model of the gene_regulatory structure the hdp hmm allows the number of different states of the network_structure to adapt as necessary to explain the observed data including a potentially infinite number of states of course restricted in practice by the finite number of experimental_observations in the previous work of it was demonstrated that the hdp hmm outperforms a dirichlet_process mixture for gaussian graphical_models on heterogeneous time series we apply our methodology to both simulated_data and gene_expression data for arabadopsis thaliana and drosophila_melanogaster demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting changes in network_structure from time series data and compare its performance and accuracy to existing_methods we also consider the biological_implications of our results and present hypotheses as to their significance
