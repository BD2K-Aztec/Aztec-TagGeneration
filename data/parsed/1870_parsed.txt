structural_bioinformatics forna force directed rna simple and effective online rna_secondary diagrams motivation the secondary_structure of rna is integral to the variety of functions it carries out in the cell and its depiction allows researchers to develop hypotheses about which nucleotides and base_pairs are functionally_relevant current approaches to visualizing secondary_structure provide an adequate platform for the conversion of static text_based representations to d images but are limited in their offer of interactivity as well as their ability to display larger structures multiple structures and pseudoknotted structures results in this article we present forna a web_based for displaying rna_secondary which allows users to easily convert sequences and secondary_structures to clean concise and cus tomizable visualizations it supports among other features the simultaneous visualization of multiple structures the display of pseudoknotted structures the interactive editing of the displayed structures and the automatic generation of secondary_structure diagrams from pdb files it requires no software installation apart from a modern web_browser availability_and the web_interface of forna is available at http rna tbi univie ac at forna while the source_code is available on github at www github com pkerpedjiev forna contact the use of secondary_structure diagrams is ubiquitous within the field of rna biology they convey not only which nucleotides are paired but also and perhaps more importantly which are unpaired the contents and positions of sub structures such as hairpin loops interior loops multiloop junctions and external loops are immediately evident such information is of great value to researchers seeking to identify putative mutations to perform when seeking to isolate the structural basis of a biological effect to find protein binding and to provide a context for observed behavior it is used as both an exploratory as well as a communicative tool researchers examine secondary_structure diagrams to gain insights about potential functions and mechanisms as well as to describe and disseminate them although there are a number of available tools for visualizing the secondary_structure of rna_molecules with the exception of pseudoviewer none are available online without java and none offer the flexibility in exploring arranging and manipulating the structure that forna does for an enumerated comparison of features we provide an easy to use accessible free open_source web_tool for rna_secondary visualization that produces beautiful highly customizable plots our tool requires no externally installed screenshot of forna web app displaying the bacterial ribonuclease p holoenzyme in complex with trna pdb id q q immediately evident are the regions of the trna which are in contact with the ribonuclease namely the and end nucleotides as well as the t wc loop an rna_binding is shown as a gray node in the lower right hand region of the diagram software and is useful for both the exploration and dissemination of rna_secondary
