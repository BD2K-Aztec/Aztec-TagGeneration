high_dimensional pharmacogenetic prediction of a continuous trait using machine_learning with application to warfarin dose prediction in african_americans motivation with complex_traits and diseases having potential genetic_contributions of thousands of genetic_factors and with current genotyping_arrays consisting of millions of single_nucleotide snps powerful high_dimensional statistical_techniques are needed to comprehensively model the genetic_variance machine_learning have many advantages including lack of parametric assumptions and high power and flexibility results we have applied three machine_learning random_forest regression rfr boosted regression tree brt and support_vector svr to the prediction of warfarin maintenance_dose in a cohort of african_americans we have developed a multi_step approach that selects snps builds prediction_models with different subsets of selected snps along with known associated genetic and environmental_variables and tests the discovered models in a cross_validation framework preliminary_results indicate that our modeling_approach gives much higher accuracy than previous_models for warfarin dose prediction a model size of snps in addition to the known genetic and environmental_variables gives the best accuracy the r between the predicted and actual square_root of warfarin dose in this model was on average for rfr for svr and for brt thus rfr had the best accuracy but all three techniques achieved better performance than the current published r of in a sample of mixed ethnicity and in an african_american sample in summary machine_learning for high_dimensional pharmacogenetic prediction and for prediction of clinical continuous traits of interest hold_great and warrant further research we tested each machine_learning rfr brt and svr on a variety of different pharmacogenetic models listed in model is similar to the previously_tested model found to have an r of in an independent multi_ethnic cohort model includes the variables in model as well as some additional previously_identified associated genetic_variants the remaining models_include the variables from model augmented by snps selected using single marker analysis in plink see section the r of each discovered model averaged over the training and testing partitions in the five fold cv for rfr brt and svr are shown in in addition shows a plot of the average r for each model and each technique in the test partitions shows that predictive_accuracy as measured in the test partitions increases with larger models for all three methods tested until a peak at the m model beyond which further increases in model size cause a slight_decrease in predictive_accuracy standard_error is given as the sd over test partitions divided by the square_root of the number of test partitions testing with a larger_sample may help decide between these two hypotheses in terms of the overall predictive_accuracy achieved as measured in the test partitions the r for model which is analogous to the previously_tested model iwpc ranges from to which is less than the previously cited r for this model in a multi_ethnic cohort but is in agreement with previous_estimates in populations of african_descent model which contains other known associated variants for warfarin doseresponse is seen to have a modest increase in accuracy over model but significant_increases in accuracy are seen with the addition of snps using each of the machine_learning regression techniques tested the highest predictive_power was seen with rfr in which an average r of was achieved with model snps the other two methods tested brt and svr also show the highest predictive_accuracy with the m model for brt and for svr these r values are much higher than the reported by the iwpc for african_americans robustness of the proposed models is demonstrated in part by comparing the change in r from training to testing partitions the decrease in r is seen to be very small or not existent and in general within the error of the method which suggests that our methodology is able to guard against overfitting in addition the fact that the predictive_accuracy of our methods show a peak at a certain model size model snps and does not continue to increase demonstrates that mechanisms for preventing overfitting in each of the three methods tested are having the desired effect further improvements in predictive_accuracy may be achieved if larger testing and training_sets are used similarly this approach may improve dose prediction for ethnic_groups other than african_american although rfr achieved the best performance in this study all three techniques show improved_prediction over the current model in this article we have demonstrated a practical approach for applying three commonly used machine_learning for continuous data rfr svr and brt to create highly_accurate predictive_models using genome_wide genotype data and clinical_variables in an application to prediction of warfarin doseresponse in african_americans all three methods tested rfr svr and brt achieved better performance than currently published_reports iwpc although the highest_accuracy was achieved with rfr this may be due to the robustness of rfr to overfitting in performing bootstrapping over thousands of trees the results of this study indicate that even with a phenotype like warfarin maintenance_dose that has many validated associated genetic_variants of large effect it is still important to include a large number of genotypic variables in a predictive_model to capture the most genetic_variance our results are consistent with the findings in that show that including only those snps found to have genome_wide significance in gwas_studies results in poorer predictive_performance and that much better performance is obtained with larger models in considering which machine_learning to apply to gwas based predictive_modeling of a continous trait therepage
