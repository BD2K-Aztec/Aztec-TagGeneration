genetics_and locusexplorer a user_friendly for integrated visualization of human genetic_association data and biological annotations in this article we present locusexplorer a data visualization and exploration tool for genetic_association data locusexplorer is written in r using the shiny library providing access to powerful r based functions through a simple user_interface locusexplorer allows users to simultaneously display genetic statistical and biological data for humans in a single image and allows dynamic zooming and customization of the plot features publication quality plots may then be produced in a variety of file_formats availability_and locusexplorer is open_source and runs through r and a web_browser it is available atgenome wide association studies gwas are a powerful_tool to interrogate genetic_variation for association with a particular phenotype a large number of loci associated with a variety of diseases and traits have been identified however the statistically most significant gwas variants only tag loci within the genome that contain the underlying functional_variant s are rarely causal themselves and the association_signals are frequently situated in non coding_regions whilst deep resequencing of gwas loci would ultimately be desirable to precisely identify the causal functional_variants behind each signal this approach is not routinely applied due to cost and time constraints and instead imputation based fine_mapping strategies are more commonly_employed to narrow down the spectrum of associated variation these association data are subsequently annotated with biological_information to prioritise an even smaller number of prospective candidate causal_variants for functional evaluation whilst this process is substantially computational manual interpretation of the integrated statistical and biological data nonetheless remains an important stage of the analysis process which is facilitated by intuitive visualization although tools for the graphical plotting of regional association data or annotation of biological_context have previously been developed these are generally unable to integrate both information types together for simultaneous scrutiny the recent enlight web_tool provided the first simultaneous annotation of diverse data types within the same plot however as with all currently available programs there remains an inherent limitation with respect to the ability to modify plots without starting over we therefore developed a novel human gwas data visualization application locusexplorer to facilitate navigation and interpretation of our findings during a recent fine_mapping study of previously_identified prostate_cancer prca susceptibility_loci
