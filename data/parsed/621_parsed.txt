automatic prediction of polysaccharide utilization loci in bacteroidetes species motivation a bacterial polysaccharide utilization locus pul is a set of physically linked_genes that orchestrate the breakdown of a specific glycan puls are prevalent in the bacteroidetes phy lum and are key to the digestion of complex carbohydrates notably by the human_gut a given bacteroidetes genome can encode dozens of different puls whose boundaries and precise gene content are difficult to predict results here we present a fully_automated approach for pul prediction using genomic_context and domain annotation alone by combining the detection of a pair of marker_genes with operon prediction using intergenic distances and queries to the carbohydrate active enzymes database www cazy org our predictor achieved above accuracy in two bacteroides species with extensive experimental pul characterization availability_and pul predictions in bacteroidetes genomes from the human_gut and two additional species from the canine oral sphere and from the environment are presented in our database accessible at www cazy org puldb index php glycans are exceptionally diverse molecules whose roles notably include energy_storage starch in plants glycogen in metazoans and fungi structure cellulose hemicelluloses and pectins of plant_cell chitin of arthropod exoskeletons cell communication and host_pathogen simple monosaccharides can be assembled via a and b glycosidic bounds into macromolecules of enormous diversity it has been estimated that hexasaccharides could be built using only d hexoses even though not all possible glycan_structures exist in nature the breakdown of such complex molecules requires a plethora of carbohydrate active enzymes for which the cazy databaseavailable at www cazy orgoffers a continuously updated sequence_based family classification organisms that feed on complex glycans have thus evolved large cazyme repertoires the human diet includes a large amount of carbohydrates ranging from simple disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose to storage polysaccharides typically glycogen and starch and the multitude of complex structures found in the cell_walls of cereals fruits vegetables and in the mammalian extracellular_matrix however the human_genome only encodes digestive cazymes that break down sucrose lactose and the readily digestible component of starch all other carbohydrates often termed dietary_fiber enter the large_bowel where a dense microbial_community comprising trillions of bacteria the microbiota breaks down these structures as well as host derived mucosal glycans the monosaccharides generated are fermented by the microbiota to generate short_chain which can provide up to of our daily caloric needs with the recent_advances in dna sequencing_techniques many metagenomic_studies have focused on the relationship between dietary_fiber and the microbiota to gain insights into how the nutrition of this microbial ecosystem influences the physiology of the human hostseefor a review despite species level variability it has been found that two bacterial phyla usually represent the majority of the sequenced s rrna derived from the human_gut the gram_positive firmicutes and the gram_negative bacteroidetes as gram_negative bacteroidetes species are characterized by a periplasmic_space located between two lipid_bilayer cellular_membranes this compartment enabled these bacteria to evolve a specific strategy for carbohydrate breakdown which are encoded by physically linked and functionally_related known as polysaccharide utilization loci puls each pul encodes co regulated proteins that i bind to polysaccharides on the surface of the bacterium ii mediate limited cleavage of the targeted polysaccharides on the outer_membrane iii import oligosaccharides generated on the bacterial_surface to the periplasm iv catalyze the final saccharification of the imported oligosaccharides to monosaccharides in the periplasmic_space and v sense degradation_products to regulate pul expression through duplication and neofunctionalization bacteroidetes have largely inherited and exchanged puls via vertical and horizontal_transfer as a consequence extant bacteroidetes species now exhibit dozens of puls that encode different enzyme consortia that are tailored to degrade specific glycans pul diversity may contribute to the evolutionary success of bacteroidetes by providing a general glycan utilization strategy optimized to catabolize the extensive repertoire of complex carbohydrates presented to the mammalian large_bowel the pul system is not restricted to mammalian gut bacteroidetes as this phylum is also common in other body sites other animals as well as in the environment the pul paradigm was initially defined for the starch utilization system sus of the human_gut commensal bacteroides thetaiotaomicron this pul consists of eight genes susa g and susr including three genes that encode cazymes on the outer cell_surface susdef bind components of starch while a amylase susg binds and cleaves the polysaccharide to oligosaccharides which are sequestrated by susc into the periplasmic_space of the bacterium imported oligosaccharides which are sensed by susr leading to upregulation of the pul are depolymerized to glucose by neopullanase susa and a glucosidase susb the functional characterization of each sus pul member has been performed independently more recently characterized all eight cazymes of a gene pul of bacteroides ovatus dedicated to xyloglucan degradation such comprehensive approaches are expected to become more widespread as the understanding of pul function requires the elucidation of the synergistic_interactions between all components of the glycan metabolizing apparatus orchestrated by these loci in this context it is critical that all the proteins encoded by specific puls are identified and when appropriate are correctly assigned to families in the cazy database which in turn provides insights into the possible function of these cazymes an ideal approach would be the exhaustive screening of gene_expression of a target species in response to a large variety of carbohydrate substrates as done byfor b thetaiotaomicron byfor b ovatus and byfor bacteroides cellulosilyticus however the large number of bacteroidetes species the difficulty in accessing all the possible glycans in a purified and highly defined formimpure glycans can give highly misleading gene_expression data precludes the systematic identification of puls based solely on gene_expression an alternative and more tractable strategy is the development of an automatic prediction method to identify these loci from genome_sequence alone thereby avoiding the need for bacterial cultivation and extensive gene_expression studies here we present a bioinformatics_approach for pul prediction in bacteroidetes species we evaluate the performance of our approach against experimentally_characterized or predicted puls available for two bacteroidetes species of the human_gut we have applied this predictor to genomes of bacteroidetes species of the human_gut to offer a perspective on the general_characteristics of puls and to allow intergenome comparisons these predictions are made accessible through a web_interface which also includes for comparison purposes two other bacteroidetes the environmental flavobacterium johnsoniae and the canine oral sphere bacterium capnocytophaga canimorsus by combining observed pul structures derived from experimental_investigations of two bacteroidetes species we were able to develop a tool for the automatic prediction of puls solely based on genome_sequence the percentage of correctly_predicted puls was in b thetaiotaomicron and in b ovatus with only a few false predictions that represent of the true_positives we applied our approach to compute pul predictions for bacteroidetes species from the human_gut varying numbers of puls from to were observed in the different species with a majority of puls containing at least two gh encoding_genes and around equal_proportions of the two considered regulator types the results are accessible to the scientific_community via the interactive webinterface puldb at www cazy org puldb index php because our method is based solely on genomic_information the accuracy of the pul delineation depends on the quality of the genome_assemblies and gene predictions with appropriately assembled_genomes our method can provide high_throughput prediction of classical puls in species without expression data or in noncultivated species subject to single_cell we expect that experimental_studies will benefit from these predicted puls for the investigation of the targeted substrates and the evolutionary_analysis of glycan breakdown in a wide_range of species iteratively our automatic pul prediction strategy will be refined by integrating additional knowledge of the pul paradigm in addition a human curation step by the cazy team is planned to correct any erroneous predictions that would appear following the experimental_characterization of a pul finally future_developments will also include bacteroidetes from environmental species to explore the genetic_architecture and function of the puls in these organisms
