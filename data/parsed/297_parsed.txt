sequence_analysis an assessment of substitution scores for protein profile profile comparison motivation pairwise protein sequence_alignments are generally evaluated using scores defined as the sum of substitution scores for aligning amino_acids to one another and gap scores for aligning runs of amino_acids in one sequence to null characters inserted into the other protein_profiles may be abstracted from multiple_alignments of protein_sequences and substitution and gap scores have been generalized to the alignment of such profiles either to single sequences or to other profiles although there is widespread agreement on the general form substitution scores should take for profile sequence_alignment little consensus has been reached on how best to construct profileprofile substitution scores and a large number of these scoring_systems have been proposed here we assess a variety of such substitution scores for this evaluation given a gold_standard set of multiple_alignments we calculate the probability that a profile column yields a higher substitution score when aligned to a related than to an unrelated column we also generalize this measure to sets of two or three adjacent columns this simple approach has the advantages that it does not depend primarily upon the gold_standard alignment columns with the weakest empirical support and that it does not need to fit gap and offset costs for use with each substitution score studied results a simple symmetrization of mean profile sequence scores usually performed the best these were followed closely by several specific scoring_systems constructed using a variety of rationales protein_sequence comparison is fundamental to computational molecular_biology early work in this field focussed on pairwise_sequence and was then inevitably extended to multiple_alignment approaches to multiple_alignment that generalize dynamic_programming to more than two dimensions are necessarily confined to a small number of sequences and have therefore found limited applications most multiple_alignment to whom correspondence should be addressed algorithms proceed in either a progressive or iterative manner by performing pairwise_alignments either between single sequences and multiple_alignments or between two multiple_alignments closely_related subfields concern the extraction of protein_profiles or position specific score matrices from multiple_alignments and their comparison either to single sequences or to one another central to any protein alignment_method is the scoring system it uses to distinguish among the exponentially large number of alternative alignments for pairwise sequence comparison alignment scores are usually constructed as the sum of substitution scores for aligning pairs of letters and gap scores for aligning runs of letters in one sequence to null characters inserted into the other in the context of ungapped local_alignment an analytic statistical theory characterizes all substitution scores as log odds scores and most popular pairwise substitution scores have been explicitly constructed using the log odds formalism similarly most extensions of substitution scores to profile sequence comparison now involve log odds scores as well mediated by position specific amino_acid frequencies estimated from a multiple_alignment column however for profile profile comparison there is no consensus on how the alignment of positions or columns from two profiles should be scored and a large variety of such substitution scores have been proposed there have been a variety of comparative evaluations of profile profile scoring_systems some quite systematic and comprehensive most of these studies have assessed scoring_systems by how well they were able to distinguish by score alignments of related and unrelated profiles or by how accurately they were able to align related profiles several studies faced the issue of how to choose profileprofile gap scores to use in conjunction with the various substitution scores considered in addition they had to offset raw substitution scores so they could be used with equal footing in a local_alignment algorithm they addressed this problem by attempting to optimize for each scoring system gap and offset score parameters over a multidimensional space here we take up again the question of comparing profileprofile substitution scores but propose a new evaluation methodology that avoids the question of how best to select gap and offset parameters in brief given a gold_standard multiple_alignment we first choose two subsets of sequences from the alignment and construct a profile from each aligned set we then simply calculate the probability that a column from one of the profiles has a higher substitution score when aligned to the correct column of the other profile than when aligned to an incorrect column we generalize this measure by considering two or three adjacent columns from one profile aligned to adjacent columns of the other we argue below that these measures of scoring system quality are appropriate and have several advantages to previous measures our approach is related to one suggested by edgar b but differs in several ways e g in that it does not compare columncolumn scores from different profile pairs as described below our approach_requires a set of accurate multiple_alignments involving fairly large_numbers of distantly_related proteins several multiple_alignments sets have been developed for evaluating multiple_alignment methodologies but not all are well suited to our approach often because their alignments involve too few sequences or sequences that are on average too closely_related accordingly we based our evaluation set of multiple_alignments upon a standard database but supplemented it with carefully curated multiple_alignments from several recent_publications we applied our measures of alignment_quality to profile profile substitution scoring_systems most of which have previously been proposed in the literature although no single scoring system emerged as best in all our tests variations on the approach of constructing scores as an average of profile sequence scores consistently outperformed most others fairly close behind were bild scores constructed as a generalization to multiple_alignments of pairwise log odds scores a weighted and symmetrized form of relative entropy based scores and co emission based scores incorporating any of these substitution scores into a profileprofile or a multiple_alignment program will generally require the introduction of gap scores and perhaps of offset scores our evaluation method purposely avoids the consideration of such scores and the best way to define them may depend upon the substitution scores with which they will be used we evaluated the profileprofile substitution scores described above on profile pairs generated as described in section specifying either or aggregate sequences we generated aligned profile pairs p and p for each mean percent identity bin for each pair we calculated the quality_scores and defined above either using sequence weights or not we omitted however from this calculation any columns of p or p containing over gap characters for each substitution score the mean values of using weights are shown in these values are significant to approximately the first digit past the decimal in each column the largest is italicized and all that differ by in absolute rather than relative value are shown in bold in addition for ease of interpretation the differences between each value of and the maximum in its column are represented in a color panel to the right of the table of numbers we discuss below several broad features of and the relationship of its data to those that result when various parameters of our analysis are varied for each score the values of increase both with the mean percent identity between profiles and with their aggregate number of sequences this is fully expected as both changes should render it easier to align the profile columns correctly the performances of certain pairs of scores i e dot g and ldot g and dot r and ldot r are indistinguishable by brief consideration reveals that this will be true of any scores that may be mapped to one another by a monotonic function nevertheless we continue to consider both scores from each pair because the quality_measures and
