morfpred a computational_tool for sequence_based prediction and characterization of short disorder to order transitioning binding regions in proteins motivation molecular_recognition features morfs are short binding regions located within longer intrinsically_disordered that bind to protein_partners via disorder to order transitions morfs are implicated in important processes including signaling and regulation however only a limited number of experimentally_validated morfs is known which motivates development of computational_methods that predict morfs from protein_chains results we introduce a new morf predictor morfpred which identifies all morf types coil and complex we develop a comprehensive dataset of annotated morfs to build and empirically compare our method morfpred utilizes a novel design in which annotations generated by sequence_alignment are fused with predictions generated by a support_vector svm which uses a custom_designed set of sequence derived features the features provide information about evolutionary profiles selected physiochemical_properties of amino_acids and predicted disorder solvent_accessibility and b factors empirical evaluation on several datasets shows that morfpred outperforms related methods morf pred that predicts morfs and anchor which finds disordered_regions that become ordered when bound to a globular partner we show that our predicted new morf regions have non random sequence_similarity with native morfs we use this observation along with the fact that predictions with higher probability are more accurate to identify putative morf regions we also identify a few sequence derived hallmarks of morfs they are characterized by dips in the disorder predictions and higher hydrophobicity and stability when compared to adjacent in the chain residues the existence of disordered proteins challenges the classical structure to function paradigm which states that a unique d conformation of a given protein determines its interactions with other molecules while this paradigm is true for many proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed disordered proteins i e proteins without a defined structure in isolation can also be involved in complex interaction networks there are several examples of proteinprotein and proteinnucleic acid interactions that involve coupled folding and binding i e disorder to order transition upon binding such interactions are significant since they often enable binding diversity and yet they are specific and reversible due to lower binding_strength compared with classical binding this is especially beneficial in signaling and regulation where highly_specific yet dispensable weak interactions are needed here we focus on molecular_recognition features morfs which are short residues binding regions located within longer intrinsically_disordered although in their unbound state morfs might or might not have residual structure they bind to protein_partners typically via disorder to order transitions resulting in helix morfs strand morfs coil morfs or mixtures of these complexmorfs often with partnerdependent conformational_differences these short binding regions have been studied using two computational_approaches as features observed in disorder predictions and as sequence_patterns called short_sequence or linear motifs long disordered binding regions more than residues can also associate with globular partners these long disordered binding sequences are typically conserved so they often show up in databases derived from hidden_markov such as pfam or smart the terms conserved predicted disorder regions b and disordered domains have been used to describe these long disordered binding regions only two related predictors are available morf predii that supersedes morf predi and anchor morf predii is a neural_network based predictor which is limited to prediction of morfs anchor predicts binding regions that undergo a disorder to order transition upon binding to a globular protein partner some of which include morfs regions to this end we develop a novel sequence_based morf predictor our approach converts an input_sequence into a feature_vector that represents various relevant characteristics of this chain which
