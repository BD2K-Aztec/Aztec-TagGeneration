detecting epistatic_effects in association studies at a genomic_level based on an ensemble approach_motivation most complex_diseases involve_multiple genes and their interactions although genome_wide gwas have shown some success for identifying genetic_variants underlying complex_diseases most existing_studies are based on limited single locus approaches which detect single_nucleotide snps essentially based on their marginal associations with phenotypes results in this article we propose an ensemble approach based on boosting to study genegene_interactions we extend the basic adaboost algorithm by incorporating an intuitive importance score based on gini impurity to select candidate snps permutation_tests are used to control the statistical_significance we have performed extensive_simulation using three interaction models to evaluate the efficacy of our approach at realistic gwas sizes and have compared it with existing epistatic detection_algorithms our results indicate that our approach is valid efficient for gwas and on disease_models with epistasis has more power than existing programs most common diseases such as neurodegenerative_diseases e g alzheimers_disease ad and cardiovascular_diseases various cancers diabetes and osteoporoses are complex_diseases that involve_multiple genes their interactions environmental_factors and gene by environment interactions the complex genetic_architecture of complex_diseases makes the task of correlating variations in dna_sequences with phenotypic_differences being one of the grand challenges in biomedical_research with recent_advances in genotyping technologies for assaying single_nucleotide snps large_scale genome_wide gwas for complex_diseases are increasingly common e g wellcome_trust case most existing_methods for gwas are singlelocus based_approaches which examine one snp at a time single locus based_methods usually are unable to recover all involved loci especially when individual_loci have little or no marginal_effects to whom correspondence should be addressed detecting epistasis from gwas is fundamentally difficult because of the large number of snps and relatively small number of samples existing snp_chips may contain up to one million snps and chips with a few millions of snps are on the pipeline on the other hand most studies only consist of less than a few thousands of samples per each disease computationally researchers have to face the problem of the curse of dimensionality whereas the search_space of the problem grows exponentially with the number of involved snps statistically one has to deal with the small n big p problem where the number of samples n is much smaller than the number of variables snps p in general one can view the problem as a model_selection or feature_selection problem with interrelated variables however traditional model_selection approaches most of which have to model interactions explicitly usually are not able to incorporate so many variables in their analyses feature_selection reduction techniques usually are not effective in this case because of the overfitting problem as well as the problem of lack of interpretation while transforming features nevertheless many approaches have been proposed over the years though many of which are not necessarily in the context of gwas seefor a review generally_speaking existing_approaches for searching gene gene or snpsnp interactions can be grouped into four broad categories methods in the first category rely on exhaustive_search classical statistics such as the pearsons test or the logistic_regression that are commonly used as single locus tests for gwas can potentially be used in searching for pairwise interactions for example have shown that explicitly modeling of interactions between loci for gwas with hundreds of thousands of markers is computationally_feasible they also showed that these simple methods explicitly considering interactions can actually achieve reasonably high power with realistic sample_sizes under different interaction models with some marginal_effects even after adjustments of multiple testing using the bonferroni_correction however directly modeling of interactions is still computationally_demanding and it can hardly be extended to include more than two loci another popular_approach based on exhaustive_search called multifactor_dimensionality mdr which is based on partitioning all possible genotype combinations into meaningful subspaces has the same problem of scalability the second category consists of methods relying on stochastic_search with beam as one representative of such algorithms later algorithms in this category e g epimode largely adopted and extended beam beam uses markov_chain mcmc sampling to infer whether each locus is a disease_locus a jointly affecting disease_locus or apage i i i we presented a machine_learning approach for detecting genetic_interactions in large_scale gwas extensive experiments have demonstrated that it outperformed the rfs approach a similar ensemble approach it also outperformed several other statistical_approaches in most cases with inferior performance only when the risk allele_frequency is low in most such cases interaction effects in our models are actually lower we have also demonstrated that permutation_based tests are generally feasible provided efficient implementation as expected they are more powerful than tests with bonferroni corrections and should be applied routinely in gwas_studies for single locus tests in our implementation of the decision_tree algorithm and the snp importance score we used the gini impurity score though it works well in general the reduced power at low mafs might be attributable to it at a low maf the high effect entries especially the one with all four minor alleles are rarely present unlike pearsons test which takes the summation of the deviations of observed counts and expected counts of different genotypes under the null_hypothesis the gini impurity takes the weighted_average of child nodes impurity this may cause some disadvantage for gini index when allele_frequencies are low because high effect nodes have smaller number of individuals on the other hand modifications of the importance score definition or using different measures other than gini impurity in building trees might improve performance it is important to note that this difference between gini impurity and test is fundamentally a single locus effect therefore modifications should not affect our approachs ability to detect epistasis which is rooted in the whole framework one important factor that we chose not to consider is ld on one hand ld is the basis for association studies on the other hand ld may interfere with the interaction effects because snps around each disease_locus usually have high_ld and may enhance the signal when they are considered together we can ignore this mainly because the way how we generated the data it is unlikely that any snps will be in high_ld with the inserted rsnps also ld could be a factor in a different way namely that the underlying rsnps might not be typed but a marker in ld could be this basically has the effect of increasing the noise in the model and reducing the power we will test this in our future work
