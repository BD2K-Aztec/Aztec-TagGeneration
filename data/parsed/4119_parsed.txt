genome_analysis savant genome_browser for high_throughput the advent_of hts technologies has made it affordable to sequence many individuals genomes simultaneously the computational_analysis of the large volumes of data generated by the new sequencing_machines remains a challenge while a plethora of tools are available to map the resulting reads to a reference_genome and to conduct primary analysis of the mappings it is often necessary to visually examine the results and underlying data to confirm predictions and understand the functional effects especially in the context of other datasets results we introduce savant the sequence_annotation visualization and analysis tool a desktop visualization and analysis browser for genomic_data savant was developed for visualizing and analyzing hts_data with special_care taken to enable dynamic visualization in the presence of gigabases of genomic reads and references the size of the human_genome savant supports the visualization of genome based sequence point interval and continuous datasets and multiple visualization modes that enable easy identification of genomic_variants including single_nucleotide structural and copy_number and functional genomic_information e g peaks in chip_seq in the context of genomic_annotations availability savant is freely_available atthe emergence of high_throughput a k a next_generation has made the acquisition of genomic_data quicker and more affordable than ever before continued technological strides are being made to further improve throughput cost and accuracy of the sequencing_platforms enabling largescale studies of genomes populations and diseases within the field of personalized genomics ambitious sequencing_projects such as the genomes_project the international cancer genome consortium and the autism genome_project are seeking to identify genomic_variants among human_genomes and to use this knowledge to determine the genetic_underpinnings of human_diseases by associating variants with symptoms http www icgc org many computational to whom correspondence should be addressed tools have been developed for single_nucleotide snp insertion_deletion indel and other types of genetic_variation discovery in individuals sequenced using high_throughput hts platforms for reviews the results of these analyses are being integrated into large_scale datasets annotating each variant with the allele_frequency in various populations and enabling demographic and association studies simultaneously hts has also revolutionized functional_genomics where the ability to sequence rna and dna to extremely_high coverage has made possible rna_seq and chip_seq methodologies that help discover rare rna_transcripts identify the location of transcription_factor on the genome as well as discover the locations of nucleosomes rna_seq and chip_seq also consist of many reads aligned to a reference_genome which are then binned and analyzed for peaks that indicate putative_transcription and exons respectively additionally anomalously mapped_reads or pairs from rna_seq experiments can suggest alternative_splicing or fusion_transcripts the capacity of new sequencing_technologies to generate huge volumes of raw_sequence has made its analysis a substantial informatics challenge sequencing_machines typically output_files containing a nucleotide_sequence and quality values for each read which can be tens to hundreds of gigabytes in size due to the sheer number of reads sequenced in a single run these files can be easily parsed line by line by downstream computer programs because of their structured textual format but are not intended for direct manual or visual_analysis while downstream_analysis programs such as read_mappers snp callers and peak_finders can identify regions of interest to the bench scientist a visual_analysis of the supporting data as well as other orthogonal information is usually warranted before costly wetlab experiments are performed to confirm the biological validity of the prediction visualization of genomic_data gives researchers the benefit of looking at information in a more natural and interpretable way compared with a textual representation there are many different tasks that are facilitated by visualization including i integration of multiple related datasets into a single view to gain insight into the interaction between genomic_features ii algorithm development where visualization of many putative calls e g genomic_variants promoter sites intronexon boundaries etc helps with debugging and identification of true and false_positives and iii exploration of various genomic_regions for specific signatures of functional sites that may be difficult to describe within a computer program e g two closely_spaced peaks in chip_seq indicating adjacentbinding sites without the convenience of a visualization_tool in each of these settings all regions of interest would have to be painstakingly considered via manual_analysis of the supporting data a number of tools have been developed for visualizing genomebased annotations the ucsc and ensembl genome_browsers for example are popular online tools that have traditionally been used to display various biological_datasets such as genomic_variants expressed_sequence ests and functional genomic_data in the context of high_quality manually_curated annotations while both have been recently updated to support display of hts_data their use for this purpose is onerous because i a large amount of locally stored data must be uploaded to servers across the internet ii once uploaded the data being visualized cannot easily be manipulated or computed with and iii server side browsers are typically slow and non interactive other visualization programs such as the integrative_genomics artemis and tablet http www broadinstitute org igv are designed to run on conventional desktop computers and thus make use of local storage capacity and computing_resources to overcome the shortcomings of web_based browsers while these popular browsers allow for interactive_visualization of hts_data they have limited analytic capability and are not extensible through user contributed modules a substantial barrier for researchers who use genomic visualization_tools for all types of data is the disconnect between the processes of visualization and computerintensive analyses a void which is caused by visualization_tools being programmatically inaccessible here we introduce savant the sequence_annotation visualization and analysis tool which combines visualization of hts and other genome based data with powerful analytic tools the savant feature_set summarized in was guided by three key design principles i ease of use users can easily install the application obtain and load data and navigate to specific regions of interest the general layout of data mirrors the standard genome_browsers to shorten the learning_curve ii speed and efficiency the program quickly and dynamically sifts through very large_datasets while maintaining a reasonable memory_footprint iii access and extensibility the underlying data is readily_accessible from within the tool itself and users can extend the application by adding any number of plug_ins for specific tasks
