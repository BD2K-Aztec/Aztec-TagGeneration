structural_bioinformatics inclusion of dyad repeat pattern improves topology prediction of transmembrane b barrel proteins accurate topology prediction of transmembrane b barrels is still an open question here we present boctopus an improved topology prediction method for transmembrane b barrels that can also identify the barrel domain predict the topology and identify the orientation of residues in transmembrane b strands the major novelty of boctopus is the use of the dyad repeat pattern of lipid and pore facing residues observed in transmembrane b barrels in a cross_validation test on a benchmark set of proteins boctopus predicts the correct topology in of the proteins an improvement of more than over the best earlier method boctopus and in addition it produces significantly_fewer erroneous predictions on non transmembrane b barrel proteins availability_and boctopus webserver along with full dataset and source codetransmembrane b barrels tmbs are located in the outer_membranes of bacteria chloroplasts and mitochondria and are involved in transport of substrates across the cell_membrane also they are key components of translocation complexes bacterial tmbs consist of an even number of anti_parallel b strands that are surrounded by long outer loops and short inner loops eukaryotic tmbs can have an odd number of strands the residues located in transmembrane b strands follow a dyad repeat pattern where alternating residues face the lipids and the pore region respectively boctopus a previously_published two stage tmb topology predictor did not predict the lipid pore facing orientation of residues in the transmembrane b strands but boctopus does the use of this information improves topology predictions boctopus predicts the correct topology for proteins out of proteins this is better than other methods and in addition the performances of all earlier methods are possibly overestimated as some of the proteins have been used in their training_sets supplementary_information one main_reason for the improved results is that the filter in boctopus avoids incorrect prediction of strands in the non barrel region this filter also aids discrimination between tmbs and non tmbs in a dataset of non tmbs and tmbs boctopus predicts three or more strands in of the tmbs at a specificity of supplementary amongst the methods tested here only hhomp and betaware have a higher mathews correlation_coefficient mcc for barrel non barrel discrimination supplementary the detection of eukaryotic tmbs seems to be more difficult as boctopus only detects out of possibly due to different evolutionary_origins supplementary table s comparison of topology prediction_methods topology number of proteins with the correct topology tm number of proteins with correct number of predicted strands sov is the segment overlap q is the two state membrane not membrane prediction_accuracy and q is the three state membrane inner loop outer loop prediction_accuracy q the four state lipid facing pore facing inner loop outer loop accuracy for boctopus is boctopus results are cross_validated while all other methods have included some of the proteins in their training_set the two last columns tpr and fpr describe the true and false_positive in the discrimination dataset boctopus proftmb pred tmbb betaware hhomp and f w b barrel analyzer results were obtained using standalone versions we present boctopus an improved topology predictor for tmbs that exploits the dyad repeat feature of bacterial tmbs to identify transmembrane b strands boctopus can also identify the transmembrane barrel domain in long_sequences and predict the correct topology in proteins in our dataset further boctopus predicts the lipid facing or pore facing status of residues in identified b strands we have recently shown that accurate topology and residue orientation prediction is beneficial for d modelling of tmbs
