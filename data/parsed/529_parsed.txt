gene_expression assign context specific genomic_profiling of multiple heterogeneous biological_pathways motivation although gene_expression based biomarkers are often developed for clinical_diagnosis many promising signatures fail to replicate during validation one major_challenge is that biological_samples used to generate and validate the signature are often from heterogeneous_biological contextscontrolled or in vitro samples may be used to generate the signature but patient samples may be used for validation in addition systematic technical biases from multiple genome profiling platforms often mask true biological_variation addressing such challenges will enable us to better elucidate disease mechanisms and provide improved guidance for personalized therapeutics results here we present a pathway profiling toolkit adaptive signature selection and integration assign which enables robust and context specific pathway analyses by efficiently capturing pathway activity in heterogeneous sets of samples and across profiling technologies the assign framework is based on a flexible bayesian factor_analysis approach that allows for simultaneous profiling of multiple correlated pathways and for the adaptation of pathway signatures into specific disease we demonstrate the robustness and versatility of assign in estimating pathway activity in simulated_data cell_lines perturbed pathways and in primary tissues samples including the cancer_genome breast carcinoma_samples and liver_samples exposed to geno toxic carcinogens availability_and software for our approach is available for download at since the advent_of genomic_profiling technologies such as gene_expression and rna_seq many computational and statistical_methods have been developed to derive gene_expression for disease diagnosis prognosis and treatment_decisions gene_expression are often used as surrogate representations of pathway activation or deactivation the use of v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com expression signatures to quantify pathway activation level has been particularly important for dissecting the complexity of diseases and providing guidelines of targeted_therapeutics to date gene_expression based pathway analyses mainly face two sources of challenges i limited pathway annotations in curated databases and ii ineffective analysis tools in reference to the first limitation many public_databases provide manually_curated pathways that associate genes lists with pathway activity however genes in those predefined pathways are not always associated with gene_expression changes that differ between disease_states for example some genes in an annotated pathway might be activated through changes in phosphorylation or protein interaction status thus pathway analysis approaches that use patient gene_expression without careful_selection for expression based signature genes with transcriptional change may lead to incorrect results an alternative way to infer pathway activity is by experimentally perturbing the pathway of interest in controlled settings and projecting the associated molecular_signature e g changes in gene_expression onto patient or other target samples to estimate pathway activity levels for example previous_efforts have generated gene_expression for growth_factor signaling_pathways in human primary cells and then used the signatures to predict disease_prognosis and drug_sensitivity in human cancer cohorts although these pathway profiling approaches have been previously shown to generate empirical gene_expression based pathway response signatures the assumption of homogeneity between in vitro e g perturbation samples and in vivo e g patient biological conditions does not always hold due to platform tissue or disease deregulation status variations in effort to address the second concern factor_analysis approaches have been used to identify latent_factors metagenes associated with pathways and clinical_outcome however it is often difficult_to the biological meaning of the latent_factors identified by these unsupervised approaches or to estimate the absolute activation level for pathways of interest supervised_classification approaches often model pathways one at a time without accounting for pathway correlation or interaction between related pathways moreover supervised_classification approaches require expression data from pathway perturbation experiments for building up models thus often fail to work when only pathway gene_lists are available so_far none of these existing_approaches adequately account for tissue disease or context specificity in assessing gene_expression regulated via pathway activation or deactivation furthermore none of them are designed to profile genomic_signatures across multiple genomic_profiling platforms to overcome_these we propose a novel and flexible pathway profiling toolkit called adaptive signature selection and integration assign assign relies on a sparse bayesian factor_analysis method to estimate the activation_status of pathways under investigation such as oncogenic_pathways immune_response pathways or drug response pathways in individual samples of a genomic dataset for predicting optimal treatment prior to any medication on patients here we use multiple simulated_and to demonstrate the validity and robustness of assign in estimating pathway activation in simulated_data the model correctly adapts the pathway signature gene_lists in specific biological_contexts by excluding irrelevant genes or including relevant_genes into signatures we used five previously_published oncogenic signaling_pathway signatures to demonstrate the advantages of modeling multiple pathways in concert to account for crosstalk among the pathways we also used the tumor_samples from the cancer_genome tcga to show that assign can robustly combine in vitro signatures generated using one profiling platform with tumor_samples profiled using a different platform finally we used profiling data generated from liver_tissues exposed to genotoxic hepatocarcinogens to demonstrate the versatility of assign in identifying and adapting signatures from precurated pathway gene_lists overall assign uses a semi_supervised approach that results in more biologically interpretable pathway activation profiles that are adapted to specific tissues or disease contexts as opposed to more rigid and less interpretable profiles generated by previous_approaches although assign was initially designed for pathway based analysis from gene_expression data it can easily be extended to other profiling data types such as dna variation or methylation data to overcome challenges from pathway cross_talk and heterogeneity from biological and technical sources we developed the assign toolkit that allows for flexible profiling of multiple correlated signatures into specific disease tissue and patient contexts here we demonstrate the features of assign using simulation cross_validation and several publicly_available genomic_datasets in section we use three simulated scenarios to evaluate the models abilities to estimate pathway activation_status and filter irrelevant genes in sections and we illustrate assigns ability to account for context specific background_levels and to crosstalk among multiple pathways in section we evaluate the effectiveness of assign to overcome cross tissue and cross_platform obstacles to estimates pathway activity in a large breast_carcinoma dataset in section we adapt curated signatures of dna_damage pathways to estimate pathway signature strength in liver profiling samples in these sections we compare assign in multiple contexts with existing_methods such as gsea ssgsea bfrm and facpad and demonstrate a general advantage of assign over these existing_approaches
