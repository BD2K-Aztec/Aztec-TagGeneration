genome_analysis triovis a visualization approach for filtering genomic_variants of parent_child trios triovis is a visual_analytics tool developed for filtering on coverage and variant frequency for genomic_variants from exome_sequencing of parentchild trios in triovis the variant data are organized by grouping each variant based on the laws of mendelian_inheritance taking three variant_call files as input triovis allows the user to test different coverage thresholds i e different levels of stringency to find the optimal threshold_values tailored to their hypotheses and to gain insights into the global effects of filtering through interaction availability executables source_code and sample data are available at https bitbucket org biovizleuven triovis screencast is available atrecent advances in massively_parallel especially sequencing of the entire protein_coding portion of the genome exome have introduced new strategies for identifying mendelian disease genes analysis of parentchild trios is one of the strategies for identifying single pathogenic_mutations among the thousands to millions of genomic_variants by sequencing the patient as well as his or her parents variants can be filtered based on consistency or inconsistency according to the laws of mendelian_inheritance although filtering based on inheritance pattern seems to be straight_forward distinguishing true variation from artefacts and false_negatives while retaining sensitivity is a challenging_task because of the sequencing_error and the interdependency of sequencing quality for multiple samples a previous study reported that of mendelian inconsistencies were found to be false_negatives because of the failure to call the germ_line variant in either parent sample in search for de_novo mutations similarly we found that the majority of variants were consistent with the mendelian laws when we analysed those variants that are in common between the exome_sequencing and an snp_genotyping array for a trio case data not shown one of the metrics commonly used to filter variants is the depth of coverage researchers we interviewed adjust the coverage threshold based on the overall coverage and their intuition without any visual aids the optimal coverage thresholds also depend on other factors such as the suspected type of mutation whether somatic or inherited and the stringency of analysis although finding the optimal coverage threshold can be automated to some extent it still requires fine adjustments of the filtering setting for variant discovery we present a visual_analytics tool triovis designed to help the analytical reasoning process of setting coverage thresholds to filter variants from parentchild trio sequencing_experiments it visualizes variants in a structured table and provides interactive visual interfaces to let the researcher dynamically and interactively test different threshold settings and change levels of stringency triovis provides an interactive interface and optimization function to calibrate coverage thresholds based on mendelian_inheritance laws for parentchild trio cases by visualizing variants in a novel table layout based on the inheritance laws it allows the researcher to gain insights into the global effect of filtering in the context of trio analysis the researcher can export the filtered result as vcf files for subsequent analysis to annotate variants to genes using annotation tools such as annotate it and annovar future work includes improving the optimization_algorithm and integration of this tool into functional_annotation tools such as annotate it and galaxy
