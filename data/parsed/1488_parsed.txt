drug set enrichment_analysis a novel tool to investigate drug mode of action motivation automated screening approaches are able to rapidly_identify a set of small_molecules inducing a desired phenotype from large small_molecule libraries however the resulting set of candidate molecules is usually very diverse pharmacologically thus little insight on the shared mechanism of action moa underlying their efficacy can be gained results we introduce a computational_method drug set enrichment analysisdsea based on drug_induced gene_expression which is able to identify the molecular_pathways that are targeted by most of the drugs in the set by diluting drug specific effects unrelated to the phenotype of interest dsea is able to highlight phenotype specific pathways thus helping to formulate hypotheses on the moa shared by the drugs in the set we validated the method by analysing five different drug sets related to well known pharmacological classes we then applied dsea to identify the moa shared by drugs known to be partially_effective in rescuing mutant cystic_fibrosis cftr gene function in cystic_fibrosis availability_and the method is implemented as an online web_tool publicly_available at http dsea tigem it large collections of small_molecules can be automatically screened against a desired phenotypic effect automated experimental screening approaches include high_content hcs and high_throughput hts with different advantages and limitations and a screening capacity that ranges from thousands to millions of compounds per assay screening assays can be performed either to identify lead_compounds binding a specific molecular target or inducing a specific phenotype of interest a common drawback of automated molecular screening is the opacity of the hit compound selection mechanism indeed the set of positive hits following an hts or hcs typically includes small_molecules with unknown mode of action moa or whose moa are so different from each other that no hint on the shared molecular_mechanisms their efficacy can be gained the difficulty in characterizing a set of screening hits resides in the complexity of their interactions within the cell molecules binding the same molecular target can induce different phenotypes caused by unknown off targets on the contrary molecules binding different targets can induce the same phenotype when they act in the same pathway nonetheless among the heterogeneous effects induced by the hit compounds in the cell there could exist a common mechanism responsible for their efficacy in the screening selection here we introduce a new method named drug set enrichment_analysis dsea that aims at identifying the mechanism s of action shared by a set of compounds in terms of the molecular_pathways targeted by all or most of them
