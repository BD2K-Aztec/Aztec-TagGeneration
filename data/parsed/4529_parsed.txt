data_and target align a tool for plant microrna target_identification motivation micrornas mirnas are important regulatory_molecules a critical step in elucidating mirna function is identifying potential mirna_targets however few reliable tools have been developed for identifying mirna_targets in plants results here we developed a smithwaterman like alignment_tool in order to accurately_predict mirna_targets dynamic_programming was used to build a score matrix based on the complementarity of nucleotides in order to trace the optimal local_alignments important parameters such as maximum mismatches and maximum consecutive mismatches between mirnas and their targets were also used for filtering the optimal local_alignments almost all of the parameters in this alignment_tool can be adjusted by users compared to other target prediction_tools target align exhibits strong sensitivity and accuracy for identifying mirna_targets more importantly target align can identify multi target_sites as well potential for non cleaved targets sites by change the default_settings windows web and command_line versions were developed to better serve different users micrornas mirnas are an extensive class of small regulatory_molecules that post_transcriptionally regulate_gene by either cleaving mrna_transcripts or by repressing protein_translation currently a total of mirnas have been deposited in the mirna database mirbase of these are from plants although increasing evidences have demonstrated that mirnas play_important in plant_growth the functions of the majority of these mirnas remains_unknown mainly due to a lack of knowledge of mirna_targets although many computational_tools have been developed for predicting animal mirna_targets few tools are available for identifying plant mirna_targets there are currently three tools miru helper tools and tapir available for predicting plant mirna_targets however these programs have a limited set of options that allow the user to adjust the search_criteria previous_studies demonstrated that most plant mirnas
