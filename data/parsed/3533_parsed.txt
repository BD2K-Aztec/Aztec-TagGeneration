databases_and phisto pathogen host_interaction search tool knowledge of pathogenhost protein interactions is required to better understand infection mechanisms the pathogen host_interaction search tool phisto is a web accessible platform that provides relevant_information about pathogenhost interactions phis it enables access to the most up to date phi data for all pathogen types for which experimentally_verified protein interactions with human are available the platform also offers integrated tools for visu_alization of phi networks graphtheoretical analysis of targeted human proteins blast_search and text_mining for detecting missing experimental methods phisto will facilitate phi studies that provide potential_therapeutic for infectious_diseases the interactions between the proteins of infectious microorganisms pathogens and their human_hosts allow the microorganisms to manipulate human cellular_mechanisms to their own advantage resulting in infection in the host organism the recent_advances in high_throughput protein interaction detection methods have led to the production of large_scale interspecies protein_protein ppi data of pathogenhuman systems currently there are a number of pathogenhost interaction phi resources that are specific to some pathogens the only available resource to access all phi data in a single database does not offer any additional functionality to analyze phi networks we have developed pathogen host_interaction search tool phisto to serve as an up to date and functionally enhanced source of phi data through a userfriendly interface phis in phisto are imported from several ppi databases using the psicquic tool text_mining is used to label phis extracted without any information on interaction detection method tools for visualization of small phi networks and graphtheoretical analysis of targeted human proteins may enable users to gain crucial insights on infection mechanisms the blast interface offers to search for orthologous phis for pathogens lacking experimental_data with regular monthly data updates and complete coverage of all data available for each pathogen type phisto will always provide unified access to up to date phi data otherwise gathering such information would require careful and tedious data_integration to our knowledge phisto is the first phi tool that uses text_mining to identify the interaction detection methods of phis that have not been originally annotated with such information additionally phi results visualized as a bipartite_graph allow users to capture phi mechanisms i e most connected pathogen host_proteins can be easily observed at a glance the sequence_search option blast makes it possible to retrieve homologous phis after homolog pathogen proteins in phisto are found interacting human protein_partners of the homolog proteins may be assigned as putative interactors for the protein under investigation finally the distributions of degree and betweenness_centrality values in the graph analysis tool give crucial insights on attacking strategies of pathogens during infections our goal with phisto is to provide a centralized and up to date platform for studying pathogenhost protein interaction systems with future curation of phis from literature by text_mining and additional advanced analysis tools for phi networks funding bog aziciazici university research funds project d marie curie fp reintegration grants ekin kimya tic ltd s ti and elginkan foundation conflict of interest none declared
