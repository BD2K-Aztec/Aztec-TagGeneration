tapas tools to assist the targeted protein quantification of human alternative_splice motivation in proteomes of higher_eukaryotes many alternative_splice can only be detected by their shared peptides this makes it highly_challenging to use peptide centric mass_spectrometry to distinguish and to quantify protein isoforms resulting from alternative_splicing results we have developed two complementary algorithms based on linear mathematical_models to efficiently compute a minimal set of shared and unique peptides needed to quantify a set of isoforms and splice_variants further we developed a statistical_method to estimate the splice_variant abundances based on stable_isotope peptide quantities the algorithms and databases are integrated in a web_based and we have experimentally tested the limits of our quantification_method using spiked proteins and cell_extracts availability_and the tapas server is available athigher eukaryotic proteomes have greatly expanded during evolution by the variation created by alternatively_spliced forms of the same gene duplication into orthologous_genes and differentially processed proteins these multiple protein isoforms play significant roles in differentiation development and disease high_throughput genomic transcriptomic and mass_spectrometry ms technologies have facilitated the genome_wide identification of alternative_splicing it was shown that shifts in the relative splice transcript_abundance between different cells and tissues are more frequently observed than all or none switch like behaviors thus knowing the amount of an expressed splice_variant is highly_desirable to understand cellular_functions peptide centric high_throughput shotgun ms approaches have achieved remarkable detection coverage however inferring protein isoform identities and estimating their abundances by peptide centric shotgun ms is not straightforward as many peptides are shared between isoforms recently statistical_methods have addressed these problems by using both unique and shared peptides while these methods have improved protein quantifications from peptide intensities they were not specifically_designed for a targeted ms approach of isoform analysis in this work we developed efficient computational optimization techniques to infer a minimal list of unique and shared peptides needed to accurately quantify a set of isoforms this algorithm is integrated in a web_based tapas that assists in the design of stable_isotope sil peptides for targeted ms experiments experiments it uses a numerical optimization method implemented in the stans c framework to find the desired solution i e the quantities of splice_variants by minimizing the gaps between the estimated and observed abundances of peptides equation where a i is the abundance of peptide i and k is the estimated amount of splice_variant k i k is indicator function that gives when peptide i belongs to splice_variant k otherwise it gives zero n xj represents probability of x from normal distribution function with mean and sd to estimate the protein abundances of selected splicing variants tapas requires the observed abundance of peptides identification of peptidases and splice_variant sequences as inputs validation of the quantification_method we tested our method with a simulation dataset modeled by lognormal distributions tapas quickly converged to a solution and gave robust results on different simulations conditions moreover we found that tapas accurately estimated amount of splice_variants from experimentally_measured peptides amounts the average_percentage of error in the estimated amounts of splice_variants was we validated our computational_approach by purifying and mixing two grb splice_variants and performing absolute quantitation of both splice_variants using selected_reaction srm based on sil reference peptides supplementary_material estimation of quantifiable splice_variants through a systematic analysis of databases with ms detected peptides mostly of trypsin origin we theoretically estimated that of the human isoforms and splice_variants could be quantifiable this number goes up to if multiple specific_proteases are independently used and the results are combined supplementary_material
