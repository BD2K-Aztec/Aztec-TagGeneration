genome_analysis jetta junction and exon toolkits for transcriptome_analysis high_throughput genome_wide studies of alternatively_spliced mrna_transcripts have become increasingly important in clinical research consequently easy to use software_tools are required to process data from these studies for example using exon and junction arrays here we introduce jetta an integrated software_package for the calculation of gene_expression indices as well as the identification and visualization of alternative_splicing we demonstrate the software using data of human liver and muscle samples hybridized on an exonjunction array availability jetta and its demonstrations are freely_available atrecent developments of high_throughput such as exonjunction arrays and rna_seq have extended transcriptome_studies in biomedical_research beyond the scope of gene_expression these genomic platforms enable the genome_wide measurements of alternative_splicing as the process by which individual exons of the same gene are spliced to produce different isoforms of mrna_transcripts in clinical samples and animal disease_models this in turn requires computational algorithms and software_tools for data analyses and visualization we have developed an integrated software_package jetta that provides a one stop solution for gene_expression and as analyses of microarray_data from raw data_files to visualization the software provides many options for array normalization probe selection background correction expression index computation as detection and data visualization it can also be potentially utilized for as detections from rna_seq here we describe jetta in an analysis of human liver and muscle_tissues assayed on a custom exonjunction gg h array
