systems_biology gemsirv a software platform for genome_scale model_simulation reconstruction and visualization motivation genome_scale models have become an indispensable part of the increasingly important field of systems_biology metabolic systems_biology studies usually include three major componentsnetwork model construction objective and experiment guided model editing and visualization and simulation_studies based mainly on flux balance analyses bioinformatics_tools are required to facilitate these complicated analyses although some of the required functions have been served separately by existing_tools a free software resource that simultaneously serves the needs of the three major components is not yet available results here we present a software platform gemsirv genome_scale model_simulation reconstruction and visualization to provide functionalities of easy metabolic_network drafting and editing amenable network_visualization for experimental data_integration and flux_balance tools for simulation_studies gemsirv comes with downloadable ready to use public_domain metabolic_models reference metabolite reaction databases and metabolic_network maps all of which can be input into gemsirv as the starting_materials for network construction or simulation analyses furthermore all of the gemsirv generated metabolic_models and analysis results including projects in progress can be easily exchanged in the research_community gemsirv is a powerful integrative resource that may facilitate the development of systems_biology studies availability the software is freely_available on the web atgenome scale metabolic_networks gems are important for understanding systems level cellular_behaviors these networks have been successfully_applied to the studies of bacteria evolution metabolic_engineering biological network_analysis and generation and validation of novel biochemical hypotheses with the growing availability of complete_genomes the number of gems is expected to increase rapidly however the genome_scale reconstructions have been progressing at a slow pace recently a web_based resource model seed was built to speed up the construction of new gems by generating functional draft models on the basis of genomic_sequences while gems can be generated automatically through the model seed platform an alternative bottom up approach has been highly_regarded and widely_applied over the last decade because of its expert_opinion reinforced accuracy and iterative refinements that integrate both computational and experimental advantages however a user_friendly that accommodates the requirements of the bottom up approach which includes recursive model refinements that go back_and between computational and experimental analyses remains unavailable for example the researchers may wish to incorporate gene_expression data into the metabolic_network by shutting down the reactions of which the responsible genes are not expressed this function as far as we understand has not been provided by any existing_tools furthermore tools that integrate functionalities of both gem reconstruction and subsequent computational_analyses are very rare an important application of gems is flux_balance fba fba simultaneously monitors hundreds to thousands of biological_reactions and yields the integrated outputs of a single_cell according to the stoichiometric matrix and the biological physicochemical constraints that are imposed on the gem of interest a limited number of software_tools and packages have been developed to enable fba thus allowing quantitative_prediction of cellular metabolisms examples_include acorn biomet toolbox cellnetanalyzer cobra fba simvis model seed optflux and sbrt however none of these tools has the dual_function of fba and gem reconstruction meanwhile free_and reconstruction tools including metannogen and metnetmaker provide an environment for constructing metabolic_networks based on the kegg_database yet these tools can neither perform fba simulations nor import existing_models for further curations although yanasquare is an integrated network_reconstruction visualization and analysis tool it cannot perform fba furthermore the major data resource of these tools the kegg_database may include metabolicgemsirv consists of three main modules i metabolic network_reconstruction module ii simulation module and iii visualization module it allows importing editing simulation analyses and visualization of gems
