bindnase a discriminatory approach for transcription_factor binding prediction using dnase_i data motivation transcription_factors tfs are a class of dna_binding that have a central role in regulating gene_expression to reveal mechanisms of transcriptional_regulation a number of computational_tools have been proposed for predicting tf_dna sites recent_studies that genome_wide sequencing_data on open chromatin sites from a dnase_i experiments dnase_seq has a great_potential to map putative_binding of all transcription_factors in a single experiment thus computational_methods for analysing dnase_seq to accurately map tf_dna sites are highly needed results here we introduce a novel discriminative algorithm bindnase for predicting tf_dna sites using dnase_seq data bindnase implements an efficient method for selecting and extracting informative features from dnase_i signal for each tf either at single_nucleotide or for larger regions the method is applied to transcription_factors in cell_line k and transcription_factors in cell_line using data from the encode_project first we show that bindnase compares favourably to other supervised and unsupervised methods developed for tf_dna prediction using dnase_seq data we demonstrate the importance to model each tf with a separate prediction model reflecting tf specific dna accessibility around the tf_dna site we also show that a highly standardised dnase_seq data pre_processing is a requisite for accurate tf_binding predictions and that sequencing_depth has on average only a moderate effect on prediction_accuracy finally bindnases binding predictions generalise to other cell_types thus making bindnase a versatile_tool for accurate tf_binding prediction transcriptional_regulation is largely controlled by transcription_factors tfs that bind short dna_sequence in gene_promoters enhancers and other regulatory_sites many tfs bind_dna in a sequence specific_manner and understanding tf_binding is integral to understanding gene_regulatory moreover changes in the genomic_dna such as snps at tf_dna sites can affect tf_binding and can contribute to phenotypic_differences including gene_expression but can also contribute to various diseases determining the locations of tf_binding is therefore of high importance commonly used computational strategies for predicting tfbinding include dna_motif based prediction of tf_binding and simultaneous analysis of dna motifs and histone_modification data e g or dnase_i experiments followed by sequencing dnase_seq the current state of art method for genomewide profiling of tf_binding is chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq chip_seq can however map the positions of only one tf per experiment and requires a specific chip grade antibody for the protein of interest on the contrary dnase_seq detects signal at open chromatin sites genome_wide consequently dnase_seq is increasingly used to complement chipseq experiments because a single dnase_seq experiment can provide_valuable about putative tf_dna sites for all tfs genome_wide maps of putative regulatory_sites in selected cell_types detected using dnase_seq data have already been created e g in the encode_project currently the exact locations of tf binding_events are pinpointed by finding stereotypic dnase_i footprints these footprints are short genomic_locations of low dnase_i cleavage_activity immediately flanked by high dnase activity an illustration of such regulatory_site is shown inwhere the atf motif locations within chip_seq are characterised with low dnase activity and the flanking_regions exhibit high dnase activity finding stereotypic dnase_i footprints does not require any information about the dnase_i signal at the true binding_sites and therefore many methods using this definition of a tf footprint are unsupervised methods it should also be acknowledged that these algorithms are transcription_factor agnostic as they can only predict whether any tf is bound to a given site it has however been reported in that for some proteins nucleotides in the middle of tf dna interface are exposed to dnase_i cleavage therefore treating all the nucleotides as protected in the tf dna interface might not be adequate the exposed nucleotides differ between tfs and this high_resolution information might be useful for making more accurate_predictions and distinguishing which tfs actually occupy the sites most of the currently used methods developed for identifying footprints use the canonical definition of dnase footprints of low dnase activity flanked by high activity these methods can be supervised millipede in which the predictions are made using models trained on training data or unsupervised which rely on giving tfs binding scores according to a model devised without training data some unsupervised methods such as centipede and piq include nucleotide_resolution information on the other hand a recent paper shows that the nucleotide_resolution dnase_i cleavage pattern is partly caused by the intrinsic sequence bias of the dnase molecule suggesting that the nucleotide_resolution dnase_seq signal at the tf_dna site does not necessarily provide predictive_power to distinguish real binding_sites moreover dnase_i footprint signal at individual genomic_locations are noisy as illustrated in it is therefore difficult to tell which signals in the dnase_seq data are informative about tf_binding and which signals are either noise or caused by the intrinsic sequence bias consequently carefully_designed computational_methods are needed for dnase_seq data_processing having the aforementioned characteristics of dnase_seq data in mind here we study the use of high_resolution dnase_seq data for predicting tf_binding we chose to treat the tf_binding prediction_problem as a supervised_classification task because this approach lets us utilize the true differences in the dnase signal between the bound and unbound sites in the model training we develop a method bindnase which for each tf automatically extracts features from the dnase_seq data which maximally discriminate bound and unbound genomic_locations by comparing bindnase with state of the art tf_binding prediction_methods we show that bindnase provides more accurate_predictions than other methods although this study focuses on making predictions with dnase_seq data the method is readily_applicable to other data types such as faire seq or atac seq
