fast stochastic algorithm for simulating evolutionary population_dynamics motivation many important aspects of evolutionary_dynamics can only be addressed through simulations however accurate simulations of realistically large populations over long_periods of time needed for evolution to proceed are computationally_expensive mutants can be present in very small numbers and yet if they are more fit than others be the key part of the evolutionary_process this leads to significant stochasticity that needs to be accounted for different evolutionary_events occur at very different time scales mutations are typically much rarer than reproduction and deaths results we introduce a new exact algorithm for fast fully stochastic_simulations of evolutionary_dynamics that include birth death and mutation_events it produces a significant speedup compared to direct stochastic_simulations in a typical case when the population_size is large and the mutation_rates are much smaller than birth and death_rates the algorithm performance is illustrated by several examples that include evolution on a smooth and rugged fitness_landscape we also show how this algorithm can be adapted for approximate simulations of more complex evolutionary problems and illustrate it by simulations of a stochastic competitive growth model natural_evolution is an inherently stochastic_process of population_dynamics driven by mutations and selection and the details of such evolutionary_dynamics are increasingly becoming accessible via experimental_investigation the importance of stochasticity comes from the fact that populations are always finite mutations are random and rare and at least initially new mutants are present in small numbers this realization prompted intensive studies of stochastic effects in evolutionary_dynamics most of the models in these studies consider a reproducing population of individuals which are endowed with to whom correspondence should be addressed genomes that can mutate and thus affect either reproduction or death_rate as with the classical wrightfisher and moran models which describe a fixed population of replicating individuals specific models vary in the details of fitness calculation and mutation rules but recent theoretical_studies of even relatively simple models lead to non trivial predictions on the rate of evolution as a function of the population_size and the details of the fitness_landscape however the complexity of more realistic evolutionary_models makes them analytically intractable and requires researchers to resort to direct numerical_simulations in order to gain quantitative_understanding of underlying dynamics on the most basic level an evolutionary_process is a markov_chain of discrete reactions of birth deaths and mutations within a population of individuals a direct and exact way of computing individual evolutionary_trajectories is to use the stochastic_simulation ssa or its variants in which birth death and mutation_events are treated as markovian reactions unfortunately for realistically large population_sizes direct stochastic_simulation of even simple models becomes prohibitively_expensive hence there is an acute need for developing accelerated methods of stochastic_simulations of evolutionary_processes such methods usually involve approximations to the exact stochastic_process based on certain small or large parameters that characterize the problem for example population_size or mutation_rates several approximate_methods have been developed in recent_years in the context of stochastic biochemical kinetics recently proposed an approximate hybrid algorithm suitable for simulation of evolutionary_dynamics by combining the leap algorithm appropriate for abundant sub populations that do not change their sizes much between individual events and the direct ssa algorithm for small sub populations this method allows one to use large time steps during which multiple_birth and death reactions may have occurred however it slows down dramatically after a new mutant has been produced since the algorithm resorts to the direct ssa for all events in which the new mutants are involved until the population of the new mutant class reaches a pre defined threshold in this article we have proposed an algorithm which can be used to sample exactly co evolving species that do not interact between mutations and faithfully approximate the evolution of weakly interacting_species bnb algorithm not only accounts for the stochastic_fluctuations that arise due to the random nature of genetic_mutations but it also accounts for the small number fluctuations due to the growth of new species that are spawned as single cells each iteration of the bnb algorithm generates the time of the next mutation and the abundances of all species just after the mutation this algorithm is exact when the birth death and mutation_rates do not change between consecutive mutations although similar in spirit to approximate leaping schemes developed for modeling stiff stochastic chemical kinetics it differs_significantly
