m path a compass for navigating potential metabolic_pathways motivation construction of synthetic metabolic_pathways promises sustainable production of diverse chemicals and materials to design synthetic metabolic_pathways of high value computational_methods are needed to expand present knowledge by mining comprehensive chemical and enzymatic information databases several computational_methods have been already reported for the metabolic_pathway design but until now computation complexity has limited the diversity of chemical and enzymatic data used results we introduce a computational platform m path to explore synthetic metabolic_pathways including putative enzymatic_reactions and compounds m path is an iterative random algorithm which makes efficient use of chemical and enzymatic databases to find potential synthetic metabolic_pathways m path can readily control the search_space and perform well compared with exhaustively enumerating possible pathways a web_based pathway viewer is also developed to check extensive metabolic_pathways with evaluation scores on the basis of chemical similarities we further produce extensive synthetic metabolic_pathways for a comprehensive set of alpha amino_acids the scalable nature of m path enables us to calculate potential metabolic_pathways for any given chemicals availability_and the web_tool and viewer are available for free atrecent developments in synthetic_biology and metabolic_engineering have led to the construction of synthetic metabolic_pathways for efficient_production of various natural and non natural chemicals synthetic metabolic_pathways have been mostly constructed by heterologous_expression of natural or non natural enzymes to catalytically convert metabolites into target chemicals and intermediates knowledge bases of enzymatic_reactions and metabolic_pathways provide troves of information to find key enzymes and to identify heterologous enzymes from orthologous_genes in different organisms new enzymatic_activities can also be engineered by comparing as databases of enzymatic_reactions and compounds have increased in size computational_methods have become necessary to identify the key enzymatic reaction_steps for efficient synthetic_pathway design there are two major computational_approaches in designing synthetic metabolic_pathways one is solely dependent on experimentally_verified information of enzymes and reactions in current knowledge bases synthetic_pathways can be designed using a network search from starting to target_compounds these methods are effective in finding known heterologous enzymatic_reactions but ignore any pathway with an unknown reaction step another approach is based on chemical_structures reaction rules are derived from the chemical_structures of substrates and products in known enzymatic_reactions and applied to produce possible metabolic_pathways including putative compounds and enzymatic_reactions this approach can suggest previously_unknown enzymatic_reactions in synthetic metabolic_pathways however the space of possible solutions grows quickly when considering the size of reaction and compound data that is contained in modern databases previous methods for synthetic_pathway design have been limited to a small number of either reactions or compounds to avoid combinatorial explosion these methods may overlook the importance of rare or poorly_characterized enzymatic_reactions or unknown metabolites here we introduce a computational platform m path for synthetic_pathway design which makes efficient use of extensive enzymatic_reaction and chemical compound databases we developed an iterative random algorithm to design possible synthetic metabolic_pathways m path could control the search_space in finding potential synthetic metabolic_pathways to a given chemical a web_based was developed to check extensive metabolic_pathways by ranking scores based on chemical similarities and suggests enzymes to be engineered m path further allows us to compute putative synthetic metabolic_pathways for a set of given chemicals we chose alpha amino_acid compounds from the pubchem database to predict possible metabolic_pathways and found about putative metabolic_pathways for compounds we present the m path platform to explore latent synthetic metabolic_pathways of putative compounds and reactions to expand the scope of metabolic_pathways to find possible metabolic_pathways for any given chemicals one needs to consider the tradeoff between computational feasibility and the size of chemical and reaction data specifically the successful design of synthetic metabolic_pathways based on reaction rules is highly dependent on how chemicals and reactions are represented in m path the representation of chemicals and reactions in the form of feature_vectors enables us to make efficient use of extensive chemical and reaction data the reaction feature_vectors have the ability to cover all enzymatic_reactions from kegg_database and differentiate them on the basis of the chemical_structures even though the abstraction of chemical_structures to chemical feature_vectors ignores information on chirality isomer and substructure these information can be added as additional features m path uses an iterative random approach and linear_programming to avoid the combinatorial explosion in exploring possible metabolic_pathways the random nature of m path gives us a chance to obtain some results even if the number of possible metabolic_pathways cannot be exhaustively enumerated in computational time moreover using hub reactions as the first step makes it possible to find appropriate start compounds for any target_compounds the evaluation of resulting metabolic_pathways is also an issue in the design of synthetic metabolic_pathways metabolic_pathways have been reported to expand the scope in nature by introducing an enzyme with the alteration of substrate_specificity bar even and salah a compound with similar chemical_structure to a substrate in a known enzymatic_reaction could be a candidate for new substrate during enzyme evolution in the same manner m path designs synthetic_pathways including putative reactions with similar reaction chemistry to known enzymatic_reactions the chemical similarities between assigned compounds in m path calculations and substrates or products in known enzymatic_reactions can thus be an index for evaluating the applicability of the enzymes and pathways m path takes_advantage of the chemical similarity to calculate average_scores for each reaction using chemical fingerprints to differentiate the resulting pathways the results here show that the chemical similarity_score is one evalution index additional methods for pathway evaluation have been proposed but m path platform is first designed to allow user to check results without excluding all possibilities in the process of making decision for this purpose the pathway viewer visualizes all possible metabolic_pathways and tooutput user selected results in the form of either pathway or network data for subsequent analyses such as flux_balance due to the increasing size of available data it is preferable to implement scalable options for dealing with the data size without significant loss of information in the design platform m path allows various options to control the design_space for example we can readily extend additional information such as chirality isomer and substructure in the form of chemical feature_vectors by adding the difference in smiles strings as descriptors in feature_vectors supplementary conversely we can downsize the chemical_features by hierarchical integration of atom and bond types as proposed in previous methods the reaction feature_vector can also be re defined in higher_resolution integrating auxiliary compounds such as co factors into chemical feature_vector m path can also be expanded beyond the specific chemical and reaction data used in this study the set of reaction feature_vectors is increased up to by using a manually_curated brenda database in the current version of m path and newer pubchem data can also be updated the scalability of m path will lead to more extensive and precise design of synthetic metabolic_pathways
