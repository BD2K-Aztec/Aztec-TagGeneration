gene_expression using poisson mixed_effects to quantify transcript_level gene_expression in rna_seq motivation rna_sequencing rna_seq is a powerful new technology for mapping and quantifying transcriptomes using ultra high_throughput next_generation using deep_sequencing gene_expression levels of all transcripts including novel ones can be quantified digitally although extremely promising the massive_amounts of data generated by rna_seq substantial biases and uncertainty in short_read pose_challenges for data analysis in particular large base specific variation and between base dependence make simple approaches such as those that use averaging to normalize rna_seq and quantify gene_expressions ineffective results in this study we propose a poisson mixed effects pome model to characterize base level read_coverage within each transcript the underlying expression_level is included as a key_parameter in this model since the proposed model is capable of incorporating base specific variation as well as between base dependence that affect read_coverage profile throughout the transcript it can lead to improved quantification of the true underlying expression_level availability_and pome can be freely downloaded atthe transcriptome is the complete set of transcripts in a cell under any given developmental_stage or physiological condition comprehensively cataloging all the components in the transcriptome is a grand_challenge in the post genome era in the past_decade microarray_technology has played a prominent role in advancing our understanding of transcriptome complexity by allowing scientists to simultaneously monitor the expression of almost all the genes in the genome despite its overwhelming success microarray_technology has its limitations for example designing probes on the chip requires knowledge of to whom correspondence should be addressed the genome_sequence and annotation hence novel transcripts will be missed additionally cross_hybridization background signal and saturation result in a reduction of microarrays dynamic range and accuracy a recently_developed sequencing based technology for measuring gene_expression termed rna_seq has the potential to overcome_these the ultra high_throughput next_generation capable of producing millions of sequence_reads dramatically_increase the throughput in dna_sequencing compared with conventional sanger technology and at a much lower cost an array of studies has been published that successfully apply these new sequencing_technologies to measure mrna_expression levels in cells from various species since illuminas platforms have been widely_adopted in rna_seq experiments we focused on short_read rna_seq generated from the illumina_platform in this study in rna_seq experiments using the aforementioned sequencing_technologies rna_molecules are first converted to a library of cdna_fragments with adaptors attached to both ends each molecule often after amplification is then sequenced using one of the next_generation following sequencing the resulting reads are aligned to known transcripts or de_novo assembled together to produce a genome_scale transcriptional_profile a fundamental_question in rna_seq is to derive expression_level from raw sequencing output data this is the basis of almost all further investigation such as detecting differentially_expressed alternative_splicing etc sophisticated and tailor made data analysis methods are needed to fully realize the power of the new sequencing_technologies a natural idea is to use the total number of reads_mapped inside each transcript or region of interest roi to represent the expression_level proposed to use the number of reads per kilobase of a transcript per_million rpkm as the transcripts expression_level the rpkm method is easy to implement and takes into consideration the transcript length and the total number of uniquely_mapped however the rpkm method is oversimplified as it ignores the variability of read_coverage within an roi demonstrated by real rna_seq morepage in microarray_data analysis it is now widely_accepted that estimates of the expression levels based on parametric_models such as the model based expression index mbei are more accurate in reflecting the underlying expression levels than summary_statistics of raw intensity values inspired by the success of model based_methods in microarray_data analysis in this study we strived to develop a model_based for analyzing rna_seq when exploring the properties of base level sequencing_depth in rna_seq we found substantial variation in sequencing_depth within most transcripts especially for those that are highly_expressed we also found that a large proportion of transcripts shows over dispersion in base level sequencing_depth supplementary which is consistent with what has been reported in the literature additionally we found that base level sequencing_depth displays substantial dependence between base_pairs that are close to each other this type of dependence resembles spatial_correlation between neighboring areas considered in spatial statistics research and to the best of our knowledge has not yet been reported in the literature on rna_seq based on these observations we believe that spatial models that can incorporate correlations such as pome have advantages over existing_models in characterizing base level rna_seq in this study we used pome to estimate the expression_level of an individual transcript two types of random_effects are introduced to characterize two types of variation in read_counts which are between adjacent base_pairs i e spatial_correlation and specific to each base_pair i e non spatial_variation respectively analyses of both simulated and real rna_seq demonstrate that the expression indices estimated by pome reflect the underlying expression levels more accurately compared with existing_methods we believe that the improvement of estimation accuracy of pome comes from modeling the dependence between the read_counts of base_pairs adjacent to each other the pome model can also be used for differential_gene analysis by incorporating biological or experimental_conditions or other covariates we will pursue research in these directions in the future pome model assumes over dispersion in the observed count_data which is the case for a large proportion of transcripts in rna_seq especially those highly_expressed for this reason we focused on highly_expressed transcripts in this study from our experience about one quarter of all transcripts belong to this category for these transcripts our analysis on simulated as well as real_data demonstrated that pome offers more accurate expression measure than other methods that we compared we have also performed small_scale tests on transcripts with medium level expression and found pome again outperforms rpkm mseq and gpseq methods data not shown for lowly_expressed transcripts we do not recommend to use pome for inference because observed data may be under dispersed like many other model based_methods the pome method is more computationally_intensive than read enumeration methods for a bp transcript without replicate it takes s for pome to complete mcmc iterations on a dell poweredge computing node ghz cpu processors and gb ram the computation time increases almost linearly with the length of transcripts however since model_fitting of individual transcript is independent of each other and thus can be performed_simultaneously the computational intensity of the pome method can be much mitigated by parallel_computing the power of modern cluster computers will also help in this regard after all we believe that accuracy in statistical_inference outweighs computation cost as long as the latter is affordable although we only applied the pome method to rna_seq obtained from the illumina_platform in this study we believe it can also be applied to rna_seq collected from other sequencing_platforms such as solid with little or no modification because these data possess similar data_structures
