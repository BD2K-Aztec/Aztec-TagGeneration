data_and integrative platform to translate gene_sets to networks we have implemented a computational platform moksiskaan that integrates pathway proteinprotein_interaction genome and literature mining data to result in comprehensive networks for a list of genes or proteins moksiskaan is able to generate hypothetical pathways for these genes or proteins as well as estimate their activation statuses using regulation information in pathway repositories an automatically generated result document provides a detailed_description of the query genes biological_processes and drug_targets moksiskaan networks can be downloaded to cytoscape for further analysis to demonstrate the utility of moksiskaan we use gene_microarray and clinical data from glioblastoma_multiforme primary tumor_samples and translate the resulting set of survival associated genes to a network high_throughput such as gene microarrays are effective in profiling gene_expressions genome_wide and have become standard means in biomedicine consequently a multitude of computational_methods have been successfully_applied to highthroughput data resulting in the discovery of a large number of disease associated genes an unresolved issue to date however is how to interpret these results such as gene_lists in biological_context a popular solution is to apply statistical_methods to identify gene_ontology categories or pathways that are associated with the differentially_expressed degs such as spia subpathwayminer and kobas these methods typically use a pathway repository such as kegg to assess whether a pathway is significantly_influenced by the degs and produce a p value or a score for each pathway many pathways crosstalk i e two or more pathways influence each other thus a gene may belong to a number of canonical pathways or be influenced by many canonical pathways pathway analysis methods that do not take crosstalking into account may not be able to produce a comprehensive view on the impact of to whom correspondence should be addressed the degs to pathways in order to address the crosstalk issue we have implemented a computational platform called moksiskaan that integrates data from kegg_pathway and drug databases cpath based pathway_commons repository of pathways http www pathwaycommons org pc ensembl genome_database pina protein_protein database and snps d literature mining database to translate gene or protein lists to networks moksiskaan is able to i rapidly give an overview of the biological_functions of a list of genes such as degs and ii form hypothetical pathways consisting of interconnections between the genes it can also be used to suggest drugs to target_proteins moksiskaan generated networks can be viewed as pdfs or downloaded to cytoscape for further analysis in the network for survival associated genes the genes egfr and erbb are linked with a brown line with a triangle which denotes a protein complex indeed the genes egfr and erbb encode receptors that can form a heterodimer which activates downstream_signaling affecting various phenotypes such as cell_growth and cell_motility the moksiskaan network further suggests that the egfr and erbb complex activates the pi k pathway directly a node with eight pik genes and via jak activation of the pi k pathway directly by egfr and erbb is well known however jak has been mainly associated with the immune system and is not considered as a part of the canonical egfr pathway thus the latter connection between egfr erbb and pi k pathway could have remained unnoticed without a comprehensive network approach the drug data_integration together with gene_ontology analysis protein interactions and gene_annotations are provided in supplementary_material in summary we have designed and implemented a platform that allows translation of gene_lists to comprehensive networks by integrating pathway proteinprotein_interaction literature mining and genome data this integrated set of regulatory connections allows identification of novel and experimentally testable_hypotheses the networks generated by the moksiskaan platform can be downloaded to cytoscape for editing and advanced analysis
