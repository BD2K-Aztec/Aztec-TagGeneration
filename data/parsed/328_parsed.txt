a network driven approach for genome_wide association_mapping motivation it remains a challenge to detect associations between genotypes and phenotypes because of insufficient sample_sizes and complex underlying mechanisms_involved in associations fortunately it is becoming more feasible to obtain gene_expression data in addition to genotypes and phenotypes giving us new opportunities to detect true genotypephenotype associations while unveiling their association mechanisms results in this article we propose a novel method netam that accurately detects associations between snps and phenotypes as well as gene traits involved in such associations we take a network driven approach netam first constructs an association_network where nodes represent snps gene traits or phenotypes and edges represent the strength of association between two nodes netam assigns a score to each path from an snp to a phenotype and then identifies significant paths based on the scores in our simulation_study we show that netam finds significantly more phenotype associated snps than traditional genotypephenotype association analysis under false_positive control taking_advantage of gene_expression data furthermore we applied netam on late_onset alzheimers_disease data and identified significant path associations among which we analyzed paths related to beta_amyloid estrogen and nicotine pathways we also provide hypothetical biological_pathways to explain our findings availability_and software is available atone of the fundamental problems in genetics is to understand how different genotypes affect phenotypic variations to find genetic_factors of complex_diseases such as alzheimers_disease ad and asthma researchers have detected single_nucleotide snps associated with phenotypes e g disease status however most snps associated with complex_diseases remain_elusive and the molecular_mechanisms of genotypephenotype associations are largely_unknown to address the problem efforts have been made in the past_decade to bridge the gap between genotypes and phenotypes by replacing phenotypes with gene_expression and then conducting association_mapping between genotypes and gene_expression for example hypothesis_testing e g t test or penalized regression_methods have been employed to find genotypegene trait associations extending the two way association i e genotypes and gene traits analysis three way association analysis among genotypes gene traits and phenotypes also has been proposed proposed an integrative genomics approach consisting of a series of statistical_tests to identify causal_genes to complex phenotypes recently developed a visualization aided approach to detect genometranscriptomephenome associations the previous_works showed the great promise of three way association analysis however most of them aim to reveal association relationships for an snp a gene trait and a phenotype thus there is an urgent need to develop an efficient method that can detect threeway associations from a large dataset of genotypes gene traits and phenotypes in this article we present a novel method netam networkdriven association_mapping to detect path associations from snps to phenotypes through gene_expression let us first introduce the concept of path associations consider a network where nodes represent snps gene traits or phenotypes and edges represent associations between a pair of nodes weighted by their strengths we call it association_network in this network we define path association by any paths from an snp to a phenotype illustrates an example of association_network identified by netam in ad dataset netam starts with constructing an association_network using sparse regression_methods such as lasso and group_lasso under stability_selection arguably these techniques perform better than single snp analysis because they allow us to find weighted edges considering all snps or all gene_expression simultaneously based on the edge_weights we define scores for all path associations reflecting their significance finally using a k shortest_path algorithm we identify top k path associations or all paths with scores greater than a threshold in the network to boost the computational_efficiency of netam for large_scale analysis we further employ screening_techniques that can discard a large number of irrelevant edges efficiently the proposed approach has advantages over traditional genotypephenotype association analysis first it allows us to better understand_the of associations e g snps affect gene_expression and altered expressions influence phenotypes furthermore it can take advantage of gene_expression to detect phenotype associated snps when snps and phenotypes are weakly associated gene_expression can bridge the gap between them allowing us to find path associations finally it can integrate rapidly_growing heterogeneous datasets such as geo gene_expression database and dbgap database of genotypes and phenotypes netam requires the same samples only for a pair of datasets e g genotypes and gene_expression to create edges and thus heterogeneous datasets can be integrated through a network in our experiments we first conducted simulation_study to verify that netam can take advantage of gene_expression data to significantly improve the performance to detect phenotype associated snps under false_positive control we then applied netam on lateonset ad dataset and identified path associations among them we highlight one path association rs znf ad status it turns out that znf interacts with only the app gene_encoding amyloid_beta a precursor protein a major factor of ad that generates neural waste called beta_amyloid in the brain see section for detailed analysis we also present biological_hypotheses that can explain the path associations identified by netam related to beta_amyloid estrogen and nicotine pathways notation we denote matrices by bold faced uppercase vectors by bold faced lowercase and scalars by lowercase letters given a genotype matrix x r nj with n samples and j snps we denote the j th column by x j the i th row by x i and the i j element by x i j similarly we denote the gene_expression matrix by y r nk and phenotype matrix by z r nm where k and m are the number of gene traits and phenotypes respectively
