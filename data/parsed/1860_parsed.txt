structural_bioinformatics fmcsr mismatch tolerant maximum common substructure searching in r motivation the ability to accurately measure structural_similarities among small_molecules is important for many analysis routines in drug_discovery and chemical genomics algorithms used for this purpose include fragment based fingerprint and graph_based maximum common substructure mcs methods mcs approaches provide one of the most accurate similarity_measures however their rigid matching policies limit them to the identification of perfect mcss to eliminate this restriction we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search method for identifying flexible mcss fmcss containing a user defin able number of atom and or bond mismatches results the fmcsr package provides an r interface with the time consuming steps of the fmcs algorithm implemented in c it includes utilities for pairwise compound comparisons structure similarity searching clustering and visualization of mcss in comparison with an existing mcs tool fmcsr shows better time performance over a wide_range of compound sizes when mismatching of atoms or bonds is turned on the compute times increase as expected and the resulting fmcss are often substantially larger than their strict mcs counterparts based on extensive virtual_screening vs tests the flexible matching feature enhances the enrichment of active structures at the top of mcs based similarity_search results with respect to overall and early enrichment performance fmcs outperforms most of the seven other vs methods considered in these tests availability fmcsr is freely_available for all common operating_systems from the bioconductor sitethe development of computational_methods for detecting and quantifying structural_similarities among small_molecules is an area of intensive_research in drug_discovery and chemical genomics the effort is largely driven by the observation that many structurally_related share similar bioactivity and physicochemical_properties maximum common substructure mcs approaches are commonly used to identify the largest substructure subgraph shared among two compounds mcs is a pairwise graph_matching concept that differs fundamentally from the structural descriptor based_methods but its results e g size of mcs relative to source structures can be used for the computation of related similarity coefficients compared with descriptor based similarity methods mcs approaches generate chemically more meaningful search results by pinpointing the common features within the structure of two compounds they also provide the most efficient method for identifying local structural_similarities and similarities among compounds with large size differences with the exception of bond mismatches existing mcs search algorithms can only identify mcss that are perfect substructure matches in two compounds of interest extending this strict matching scheme to one that tolerates mismatches among atoms and or bonds facilitates the identification of larger flexible mcss fmcss than their strict mcs counterparts resulting in a more complete description of the similarities among two compounds here we introduce such a fmcs algorithm that allows both mismatches of atoms and or bonds in the identified mcss when the flexible matching feature is enabled the user can identify more complex and subtle similarity patterns among two structures than is possible with strict mcs algorithms for instance two molecules may share a larger imperfect mcs that is disrupted by a substitution of a small number of atoms strict mcs algorithms will identify in these cases only the largest invariant subcomponent s while the fmcs algorithm will often find a much larger but partially imperfect mcs this has various advantages for practical_applications in small_molecule discovery such as the prediction of bioactive_compounds scaffold identification in screening libraries or assignment of metabolic compounds to enzymatic steps in pathways
