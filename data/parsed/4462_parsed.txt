systems_biology subnet a java_application for subnetwork extraction the extraction of targeted subnetworks is a powerful way to identify functional_modules and pathways within complex_networks here we present subnet a java_based stand alone program for extracting subnetworks given a basal network and a set of selected nodes designed with a graphical user_friendly interface subnet combines four different extraction methods which offer the possibility to interrogate a biological_network according to the question investigated of note we developed a method based on the highly_successful google pagerank algorithm to extract the subnetwork using the node centrality metric to which possible node weights of the selected genes can be incorporated biological_systems are complex entities composed of interacting components and can be modeled as different types of biological_networks recently_developed high_throughput genomic methods have generated large biological_networks on the whole_genome level which are in general too complex if possible at all to be analyzed as a whole such analytical intractability makes it necessary to focus only on parts of the large networksthe subnetworksthat are most relevant to the research_question not only do they make network_analysis feasible and more focused subnetworks can also help to predict pathways discover network_components e g genes or proteins not known to belong to a functionally_related group and assign function to novel genes by revealing their neighbors in the networks several algorithms have been developed to extract subnetworks given a basal network and a set of selected nodes the seeds although the majority of themthe takahashi matsuyama the klein ravi and the pairwise k shortest_path algorithmsare based on the shortest_paths between nodes in the network one of them the k walks algorithm uses random_walks on the network to find the relevant nodes and edges to generate the subnetwork although these algorithms can extract subnetworks based on well established operations on networks they cannot use informative node weights of seeds if present derived from prior_knowledge here we present subnet a java_based application with a graphical user_friendly interface combining four different methods to identify and extract subnetworks of interest we developed one of the extraction methods based on the highly_successful google pagerank algorithm this method is rigorous efficient and can incorporate_prior about the seeds
