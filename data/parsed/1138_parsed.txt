connectedness of ppi_network neighborhoods identifies regulatory hub proteins motivation with the growing availability of high_throughput protein_protein ppi data it has become possible to consider how a proteins local or global network_characteristics predict its function results we introduce a graph_theoretic approach that identifies key regulatory_proteins in an organism by analyzing proteins local ppi network_structure we apply the method to the yeast_genome and describe several properties of the resulting set of regulatory hubs finally we demonstrate how the identified hubs and putative target gene_sets can be used to identify causative functional regulators of differential_gene linked to human disease availability code is available atthe availability of high_throughput proteinprotein_interaction ppi datasets has led to investigations into network_structure although interactome data for most experimental organisms is incomplete initial analyses suggested that interaction networks are typically scale_free consisting of a relatively small fraction of highly_connected hubs and many nodes of low degree this assumption has more recently been called into question but interest in the functional role of high degree proteins persists in particular many attempts have been made to infer function from network_structure one such approach is to characterize the relative importance of hubs in protein_interaction hubs have been shown to be more likely than random proteins to be essential another approach relies on the notion of betweenness which characterizes nodes by how often they occur on the shortest_path between two other nodes in the graph bottlenecks identified in this way are even more likely to be essential than their degree would to whom correspondence should be addressed suggest abstraction of global connectivity by the formation of guilds of genes has also been used to predict protein_function here we propose using ppi data to identify sets of putative regulatory_proteins to do so we model noisy and incomplete ppi data using a probablistic graph we then assess the connectedness of the graph neighborhood of each highly_connected or hub protein and we compute the likely number of connected components in that neighborhood specifically we show that we can bound the likelihood of disconnecting each ppi neighborhood and that doing so separates likely regulatory hubs from hubs that are merely highly_connected participants in protein_complexes although our approach could be applied to all proteins in the network we choose to focus on highly_connected proteins so that the ppi neighborhoods are sufficiently_large our work allows us to identify candidate regulators whose interactions may determine responses to changing conditions or environmental_stimuli finding such bifurcation points may provide novel insights into the molecular_mechanisms of cellular_behavior however unlike the work of which identifies bifurcation events from dynamic time series expression data our approach uses static protein interaction data to identify a set of proteins that are key decision_makers in a dynamic setting we also distinguish our work characterizing neighborhood connectivity from the related notion of the clustering_coefficient which measures the density of edges in the network neighborhood of a node while our measure deals with similar data we show that our focus on the structure of the neighborhood produces different results our approach also differs from that of measuring node betweenness in that we rely only on the immediate neighborhood of the candidate regulatory protein whereas the betweenness of a node may be heavily influenced by the global structure of the network in addition our method includes a probabilistic_model of noise in the ppi data and identifies not only regulators but also multiple candidate_target sets for each in this way our work is perhaps more akin to that of who examine the functional characteristics of hubs with single versus multiple binding_interface sites however that approach relies on the availability of structural_information whereas ours uses only the protein_interaction in addition to providing general insights into functional network_analysis our method is easily applied to the interpretation of gene_expression data analysis of microarray_experiments typically produces lists of differentially_expressed functional_analyses of these lists are now standardprocedure but they generally do not distinguish between the molecular changes responsible for causing a disease phenotype and those that are downstream consequences of the phenotype here we demonstrate how our identified hubs and their putative target gene_sets can be used to identify causative functional regulators of differential_gene our work may therefore provide new insights into the molecular causes of disease_states and may help in identifying new therapeutic_targets
