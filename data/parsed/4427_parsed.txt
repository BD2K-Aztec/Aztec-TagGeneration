stochastic em based tfbs motif_discovery with mitsu motivation the expectationmaximization em_algorithm has been successfully_applied to the problem of transcription_factor tfbs motif_discovery and underlies the most widely used motif_discovery in the wider field of probabilistic modelling the stochastic em sem algorithm has been used to overcome some of the limitations of the em_algorithm however the application of sem to motif_discovery has not been fully explored results we present mitsu motif_discovery by iterative sampling and updating a novel algorithm for motif_discovery which combines sem with an improved approximation to the likelihood_function which is unconstrained with regard to the distribution of motif occurrences within the input dataset the algorithm is evaluated_quantitatively on realistic synthetic data and several collections of characterized pro karyotic tfbs motifs and shown to outperform em and an alternative sem based algorithm particularly in terms of site level positive pre dictive value availability_and java executable available for download at http www sourceforge net p mitsu motif supported on linux os x contact a m kilpatrick sms ed ac uktranscription factor binding_site tfbs motifs are short dna sequence_patterns that have important roles in genetic transcriptional_regulation these patterns are of considerable interest to biologists as they are central to understanding the mechanisms of gene_expression the discovery and further analysis of tfbs motifs remains an important and challenging_problem in bioinformatics examples from the recent encode_project include as a result there is continued interest in developing algorithms for unsupervised discovery of tfbs motifs the majority of tfbs discovery algorithms are probabilistic algorithms which search the input_data usually a collection of promoter_regions of coregulated genes for sequences that are statistically over represented deterministic algorithms make up a large proportion of commonly used algorithms for motif_discovery the deterministic expectationmaximization em_algorithm is one of the earliest probabilistic motif_discovery and is the basis for a number of others including the benchmark motif_discovery algorithm meme however the em_algorithm has several well known limitations for example the em_algorithm is highly_sensitive to its starting parameters owing to this sensitivity and the use of a local search_strategy the em_algorithm cannot be guaranteed to converge to the global maximum of the likelihood_function instead converging to an insignificant local maximum or saddle_point of the likelihood_function in general the steps of the em_algorithm can become either analytically or computationally_intractable in many practical situations the stochastic em sem algorithm is motivated by the limitations of the deterministic em_algorithm particularly the issues of intractability note that the sem algorithm is generally more successful than the em_algorithm owing to stochastic perturbations which allow the sem algorithm to escape stable fixed points of the em_algorithm such as insignificant local maxima of the likelihood_function in addition to this retaining the underlying em dynamics means that the sem algorithm generally converges in a relatively small number of iterations in comparison with full stochastic_methods stochastic variants of the em_algorithm have been applied to motif_discovery previously for example the seam and mcemda algorithms however the power of sem in a motif_discovery context has not been fully explored most notably these algorithms are limited to the one occurrence per sequence oops model which places a constraint on the distribution of motif occurrences within the input dataset further algorithms based on stochastic variants of em have so_far not implemented features commonly found in other motif_discovery including the ability to automatically_determine the most likely motif width from a range of plausible values in this article we present mitsu motif_discovery by iterative sampling and updating a novel algorithm for tfbs motif_discovery that combines a stochastic version of the em_algorithm with a derived dataset which leads to an improved approximation of the likelihood_function significantly this likelihood_function is unconstrained with regard to the number of motif occurrences in each input_sequence the algorithm also incorporates mcoin an information based heuristic to automatically_determine the most likely motif width mitsu is evaluated_quantitatively on realistic synthetic data and several collections of previously_characterized prokaryotic tfbs sequences and shown to outperform an em based algorithm and the seam algorithm most notably in terms of site level positive_predictive the results of additional_tests demonstrate that mitsu has significant advantages over current sem based_approaches for motif_discovery
