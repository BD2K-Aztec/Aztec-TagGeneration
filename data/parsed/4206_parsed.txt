sequencing delivers diminishing returns for homology detection implications for mapping the protein universe motivation databases of sequenced_genomes are widely used to characterize the structure function and evolutionary_relationships of proteins the ability to discern such relationships is widely expected to grow as sequencing_projects provide novel information bridging gaps in our map of the protein universe results we have plotted our progress in protein sequencing over the last two decades and found that the rate of novel sequence discovery is in a sustained period of decline consequently psi_blast the most widely used method to detect remote evolutionary_relationships which relies upon the accumulation of novel sequence_data is now showing a plateau in performance we interpret this trend as signalling our approach to a representative map of the protein universe and discuss its implications contact only a tiny fraction of the vast space of all possible protein_sequences is populated by proteins present in existing organisms knowledge of these populated islands can be considered as a map of the protein universe as sequencing_projects continue to provide new data the resolution of the map increases permitting insights into protein_function and evolution the map currently covers published genomes in comparison there are over million known organisms while estimates of the total number of species on earth vary between and million despite the exponential_growth in sequencing over the past_two it would appear that a comprehensive map of the protein universe will not be achievable for many years however for many purposes the map need only contain representative sequences a substantial_proportion of the current map has been shown to be composed of very similar homologous_sequences whose diversity can be captured by far fewer representative sequences acquiring a representative map of the protein universe will be possible in a far shorter time than achieving comprehensive coverage here we investigate our progress towards such a representative map for the purpose of this work we consider the protein universe to be populated by protein_sequences clustered by sequence_identity into islands of varying_degrees of density as more genomes are sequenced the map of the protein universe can become more detailed either through the creation of new islands or the progressive population of existing islands early_stages of sequencing are expected to be dominated by the discovery of novel sequence islands as a complete representative map is approached an increasing proportion of newly determined sequences are expected to fall within existing islands in sequence_space and for the creation of new islands to become progressively less common often the evolutionary_relationship between proteins is distant in the map representation this would be seen as points appearing far apart within an island or even in a separate island if the map has insufficient resolution to detect these remote relationships between proteins sophisticated homology detection_tools are required as novel sequences accumulate in the database bridging gaps in the protein map these tools are expected to be capable of detecting more of these remote relationships observed the growth in the number of islands while incrementally adding genomes consisting of protein_sequences marsden et_al later used a larger dataset of sequences from genomes both investigations showed a linear increase in the number of islands with the addition of each genome since then there has been a nearly fold increase in the number of genomes sequenced more recent analysis using sequence_profile matches to historical sequence_databases demonstrated that single domain_sequences are now growing slowly and appear to be saturating in the sequence database however novelty in the form of theour map of the protein universe is reliant on the sequences available from various sequencing_projects as novel data is acquired the resolution of this map is expected to increase and eventually become a global map fully representing the space of all existing sequences obtaining a representative map will be achievable long before we have sequenced all of earths biodiversity because of the similarities inherent in proteins due to sharing a common evolutionary origin these similarities mean that proteins will exist in islands the distribution shape and density of which reflect their relationship to each other when a point is reached where any new sequence can be placed in a pre_existing island we will have obtained the representative map in this study we investigated the progress towards such a map over the last years of sequence data_acquisition by comparing the number of islands to the absolute number of added sequences over time we show that the rate of novel island discovery is in a sustained period of decline an ever increasing proportion of newly_sequenced are highly_similar to proteins already in the database thus the general structure of the sequence map is changing more slowly as it is dominated by those protein_families common to a wide_range of species this is not to say that novel sequences are no longer being found it is clear fromthat the number of islands continues to increase to the present day however the effect of these sequences on the global picture of sequence_space is diminishing methods for remote_homology such as psi_blast are able to routinely identify relationships with sequence_identity being able to detect these remote relationships is vital to our ability to map the protein universe and predict the function and structure of proteins the psi_blast paper has over citations in the literature making it the most highly cited of the past_decade this reflects the crucial_role played by remote_homology for the accurateinference of the relationships between protein_sequence structure function and evolution it has been assumed that the continued_growth of the sequence database will bring with it a steady improvement in our ability to detect remote homology with methods such as psi_blast here we have shown that the slowing in the gain of novel sequence_data is associated with a plateau in our ability to detect remote homologues with psi_blast the recent decline in psi_blast performance since is of particular importance here we eliminated this decline by either the removal of the most populated superfamilies from the analysis or by a global reduction in sequence redundancy in the databases thus the decline appears to be related to errors regarding the handling of redundant data that have been previously_identified given the expectation of continued exponential_growth in the sequence database problems caused by redundancy are expected to become more acute in addition this growth is substantially increasing the computational_burden of sequence_analysis faster than progress in computational power the removal of sequence redundancy can alleviate both of these issues however this approach does not alter the overall trend of substantial slowing or a plateau in performance over recent_years the utility of representative databases for remote_homology will apply outside of the test_set used here for example in the casp assessment the phyre structure_prediction server used sequence_profiles built using a nonredundant sequence database similar to that described here and was placed in the top four servers
