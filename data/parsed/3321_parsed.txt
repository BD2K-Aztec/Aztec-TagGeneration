genome_analysis olorin combining gene_flow with exome_sequencing in large family studies of complex disease motivation the existence of families with many individuals affected by the same complex disease has long suggested the possibility of rare alleles of high_penetrance in contrast to mendelian_diseases however linkage_studies have identified very few reproducibly linked loci in diseases such as diabetes and autism genome_wide have had greater success with such diseases but these results explain neither the extreme disease load nor the within family linkage peaks of some large_pedigrees combining linkage information with exome or genome_sequencing from large complex disease pedigrees might finally identify family specific high_penetrance mutations results olorin is a tool which integrates gene_flow within families with next_generation data to enable the analysis of complex disease pedigrees users can interactively filter and prioritize variants based on haplotype_sharing across selected individuals and other measures of importance including predicted functional_consequence and population frequency next_generation has rapidly become the standard approach for identifying mutations responsible for mendelian_diseases although software and file_formats for the processing of raw_sequence are relatively robust there is currently a lack of easy to use software for downstream_analysis of these data for some study_designs such as focused analysis of fully penetrant de_novo mutations or autosomal_recessive exome_sequence can be analysed and filtered relatively simply increasingly however sequence based_approaches are being applied to complex_diseases which are unlikely to follow a simple genetic model such as autism and to more complicated scenarios such as large_pedigrees with incomplete_penetrance these studies require new tools to enable the diverse community of researchers working on such families to interactively and comprehensively analyze next generation sequence_data shows how our new program olorin integrates within family linkage_analysis with exome_sequencing in a user_friendly package
