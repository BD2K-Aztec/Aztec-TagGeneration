comparative_study of the effectiveness and limitations of current methods for detecting sequence coevolution motivation with rapid accumulation of sequence_data on several species extracting rational and systematic information from multiple_sequence msas is becoming increasingly important currently there is a plethora of computational_methods for investigating coupled evolutionary changes in pairs of positions along the amino_acid and making inferences on structure and function yet the significance of coevolution signals remains to be established also a large_number fps arise from insufficient msa size phylogenetic background and indirect couplings results here a set of pairs of non interacting_proteins is thoroughly examined to assess the effectiveness and limitations of different methods the analysis shows that recent computationally_expensive methods designed to remove biases from indirect couplings outperform others in detecting tertiary structural contacts as well as eliminating intermolecular fps whereas traditional_methods such as mutual_information benefit from refinements such as shuffling while being highly_efficient computations repeated with pairs of protein_families from the negatome database corroborated these results finally using a training_dataset of families of proteins we propose a combined method that outperforms existing individual methods overall the study provides simple guidelines towards the choice of suitable methods and strategies based on available msa size and computing_resources with sequence_data being generated at an ever increasing rate in the post genomic era it is becoming crucially important to develop efficient and accurate methods at the interface between evolutionary_biology computational_biology and molecular biophysics to learn and make inferences from sequence_data structural_and of proteins go hand in hand with their evolutionary properties for instance maintaining protein_stability usually involves interactions between conserved_residues at the core of the structure likewise biochemical activities such as catalysis involve conserved_residues recognition_sites on the other hand may show correlated_mutations that maintain the balance between specificity and adaptability b recent_studies also highlight how sequence_evolution correlates with structural_dynamics coevolution patterns derived from multiple_sequence msas provide valuable constraints that assist in structure_prediction the idea of inferring inter residue_contacts for structure_prediction using sequence correlation data indeed goes back to the early s e g such applications may be particularly useful in the case of membrane_proteins that can often be difficult to resolve detection of correlated mutation_sites could also assist in identifying hot_spots and provide guidance for protein design and engineering in line with increased sequence_data and thereby increased opportunity for detecting and interpreting sequence correlations across the members of protein_families a broad range of theory and methods have been introduced for correlated_mutations analysis cma in the last decade mutual_information mi from information_theory was one of the first rigorous metrics adopted for quantifying the extent of cross correlations between amino_acid in proteins a corrected version mip where the background_noise and phylogenetic effects were largely eliminated by subtracting an average product correction apc proved to enhance signals associated with amino_acids that are proximal in the structure also non mi based_methods have been shown to help identify correlated_mutations such as the observedminus expected squared omes method and the statistical coupling analysis sca more recently advanced approaches that require more expensive computations have been introduced focused on removing indirect or transitive couplings that may obscure the detection of direct correlations between sequence_positions such methods include direct coupling analysis dca or di for direct information protein sparse inverse covariance psicov a bayesian_network algorithm for disentangling direct from indirect dependencies between residues the pseudolikelihood maximization dca plmdca method due to gremlins pseudo likelihood method and a network deconvolution approach based on spectral decomposition of the correlation_matrix these studies have shown success in detecting correlations that relate to contacts in the three_dimensional d structure and in reverse_engineering the d structure from correlations in a control study horovitz and coworkers demonstrated that cma methods may erroneously yield coevolutionary signals even between non interacting_proteins this study performed for a set of non interacting_protein supplementary further showed that shuffling algorithms could be adopted to improve signal_to and reduce these false_positives fps of interest is to see if methods developed for improving the detection of d contact making residues are equally_effective in eliminating intermolecular fps in a broader context it is not often clear which method might be most suitable for a given set of data or what are their limits of applicability which fraction of signals outputted by these methods can be reliably used for making structural or functional inferences how does the size of the msa affect the results can we estimate the minimum_size of the msa to achieve a certain level of accuracy can we design hybrid approaches or combined methods that take advantage of the strengths of different methods to outperform individual methods in the present study we present a critical assessment of the performance of nine methods approaches developed for predicting pairwise_correlations from msas proteins in supplementary table s see also supplementary_information si supplementary are adopted as a benchmark_dataset for a detailed analysis which is further consolidated by extending the analysis to a dataset of structurally resolved protein pairs extracted from negatome database of non interacting_proteins two basic performance_criteria are considered first does the method correctly filter out intermolecular correlations fps if the analyzed pairs of proteins are known to be non interacting second if one focuses on intramolecular signals does the method detect the pairs that make tertiary contacts in the d structure termed intramolecular true_positives tps the study shows that the abilities of the existing_methods to discriminate intermolecular fps are comparable but their abilities to identify intramolecular tps vary with di and psicov outperforming others we also analyse the relationship between the size of msas and the effectiveness of shuffling algorithm we examine the similarities dissimilarities or the level of consistency between the outputs from different methods and provide simple guidelines for estimating how accuracy varies with coverage finally using a navenave bayesian_approach with a training_dataset of families of proteins si supplementary we propose a combined method of psicov and di that provides the highest levels of accuracy overall the study provides a clear understanding of the capabilities and deficiencies of existing_methods to help users select optimal methods for their purposes the above comparative_analysis led to the following conclusions summarized below in the context of three groups of outputs regimes colored light green yellow and pink in supplementary figs s and s strong coevolution signals ranked in the top subset intermediate signals and relatively weak signals first among all studied methods psicov and di yielded the best performance in the strong_signal regime both methods were successful in accurately detecting coevolving pairs of residues thatmake contacts in the d structure and b and supplementary figs s b and s including non local contacts or in eliminating the intermolecular fps and supplementary their performance was particularly impressive when the strongest coevolutionary signals top were considered for a protein of n residues means n n pairs thirty nine of them predicted by these methods were on average observed to form inter residue_contacts in the structure likewise among the top signals pairs out of would make contacts the predictions thus help not only in elucidating evolutionarily relationships but also in assisting in structure_prediction these methods are therefore uniquely useful in cases where no suitable template structures are available di indeed showed remarkable success in predicting the structures of membrane_proteins second in the intermediate regime while the proportion of contacts among coevolving pairs predicted by psicov and di remains high we note that the discriminatory_ability of omes and mip and their shuffled versions between intermolecular and intramolecular interactions start to pick up and outperform that of di notably mip s exhibits the highest performance in the relatively weak but high coverage regime both in terms of elimination of fps and identification of d contact making tps this superior_performance of mip in situations where di and psicov start to underperform is noteworthy two such situations are i the search for a large number of predictions or higher_coverage albeit at lower accuracy and ii the search for coevolving pairs that potentially make d contacts in the absence of a sufficient number of sequences see figs and supplementary mip s emerges as the method of choice in those situations for example if one is interested in exploring coevolutionary patterns within a small sub family of sequences one third of predictions made by mip s would be on the average making contacts in the d structure among the top signals see supplementary this subset of signals contains pairs for n of which would be physically interacting this is a large majority of native contacts based on inter residue coordination_number of z within a third the study highlights how the size m of msa a parameter known to be an important_determinant of the statistical_significance of results affects different methods it is well known that larger msas usually give better results and some methods have specified lower bounds for m sequences for sca for sensitive results from di and for full di performance psicov doesnt specify a lower_bound but there is a clear correlation between performance and msa size however the present study further shows that the deficiency arising from small msas can be partially offset by the shuffling algorithm shuffled mip s in particular emerges as a better choice than di and psicov when dealing with small msas generally_speaking we need more than m sequences to justify the use of the computationally_expensive di and psicov methods otherwise mip might be preferred together with a shuffling algorithm and supplementary on a practical side both psicov and di involve the inversion of a covariance_matrix and or global optimization algorithms which may take hours even days depending on the size of the msa specifically psicov and di need each about gb memories to analyse a residue msa the memory requirement increases quadratically with sequence size and this o n dependence may become prohibitively_expensive for large proteins the computing time for inverting the di covariance_matrix scales between n and n depending on the algorithm and parameters mi mip and omes on the other hand are very fast as such they lend themselves to high_throughput analysis thus allowing for statistical inferences about sequence structuredynamics function relations see e g even though shuffling is time consuming it needs very small memory and we could speed up the calculation by adjusting the number k of shuffles because the computing time scales linearly with k as o kn m so vis_a the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency mip s could serve as an optimal approach especially for msas of large proteins containing a small number of sequences finally our analysis permitted us to develop a hybrid method that takes_advantage of the strengths of di and psicov the improvement in performance is incremental due to an already high overlap of between the predictions of di and psicov yet one may advantageously adopt this hybrid method to maximize the fraction of contact making predictions especially in the intermediate coverage regime another useful recipe for case studies is to select the intersection of di psicov and mip which appears to be particularly useful for eliminating fps all methods are accessible via the evol extension of prody
