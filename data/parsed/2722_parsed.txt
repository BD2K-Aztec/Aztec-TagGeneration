genetics_and linkphase an improved pedigree based phasing algorithm robust to genotyping and map errors many applications in genetics require haplotype reconstruction we present a phasing program designed for large half sibs families as observed in plant and animals that is robust to genotyping and map errors we demonstrate that it is more efficient than previous versions and other programs particularly in the presence of genotyping_errors availability_and the software linkphase is included in the phasebook package and can be freely downloaded from www giga ulg ac be jcms prod software the package is written in fortran and contains source codes a manual is provided with the package haplotype reconstruction is useful in many applications including quantitative_trait qtl_mapping whole_genome prediction imputation of missing genotypes identification of selective_sweeps and analysis of the recombination_process in plant and animals large half sibs families are common and methods that exploit the corresponding within family linkage information result in accurate haplotype reconstruction we implemented a method_combining such information with mendelian segregation rules in linkphase a program included in our phasebook package linkphase has been successfully used in many applications including studies of the recombination_process in cattle imputation of missing marker genotypes e g qtl_mapping in half sib families or routine genomic evaluation in dairy_cattle however the methods implemented in linkphase and related programs are sensitive to genotyping and map errors these will affect accuracy and power in applications such as qtl_mapping genomic_selection or genotype_imputation and will inflate the estimated number of crossovers we herein describe an extension of linkphase referred to as linkphase based on the implementation of a new haplotyping method which is faster robust to genotyping_errors and can identify map errors
