evolution of gene neighborhoods within reconciled phylogenies motivation most models of genome_evolution integrating gene_duplications losses and chromosomal_rearrangements are computa tionally intractable even when comparing only two genomes this prevents large_scale studies that consider different types of genome structural_variations results we define an adjacency phylogenetic_tree that describes the evolution of an adjacency a neighborhood relation between two genes by speciation duplication or loss of one or both genes and rearrangement we describe an algorithm that given a species_tree and a set of gene_trees where the leaves are connected by adjacencies computes an adjacency forest that minimizes the number of gains and breakages of adjacencies caused by rearrangements and runs in polynomial time we use this algorithm to reconstruct contiguous regions of mammalian and plant ancestral_genomes in a few minutes for a dozen species and several thousand genes we show that this method yields reduced conflict between ancestral adjacencies we detect duplications involving several genes and compare the different modes of evolution between phyla and among lineages availability c implementation using bio package available upon request to sverine brard a phylogenetic_tree describes the kin relationships between a set of homologous objects non homologous objects may have other types of relationships such as interactions functional_relationships co expression or neighborhood between genes studying the pattern of descent of these relationships can be used to define homology between them reconstruct ancestral relationships and build phylogenetic_trees the evolution of gene proximity or interaction has been the subject of numerous recent_studies it is for example a way to assess co evolution between genes even if often co evolution is detected by searching for similarities in gene_trees but without modeling explicitly the relation that make the genes co evolve closer to our study and or propose methods to reconstruct to whom correspondence should be addressed ancestral proteinprotein_interactions or gene neighborhoods based on a model of evolution allowing gene_duplications they however assume that the chronology of duplications is known which often is not the case define a general_problem of network evolution without this assumption and give a heuristic solution for the comparison of two species our model considers the more specific problem of gene neighborhoods on chromosomes but generalizes s method in that it handles an arbitrary number of species and provides an exact solution to a less constrained problem several methods are aimed at building ancestral chromosomes which can be seen as relationships between genes most of these methods however ignore duplications and losses and are limited to gene_families which have exactly one representative in each studied species the number of such gene_families becomes smaller and smaller as the number of species grows some methods take as input gene_trees allowing duplications and losses but do not model these events and treat them as noise that is removed for the construction of chromosomes by traveling salesman like optimization_methods or model duplications only in the context of whole_genome duplications here we propose a method that takes a species_tree and a set of gene_trees as inputs and models the gain and breakage of gene adjacencies along a pair of trees taking duplications and losses into account we consider two genes to be adjacent if they are on the same chromosome in the same genome and no other gene is located between the two we give an exact polynomial algorithm which minimizes the number of gains and breakages of adjacencies or more generally the gain breakage cost of an evolutionary scenario for gene adjacencies the result consists of sets of adjacency trees which are phylogenetic_trees describing the evolution of a family of homologous adjacencies adjacencies that share a common_ancestor and derived from it we assume that adjacencies evolve independently from each other so we do not model the rearrangement explicitly inversions translocations etc but model their effect on adjacencies which thus can undergo gains and breakages doing this we solve a problem that fits in the methodological program started by which mixes rearrangements and reconciliations of phylogenetic_trees a reconciliation is an annotation of gene_tree nodes by duplication or speciation_events according to a species_tree algorithmically the dynamic_programming principle we use generalizes the sankofffitch copyedited by
