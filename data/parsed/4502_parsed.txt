synaptomedb an ontology_based knowledgebase for synaptic genes motivation the synapse is integral to the function of the brain and may be an important source of dysfunction underlying many neuropsychiatric_disorders consequently it is an excellent candidate for large_scale genomic and proteomic_study however while the tools and databases available for the annotation of high_throughput dna and protein are generally robust a comprehensive resource dedicated to the integration of information about the synapse is lacking results we present an integrated database called synaptomedb to retrieve and annotate genes comprising the synaptome these genes_encode components of the synapse including neurotransmitters and their receptors adhesion cytoskeletal_proteins scaffold proteins membrane_transporters synaptomedb integrates various and complex data_sources for synaptic genes and proteins the synapse is fundamental to the structure and function of the brain through its role in connecting neurons into circuits as a result the synapse is an excellent target of large_scale study of neuropsychiatric_disorders over the past_decade the number of identified synaptic_proteins has increased dramatically creating a need for a comprehensive resource to integrate_information about synaptic genes and proteins the synaptome from multiple heterogeneous sources these genes_encode components of the synapse including neurotransmitters and their receptors adhesion cytoskeletal_proteins scaffold proteins transporters and others here we report on an integrated database synaptomedb which provides a detailed and experimentally_verified annotation of all known synaptic_proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed the development of synaptomedb has been motivated by a desire to have a database that can interoperate with different resources by simply storing the object keys database_identifiers some important attributes such as symbol and name and the relationships among the objects the database does not actually store large objects like sequence records but built in web_services can retrieve the subset of objects of interest on demand from other sources such as ebi and ncbi we assembled a list of genes n that encode all known proteins of the synapse this comprises genes_encoding proteins in the presynaptic nerve_terminal and active_zone from the synaptic_vesicles and from the postsynaptic_density there is some overlap between categories the list includes strong candidates for a number of neuropsychiatric_disorders such as for example ank for bipolar_disorder grm for major_depression pde b for schizophrenia and shank for autism synaptomedb is a database with a web front application resource that integrates the various and complex data_sources for these synaptic genes
