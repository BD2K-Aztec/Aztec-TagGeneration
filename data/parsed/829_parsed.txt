broadpeak a novel algorithm for identifying broad peaks in diffuse chip_seq although some histone_modification chromatin immunopre cipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq signals show abrupt peaks across narrow and specific genomic_locations others have diffuse distributions along chromosomes and their large contiguous enrichment landscapes are better modeled as broad peaks here we present broadpeak an algorithm for the identification of such broad peaks from diffuse chip_seq we show that broadpeak is a linear time algorithm that requires only two parameters and we validate its performance on real and simulated histone_modification chip_seq broadpeak calls peaks that are highly coincident with both the underlying chip_seq tag count distributions and relevant biological_features such as the gene_bodies of actively_transcribed and it shows superior overall recall and precision of known broad peaks from simulated_datasets availability the source_code and documentations are available atchromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq technology has been used to produce genome_wide maps for a variety of histone_modifications in a number of different cell_types one of the most critical chip_seq processing_steps is peak_calling i e the identification of contiguous genomic_regions that are significantly_enriched with chip_seq tags when compared with the genomic background tag count distribution although numerous computational_methods that can reliably identify narrow histone_modification peaks have been developed there are fewer methods for calling broad peaks here we describe broadpeak a distinct approach for calling broad peaks in diffuse chip_seq and apply the algorithm to both real_and to evaluate its performance
