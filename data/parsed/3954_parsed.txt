regioner an r bioconductor_package for the association analysis of genomic_regions based on permutation_tests motivation statistically assessing the relation between a set of genomic_regions and other gen_omic features is a common challenging_task in genomic and epigenomic analyses randomization based_approaches implicitly take into account the complexity of the genome without the need of assuming an underlying statistical_model summary regioner is an r package that implements a permutation_test framework specifically_designed to work with genomic_regions in addition to the predefined randomization and evaluation strategies regioner is fully customizable allowing the use of custom strategies to adapt it to specific_questions finally it also implements a novel function to evaluate the local specificity of the detected association availability_and regioner is an r package released under artistic license the source_code and documents are freely_available through bioconductor http www bioconductor org_packages regioner sets of genomic_regions are the output of many different genomic and epigenomic analyses like chip_seq regions with copy_number or differentially_methylated the identification of meaningful associations between a set of genomic_regions and other genomic_features is an important part of downstream_analysis the genomic_features can be of different types other region sets intrinsic_properties of the genomee g gc contentor functions defined over the genomee g dna methylation_levels phylogenetic conservation in addition different metrics can be used to evaluate the associations thus while counting the number of overlaps between two region sets is a widely used evaluation strategy with regioner it is possible to answer a wider_range of biological_questions beyond region overlapping with the use of other combinations of metrics and genomic_features computing any of these evaluations can be straightforward but assigning a statistical_significance to the association levels is far from trivial due to the complexity of the genome statistical_models relying on strict assumptions can only be used in certain circumstances empirical approaches such as permutation_tests might overcome_these but they require the use of the appropriate strategies to generate meaningful_results and usually have higher computational costs existing software_tools to evaluate the association of region sets and other genomic_features such as geometricorr or gat are either based on statistical modelling or only applicable to a limited number of situations regioner provides a permutation_test based framework to statistically assess the association between a set of regions and any other genomic_features or annotations it implements a number of randomization and evaluation strategies addressing the most common use cases in addition it can also be easily adapted to specific_questions by using custom functions the package also contains a set of helper functions to simplify the management of sets of genomic_regions regioner is a new and customizable tool to manage and analyze sets of regions and a useful addition to the ngs and genome_wide analysis toolbox using a per chromosome randomization of ctcf peaks the number of overlaps as the evaluation function and permutations the association is highly_significant with the observed value far from the limit of significance of the random_distribution b plot of the local z_score of the permutation_test in a the association is strongly related to the exact position of the ctcf peaks since the z_score drops sharply as soon as the regions are shifted a few hundreds of bases
