complex event_extraction at pubmed scale motivation there has recently been a notable shift in biomedical information_extraction ie from relation models toward the more expressive event model facilitated by the maturation of basic tools for biomedical_text analysis and the availability of manually_annotated resources the event model allows detailed representation of complex natural_language statements and can support a number of advanced text_mining applications ranging from semantic search to pathway extraction a recent collaborative evaluation demonstrated the potential of event_extraction systems yet there have so_far been no studies of the generalization ability of the systems nor the feasibility of large_scale extraction results this study considers event based ie at pubmed scale we introduce a system combining publicly_available state of the art methods for domain parsing named_entity and event_extraction and test the system on a representative_sample of all pubmed citations we present the first evaluation of the generalization performance of event_extraction systems to this scale and show that despite its computational_complexity event_extraction from the entire pubmed is feasible we further illustrate the value of the extraction approach through a number of analyses of the extracted information availability the event detection system and extracted data are open_source licensed and available atin response to the explosive_growth of biomedical scientific_literature there has recently been significant interest in the development of automatic_methods for analyzing domain texts in the previous decade of work on automatic information_extraction ie from biomedical publications efforts have focused in particular on the basic task of recognizing entity mentions in text such as gene protein or disease names and on the extraction of simple relations of these entities such as statements of protein_protein ppi state of the art ie methods frequently rely on a detailed analysis of sentence structure parsing and several studies have addressed the development and adaptation of parsing methods to biomedical_domain texts the research_focus on biomedical_text analysis has brought forth notable advances in many areas automatic protein and gene named_entity ner with performance exceeding to whom correspondence should be addressed we apply the event_extraction system to a sample of the distribution of the pubmed literature_database the full pubmed dataset contains million citations which we downsampled at random to create a dataset of citations to assure that results are representative of the full pubmed_database we performed no document selection or filtering consequently of the citations in the sample contain only a title but no abstract and the earliest citation in the sample is for an article published in pmid while many of the citations in the sample are thus likely to have limited utility for biomolecular event_extraction their inclusion assures unbiased results and a fair test of the true generalization ability of the applied methods in total the system extracted events from citations in the pubmed sample the number of extracted events for the nine event_types is presented in the banner ner system marked gene protein entities in citations in the sample averaging two mentions per citation overall and almost seven per citation for those containing at least one tagged entity by this estimate less than a third of pubmed citations contain gene protein mentions when the extracted events are broken up by publication year a strong trend for increasing number of citations containing gene protein mentions and events is visible with of citations from the last years containing at least one event since the extracted events are of the protein gene specific bionlp shared task types this trend can be seen to reflect the growing prominence of molecular_biology based on the predicted named_entities and events the present release of pubmed can be estimated to contain more than million citations with gene protein mentions totaling over million mentions overall and nearly million citations containing events of the shared task types totaling over million such events overall the number of citations with events has increased consistently with the growth of pubmed until the year after this the total amount of citations grows more rapidly perhaps reflecting pubmeds expanded coverage of life_science topics since then while not the primary result of this study the extraction output can be used to support analysis of some large_scale trends in pubmed as an example shows the number of citations per year with mentions of insulin immunoglobulin g igg and tumor_necrosis tnf the three most common named_entities identified and their associated events we note that citations for insulin show a long_term growing trend perhaps reflecting the considerable resources directed toward diabetes research the decreasing number of article abstracts mentioning igg despite its centrality in many experimental applications might be seen to indicate its waning as a primary subject of research considering average gene quotation frequencies over time the number of citations mentioning tumor_necrosis has grown explosively since it was first cloned and named in showing continued and growing interest in
