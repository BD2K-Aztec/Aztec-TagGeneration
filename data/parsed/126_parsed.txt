structural_bioinformatics a discriminatory function for prediction of protein_dna based on alpha shape modeling motivation proteindna_interaction has significant importance in many biological_processes however the underlying principle of the molecular_recognition process is still largely_unknown as more high_resolution d structures of proteindna complex are becoming available the surface_characteristics of the complex become an important research_topic result in our work we apply an alpha shape model to represent the surface_structure of the proteindna complex and developed an interface atom curvature dependent conditional_probability discriminatory function for the prediction of protein_dna the interface atom curvature dependent formalism captures atomic interaction details better than the atomic distance based method the proposed method provides good performance in discriminating the native structures from the docking decoy_sets and outperforms the distance_dependent formalism in terms of the z_score computer experiment results show that the curvature dependent formalism with the optimal parameters can achieve a native z_score of in discriminating the native_structure from the highest surface complementarity scored decoy set and a native z_score of in discriminating the native_structure from the lowest rmsd decoy set the interface atom curvature dependent formalism can also be used to predict apo version of dna_binding these results suggest that the interface atom curvature dependent formalism has a good prediction capability for proteindna_interactions availability the code and data_sets are available for download onproteindna interaction plays an important role in many biological_processes such as dna_replication transcription and nucleosome_remodeling in the beginning scientists focused on the nucleic_acid sequence_information and tried to explain proteindna_interaction by genetic codes however later research on the geometric_analysis of the proteindna interface showed that there is no simple code for to whom correspondence should be addressed proteindna recognition in recent_years they paid more attention to the pairwise interatomic distance information provided by the d structure of the proteindna complex samudrala and moult proposed an all atom distance_dependent discriminatory function for the prediction of nucleic_acid binding_proteins they applied the conditional_probability theory to the analysis of the protein_structures and got good results compared with the free_energy theory later applied an interface pairwise residue_level potential to the screening of predicted docked complex recently robertson and varani improved the method based on an interface atom distance_dependent formalism and showed better prediction power than previous methods gao and skolnick developed a knowledgebased method which can perform apo version of dna_binding prediction there are several other methods that have been devised to predict protein related interactions developed a structure base method for the transcription_factor binding_site ahmad proposed the usage of moment information in the prediction of dna_binding applied the clustering method in the analysis of proteindna structural data however the underlying principle of proteindna_interactions is still largely_unknown previously some scientists focused on the electrostatics features of the amino_acid and some focused on the interatomic distance although these attempts to predict proteindna_interaction provided acceptable results few paid enough attention to the d interface surface_characteristics of the proteindna complex which are also direct factors_influencing the binding process in proteindna_interaction the binding surface of the protein should provide certain conditions to adapt to particular dna molecular_surfaces such conditions can be the atom_type surface curvature accessible_surface net_charge etc as more high_resolution d structures of biological_molecules are becoming available the surface_characteristics of the molecules have become an important research_topic a useful tool for object_surface analysis is the d alpha shape model alpha shape has been used for a long time in molecular volume computation cavities detection and shape representation first proposed to use alpha shape modeling to compute the molecular area volume and detect the inaccessible cavities in proteins used the edges in alpha shape modeling to represent the protein_structure and atom contacts poupon used voronoi tessellations to compute the protein volume and detect the pockets cavities and voids on the protein surface recently alpha shape has been introduced into the study of molecular_surface applied alpha shape modeling to characterize the surface of the protein and defined the surface residue and surface patches with some local_features however most of the work has been done on protein surface analysis and little attention has been paid to the interface surface_characteristics of the proteindna complex in our research we propose to apply d alpha shape modeling to study the interface surface_characteristics of the proteindna complex and develop a surface characteristic based discriminatory function for the prediction of proteindna_interaction in this study we have constructed an interface atom curvaturedependent discriminatory function for the prediction of protein_dna a d alpha shape model is introduced to represent the surface of the proteindna complex in this model solid angle atom_type and residue type are extracted to characterize the interface surface of the proteindna complex we use the conditional_probability to form the discriminatory function the performance of function is tested by discriminating the native structures from a set of docking decoy structures and the near native decoy structures the interface atom curvature dependent formulation shows better performance than the previous pairwise potential method in terms of native z scores in the same decoy discrimination test we reaffirm the importance of the geometric complementarity in determining the structure of a complex and show that interface surface curvature plays an important role in proteindna_interaction we show that our method is also applicable to the prediction of apo version of dna_binding our work can be extended in several ways the alpha shape model should also be useful for the analysis of other types of molecular_interactions such as proteinrna proteinligand and protein protein_complexes and for the study of multiple proteins multiple binding_sites or a specific family of proteins these problems would require modeling interface surfaces of different characteristics such as different sizes and the compatibility and cooperativity between these surfaces thus new surface features in addition to the solid angle may be needed recently it has been shown that interface cluster patterns found based on multiple_sequence and graph models play_an in molecular_interactions however currently these cluster patterns can only incorporate limited d information and steric compatibility the alpha shape model discussed in this article is true d in nature thus it can be used to extract d interface patterns this would be an interesting future_research direction
