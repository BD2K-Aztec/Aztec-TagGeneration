systems_biology direct calculation of elementary_flux satisfying several biological constraints in genome_scale motivation the concept of elementary_flux efm has been widely used for the past_years however its application to genome_scale gsmns is still under development because of methodological_limitations therefore novel approaches are demanded to extend the application of efms a novel family of methods based on optimization is emerging that provides us with a subset of efms because the calculation of the whole set of efms goes beyond our capacity performing a selective search is a proper strategy results here we present a novel mathematical_approach calculating efms fulfilling additional linear constraints we validated our approach based on two metabolic_networks in which all the efms can be obtained finally we analyzed the performance of our methodology in the gsmn of the yeast_saccharomyces by calculating efms producing ethanol with a given minimum carbon yield overall this new approach opens_new for the calculation of efms in gsmns availability_and matlab_code is provided in the supplementary online materials contact fplanes ceit es from its inception classical biology has relied on reductionist principles however the actual nature of the cell in which all components interact demanded switching the previous paradigm to a holistic molecular approach extending the scope of the analysis these are the foundations that motivated the development of systems_biology in the second half of the twentieth_century in particular systems_biology aims at studying the biological_processes in terms of the cellular_components and their interactions from a holistic molecular perspective some of these components interact in the cellular_metabolism which comprises those biochemical_reactions consuming and producing the smallest compounds of the cell typically named metabolites these reactions are close to be in thermodynamic_equilibrium requiring the presence of catalytic agents so as to achieve the appropriate rate of activity to sustain life in most metabolic_reactions a set of proteins named enzymes act as catalysts the conversion_rate of the metabolic_reactions is termed metabolic_fluxes metabolic_reactions are organized into distinct functional_modules forming the so_called metabolic_pathways some of these pathways have been experimentally reported and manually included in different databases as well as in biochemistry books e g glycolysis tca_cycle however metabolic_pathways are not independent entities for example the same enzyme or metabolite may appear in different pathways for this reason a most general analysis of metabolism requires the simultaneous consideration of different metabolic_pathways in the most extreme scenario when all the known metabolic_pathways are considered the resulting set of enzymes and metabolites is referred to as genome_scale gsmns the outbreak of different high_throughput has allowed us to increase the accuracy and size of gsmns in terms of metabolites reactions and gene_regulation currently gsmns for several organisms are publicly_available through different online repositories the inherent complexity of gsmns does not make it possible to perform a manual_analysis per se different computational strategies have been developed among them a number of theoretical_frameworks have been proposed to extend the concept of metabolic_pathways from a network oriented perspective one of the most important pathway concepts is that of elementary_flux efm efms are a minimum set of enzymes necessary to accomplish mass_balance and thermodynamic irreversibility conditions although the mass_balance and thermodynamic_constraints are directly imposed by means of two linear constraints the condition that guarantees that only a minimum number of reactions is active referred to as the non decomposability condition ndc is more difficult and demands further mathematical considerations efficient algebraic frameworks can be found in the literature for calculating the whole set of efms of a given metabolic_network these methods are based on an iterative process that has to be completed so as to guarantee that the obtained solutions are efms however the number of efms increases exponentially with the number of reactions constituting the network consequently applying these methodologies to gsmns goes beyond their scope because it is not possible to calculate all the efms in gsmns different mathematical frameworks were later developed to provide a particular to whom correspondence should be addressed subset of them most of them based on mixed_integer milp these optimization_methods typically enumerate efms in an increasing number of reactions and have been proved_effective for a number of applications however they allow us to add only one biological constraint in the search_procedure e g computing the shortest efms producing l lysine as stated by this limitation is due to ndc in other words currently in the literature there is no general_methodology for taking_into more than one biological constraint in the efm computation without violating ndc in this work we present a novel approach based on milp that is able to calculate a subset of efms fulfilling additional constraints the framework is illustrated with a toy example and validated with two networks where all efms can be obtained subsequently the scalability of our approach is confirmed by calculating a subset of efms in the genome_scale of saccharomyces_cerevisiae here we investigated efms simultaneously consuming glucose and producing ethanol guaranteeing that a minimum yield is achieved we also validated the performance of this new approach when more than two constraints are imposed particularly by calculating efms activating a random set of five reactions
