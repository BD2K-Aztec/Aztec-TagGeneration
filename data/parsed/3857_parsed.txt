ractip fast and accurate prediction of rna rna interaction using integer_programming motivation considerable attention has been focused on predicting rnarna_interaction since it is a key to identifying possible targets of non coding small_rnas that regulate_gene post_transcriptionally a number of computational studies have so_far been devoted to predicting joint secondary_structures or binding_sites under a specific class of interactions in general there is a trade_off between range of interaction type and efficiency of a prediction algorithm and thus efficient computational_methods for predicting comprehensive type of interaction are still awaited results we present ractip a fast and accurate prediction method for rnarna_interaction of general type using integer_programming ractip can integrate approximate information on an ensemble of equilibrium joint structures into the objective_function of integer_programming using posterior internal and external base paring probabilities experimental_results on real interaction data show that prediction_accuracy of ractip is at least comparable to that of several state of the art methods for rnarna_interaction prediction moreover we demonstrate that ractip can run incomparably faster than competitive methods for predicting joint secondary_structures availability ractip is implemented in c and the source_code is available at http www ncrna org software ractip recent_years have seen a renewal of interest in the biological_roles of functional non_coding ncrnas modern studies have provided evidence that they can act as ubiquitous regulators in living_cells a class of small ncrnas downregulates gene_expression post_transcriptionally via base_pairing with target_mrnas of the ncrnas to inhibit the translation into the corresponding proteins eukaryotic micrornas mirnas and small_interfering sirnas are very short and have almost full sequence complementarity to their targets on the other hand several regulatory antisense rnas have been found in bacterial chromosomes which have relatively long_sequences and interact with their target_mrnas in a more intricate manner this type of interaction comes from the fact that the genes_encoding the antisense rnas are located at loci different from those encoding their targets i e trans encoded antisense rnas in particular kissing hairpin structures see caused by looploop interaction have been observed to help to understand the mechanism of rnarna_interaction further as well as to identify target rnas of specific ncrnas it is desirable to develop fast and accurate computational_methods for predicting interacting rna_structures rnarna_interaction prediction has so_far been performed by several computational_approaches which can be roughly classified into four groups the first group including unafold rnahybrid and rnaduplex from the vienna rna package disregards intramolecular bonds in both sequences and computes the minimum_free mfe hybridization they work out for short interacting rnas but are impracticable for long_sequences with intramolecular structures the second group belongs to the category that uses the idea of concatenating two rna_sequences and considering them as a single_strand so that the mfe structure of the resulting sequence can be computed pairfold and rnacofold adopt this procedure but these methods cannot predict general type of interaction such as kissing hairpins other approaches such as rnaup intarna inrnas and bistarna fall into the third group which considers rnarna_interaction as the stepwise process of individual intramolecular foldings and their hybridization rnaup and intarna can predict only one binding_site whereas inrnas and bistarna can predict multiple binding_sites the final group aims at predicting the mfe joint secondary_structure or computing the interaction partition_function under the comprehensive type of interaction iris interna rig pirna rip and also inrnas are listed as this category these methods impose natural constraints on the joint structure such that there are no internal pseudoknots crossing interactions and zigzags note thatsuggested that these constraints are satisfied by all examples ofpage i i i we proposed ractip a novel method for predicting rna rna interaction of general type using ip in our approach the threshold cut technique was adopted to reduce the complexity of the solution_space of the ip problem which also leads to maximizing expected_accuracy experimental_results on real interaction data demonstrated that prediction_accuracy of ractip is at least comparable to that of several state of the art methods for joint structure_prediction and binding_site although it is difficult to evaluate theoretically the time complexity of our ipbased approach experimental validations revealed that ractip can run much faster than competitive methods for predicting joint secondary_structures this is an important fact to stress since ractip is expected to improve prediction_performance in unknown target search in long genomes by predicting respective intramolecular structures as well as intermolecular binding_sites in practical time for this purpose we should also show that ractip can discriminate between targets and non targets which is left as our future work ractip not only achieved success in rnarna_interaction prediction but also showed further possibility of applying the fast ip based method with threshold cut to other biologically_important problems which are worthwhile and challenging tasks we employed the threshold cut technique to reduce_the for the optimal joint secondary_structure which makes ractip run much faster than existing state of the art algorithms for joint structure_prediction let us stress again that there is a close relation between the threshold cut and maximizing expected_accuracy
