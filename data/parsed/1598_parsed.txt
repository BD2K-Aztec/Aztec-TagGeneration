epigpu exhaustive pairwise epistasis scans parallelized on consumer level graphics cards motivation hundreds of genome_wide have been performed over the last decade but as single_nucleotide snp chip density has increased so has the computational_burden to search for epistasis for n snps the computational time resource is o n n while the theoretical contribution of epistasis toward phenotypes of medical and economic importance is widely_discussed empirical_evidence is conspicuously absent because its analysis is often computationally prohibitive to facilitate resolution in this field tools must be made available that can render the search for epistasis universally viable in terms of hardware availability cost and computational time results by partitioning the d search grid across the multicore architecture of a modern consumer graphics_processing gpu we report a increase in the speed of an exhaustive pairwise epistasis scan for a quantitative phenotype and we expect the speed to increase as graphics cards continue to improve to achieve a comparable computational improvement without a graphics card would require a large compute cluster an option that is often financially non viable the implementation presented uses openclan open_source library designed to run on any commercially_available gpu and on any operating system availability the software is free open_source platform independent and gpu vendor independent it can be downloaded from http sourceforge net_projects epigpu the importance of epistasis genegene_interactions in complex_trait is largely_unknown and computational difficulties have rendered this topic difficult to explore yet efforts to identify the genetic_factors that underlie traits of economic or medical importance have accelerated over the last decade indeed in the first half of alone genome_wide gwass for traits were published http www genome gov gwastudies last accessed date october despite the scale of these studies the proportion of genetic_variance explained has been disappointing and so has emerged the enigma of the missing_heritability but even with the availability of these data the search to whom correspondence should be addressed for epistasis has been largely neglected phenotypic_variance can be partitioned into several components however in the context of linkage mapping or gwas heritability_estimates are generally limited to the narrow sense thus reducing the search to only independent additive_genetic in human and animal genetics in particular estimation of genetic_variance beyond the scope of purely additive_effects i e broad sense heritability is intractable in most cases and so the overall contribution of epistasis remains_unknown there has been a lively debate for several years concerning the importance of the broad sense heritability in complex_traits and in particular the contribution of epistasis but there is still an absence of empirical results epistasis is a recurring candidate for explaining the missing_heritability but in fact most epistatic patterns are unlikely to be detectable through marginal_effects alone on the contrary if epistasis was found to be prevalent in complex_traits the major implication would be that significant genetic control exists beyond the extant estimates of narrow sense heritability should it be the case that the phenotypic effect of one locus depends on the genotype at another locus the impact upon such endeavours as personalized_medicine disease risk prediction animal breeding and evolutionary_genetics could be significant several obstacles exist that make epistatic searches difficult when searching for independent additive_effects each snp is tested for association with the phenotype but in order to most powerfully identify epistatic_effects the search must be increased to two dimensions testing each snp against all other snps for example a k snp chip would require independent_tests which is a massive computational undertaking currently the cheapest way to run this type of analysis using a desktop computer could take weeks however the parallel decomposition of this problem is relatively straightforward and the mainstream availability of multicore gpus has paved the way for an efficient and inexpensive alternative we provide software that dramatically_reduces the computational time of an exhaustive_search for two locus epistasis on large_scale snp data for continuous traits we evaluate the performance of the software running on several types of gpus against optimized software that runs serially on desktop computers and against parallelized versions for multicore cpus and large compute clusters we produced software that geometrically parallelizes exhaustive searches for pairwise epistatic associations with quantitative_traits we performed large_scale analyses typical of those that would be expected based on gwass already published on several different software and hardware systems our tests show that against the baseline system serial code running on a modern cpu graphics cards can perform the same analysis almost two orders_of and at minimal expense such that an analysis that would take over days could be performed in just over an hour by using software utilizing a graphics card it is demonstrable that to achieve comparable speeds using cpu cores would require a large compute cluster for which the cost to acquire and administer could be prohibitively_expensive the use of graphics cards as a tool for scientific_research is a rapidly emerging industry that has manifested staggering improvements in performance over the last few years however it is still in its infancy and as reflected in the level of manual optimization required by developers to harness this power is considerable furthermore while a very heterogeneous array of devices can be used for opencl applications differences in their architectures inevitably results in different responses to optimization strategies shows that without careful optimization even the most recent gpus will appear to offer little to no advantage over cpu implementations quantitative genetics has long been occupied with the theoretical contribution of genetic_variants to complex_traits the last decade has seen a global effort to start investigating this empirically on a large_scale yet epistasis remains_largely computing exhaustive pairwise epistatic scans is an important step in making tractable the understanding of non additive_genetic in complex_traits we show that this can be achieved efficiently by using consumer level graphics cards an established technology that is cheap and widely available in its current_implementation epigpu is limited to performing linear_regression on quantitative_traits but the parallel decomposition framework is sufficiently generic to allow its extension to other pairwise statistical_analyses relatively easily such as chi_square testing for casecontrol data another central problem with epistasis scans is the heavy multiple testing penalty incurred by stringent significance thresholds computationally straightforward methods such as the bonferroni_correction are likely to penalize for an overestimated number of independent_tests and this is particularly problematic with epistasis where the dimensionality of the search is increased however with the growing availability of gpu clusters it is now becoming feasible to perform d genome_wide permutation analyses to generate more accurate estimates of family wise false_discovery a potentially critical step toward understanding the contribution of epistasis toward complex_traits
