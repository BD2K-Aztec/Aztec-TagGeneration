phenomescape a cytoscape app to identify differentially_regulated sub networks using known disease associations phenomescape is a cytoscape app which provides easy access to the phenomeexpress algorithm to interpret gene_expression data phenomeexpress integrates protein_interaction with known phenotype to gene_associations to find active sub networks enriched in differentially_expressed it also incorporates cross_species phenotypes and associations to include results from animal_models of disease with expression data imported into phenomescape the user can quickly generate and visualise interactive sub networks phenomescape thus enables researchers to use prior_knowledge of a disease to identify differentially_regulated sub networks and to generate an overview of altered biologically processes specific to that disease the interpretation of gene_expression data to gain insights into molecular_mechanisms of disease after differentially expression analysis is challenging looking at groups of genes using enrichment or network based_methods adds power to the analysis and aids interpretation gene_set approaches are limited to predefined sets of genes and ignore the known interaction information finding de_novo subnetworks pathways from a protein_protein ppi_network and the expression data itself is an alternative approach employed by many tools for many diseases there are genes which are known through human mendelian disease and animal_models where perturbation gives rise to observed phenotypes present in the disease under study projects such as the international knockout_mouse consortium are adding much new information as they systematically identify gene to phenotype associations this prior_knowledge is valuable since when combined with the gene_expression data it indicates which genes and pathways regions of the interactome are of importance in the disease we recently described an algorithm named phenomeexpress for analysis of disease related expression data that makes use of known crossspecies phenotype to gene_associations to generate sub networks of differentially_expressed that are linked to the observed phenotypes we here present phenomescape a cytoscape application allowing a user to quickly run the described phenomeexpress algorithm on gene_expression data within the cytoscape gui environment phenomescape allows users to rapidly explore analysed gene_expression data compared to existing_tools such as reactomefiviz phenomescape is unique in allowing integration of the prior phenotypic knowledge of disease genes into the expression analysis no coding experience is needed to run phenomescape making it suitable for bench scientists who have gene_expression data available the resulting sub networks produced in cytoscape allow the user to extend the analysis with additional apps for regulatory analysis phenomescape provides new insights in active processes revealed by expression data in the context of the prior_knowledge of the disease_phenotypes
