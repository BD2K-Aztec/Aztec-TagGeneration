an optimal peak alignment for comprehensive two_dimensional gas_chromatography using mixture similarity measure motivation comprehensive two_dimensional gas_chromatography gc gcms brings much increased separation capacity chemical selectivity and sensitivity for metabolomics and provides more accurate information about metabolite retention_times and mass_spectra however there is always a shift of retention_times in the two columns that makes_it to compare metabolic profiles_obtained from multiple samples exposed to different experimental_conditions results the existing peak alignment_algorithms for gc gcms data use the peak distance and the spectra similarity sequentially and require predefined either distance based window and or spectral similarity based window to overcome the limitations of the current alignment_methods we developed an optimal peak alignment using a novel mixture similarity by employing the peak distance and the spectral similarity_measures simultaneously without any variation windows in addition we examined the effect of the four different distance measures such as euclidean maximum manhattan and canberra distances on the peak alignment the performance of our proposed peak alignment algorithm was compared with the existing alignment_methods on the two sets of gc gcms data our analysis showed that canberra distance performed better than other distances and the proposed mixture similarity peak alignment algorithm prevailed against all literature reported methods availability the data and software mspa are available atan emerging technology comprehensive d gas_chromatography gcgcms brings much increased separation capacity chemical selectivity and sensitivity for metabolomics analysis although there are several issues this approach usually uses a short column after the to whom correspondence should be addressed main analytical_column typically the second column is operated at a higher_temperature than the first column with different stationary_phase the compounds co eluted from the first column are further separated in the second column because of the difference of column temperature and the chromatography matrix the further separated compounds are directed to a high capacity time of flight mass_spectrometry system for detection the gc gcms platform offers_significant for analysis of complex samples including an order of magnitude increase in separation capacity significant increase in signal_to and dynamic range and improvement of mass_spectral deconvolution and similarity matches since the gc gcms system can provide more accurate information about compound retention_times and mass_spectrum it represents a powerful_tool for the analysis of compounds in complex_biological however while gathering gc gcms data there is always a shift of retention_times in the two columns retention time shifts make it difficult to compare metabolic profiles_obtained from multiple samples in order to correct the retention time shifts in the gc gc system two alignment approaches have been developed profile alignment and peak alignment the profile alignment directly uses the entire chromatographic_data i e the raw instrument data as the input_data in the peak alignment approach the raw instrument data are first deconvoluted to peak list and the peak lists of multiple samples are then employed as the input_data to correct retention time shifts the selection of the two approaches for retention time correction depends on the methods of downstream statistical_analysis currently four profile alignment_methods have been reported introduced an algorithm based on the generalized rank annihilation method developed a correlation optimized shifting method these two methods were designed to align small or local_regions of interest in gc gc data in order to correct the entire chromatogram in both dimensions proposed an indexing scheme together with a piecewise retention time alignment algorithm developed a d correlation optimized warping d cow method for warping the gc gc data however all the profile alignment_methods align the gc gcms data based on d retention_times alone although the signature feature of a compound i e mass_spectrum of fragment_ions is readily available in the raw instrument data aligning compound peaks solely based on the d retention_times may introduce a high rate of false_positive alignment becausepage
