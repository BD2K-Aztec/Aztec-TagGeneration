cypiripi exact genotyping of cyp d using high_throughput cyp d is highly_polymorphic gene which encodes the cyp d enzyme involved in the metabolism of of all clinically prescribed_drugs and other xenobiotics in the human_body cyp d genotyping is recommended prior to treatment_decisions involving one or more of the numerous drugs sensitive to cyp d allelic composition in this context high_throughput hts technologies_provide a promising time efficient and cost_effective alternative to currently used genotyping techniques to achieve accurate interpretation of hts_data however one needs to overcome several obstacles such as high_sequence and genetic recombinations between cyp d and evolutionarily_related pseudogenes cyp d and cyp d high copy_number among individuals and short_read generated by hts technologies results in this work we present the first algorithm to computationally infer cyp d genotype at basepair resolution from hts_data our algorithm is able to resolve complex genotypes including alleles that are the products of duplication deletion and fusion events_involving cyp d and its evolutionarily_related cousin cyp d through extensive experiments using simulated_and we show that our algorithm accurately solves this important problem with potential_clinical availability_and cypiripi is available at http sfu compbio github io cypiripi response to a large number of clinically prescribed_drugs varies_significantly among individuals although some patients show a good response to a medication the same treatment might fail in others or cause serious side_effects which can even result in the death of the patient in many cases an individuals genetic_makeup has been recognized as one of the potential causes of treatment_failures to avoid adverse_effects it is recommended to perform accurate genotyping prior to treatment_decisions that include drugs sensitive to the allelic composition of genes involved in their metabolism drug_dosage and selection can then be adjusted based on the inferred genotypes cytochrome_p d cyp d is one of the most widely_studied genes for which the correlation between the allelic makeup and therapy response has been established it is currently estimated that metabolism of of clinically prescribed_drugs is at least in part dependent on cyp d genotype these include antidepressants antipsychotics anticancer_drugs opioids and many others cyp d is highly_polymorphic gene with more than different allelic_variants reported up to date the information about the known alleles is publicly_available at cyp d allele nomenclature website_http www cypalleles ki se cyp d htm which contains detailed information on the sequence_variants characterizing each allele the website also includes information on the impact of genotype on the activity of the encoded enzyme for more than known alleles based on their enzyme_activity the set of known cyp d alleles is divided_into four categories poor intermediate extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers corresponding to none decreased normal and ultrarapid activity respectively the first set of validated cyp d genotypes have recently been made available for publicly_available hts_data from genomes_project phase i collection genomes unfortunately none of these samples are suitable for our purposes as they are either sequenced at very low coverage x or have very short_read length_bp our method requires a minimum coverage of x per strand to successfully filter out the noise originating from sequencing_errors furthermore reads longer than bp can ensure unambiguous mapping as described in the filtering step of the section as a result proper cyp d genotype data for publicly_available hts experiments with reasonable coverage and read_length is not yet available in this article we have presented the first computational framework to exactly characterize the clinically_important cyp d gene and its variations by using hts_data only our framework which we call cypiripi is able to cope with many of the issues presented by the existing non hts based_approaches for cyp d genotyping such as their inability to perform accurate copy_number estimation cyp d variant characterization and fusion_detection in addition cypiripis highly optimized running time makes it an ideal choice for clinical_settings where speed is of high importance the algorithmic basis of cypiripi a gene agnostic ilp can be easily extended to other unique gene_clusters with similar properties it should be noted that there remain some challenges that we aim to investigate in follow_up work for example genotyping when the cypiripi performance for every group available set of sequence_variants can be described by more than one set of genotypes is problematic this technology bound issue can be resolved by the use of paired_end in some cases but may require the availability of longer_reads for the resolution of other cases in addition exact characterization of novel genotypes within the cyp d locus is a further goal to be investigated as the cost of whole_genome wgs plummets and approaches the cost of exome_sequencing we will be able to perform detailed sequence_analysis of several clinically_important loci across the human_genome by using standard coverage hts_data this can reduce both the time and cost required for genomic analysis and address many of the limitations of existing non hts based techniques as wgs makes its way into the clinic it is providing economical and efficient means to identify many pharmacogenomic variants that can be used to provide personalized medication options by the use of a proper computational framework such as cypiripi decision_support to assist physicians for prescribing specific medications can benefit from fast and accurate genotyping based on hts
