bioinformatics_discovery systems_biology identification of transcription_factors for drug associated gene_modules and biomedical implications motivation one of the major findings in systems biomedicine is that both pathogenesis of diseases and drug mode of action have a module basis however the transcription_factors tfs regulating the modules remain_largely results in this study by using biclustering approach fabia factor_analysis for bicluster acquisition we generate modules for gene_expression on agent treatments these modules are of biological_relevance in terms of functional enrichment drugdrug_interactions and d proximity in chromatins by using the information of drug_targets some of which are tfs and biological regulation the links between modules and specific tfs such as estrogen_receptors ers nuclear_factor like and peroxisome_proliferator can be established some of the links are supported by d transcriptional_regulation data derived from chia_pet chromatin_interaction analysis using paired_end tags experiments and drug mode of action as well the relationships between modules and tfs provide new clues to interpreting biological regulation mechanisms in particular the lipid_metabolism regulation by er in addition the links between natural_products e g polyphe nols and their associated modules and tfs are helpful to elucidate their polypharmacological effects in terms of activating specific tfs such as ers nuclear_factor like and peroxisome_proliferator contact roughly speaking the basis of drug_actions is to rectify the gene_expression disorders in diseases through modulating transcription_factors tfs therefore the gene_expression based analysis has played a critical role in drug_repurposing lead_discovery and elucidating drug mode of action moa the pathogenesis of diseases has been revealed to be tightly connected to gene_modules which are sets of functionally_related intriguingly by using biclustering approach iterative signature algorithm iskar et_al revealed that drug moa also has a module basis which provided new insights into drug_actions and perturbed cellular_systems as well however the tfs regulating the drugassociated transcriptional modules remain_unknown which prevents us to understand_the underlying the drug_induced transcriptional variations considering the fact that some drug_targets are tfs such as estrogen_receptors ers peroxisome_proliferator ppars and glucocorticoid_receptor gr we attempt to use the target information of the module coupled drugs to identify the tfs because biclustering approach fabia factor_analysis for bicluster acquisition has shown good performance in recognizing biclusters and has been successfully used in identifying gene_expression modules and associated tfs we used fabia to generate drug_induced transcriptional modules in this study a module is not only a set of genes but also connected with a set of agents so a module is exactly a bicluster then we demonstrate that the modules are of biological_relevance in terms of functional enrichment drug_drug ddis and d proximity in chromatins finally we identify the tfs for some modules by which we reveal some new mechanisms for metabolic_regulation and elucidate the polypharmacological mechanisms for some natural_products
