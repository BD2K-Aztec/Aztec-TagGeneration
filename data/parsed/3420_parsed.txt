bioimage_informatics parallel content based sub image_retrieval using hierarchical searching motivation the capacity to systematically search through large image collections and ensembles and detect regions exhibiting_similar morphological_characteristics is central to pathology diagnosis unfortunately the primary methods used to search digitized whole slide histopathology specimens are slow and prone to inter_and variability the central objective of this research was to design develop and evaluate a content_based system to assist doctors for quick and reliable content based comparative search of similar prostate image patches method given a representative image patch sub image the algorithm will return a ranked ensemble of image patches throughout the entire whole slide histology section which exhibits the most similar mor phologic characteristics this is accomplished by first performing hierarchical searching based on a newly_developed hierarchical annular histogram hah the set of candidates is then further refined in the second stage of processing by computing a color histogram from eight equally_divided segments within each square annular bin defined in the original hah a demand driven master worker parallelization approach is employed to speed up the searching procedure using this strategy the query patch is broadcasted to all worker processes each worker process is dynamically assigned an image by the master process to search for and return a ranked_list of similar patches in the image results the algorithm was tested using digitized hematoxylin_and h e stained prostate_cancer specimens we have achieved an excellent image retrieval_performance the recall_rate within the first rank retrieved image patches is availability_and both the testing data and source_code can be downloaded from http pleiad umdnj edu cbii bioinformatics the exponential_growth of imaging in biomedical_research in the past_decade has resulted in an increasing demand for efficient content_based cbir systems which can detect and locate similar images in large_scale collections given a representative input query several state of the art cbir systems have been designed to facilitate the execution of queries across separate images in support of diagnostic decisions however with the advent of whole slide digital microscopy which can generate high_resolution images rapidly users of cbir systems are often more interested in performing subregion searching and navigation usually searching for an image patch exhibiting specific patterns or structures containing an object when provided with a region of interest i e a query patch a cbir system should be able to return patches in a set of images that contain localized subregions exhibiting features similar to the query patch this process is called content based sub image_retrieval cbsir an advantage of cbsir is that the relevance of images is not limited by changes in specific viewpoint of the image or any background clutter that might be present in practice this approach makes it possible for pathologists and other investigators to select an area or object of interest within a digitized specimen recently researchers have proposed methods for performing cbsir on both natural and medical_images luo andhave introduced relevance feedback by applying a tile reweighting approach to assign penalties to tiles that compose database images and update the penalties for all retrieved images within each iteration to perform region of interest roi queries have presented a sammatch framework based similarity model a hash_table based method for image object retrieval is presented inis used to address the sub image_retrieval problem using a local sensitive hashing searching algorithm however this strategy is time consuming because of the large amount of features that need to be computed to perform large_scale subregion retrieval the method reported inuses approximate k means and hierarchical k means to build large vocabularies followed by a randomized tree based quantization algorithm have incorporated a contextual synonym dictionary to the bag of visual words framework for large_scale visual object searches where synonym words are used to describe visual objects with the same semantic meaning a fast and efficient subwindow search ess algorithm is presented into localize regions of interest using a branch and bound scheme which enables efficient maximization of a large class of classification_functions over all possible sub images building on the ess algorithm lampert has introduced a new box set parameterization that is suitable for subregion retrieval and a two layer branch and bound scheme to localize objects in large image collections another subregion driven image_retrieval method can be found in sivic and zisserman which represents objects with a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors and uses a spatial layout to rank the retrieved regions in an attempt to address the challenges of subregion retrieval in medical_image datasets simonyan et_al have developed a structured visual_search method have proposed a method for executing roi queries in ct_scans this method first executes instance based regression in combination with interpolation techniques to map scanned slides to the height of a human_body model next it finds a stable mapping while deriving a minimal amount of matching points in this article we have proposed a three stage cbsir system that is different from the previous_efforts we have designed a novel feature called a hierarchical annular histogram hah which is proven to be not only accurate but also computationally_efficient the algorithm flowchart is shown in the workflow first performs hierarchical searching using hah it subsequently refines the search by computing a color histogram from eight equally_divided segments of each square annular bin which we refer to as the refined hah finally mean shift clustering is executed to delineate densely overlapping candidates to generate the final content based rank retrieval results we also implemented a parallelization strategy for the cbsir system based on the well known masterworker style execution to scale cbsir to large_numbers of images the masterworker strategy uses a demand driven assignment scheme in which images are assigned by a master process to worker processes dynamically whenever workers become idle this strategy is suitable for cbsir as search for images patches similar to the query patch can be performed independently we have developed a unique extension to this basic strategy to take advantage of hierarchical searching to reduce the list of images to be processed when resources are limited and shared by other clients and applications in this article we have presented the design and implementation of a content based sub image_retrieval cbsir and navigation framework and its parallel implementation this framework uses a simple yet powerful hierarchical searching based on a novel feature call hah to reduce the cost of extracting image patches from a large_scale whole slide scanned high_resolution microscopy datasets with the purpose of seeking the most similar cases as the given query patch we also presented its parallel implementation in details our results show that performance savings can be significant with the hierarchical cbsir compared with non hierarchical cbsir because the hierarchical searching step can be leveraged to reduce the number of images to be analyzed using a user_defined similarity measure the cost of the hierarchical searching step is small enough that substantial reduction in resource usage can be achieved when a subset of images are selected and processed even when the cost of the hierarchical searching step is added to the overall execution time
