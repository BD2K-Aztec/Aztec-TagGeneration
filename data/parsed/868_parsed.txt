cas database web_based genome_wide guide rna library design for gene_knockout screens using crispr_cas motivation crispr derived rna_guided endonucleases rgens have been widely used for both gene_knockout and knock in at the level of single or multiple genes rgens are now available for forward genetic_screens at genome_scale but single guide rna sgrna selection at this scale is difficult results we develop an online tool cas database a genome_wide grna library design tool for cas nucleases from streptococcus_pyogenes spcas with an easy to use web_interface cas database allows users to select optimal target_sequences simply by changing the filtering conditions furthermore it provides a powerful way to select multiple optimal target_sequences from thousands of genes at once for the creation of a genome_wide library cas database also provides a web application_programming web api for advanced bioinformatics users availability_and free access atrna guided endonucleases rgens derived from the type_ii clustered_regularly crispr_cas crispr associated system an adaptive_immune in bacteria and archaea have been usefully harnessed in many genome_engineering applications such as gene_knockout and knock in in various organisms recently a few groups have undertaken genome_wide cas mediated genetic_screens in human and other mammalian_cells the selection of target_sequences is an initial rate_limiting in rgen applications we and other groups have developed a number of web_based online tools or command_line programs for single guide rna sgrna design or off target_site identification although they are very useful for choosing sgrnas that target one gene selection of sgrnas at the genome_scale is still challenging previously two genome_wide databases for spcas design have been built conceptually however although they are useful for selecting sgrnas that target a small number of genes neither offers an easy way to select optimal target_sequences at once from thousands of genes for genome_wide library_construction in a variety of organisms here we describe cas database a web_based genome_wide grna design tool for spcas nucleases for genome_scale screening v c the author published_by
