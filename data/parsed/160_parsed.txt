a generic methodological framework for studying single cell_motility in high_throughput time lapse data motivation motility is a fundamental cellular attribute which plays a major part in processes ranging from embryonic_development to metastasis traditionally single cell_motility is often studied by live_cell yet such studies were so_far limited to low_throughput to systematically study cell_motility at a large_scale we need robust_methods to quantify cell trajectories in live_cell data results the primary contribution of this article is to present motility study integrated workflow motiw a generic workflow for the study of single cell_motility in high_throughput time lapse screening data it is composed of cell_tracking cell trajectory mapping to an original feature_space and hit detection according to a new statistical_procedure we show that this workflow is scalable and demonstrates its power by application to simulated_data as well as large_scale live_cell data this application enables the identification of an ontology of cell_motility patterns in a fully unsupervised manner availability and implementationhigh throughput ht microscopy and high_content hcs are state of the art approaches to investigate many aspects of cellular_organization and function such as protein_localization spatial transcriptomics or drug_screening in particular when combined with a loss of function strategy these approaches are now widely used to study the molecular basis of biological_processes by monitoring the phenotypic consequences of downregulation or overexpression of genes of interest when performed at a large and ideally genome_wide scale such screening approaches have become indispensable tools for functional_genomics they have the potential to provide us with a close to complete picture of the proteins involved in the process under study indeed many large_scale phenotypic screens have been published_previously shedding light on the regulation of such diverse_cellular as protein secretion endocytosis or cell_division such screens do not only provide lists of candidate_genes for further follow_up studies and for computational modeling_approaches they also generate large image databases those can turn out to be a precious scientific resourceas a collection of experimental_data for punctual queries or as a basis for systematic and potentially integrative computational_analysis although it has always been a strength in bioinformatics to rely on rich publicly_available data_sources the use and re use of image data is not straightforward on the one hand this is due to the lack of standardized data_formats and ontologies on the other hand the computational_tools which are necessary to perform such v c the author published_by in this section we present motiw our workflow for the automatic and quantitative analysis of single cell_motility in video sets from time lapse microscopy based screens summarizes its different steps briefly for each video nuclei are segmented and features are extracted as published_previously cells are tracked using a new machine_learning tracking procedure described in section the trajectories are then mapped to a feature_space described in section presented in section an original statistical_procedure then enables the detection of experiments in which single cell_motility is significantly different than that in control movies finally section describes the simulation of trajectories which allows us to validate the performance of the workflow this article_presents a generic methodological framework for studying single cell_motility in a ht setup it combines single cell_tracking newly_designed trajectory features and an original statistical_procedure furthermore its output could be used to obtain an ontology of cell_motility in an unsupervised manner cell motion types were inferred from the data without using any prior_knowledge we found that clustering procedures might not scale in the presence of great biological_variability as is typically observed in ht datasets we suspect that this is due to highly unbalanced classes and large biological_variability taken together those effects produce continuous looking datasets however applying hit detection with the described statistical_procedure prior to clustering solved the problem for our trajectory analysis it may be a promising procedure to apply to other clustering problems in hcs such as clustering of nuclear or cellular morphologies as cell_population migration during metastasis are thought to be led by some leader cell it is crucial to study single cell_motility the workflow we have presented in this article allows to quantify single_cell trajectories therefore its application to large_scale datasets will provide useful insights into the molecular regulation of single cell_motility thereby complementing previous_studies on collective cell_migration the application of this workflow is not limited to rnai data in a next step we are going to apply this workflow to newly generatedenvironmental toxicology data in order to identify environmentally_relevant chemicals which perturb cell_motility
