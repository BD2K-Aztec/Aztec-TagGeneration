gene_expression preda an r package to identify regional variations in genomic_data chromosomal patterns of genomic signals represent molecular fingerprints that may reveal how the local structural_organization of a genome impacts the functional control mechanisms thus the integrative_analysis of multiple sources of genomic_data and information deepens the resolution and enhances the interpretation of stand alone high_throughput data in this note we present preda position related data analysis an r package for detecting regional variations in genomics data preda identifies relevant chromosomal patterns in high_throughput data using a smoothing approach that accounts for distance and density variability of genomics features custom_designed data_structures allow efficiently managing diverse signals in different genomes a variety of smoothing functions and statistics empower flexible and robust workflows the modularity of package design allows an easy deployment of custom analytical pipelines tabular and graphical_representations facilitate downstream biological_interpretation of results availability preda is available in bioconductor and athigh throughput technologies allow the complete exploration of dna and rna_molecules at genome_wide scale thus offering the opportunity to decipher the control mechanisms_underlying the functional utilization of a genome although hundred of studies fully demonstrated the relevance of bioinformatics in analyzing each data type alone fewer approaches have been proposed for the integrative_analysis of genomics signals and genome structural_organization some of these methods specifically address the identification of gene_expression at the chromosomal level others the integrative_analysis of paired dna_copy and gene_expression data to whom correspondence should be addressed here we describe preda an r bioconductor_package for detecting regional variations of genomic_features from the integrative_analysis of high_throughput data and genome local structural_organization the program implements a generalized version of the integrative strategy first introduced byand further improved byto identify and prioritize targets for functional studies from diverse type of highthroughput data in different genomes preda integrates high_throughput signals and structural_information using a non linear kernel regression with adaptive bandwidth that efficiently accounts for the density variability of genomics data the integrative_analysis is performed through a modular and flexible framework that accommodating different types of smoothing functions and statistics facilitates its adoption in a broad_spectrum of genomics studies the potential applications range from the study of pathological_processes involving genome_structure modifications as for chromosomal amplifications and deletions in cancer e g integrative_analysis of dna_copy and gene_expression to the analysis of physiological mechanisms_regulating genome utilization e g identification of genes colocalized and co expressed analysis of tiling arrays a detailed_description and discussion of the package is reported in the supplementary_material preda generalizes and strengthens previously_proposed methods for the integrative_analysis of high_throughput data and genome structural_information the modularity of the package allows implementing different type of smoothing functions and statistics thus facilitating its application to different genomics data and genomes the core components of the method i e i the data smoothing with non linear_regression functions ii the permutation schema to evaluate the significance of results iii the statistics computed on each gene and used as input for the analysis have been rendered of general applicability and enhanced over prior implementations the modifications aimed at improving the sensitivity of the procedure in detecting_small significant genomic_regions and at controlling false_positive the methodological refinements were tested on simulated_datasets and the results are discussed in details in the supplementary_material results indicate that the overall procedure for position related data analysis is robust to modifications of input statistics and can be adopted in a number of different biological_problems however simulations revealed that selecting the optimal smoothing strategy might be critical to improve sensitivity and reduce the fdr as such several alternative options for data smoothing have been implemented in the preda package along with a flexible and modular framework of r functions that would allow end_users to define custom smoothing methods when needed
