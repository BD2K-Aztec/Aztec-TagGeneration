systems_biology probmetab an r package for bayesian probabilistic annotation of lc_ms based_metabolomics we present probmetab an r package that promotes substantial improvement in automatic probabilistic liquid chromatog raphymass spectrometry based metabolome annotation the inference engine core is based on a bayesian_model implemented to i allow diverse source of experimental_data and metadata to be systematically incorporated into the model with alternative ways to calculate the likelihood_function and ii allow sensitive selection of biologically_meaningful biochemical_reaction databases as dirichlet categorical prior_distribution additionally to ensure result interpretation by system biologists we display the annotation in a network where observed mass peaks are connected if their candidate metab olites are substrate product of known biochemical_reactions this graph can be overlaid with other graph_based analysis such as partial_correlation networks in a visualization scheme exported to cytoscape with web and stand alone versions availability_and probmetab was implemented in a modular manner to fit together with established upstream xcms camera astream mzmatch r etc and downstream r package tools genenet rcytoscape diffcorr etc probmetab along with extensive documentation and case studies is freely_available under gnu license at
