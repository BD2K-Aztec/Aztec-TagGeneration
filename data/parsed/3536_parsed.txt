databases_and phosphonetworks a database for human phosphorylation_networks phosphorylation plays an important role in cellular_signal current phosphorylation related databases often focus on the phosphorylation_sites which are mainly determined by mass_spectrometry here we present phosphonetworks a phosphorylation database built on a high_resolution map of phosphorylation_networks this high_resolution map of phosphorylation_networks provides not only the kinasesubstrate relationships ksrs but also the specific phosphorylation_sites on which the kinases act on the substrates the database contains the most comprehensive dataset for ksrs including the relationships from a recent high_throughput project for identification of ksrs using protein microarrays as well as known ksrs curated from the literature in addition the database also includes several analytical_tools for dissecting phosphorylation_networks phosphonetworks is expected to play a prominent role in proteomics and phosphorylation related disease research availability_and http www phosphonetworks orgthe reversible phosphorylation of proteins regulates many aspects of cellular_physiology abnormal phosphorylation is known to be both a cause and a consequence of many diseases such as cancer diabetes heat attack hypertension and rheumatoid_arthritis the systematic study of phosphorylation can greatly benefit disease related biomedical_research in a recent project we developed a combined protein microarray and bioinformatics_approach to identify kinasesubstrate relationships ksrs in a high throughout manner based on the results of these studies we experimentally_identified substrates for unique kinases resulting in high_quality ksrs the study generated more human ksrs than all previous_studies combined to facilitate the use of this information we created the database for a highresolution map of human phosphorylation_networks phosphonetworks an integrated information system for the storage retrieval visualization and analysis of human phosphorylation data to enhance the discovery of phosphorylation relationships between kinases and their downstream substrates we also connected the kinases with the specific phosphorylation_site on substrate protein_sequences which will help users design mutagenesis experiments of phosphorylation_sites to block the phosphorylation event therefore the phosphonetworks database provides not only a powerful information resource but also an integrated analysis platform
