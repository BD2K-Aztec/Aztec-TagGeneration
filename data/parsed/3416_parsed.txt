panther psep predicting disease_causing genetic_variants using position specific evolutionary preservation panther psep is a new software_tool for predicting non synonymous genetic_variants that may play a causal_role in human disease several previous variant pathogenicity prediction_methods have been proposed that quantify evolutionary_conservation among homologous_proteins from different organisms panther psep employs a related but distinct metric based on evolutionary preservation homologous_proteins are used to reconstruct the likely sequences of ancestral proteins at nodes in a phylogenetic_tree and the history of each amino_acid can be traced back in time from its current state to estimate how long that state has been preserved in its ancestors here we describe the psep tool and assess its performance on standard benchmarks for distinguishing disease associated from neutral variation in humans on these benchmarks psep out performs not only previous tools that utilize evolutionary_conservation but also several highly used tools that include multiple other sources of information as well for predicting pathogenic human variants the trace back of course starts with a human reference protein_sequence but the psep tool can also be applied to predicting deleterious or pathogenic_variants in reference proteins from any of the other species in the panther database availability_and panther psep is freely_available on the web at http pan therdb org tools csnpscoreform jsp users can also download the command_line based tool atrecent advances in sequencing_technology have increased the rate of genetic_variation discoveries thus exacerbating the problem of interpreting these genetic_variations here we focus on non_synonymous variants nsvs a type of genetic_variation that results in a single amino_acid in an encoded_protein most computational_tools for predicting the functional consequences of nsvs including sift polyphen and pantherpsec rely at least in part on the assumption that crucial amino_acids for protein_families are conserved through evolution due to negative_selection i e amino_acid changes at these sites were deleterious in the past and that mutations at these sites have an increased likelihood of being pathogenic causing disease in humans in general homologous_sequences of a target protein are collected and aligned and a metric of conservation is computed based on the weighted frequencies of different amino_acids observed in the target_position in the alignment here we present a new tool panther psep position specific evolutionary preservation for predicting potentially pathogenic ordeleterious nsvs panther psep is different from other variant prediction_tools in that psep uses a metric based on evolutionary preservation preservation is related to conservation as it also reflects the effect of negative_selection that has acted to prevent evolutionary_change at a given site in a protein it is also related to earlier methods that utilize a phylogenetic_tree in addition to a multiple_sequence pioneered by the evolutionary trace method and later applied to variant pathogenicity prediction in the panther psecv and evolutionary action methods but unlike these other approaches preservation uses ancestral sequence reconstruction to assess evolutionary_change specifically in the lineage leading to the sequence of interest we have previously shown evolutionary preservation to be superior to conservation for identifying deleterious_mutations in a growth based assay in the human mthfr protein as well as the e coli laci protein here we describe a software_tool based on the same concept of ancestral preservation but using a simple standardized metric for quantifying preservation in panther psep preservation is measured as the approximate length of time a site has been preserved tracing back the lineage from the relevant human protein or potentially any other protein in the panther library because panther trees are reconciled with the known species_tree we can use best estimates of speciation times to date the ancestral preservation of each site
