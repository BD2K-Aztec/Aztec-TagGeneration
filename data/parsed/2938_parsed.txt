genome_analysis methylsig a whole_genome dna_methylation analysis_pipeline motivation dna_methylation plays critical roles in gene_regulation and cellular specification without altering dna_sequences the wide_application of reduced_representation rrbs and whole_genome bis seq opens_the to study dna_methylation at single cpg_site resolution one challenging question is how best to test for significant methylation differences between groups of biological_samples in order to minimize false_positive results we present a statistical_analysis package methylsig to analyse genome_wide differences between samples from different treatments or disease groups methylsig takes_into both read_coverage and biological_variation by utilizing a beta_binomial approach across biological_samples for a cpg_site or region and identifies relevant differences in cpg_methylation it can also incorporate local information to improve group methylation_level and or variance estimation for experiments with small_sample a permutation study based on data from enhanced rrbs samples shows that methylsig maintains a well calibrated type_i when the number of samples is three or more per group our simulations show that methylsig has higher sensitivity compared with several alternative_methods the use of methylsig is illustrated with a comparison of different subtypes of acute_leukemia and normal bone_marrow samples availability methylsig is available as an r package at http sartorlab ccmb dna_methylation methylcytosine is the most intensively_studied and one of the best understood epigenetic_marks in mammalian_cells having important roles in imprinting genome_stability and regulation of gene_expression without altering the dna_sequence itself in mammalian_cells cytosine_methylation occurs almost exclusively at cpg_dinucleotides with the exception of embryonic_stem where non cpg_methylation is a frequent occurrence dna_methylation is essential for normal development and cell_differentiation due to its roles in regulating gene_expression for example unmethylated cpgs in promoter_regions can allow binding of specific transcription_factors tfs while methylated cpgs in these regions can prevent binding furthermore extensive crosstalk occurs between dna_methylation and chromatin modifying histone_marks dysregulation of dna_methylation is a hallmark of cancer with overall genomic demethylation and gene specific hypermethylation most notably in oncogenes_and treatment of dna with sodium_bisulfite deaminates unmethylated_cytosines to uracil while methylated_cytosines are resistant to this conversion thus allowing for sequence specific discrimination between methylated and unmethylated cpg_sites sodium_bisulfite pre_treatment of dna coupled with next_generation has facilitated genome_wide quantitative dna_methylation to be studied at single cytosine site resolution the high_cost of whole_genome bis seq and the uneven_distribution of cpg_sites in the genome motivated the development of modified approaches such as reduced representation bis seq rrbs and enhanced rrbs errbs these methods have the advantage of requiring fewer sequencing_reads by enriching for cpg dense regions of the genome bis seq rrbs and errbs facilitate the study of dna_methylation across the genome in multiple samples and between sample groups recently errbs was used to identify and describe distinct dna_methylation associated with specific forms of acute_myeloid aml aml is a highly_heterogeneous disease both from the clinical and molecular standpoints with many distinct molecular_subtypes defined by genetic_abnormalities several of these target key epigenetic_regulators an estimated of all amls are associated with heterozygous somatic_mutations of isocitrate_dehydrogenase or idh or or ten_eleven tet any one of these mutations results in an impairment of dna_demethylation pathways and leads to the establishment of a dna_hypermethylation phenotype a separate class of amls constituting of all aml_cases are identified by the presence of the t translocation giving rise to the aml_eto fusion oncoprotein several methods have been published for analysing genomewide methylation_levels bsmooth which is targeted to analyse bis seq data uses a smoothing approach across the genome within each sample to increase the accuracy of the estimated methylation_level for a single cpg_site bsmooth identifies differentially_methylated dmrs by combining top_ranked differentially methylated_cytosines dmcs found using a t statistics approach with either a quantile or direct t statistic cutoff methylkit offers useful annotation_features and provides a statistical_test by pooling sequencing_reads among the individuals in each group when multiple samples are present logistic_regression with a binary predictor is used which can be formulated as a binomial based test however methylation_levels often vary significantly across individuals as observed in cancer samples pooling of reads among individuals may result in inflated type_i when testing for group differences non parametric tests such as the wilcoxon_rank have also been used to test for dmcs however these tests suffer from a lack of statistical_power for experiments with small_sample to overcome current_limitations we developed methylsig a genome_wide analysis_pipeline for use with bis seq rrbs or errbs data methylsig utilizes a betabinomial model across the samples in each defined group for each cpg_site or region to identify either dmcs or dmrs it can also incorporate local information across a chromosome to improve estimates of variances and or methylation_levels methylsig offers annotation functions to map dmcs dmrs to gene structures and a unique data visualization approach to view several aspects of the data simultaneously across the genome providing a platform from which to process analyse and visualize genome_wide data statistical_analysis of genome_wide bis seq experiments with multiple biological_samples per group is challenging due to heterogeneous read_coverage and methylation_levels relatively small_sample and the large number of tests required for a site_specific analysis appropriately applying a statistical_method to adjust for biological_variation and using information from nearby cpg_sites to improve estimation can significantly reduce the false_positive while maximizing power here we introduced methylsig a genome_wide analysis_pipeline for bis seq or rrbs errbs data that estimates biological_variation using a beta_binomial approach and maintains a well calibrated type_i methylsig is able to incorporate local information to improve the estimation of variances and group methylation_levels our simulation_results show that in terms of sensitivity methylsig outperforms both standard statistical_tests such as the t test and wilcoxon rank test as well as bsmooth and the binomial_test of methylkit under a variety of realistic scenarios our method reduces false_positive by filtering out sites that have a high difference in percent methylation but are too heterogeneous or have very low of coverage in many samples to be of biological_relevance our analyses using errbs methylation data from aml and nbm samples showed that methylsig can lead to statistically and biologically_relevant results one subgroup of aml samples had mutations in either idh or idh nearly all of the dmcs in cancers with neomorphic idh mutations are expected to be hypermethylated because they lead to abnormally_high levels of hydroxyglutarate which is a direct inhibitor of the tet dna demethylases required to convert mc to hmc similarly loss_of in tet result in impaired dna_demethylation although most of the dmcs in the tet mutant subgroup are also expected to be hypermethylated this occurs to a lesser degree than for the idh group due to the possible partial compensation by other tet proteins the great majority of dmcs identified by methylsig in these two subgroups were hypermethylated compared to methylkit which uses a binomial model without adjusting for biological_variation we demonstrated that our approach performs favorably in terms of type_i and correlation between significance and percent methylation change recently more sophisticated methods based on bayesian hierarchical_models have been published although these methods also make use of a betabinomial model they differ from methylsig by using priors for the methylation_levels or dispersion parameters based on the entire data methylsig in contrast incorporates local information for methylation_levels and or dispersion parameters for sites that are highly_heterogeneous in both groups methylsig may not be able to identify regions that are important for a subgroup of samples this is similar to other traditional statistical_methods that test for significant_group in this case a test for a significant subgroup such as cancer outlier profile analysis used for expression data and implemented in oncomine may be more appropriate in cases where one of the groups e g controls is more homogeneous users may estimate variance based only on that group in order to identify regions potentially important in a subset of the diseased samples which are likely more heterogeneous overall methylsig can also be used to analyse alternative cytosine_methylation contexts finally the methylsig r package provides a unique visualization approach and useful annotation functions
