data_and chemspot a hybrid system for chemical named_entity motivation the accurate identification of chemicals in text is important for many applications including computer_assisted reconstruction of metabolic_networks or retrieval of information about substances in drug_development but due to the diversity of naming conventions and traditions for such molecules this task is highly complex and should be supported by computational_tools results we present chemspot a named_entity ner tool for identifying mentions of chemicals in natural_language texts including trivial names drugs abbreviations molecular formulas and international_union of pure and applied chemistry entities since the different classes of relevant entities have rather different naming characteristics chemspot uses a hybrid_approach combining a conditional_random with a dictionary it achieves an f measure of on the scai corpus outperforming the only other freely_available chemical ner tool oscar by percentage_points metabolic and signaling_networks representing complex physiological_processes play_an in systems_biology and drug research for instance simulation_results derived from recently_published human metabolic_networks provided substantial insight into functional biochemical relationships at the systems level such networks are typically built by a group of biological experts that systematically scan relevant publications and extract the important information which is a particularly tedious and time consuming task requiring considerable expertise natural_language nlp can accelerate this process especially by automatically pre annotating network_components e g chemicals and proteins and their interactions such annotations if of high_quality can considerably help to speed up literature curation accordingly most work has been invested in the development of tools for named_entity ner of biomedical entities while these tools mainly focus on identifying genes and protein_names in this work we address chemical names a task which has not received much attention yet to whom correspondence should be addressed finding mentions of chemicals in text is hindered by the fact that there exist various and highly_heterogeneous ways of naming them this includes trivial names e g water brand names e g voltaren systematic international_union of pure and applied chemistry iupac names e g adenosine hydrogen phosphate generic or family names e g alcohols company codes e g ici molecular formulas e g cooh and identifiers of various databases on top many of these names are used in abbreviated form e g dms for dimethyl sulfate a number of nomenclature organizations exist and strive for systematic naming in the biochemical field such as the iupac and the international_union of biochemistry and molecular_biology iubmb however most of their rules are only recommendations leaving ample room for variation in their appliance for instance separating digits in systematic chemical names using dashes or commas is equally valid in contrast both the existence as well as the non existence of brackets and whitespaces can be crucial for the correct identification of chemicals for instance the placement of spaces between methyl ethyl and malonate results in four different chemical_structures this situation accounts for a high amount of possible synonyms for one chemical entity sometimes these synonyms do not even share a single pair of adjacent letters e g in the case of phthalonitrile and o dicyanobenzene chemical ner also tends to be sensible to spelling errors which is especially crucial in long formulas and errors during document transformations for instance through inappropriate tokenization or sentence splitting even small errors may change the meaning of a chemical name completely for instance brecher points out that several pairs of different structures differ only by one single character e g methylamine and menthylamine on top of these problems also homonyms are common place especially when it comes to abbreviations despite this heterogeneity names for chemical_structures in text can roughly be divided_into two classes a rather closed finite class for brand and trivial names and an open infinite class for names following rule_based conventions e g iupac names in this article we show that using a proper method for recognizing entities in each of these two classes enables the construction of a high_quality chemical ner system we built chemspot a tool which combines into a single system the two most prominent methods in ner machine_learning and dictionary matching chemspot uses a conditional_random crf to achieve high_quality in recognizing iupac names as dictionary chemspot uses chemidplus http www nlm nih gov pubs factsheets chemidplusfs html which allows when applied with a proper matching algorithm tokenization method post_processing rules high_quality annotation of trivial and brandfirst we compare chemspot with oscar current alpha release and oscar on the scai corpus using standard configurations for oscar and oscar the memm is used with a confidence threshold of only chemical annotations are considered the reaction adjective enzyme and prefix annotations of oscar and oscar are out of scope as well as the modifier annotations provided by the scai corpus we then separately evaluate the performance of chemspots dictionary component furthermore we provide a detailed comparison of chemspots crf component with that ofon the iupac test corpus results are shown_inand finally we compare chemspot to metamap as other tools such as drugner are largely based on metamap further analysis will be provided in section
