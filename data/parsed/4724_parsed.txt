transcript structure and domain display a customizable transcript visualization_tool transcript structure and domain display tsdd is a publicly_available web_based program that provides publication quality images of transcript structures and domains tsdd is capable of producing transcript structures from gff gff and bed files alternatively the gff files of several model_organisms have been pre loaded so that users only needs to enter the locus ids of the transcripts to be displayed visualization of transcripts provides many benefits to researchers ranging from evolutionary_analysis of dna_binding to predictive function modeling availability_and tsdd is freely_available users atdue to high_demand for publication quality transcript visualization software there have been several software solutions available for researchers each of these solutions has advantages and drawbacks for instance geca which can be used online or downloaded to a server for offline usage has a relatively quick runtime and has an appealing user_interface however it is difficult to use and lacks customizable features and custom motifs geca also requires the dna_sequence protein_sequence and a gff file which could pose a problem for those who may not have this information available featurestacks advantages include relatively high_quality images and the capacity to display custom domains however featurestack lacks an online version requiring users to download and install a program onto their server fancygene is highly customizable allowing selection of feature colors feature sizes and custom motifs however it can only display a single gene at a time gsdraw produces customizable high_quality images with the capability of custom motifs in addition gsdraw provides users with a phylogenetic_tree however gsdraw has a long_run time requires both the genomic and cds sequences and cannot utilize a gff file gsds is a fast easy to use webbased program that requires only a gff file and produces customizable results that include custom motifs and a phylogenetic_tree however gsds has some limitations gsds can only process a maximum of genes at a time which may pose a problem when studying large gene_families for example the wrky gene_family contains well over genes in many species other limitations of gsds include the inability to select a font or font size gsds also lacks the capability to vertically space genes so when the size of gene features is enlarged the genes overlap herein we report an alternative and enhanced transcript display software that is fast easy to use web_based and resolves issues with other transcript visualization software tsdd is capable of providing researchers with publication quality images that can be customized and downloaded
