systems_biology voronto mapper for expression data to ontologies motivation several techniques analyze gene_expression data from the point_of of biological ontologies these methods focus on statistical and numerical analyses but there is an additional need for fast global and interactive_visualizations of gene_expression data in the context of biological ontologies results voronto addresses these needs with an easy to use integration of custom gene_expression data with custom or public ontologies in order to do that it implements voronoi diagrams where ontologies are mapped with gene_expression providing a quick hierarchy browsing and integration with ontologys resources availability the tool is available atfunction and relation focused techniques are gaining interest as part of expression data analyses the growing of existing biological_knowledge and its consolidation into structured ontologies make it possible to integrate such information into the analysis process the results of these techniques are usually lists of enriched terms which focus on statistical_significance and other numerical information disregarding non enriched terms hierarchical relationships and expression levels it is therefore hard if not impossible to get a picture of expression data in the context of the whole ontology at hand and to easily inspect it here we present voronto a tool that integrates expression data and biological ontologies allowing the analyst to explore the whole ontology and detect changes on expression_patterns inside the ontology the tool has been tested with several expression data from different organisms and experimental contexts see supplementary_information for some use cases biologists testing of the tool suggests that it is useful on a top_down approach start by the highest levels of the ontology and narrow down the search to differentially_expressed lower terms helped by the profile bar and the gene heatmap it has also been used with success in bottom up approaches starting with genes or terms known to be relevant for the experiment and searching them in the ontology to determine biological relations or expression_patterns as an example inwe can easily_identify sulfur metabolism as highly_expressed and at the same time we can check other terms e g rna transport with no significant expression or peroxisome slightly underexpressed or other time points for sulfur metabolism is a peak around c phase with no significant expression earlier or later on from there we can go up on the hierarchy to check for more generic behaviors or narrow down to identify the genes involved in sulfur metabolism voronto unburdens the analyst from mapping ontologies to gene_expression and offers a clean general_view of the hierarchy it favors exploration in the context of the ontologys resources and the experimental_conditions complementing functional_enrichment common in systems_biology studies these characteristics make voronto a powerful yet simple and fast way to study expression data in the context of ontologies the term sulfur metabolism with nine mapped genes is highlighted and its profile bar for the whole time series shown at the bottom right top and center first and second levels of the hierarchy sulfur metabolism belongs to metabolism and energy_metabolism right bottom heatmap with sulfur metabolism annotatd genes showing the overexpression at is mostly due to three of them
