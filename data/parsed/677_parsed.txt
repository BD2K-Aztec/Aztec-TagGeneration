bayesian integration of networks without gold_standards motivation biological_experiments give insight into networks of processes inside a cell but are subject to error and uncertainty however due to the overlap between the large number of experiments reported in public_databases it is possible to assess the chances of individual observations being correct in order to do so existing_methods rely on high_quality gold_standard reference networks but such reference networks are not always available results we present a novel algorithm for computing the probability of network interactions that operates without gold_standard reference data we show that our algorithm outperforms existing gold_standard based_methods finally we apply the new algorithm to a large collection of genetic_interaction and proteinprotein_interaction experiments availability the integrated dataset and a reference implementation of the algorithm as a plug in for the ondex data_integration framework are available for download at http bio nexus ncl ac uk projects nogold contact a significant proportion of knowledge about molecular biological_processes is distributed over a large number of online_databases this knowledge has been obtained through experiments performed in laboratories all over the world overlaps often exist across the contents of these databases the sub discipline of integrative bioinformatics aims at collating this knowledge and making it accessible to both humans and computers a popular integration paradigm is the construction of functional_networks functional_networks represent different types of relationships between biological_entities in an abstract manner associations such as genetic_interactions gis proteinprotein_interactions ppis to whom correspondence should be addressed gene_regulation and co expression are combined into simple abstract statements of functional relatedness which are termed functional interactions an alternative paradigm is semantic data_integration these approaches aim at representing the biological_information and as much of its meaning as possible in a computationally accessible fashion rather than generalizing over all types of associations between entities to infer functional interactions each type of association is considered separately an important question regarding such networks is how to assess the degree of confidence in each statement that is how likely the statement is to be correct several popular solutions to this problem exist for functional_networks these methods assess the quality of each input dataset against one or more additional datasets of higher quality usually manually_curated collections based on the confidence measures gained from this comparison it is then possible to calculate a confidence measure for each functional interaction the high_quality datasets used in these comparisons are often referred to as gold_standards the method described byevaluates each evidential dataset against such a gold_standard and obtain a log likelihood_score lls subsequently for each interaction in question a weighted_sum is formed over the lls scores of those datasets that report the interaction the weights are chosen in a manner that represents the degree of dependency between the datasets lycett describes a method that extends the original method of lee et_al not only one but several different gold_standards are used to generate lls scores for the datasets furthermore instead of creating a score for each interaction via the weighted_sum described above this method computes an existence probability from the original lls scores and then averages over the different probabilities according to the different gold_standards the authors show that any bias inherent in the used gold_standards can thus be overcome these methods work very well for functional_networks however inferring confidence assessments for semantic networks rather than functional_networks is more challenging because each single type of association must be scored separately reliable gold_standards
