genome_analysis oncofuse a computational framework for the prediction of the oncogenic_potential of gene_fusions motivation gene_fusions resulting from chromosomal_aberrations are an important cause of cancer the complexity of genomic changes in certain cancer_types has hampered the identification of gene_fusions by molecular_cytogenetic methods especially in carcinomas this is changing with the advent_of which is detecting a substantial number of new fusion_transcripts in individual cancer_genomes however this poses the challenge of identifying those fusions with greater oncogenic_potential amid a background of passenger fusion sequences results in the present work we have used some recently identified genomic hallmarks of oncogenic fusion_genes to develop a pipeline for the classification of fusion sequences namely oncofuse the pipeline predicts the oncogenic_potential of novel fusion_genes calculating the probability that a fusion sequence behaves as driver of the oncogenic process based on features present in known oncogenic fusions cross_validation and extensive validation tests on independent_data suggest a robust behavior with good precision and recall_rates we believe that oncofuse could become a useful tool to guide experimental validation_studies of novel fusion sequences found during next_generation analysis of cancer transcriptomes availability_and oncofuse is a naive_bayes network classifier trained and tested using weka machine_learning package one of the most common types of somatic_mutation in the human cancer gene census involves chromosomal_translocations that fuse two different genes resulting in a chimeric transcript it is estimated that of all cancers are caused by gene_fusions driven by chromosomal_translocations and the number of reported clinical cases is growing rapidly there is compelling_evidence that fusions represent an initial event in oncogenesis and play_an in aggressive_cancer cases many gene_fusions are translated as fusion_proteins with oncogenic_potential due to the presence of protein_domains that are normally located in separate proteins examples of recurrent fusions are bcr_abl which is present in chronic_myeloid cases or tmprss_erg found in prostate_cancers most chromosomal_translocations involved in cancer cases are described in several databases for example hundreds of gene_fusions associated with clinical reports are included in mitelman database http cgap nci nih gov chro mosomes mitelman although it does not contain sequence_data our database of fusion sequences ticdb http www unav es genetica ticdb allows the precise mapping of breakpoint positions and facilitates analysis of the structure of fusion_genes another database chimerdb http ercsb ewha ac kr fusiongene contains several thousand putative fusions predicted solely from sequences present in publicly_available databases owing to the complex type of rearrangements sustained by the genomes of solid_tumors most gene_fusions have been identified and characterized in hematological hem neoplasms however novel next_generation ngs_technologies coupled with sophisticated algorithms allow the detection of gene_fusions with extraordinary sensitivity even in solid_tumors some reliable predictions detect fusion junctions at sequencing_reads per million it is reasonable to expect that this unprecedented sensitivity will lead to the discovery of hundreds of novel and rare fusion sequences in various cancer_types raising the question of how many of these mutations are important for cancer development and not just passenger events this is even more relevant in the context of emerging data obtained from high_throughput studies which demonstrate the presence of fusion_transcripts in normal cells as had been suggested in earlier_studies to solve this issue a deep_understanding of fusion driven oncogenesis is required the enrichment of certain combinations of functional_domains and domain families in gene_fusions has been highlighted by previous_studies likewise we have recently identified some genomic hallmarks of oncogenic fusion_genes using information from public_databases in addition to promoter or untranslated_region utr swapping that leads to well known expression changes in fusion_proteins these hallmarks include the combination of specific protein_domains and protein interaction interfaces piis with novel oncogenic functions as well as features related to replication_timing we reasoned that this set of features could be used to predict the oncogenic_potential of novel fusion sequences found in tumor to whom correspondence should be addressed samples in this work we present oncofuse a robust bayesian_classifier that identifies fusion_genes that could behave as drivers of the oncogenic process based on their shared properties with known oncogenic fusions a previous work byrepresented the first attempt to distinguish driver and passenger_mutations by incorporating interactome pathway and gene_ontology go information to rank the genes under consideration here we have followed a different approach as our goal is to predict whether a given fusion sequence is driver in this regard our tool is focused on fusion sequences whereas previous strategies were gene centered predicting whether a gene is likely to undergo a fusion notably a recent article deals with the problem of distinguishing driver and passenger missense point_mutations not gene_fusions using a classifier trained on a large number of protein sequence_features from positive_and sets although not directly comparable with our pipeline that study highlights the potential of classification strategies for the identification of driver_mutations in cancer it is estimated that of all cancers are caused by gene_fusions driven by chromosomal_translocations but it is reasonable to predict that this figure will increase during the next years as more samples from solid_tumors notably epi will be analyzed with ngs_technologies sequencing of cancer transcriptomes will yield large lists of chimeric fusion_genes and it will be a challenge to identify which of those are actually contributing to the initiation or progression of cancer the oncogenic_role of gene_fusions like other types of mutations is usually judged by their recurrence if they are found in different samples or in different tumor_types they are considered to be important for cancer development however this view is probably over simplistic considering recent_findings showing that many mutations important for cancer development are private i e non recurrent because the same biological_pathways can be inactivated by mutations in different genes furthermore it is unclear that all recurrent fusion sequences must necessarily be oncogenic for instance we found four recurrent fusions in ngs_data from cancer_cells that were also present as natural read through transcripts in normal cells it is reasonable to predict that the increasing use of rna_seq to interrogate cancer_genomes will yield recurrent fusions that will turn out to be passenger events rendering recurrence a weaker argument for oncogenic_potential therefore it is necessary to develop tools to reliably_predict the oncogenic_potential of gene_fusions that play_a in cancer development regardless of whether they are recurrent in this article we present oncofuse a novel algorithm that provides an accurate classification of driver and passenger fusion_genes with probability estimates which could be of great help to rank fusions detected by ngs in tumor_samples and thus prioritize experimental validation_studies a summary of the analysis_pipeline used in this study is presented in supplementary building on our previous identification of several genomic hallmarks of oncogenic driver fusion sequences we generated a carefully_selected set of genomic_features that were used to train a bayesian_classifier showing good precision and recall_rates in cross validation_studies thus when a researcher is faced with a list of fusion_genes detected by ngs studies in cancer_genomes oncofuse will extract the same set of genomic_features and will return a p value for the probability that each fusion in the list is driver as well as some additional information about its functional profile we observed that functional profiles of fusion_proteins provide a substantial amount of information on whether a fusion is likely to be driver molecular_functions related to tf transcription co factor kinase histone_modification protein isomerization and gtpase related are enriched in driver fusion_proteins this is consistent with our previous observations in hem malignancies and seems to be a common hallmark of all driver gene_fusions regardless their tissue of origin ngs and ngs_datasets used in this study are exclusively of epi origin this is a important point because it justifies the use of the same classifier for fusions from different sources by adjusting only gene_expression features the fact that tissue_specific of fusion partner_genes are robustly replicated for the three tissues examined in this study helps to explain that oncofuse assigns more significant p values in the tissue where a fusion was identified compared with other tissues thus even though the original features used to construct the classifier were based on insights taken mostly from hem malignancies oncofuse will also classify gene_fusions from mes and epi cancers if expression data of both partner_genes are provided although there are a few algorithms for the identification of chimeric fusion sequences in ngs_data the only attempt to the best of our knowledge to distinguish driver from passenger rearrangements was performed by chinnaiyan and colleagues in however our strategy is different in several important aspects first wang et_al made their predictions based on the properties of entire partner_genes such as go annotations and their position in the interactome whereas we use features retained or lost in fusion_genes or in the proteins encoded by them these features like the loss of specific protein_domains the co occurrence of domain combinations or promoter and utr swapping could yield information that is not correctly described by simply summarizing the annotations of the parent genes frenkel moreover we show that the analysis of protein_domains yields meaningful functional signatures that allow the distinction between driver and passenger gene_fusions another important difference is that our pipeline takes_into expression data as changes in the expression of partner_genes are common in gene_fusions notably among the top genes identified by wang et_al as those more likely to undergo a fusion there is a fold enrichment for cgc proto_oncogenes not reported to be involved in translocations whereas proto_oncogenes present in mitelman database i e involved in translocations are enriched only fold this suggests that their predictions some of which have been validated experimentally are biased towards known oncogenes whether involved in fusions or not although our approach might also be affected by this bias in favor of known oncogenes of cgc oncogenes are predicted to be driver we have tried to minimize this problem by including features that are retained or lost as a result of the fusion therefore the predictive_accuracy of our pipeline should be even better even though these results support a robust behavior of the classifier we set out to validate it in various ways using results from several independent datasets containing several thousand fusions reported in recent ngs and est mrna studies we found that they were moderately but significantly_enriched in predicted driver fusions whereas only a small number_of were found among chimeric_transcripts identified in normal cells likewise those datasets with more confident gene_fusion predictions showed a higher percentage of fusions classified as driver by oncofuse furthermore pathway analysis showed that fusions predicted to be driver in these datasets involve genes that participate in key oncogenic_pathways for example we found that many predicted driver fusions could lead to oncogenesis by disrupting normal cell_adhesion which is one of the hallmarks of cancer this is an interesting finding especially given the fact that the datasets analyzed were obtained mostly from epi tissues in which this pathway plays_a in carcinogenesis martin finally we were able to test the performance of oncofuse in new datasets that have been made available since its construction first oncofuse would have correctly_classified of the gene_fusions published in cancer samples in this period until april second we tested the classifier on the lists of candidates detected by gene_fusion detection_algorithms in rna_seq studies although the real number of gene_fusions with oncogenic properties in such datasets is unknown because only a few candidates are tested_experimentally fusions with support from published experimental_studies were given higher probabilities of being driver in summary we present a robust bayesian_classifier supported by extensive validation_studies we believe that oncofuse could become a useful computational_tool to aid in the prediction of the oncogenic_potential of novel fusion_genes detected by ngs in the transcriptomes of cancer samples in this way it should help to prioritize which candidates should be tested_experimentally and thus speed up the identification of novel fusion_genes with a relevant role in the diagnosis classification and treatment of cancer patients
