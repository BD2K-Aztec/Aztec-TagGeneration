multifactor_dimensionality for graphics_processing enables genome_wide testing of epistasis in sporadic_als motivation epistasis the presence of genegene_interactions has been hypothesized to be at the root of many common human_diseases but current genome_wide largely ignore its role multifactor_dimensionality mdr is a powerful model free method for detecting epistatic relationships between genes but computational costs have made its application to genome_wide data difficult graphics_processing gpus the hardware responsible for rendering computer games are powerful parallel processors using gpus to run mdr on a genome_wide dataset allows for statistically_rigorous testing of epistasis results the implementation of mdr for gpus mdrgpu includes core_features of the widely used java software_package mdr this gpu_implementation allows for large_scale analysis of epistasis at a dramatically lower cost than the standard cpu based implementations as a proof_of we applied this software to a genome_wide study of sporadic_amyotrophic als we discovered a statistically_significant two snp classifier and subsequently replicated the significance of these two snps in an independent study of als mdrgpu makes the large_scale analysis of epistasis tractable and opens_the to statistically_rigorous testing of interactions in genome_wide datasets availability mdrgpu is open_source and available free of charge from http www sourceforge net_projects mdr genome_wide hold_promise for the discovery of the genetic_factors that underlie common human_diseases unfortunately this promise has largely not been realized it is thought that this failure could be due to epistasis the role of genegene_interactions which has commonly been ignored in these studies powerful and model_free such as multifactor_dimensionality mdr have been developed but an exhaustive examination of even pair_wise interactions in a snp dataset would require the analysis of combinations while an analysis of this scale is approachable with modern cluster computing an analysis that includes permutation_testing to assess_the of results remains infeasible with cpu based_approaches rendering photo realistic video_games in real_time is also computationally difficult for video_game graphics specific hardware the graphics_processing or gpu has been developed the gpu is a massively parallel_computing platform that can be adapted to some scientific tasks we have previously shown that mdr is one of these tasks here we provide software which makes practical the analysis of epistasis in genome_wide data through the use of gpus and demonstrate its application to a genome_wide analysis of epistasis of sporadic_amyotrophic als page our three gpu systems completed an analysis of pairwise interactions in a single permutation approximately every min the time to analyze the dataset itself for pairwise interactions is the same as the time required for one permutation one thousand permutations were used to assess_statistical which required h the time to analyze the same dataset on a cluster with amd opteron ghz cpu cores was just over h without permutation_testing and thus a cpu based permutation_test was considered infeasible as the estimated time required on cpu cores was days in the proof_of analysis the highest_accuracy combination in our dataset was snps rs and rs with a balanced accuracy of in our permutation_test this accuracy was statistically_significant p in the replication dataset this pair had a balanced accuracy of permutation_testing the replication dataset showed that this result was also statistically_significant p therefore not only have we discovered a statistically_significant pair of snps using an experiment wise of but we have replicated the significant relationship in an independent dataset here is evidence of how the permutation_testing allowed by mdrgpu enables the discovery of combinations of snps that are significantly associated with a disease while snp_rs has been reported as associated with disease in it did not have a statistically_significant effect inwhen considered alone p and would have failed to replicate without considering pairwise effects snp_rs has not previously been described as associated with sporadic_als although it shows main effects uncorrected p in both datasets have shown that snps can fail to replicate a significant association when the joint_effect of those snps is ignored this is particularly likely when the populations from which patients are ascertained differs collected individuals from the usa whilecollected individuals from ireland by considering the joint_effect of snps mdrgpu discovers a novel association which replicates in an independent dataset gpus provide a platform for epistasis_analysis in genome_wide data where computational requirements far exceed what cpus can cost effectively provide mdrgpu is a software_package for this emerging computing platform that enables human geneticists to tackle analyses previously found to be intractable
