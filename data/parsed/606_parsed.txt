automated profiling of individual cell_cell from high_throughput time lapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids timing motivation there is a need for effective automated methods for profiling dynamic cellcell interactions with single_cell resolution from high_throughput time lapse imaging data especially the interactions between immune_effector and tumor_cells in adoptive_immunotherapy results fluorescently_labeled human t cells natural_killer nk and various target cells nalm k el were co incubated on polydimethylsiloxane arrays of sub nanoliter wells nanowells and imaged using multi_channel time lapse microscopy the proposed cell segmenta tion and tracking algorithms account for cell variability and exploit the nanowell confinement property to increase the yield of correctly analyzed nanowells from existing algorithms to for wells containing one effector and a single target enabling automated quantification of cell locations morphologies movements interactions and deaths without the need for manual proofreading automated analysis of recordings from different experiments demonstrated automated nanowell delineation accuracy automated cell segmentation accuracy and automated cell_tracking accuracy of with default_parameters despite variations in illumination staining imaging noise cell_morphology and cell clustering an example analysis revealed that nk_cells efficiently discriminate between live and dead targets by altering the duration of conjugation the data also demonstrated that cytotoxic cells display higher motility than non killers bothdynamic cell behaviors especially cellcell interactions are of vital interest in immunology cancer_biology and stem_cell engineering automated time lapse microscopy of live cells in vitro is a well established method for spatiotemporal recording of cells and biomolecules and tracking multi cellular_interactions unfortunately most conventional methods assess limited_numbers of manuallysampled representative cell pairs leading to subjective bias and therefore lack the ability to quantify the behaviors of statistically under represented cells reliably this is significant since many biologically_significant cellular subpopulations like tumor stem_cells multi killer immune_cells and biotechnologically relevant protein secreting_cells are rare there is a need for methods to sample cellcell interaction events on a larger scale to investigate such cellular phenomena recent_advances have enabled the fabrication of large arrays of sub nanoliter wells nanowells cast onto transparent biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane substrates small groups of living_cells from clinical samples and laboratory engineered cells can be confined to nanowells and imaged over extended durations by multi_channel time lapse microscopy allowing thousands of controlled cellular_events to be recorded as an array of multi_channel movies we refer to this method as time lapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids timing the spatial_confinement can enable a rich sampling of localized cellular phenomena including cell movements cellular_alterations and cellcell interaction_patterns along with the relevant intra cellular_event markers timing is thus ideally_suited for tracking cell_migration and interactions at short distances but if cell migratory patterns over larger distances are of interest arrays with larger wells can be fabricated similarly if unconfined migratory behavior of cells is desired other methods have been described the promise and challenge of nanowell arrays is high_throughput eliminating the need for user selection of events of interest and the ability to repeatedly follow the same cell s over time illustrates a timing dataset consisting of nanowells containing fluorescently_tagged human car t cells red and nalm tumor_cells green that were imaged by time lapse microscopy over time points at min intervals to yield an array of channel movies one per nanowell the border nanowells from each block are discarded yielding usable nanowells block timing datasets vary in size between gb and tb depending upon the array size and the number of time points a sample timing dataset corresponding to one block is provided as supplementary_material a production datasets are often of lower_quality than the example in for example see and exhibit natural cellular variability variations in signal_to snr staining variations focus drift spectral overlap between fluorochromes and photobleaching our goal is to develop highly automated pipeline of algorithms that can reliably segment and track the cells in timing datasets with minimal parameter_tuning and yield a sufficiently rich set of cellularscale measurements for statistical profiling without the need for manual proofreading supplementary_material b a direct_application of general_purpose segmentation and tracking algorithms is not a viable strategy since their yield the number of correctly analyzed nanowells is surprisingly low and their parameter_tuning needs are high for example a direct_application of alsegmentation algorithm with a reported accuracy that is the core of the opensource farsight toolkit farsight toolkit org to the dataset inproduces an error_free yield of only of the nanowells for the basic case when a nanowell contains one effector and one target the situation with tracking algorithms is similar for example in analyzing one sample block containing nanowells out of which contained at least one cell a state of the art algorithm accurately tracked only six nanowells withan array of nanowells arranged in blocks of with usable inner nanowells block b enlarged views of five blocks highlighted by the red box in panel a c timeseries data at min intervals for

bioinformatics online zero errors yield of supplementary_material c when the yield falls below manual proofreading is essential to identify the nanowells that were tracked accurately if on the other hand when the automated accuracy exceeds the user can simply accept the automated results and the modest error that they entail general_purpose segmentation and tracking algorithms are inadequate because they do not exploit the powerful constraints that are germane to timing datasets specifically the spatial_confinement of cells and rarity of cell_divisions they also lack mechanisms to cope with the higher morphological variability and non uniform fluorescence of cell_bodies compared with cell_nuclei that were heavily studied in the prior literature in this article we present algorithms that exploit the confinement and cell_cycle constraints and utilize novel segmentation approaches to increase the yield to for the basic case noted above results section compareversus and deliver high tracking accuracies at this level of performance the quantitative_measurements derived from automated_segmentation and tracking can be directly utilized for statistical studies without the need for manual proofreading the following sections describe our methodology
