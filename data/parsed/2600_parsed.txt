jdet interactive calculation and visualization of function related conservation patterns in multiple_sequence and structures we have implemented in a single package all the features required for extracting visualizing and manipulating fully conserved positions as well as those with a family dependent conservation pattern in multiple_sequence the program allows among other things to run different methods for extracting these positions combine the results and visualize them in protein d structures and sequence spaces availability_and jdet is a multiplatform application written in java it is freely_available including the source_code at http csbg cnb csic es jdet the package includes two of our recently_developed programs for detecting functional positions in protein_alignments xdet and s det and support for other methods can be added as plug_ins a help file and a guided tutorial for jdet are also available sequence_based protein functional analysis has become a fundamental part of a number of studies multiple_sequence msas of protein_families are valuable sources of structural and functional information these msas can be obtained from the vast_amounts of genomic_information coming from high_throughput initiatives and there are many resources with automatically pre compiled alignments for thousands of families msas can be used to assess the importance of the different residues for a given protein the most obvious important positions are those not allowed to change fully conserved conserved positions were the first indicators of functionality and consequently many methods were developed for detecting them most protein_families can be subdivided into subfamilies with different functional specificities a division which is reflected in the to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address bioprocess engineering max planck institute for dynamics of complex technical systems magdeburg germany structure of the msa this division is related to a class of positions with a subfamily dependent conservation pattern i e the conserved amino_acid is different for the different subfamilies these positions are intuitively related to sites with some importance for defining the functional specificity of the different subfamilies within the msa and for that reason they are commonly known as specificity determining positions sdps a plethora of methods have been developed which based on different concepts try to detect these positions the presence of sdps in protein regions related to functional and interaction specificity has been recently shown to be a widespread phenomenon moreover the role of sdps automatically extracted from msas in controlling the functional specificity of the family has been in many cases experimentally demonstrated by mutating the corresponding residues see for example working with sdps usually involves running different programs for extracting them from msas interactively visualizing and combining their results and mapping them onto protein_structures when available since no single package implemented all these capabilities we developed jdet a user_friendly program which contains all the features we consider practical and indispensable for the daily work with sdps and conserved positions based on our own experience working with subfamilies and sdps we have implemented in jdet all the features we consider useful for that activity previously these operations had to be done manually or by integrating diverse software although some of these features are individually present in existing resources oriented to sdps e g treedet server or to msas in general e g jalview no single package integrates all of them for this reason we think this software would be really useful for people working in extracting functional features from msas
