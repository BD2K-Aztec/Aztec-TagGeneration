sinvict ultra sensitive detection of single_nucleotide and indels in circulating tumour dna motivation successful development and application of precision oncology approaches require robust elucidation of the genomic landscape of a patients cancer and ideally the ability to monitor therapy induced genomic changes in the tumour in an inexpensive and minimally_invasive manner thanks to recent_advances liquid biopsy the sampling of patients bodily fluids such as blood and urine is considered as one of the most promising approaches to achieve_this in many cancer patients and especially those with advanced metastatic_disease deep_sequencing of circulating_cell cfdna obtained from patients blood yields a mixture of reads originating from the normal dna and from multiple tumour subclones called circulating tumour dna or ctdna the ctdna cfdna ratio as well as the proportion of ctdna originating from specific tumour subclones depend on multiple factors making comprehensive detection of mutations difficult especially at early_stages of cancer furthermore sensitive and accurate detection of snvs and indels from cfdna is constrained by several factors such as the sequencing_errors and pcr artifacts and mapping errors related to repeat regions within the genome in this paper we introduce sinvict a computational_method that increases the sensitivity_and of snv and indel detection at very low variant allele_frequencies sinvict has the capability to handle multiple sequencing_platforms with different error properties it minimises false_positives resulting from mapping errors and other technology specific artifacts including strand bias and low base_quality at read ends sinvict also has the capability to perform time series analysis where samples from a patient sequenced at multiple time points are jointly examined to report locations of interest where there is a possibility that certain clones were wiped out by some treatment while some subclones gained selective_advantage results we tested sinvict on simulated_data as well as prostate_cancer and cfdna obtained from castration_resistant patients on both simulated and biological data sinvict was able to detect snvs and indels with variant allele percentages as low as the lowest amounts of total dna used for the biological data where snvs and indels could be detected with very high_sensitivity were ng on the ion_torrent platform and ng on illumina with increased sequencing and mapping accuracy sinvict might be utilised in clinical_settings making it possible to track the progress of point_mutations and indels that are associated with resistance to cancer_therapies and provide patients personalised treatment we also compared sinvict with other popular snv callers such as mutect varscan and freebayes our results show that sinvict performs better than these tools in most cases and allows further data exploration such as time series analysis on cfdna sequencing_data one of the most promising areas of precision oncology is the development of custom targeted_therapies tailored for a patient successful development and efficient application of such therapies require efficient and inexpensive identification and monitoring of therapy induced changes in a patients tumour dna unfortunately especially in advanced_stage cancers the main cause of cancers morbidity_and is the development of multiple metastatic_lesions often not easily_accessible for tissue_sampling for example in prostate_cancer more than of metastases occur in bone and or deep lymph_nodes biopsying such sites is associated with significant morbidity for the patients and thus is not commonly performed the existence of circulating_cell cfdna in mammalian blood has been known since cfdna is thought to be released from the dying necrotic apoptotic_cells both normal and tumour as has been shown in when mutated ras gene_fragments were detected in the blood of cancer patients see the non specific mechanism of generating cfdna results in integral representation of all tumour dna of a patient subject to sampling variability and possibly to tumours access to blood_stream in an earlier study for example we observed the presence of multiple mutated forms of ar androgen_receptor gene in cfdna of patients with castrate_resistant crpc that can be best explained by the presence of multiple subpopulations of cancer_cells in each patients body this integral representation of multiple tumour foci subclones provides an important advantage to the use of blood_plasma as a source of tumourderived dna unfortunately the presence of both normal and tumour dna in a patients blood poses_significant to the analysis of cfdna sequence_data to make matters worse tumour dna is many times derived from multiple subclones and is thus highly_heterogeneous an earlier study we performed on mutations in crpc patients demonstrated that cfdna comprised an average of iqr of ctdna based on the proportion of reads with mutations in ar there are several somatic and germline_mutation callers that were developed to find single_nucleotide snvs as well as indels within a given population using wgss whole_genome as well as to detect specific variants in a patients genome through sampling multiple_loci from the same patient examples_include gatk varscan freebayes strelka mutect and others most of these tools either use a frequentist or bayesian_approach to estimate the probability of a locus being an actual mutation instead of being a false_positive caused by noise due to sequencing or mapping errors among them varscan uses several heuristics to reduce the size of the candidate set and then applies some statistical_test like fishers exact on tumour benign pairs to call somatic_mutations it also provides post_processing capability to enable further filtering based on additional factors such as strand bias other tools such as freebayes mutect and strelka make use of the prior and posterior_probabilities of a location being mutated in a bayesian context in order to call mutations unfortunately these tools are not designed to work with i sequencing_data from patients at multiple time points ii very high read_depth e g k k average up to k and possibly more in the future or iii extremely_low dilutions can be as low as around variant allele percentage or iv samples with high intra tumour heterogeneity or v batches of samples that suffer from systematic noise in addition ctdna levels can also be below the analytical_sensitivity of existing ctdna detection approaches in patients with localized disease and in patients that have received therapy in order to address problems mentioned above we introduce sinvict a computational_tool that can handle very high read_depth and very low dilutions sinvict can be run on a single tumour sample on a batch of multiple tumour_samples or on multiple samples from a single patient sequenced at multiple time points this feature allows sinvict to process samples from a single patient in multiple cancer_stages as well as a group of different patients that are being sequenced and analyzed at the same time in cases where these samples have similar disease_progression and dilution levels sinvict can make use of the signal_to of the batch explained later to characterise the systematic noise and try to reduce the number_of due to the non uniformity of noise across the sequenced regions we evaluated robustness of sinvict on data obtained by two sequencing_platforms with distinct error_rates substitution in illumina indel in iontorrent which were applied to the same tumour_samples our experiments indicate that sinvict is highly_sensitive to calls on data generated by both sequencing_platforms for example three previously validated ar androgen_receptor gene_mutations in a mixture of rv and c cell_lines which were used as reference in ampliseq calibration and illumina calibration experiments were detected with almost identical sensitivity by sinvict sinvict was also able to detect previously validated mutations successfully from actual cfdna sequencing_data obtained from castrate_resistant crpc patients these findings_suggest that sinvict might be utilised in the analysis of deep_sequencing cancer data obtained from both ion_torrent and illumina sequencing_technologies as importantly sinvict addresses a unique problem and is not comparable to existing popular snv and indel callers e g gatk particularly because such tools typically process a fraction of the reads in datasets with high sequencing_depth since multiple occurrences of identical reads are marked as pcr duplicates however identical reads are to be expected in deep amplicon_sequencing and this is not necessarily an artifact of pcr in order to evaluate our method we performed the following experiments i we simulated insilico ctdna cfdna with varying dilutions to determine sinvicts performance precision_recall in snv detection ii we mixed rv and c prostate_cancer and sequenced them with ion_torrent and illumina technologies to emulate various tumour normal mixture levels to measure sinvicts snv as well as indel detection performance on a mixture of sequencing_data and finally iii we explored the time series analysis capabilities of sinvict on cell_free sequencing_data from castration_resistant patients we compared our method to widely used snv callers mutect varscan and freebayes in all the experiments sinvict outperforms freebayes furthermore our results show that sinvict performs better than mutect and varscan in most cases for ultra_deep data and allows further data exploration such as time series analysis on cfdna sequencing_data sinvict is a highly_accurate and sensitive tool for detection of snvs and short indels in circulating tumour dna at very low variant allele percentages mutation detection with high read_depth is often difficult due to sequencing_errors getting amplified with the amplicon technology used in most deep sequencing_platforms sinvict is capable of filtering mutation calls by several parameters such as the minimum read_depth strand bias etc we provide more details on the effect of filters on the experiments performed in section in supplementary table sinvict is also highly customisable allowing the user to fine_tune several parameters to achieve the desired_level of sensitivity_and timeseries analysis capabilities of sinvict might be utilised to gain insight to how certain drug_treatments affect the overall clonal composition for a patient results obtained from experiments on simulated_data suggest that at variant allele percentages below even increasing the read_depth indefinitely will not help with the calls unless the sequencing_errors are reduced results obtained from the cell_line experiments might allow us to speculate that ng for ampliseq and ng for illumina are the safest amounts of dna among our calibration samples from which a set of reliable calls can be obtained at all dilutions mentioned before
