genome_analysis a classification approach for dna_methylation with bisulfite next_generation with the advent_of sequencing_technology bisulfitesequencing based dna_methylation methods have emerged as the most promising approaches due to their single_base and genome_wide coverage however statistical_analysis methods for analyzing this type of methylation data are not well developed although the most widely used proportion based estimation method is simple and intuitive it is not statistically adequate in dealing with the various sources of noise in bisulfite sequen_cing data furthermore it is not biologically satisfactory in applications that require binary methylation status calls results in this article we use a mixture of binomial model to characterize bisulfite sequencing_data and based on the model we propose to use a classification based procedure called the methylation status calling msc procedure to make binary methylation status calls the msc procedure is optimal in terms of maximizing the overall correct allocation rate and the false_discovery fdr and false non discovery rate fndr of msc can be estimated to control fdr at any given level we further develop an fdr controlled msc procedure which combines a local fdr based adaptive procedure with the msc procedure both simulation_study and real_data application are carried_out to examine the performance of the proposed procedures it is shown in our simulation_study that the estimates of fdr and fndr of the msc procedure are appropriate simulation_study also demonstrates that the fdr controlled msc procedure is valid in controlling fdr at a prespecified level and is more powerful than the individual binomial testing procedure in the real_data application the msc procedure exhibits an estimated fdr of and an estimated fndr of the overall correct allocation rate is these results suggest the effectiveness of our proposed procedures availability_and the proposed procedures are implemented in r and are available atdna methylation is an epigenetic_modification to the genomic_dnas by adding the methyl_group to some c positions of dna_sequences it plays_a in a variety of biological_processes including cell development imprinting and x_chromosome it is prevalent at cpg positions with of all cpgs being methylated in mammals whereas it is much less frequent at non cpg_sites with only of non cpgs being found to be methylated unmethylated cpgs tend to cluster in small regions of dna_sequences called cpg islands most of which coincide with promoter_regions of many genes the link between abnormal dna_methylation pattern and cancer is fold first a global hypomethylation is associated with genomic_instability and is a common characteristic of cancer_cells second hypermethylation of cpg islands located at gene_promoters results in suppression of gene_expression and is conventionally observed in cancer_cells therefore it is desirable to reveal both genome_wide and promoter specific dna_methylation of a cell various methods for genome_wide detection have been developed in the past_years they can be classified into three categories which are methylation sensitive enzymebased methods enrichment based_methods and bisulfite_conversion based_methods in the past array based techniques such as microarray_technology were the leading platforms to be combined with methods from all those three categories to survey methylation status although the application of these platforms enables comprehensive dna_methylation at economical cost they can only interrogate c sites of given regions at moderate resolution recently next_generation ngs_technology has been incorporated into all three categories of methods for genome_wide profiling despite the fact that ngs equipped methods have relative advantages over array based_methods those methods from the first two categories are still subject to the same weaknesses they had when coupled with array based techniques more specifically methylation sensitive enzyme based_methods equipped with ngs_technology remain restricted to the recognition_sites of the particular enzymes used and enrichment based_methods equipped with ngs_technology do not overcome the disadvantage of moderate resolution on the other hand bisulfite_conversion based_methods coupled with ngs_technology designated as bisulfite_sequencing methods have emerged as the most promising methods as they generate whole_genome dna_methylation profiles at single_base among all bisulfite_sequencing methods methylcseq and reduced_representation rrbs are the two most popularly used methods in methylc seq genomic_dnas are first sonicated into smaller fragments after going through end repair and adapter ligation these fragments are treated with bisulfite the bisulfite_treatment converts unmethylated_cytosines into uracils and to whom correspondence should be addressed leaves methylated_cytosines unchanged subsequent pcr_amplification process further replaces uracils with thymines these pcr_amplified fragments are then subject to standard sequencing_technology to produce short_sequencing which are mapped back to the reference_genome thus the unmethylated_cytosines are distinguishable from methylated_cytosines by examining sequencing_reads the workflow for methylc seq experiment is given in supplementary_material section rrbs uses the same mechanism as methylc seq the major difference between rrbs and methylc seq occurs in the first step i e the way genomic_dnas are fragmented in rrbs genomic_dnas are digested with mspi an enzyme which cuts all ccgg sites these two methods have their relative advantages_and which make them suitable for different research_purposes by the way genomic_dnas are digested in rrbs cpg regions are substantially enriched in dna_fragments after size_selection thus rrbs is more preferable than methylc seq when the research is targeting regions with high_density of cpg_sites such as cpg islands on the other hand because of its theoretical capacity of capturing methylation information from each c position in the whole_genome methylc seq has become the golden_standard for genome_wide analysis as reported in when these two methods are applied to biological_replicates of human_embryonic methylc seq covers of all cpgs whereas rrbs shows a genome_wide cpg coverage of only in the data generated by methylc seq or rrbs ideally there are only c reads or t reads for each covered c position of interest depending on the methylation status in other words if a c position is methylated then there should be only c reads at that site in the data whereas if a c position is unmethylated then there should be only t reads however owing to various sources of noise in the real_data generated by these two methods there are both c reads and t reads for most of the target c sites for instance the process of bisulfite_conversion needs to be carried_out under specific experimental_conditions failure to meet any of those conditions would lead to incomplete conversion which further results in c reads at unmethylated c positions moreover as a typical and inevitable result of applying ngs_technology there will be sequencing_errors in the data which means a small proportion of c reads will be miscalled to be t reads and vice_versa because there are both c reads and t reads in the data it is not straightforward to infer the true methylation status the aim is then to make methylation call for each target c position based on the number of c reads and the number of t reads it receives which becomes an interesting statistical problem in some studies concerning dna_methylation analysis researchers use the ratio of c count to the total number of reads received at a site to quantify the methylation_level at that site the total number of reads received at a site is referred to as coverage or sequencing_depth although this quantification approach has the virtue of being simple and straightforward it does not use proper inference to deal with the noise in the data and thus it is not statistically satisfactory in other studies researchers aim to make binary methylation calls for c positions of interest there exist a few such approaches in the literature in the proportion of c count at each cpg_site was calculated and binary methylation call was made for each site with various choices of cutoff for the proportion however those choices were not statistically justified a more sophisticated method was used in which applied a multiple testing procedure to identify methylated_cytosines in the methylc seq experiment conducted by an unmethylated lambda dna was spiked with the target genomic_dnas before sonication and was used to estimate the error_rate at which a c count occurs at an unmethylated c position as will be shown in section and supplementary_material section the procedure used byis conservative in detecting unmethylated_cytosines due to the underestimation of error_rate and their choice of null_hypothesis in this article we propose to use a classification procedure based on a mixture of binomial model to make binary calls for methylation status as a by product the memberships generated in this procedure can be used for quantifying the methylation_levels the performance of the proposed procedure can be assessed by correct allocation rates as well as false_discovery fdr and false non discovery rate fndr motivated by the concern of controlling fdr at any given level we view our classification_problem from a multiple testing perspective then a component based on local_false lfdr is incorporated into the proposed classification procedure to provide an approach that is capable of controlling fdr at any prespecified level on the basis of the bayes rule the proposed classification procedure is optimal in terms of maximizing the overall correct allocation rate simulation_results demonstrate that the proposed classification procedure outperforms the conventional individual binomial testing procedure and is more accurate in detecting the true methylation status simulation_results also show the validity of the proposed fdr controlled procedure with various choices of fdr level owing to the fact that most non cpg_sites are unmethylated when evaluating our method with real_data we focus exclusively on cpg_sites however it is worth pointing out that our model can be applied to c positions of any context the real_dataset we use is from which was generated from a methylc seq experiment however our method is not restricted to methylc seq data and it can also be applied to other bisulfite sequencing_data the rest of the article is organized as follows section first gives the details of the mixture of binomial model and describes the proposed classification procedure and then it presents several performance assessment methods of the proposed procedure in the last part of section the fdr controlled procedure is introduced section reports the simulation_results as well as the results from the real_data application in this article we develop a classification based procedure and an adaptive fdr controlled procedure to make binary dna_methylation calls for bisulfite based data based on our simulation_study and real_data evaluation we believe the proposed classification procedure is the procedure of choice if an fdr level between and is satisfactory thus for analyzing bisulfite based data it is recommended to apply the classification procedure and estimate the resulting fdr first if an fdr level other than the estimated fdr is of concern the adaptive procedure at the desired fdr level can be used both the classification based procedure and the adaptive fdrcontrolled procedure are implemented in r and are available free online at http www stat purdue edu cheng code html this work also points to several future_research first in this work the proposed procedures are applied either genome_wide or chromosome wise a more sophisticated choice of regions needs to be further explored as it is assumed that all the cpg_sites in the same region share the same error_rates second for adjacent cpg_sites their methylation statuses can be correlated hidden_markov can be used to accommodate this type of correlation and may potentially lead to more accurate methylation status calls third bowtie was used to align the read sequences by this may lead to a bias toward the reference allele how to correct this bias is worth exploring possible solutions include the methods proposed by finally the ultimate_goal of methylation analysis is to detect differentially_methylated sites or regions how to accomplish this goal with our proposed model will be investigated in the future
