genome_analysis histogram based dna analysis for the visualization of chromosome genome and species information motivation we describe a novel approach to explore dna nucleotide sequence_data aiming to produce high_level categorical and structural_information about the underlying chromosomes genomes and species results the article starts by analyzing chromosomal data through histograms using fixed_length dna_sequences after creating the dna related histograms a correlation between pairs of histograms is computed producing a global correlation_matrix these data are then used as input to several data_processing methods for information_extraction and tabular graphical output generation a set of species is processed and the extensive results reveal that the proposed method is able to generate significant and diversified outputs in good accordance with current scientific_knowledge in domains such as genomics and phylogenetics availability_and source_code freely_available for download at http www dei isep ipp pt etc dnapaper implemented in free pascal and unix scripting tools phylogenetics concerns the study of the evolutionary relations between groups of organisms nowadays phylogenetics benefits from molecular sequencing_data techniques to gather extensive data for analyses aiming to improve research in areas such as the evolutionary tree of life grouping of organisms among many others with the advent of genome_sequencing and genome_databases a large_volume of information is available for computational processing allowing worldwide research on decoding the informational structure present in dna_sequences a massive amount of dna information is being collected and decoded as result of a large collaborative_effort among many to whom correspondence should be addressed individuals and research institutions around the world and is available for scientific_research in this evolving area was addressed by applying mathematical tools to genome data revealing new information patterns in this study we analyze the dna code in the perspective of identifying structural patterns in the nuclear and mitochondrial_genomes understanding dna may be one of the most challenging problems posed to the human knowledge nobel_prize web_site http nobelprize org nobel prizes medicine laureates the decoding of the dna complex structure may not only have a primary level of biochemical detail but also other levels of information this vision motivated the association of logical and mathematical concepts namely histogram correlation and analysis visualization_tools such as multidimensional analysis directed_graphs and dendograms once established the methodology for several species its dna data is used to pursue the vision in the chosen dna repository a substantial part corresponding to genes and short repetitive_sequences as defined in the university of california santa_cruz genome bioinformatics web_site is organized into chromosomes which is our input_data in this study we consider the available nuclear and mitochondrial_genomes of species mammals birds aves fishes insect nematodes and fungus we note that in most of the species the association of genes to chromosomes is not yet incomplete in we present the chromosomal characteristics of those species the dna implements an alphabet composed by the symbols t c a g any simple translation to a numerical counterpart may impose bias and destroy intrinsic information consequently it was decided to directly process the non numerical code due to the immense volume of information a histogram based measure was adopted nevertheless in general histograms do not capture dynamics in order to overcome_this a flexible pattern detection algorithm based on counting the sequence of symbols was considered by flexible we mean that the algorithm can count sequences of length n items each one composed by one of the four base symbols with the exception of yeast sc the available chromosome data includes a fifth symbol n corresponding to masked dna symbols not belonging to the genome which typically appear in large contiguous sequences for example in the human y chromosome file there are bp of which bp are n arranged in sequences the largest one with symbols another example is the chicken ga chromosome with bp of which are n arranged in sequences the largest one with symbols hoy and ga are just two examples of chromosomes with a percentage of n symbols but most of the chromosomes have smaller percentages we decided not to use n in sequences as a fifth symbol or not to replace it by any of symbols t c g a because that would introduce an unknown bias in the sequence processing we then considered two approaches a removing all n symbols in a preprocessing_step or b process sequences but ignoring any sequence with an n although a and b may seem different we concluded that differences were minimal and that a could beadvantageously used without compromising the quality of results and conclusions using as examples ho ck tn ag nuclear chromosomes and a sequence_length of n rightmost column synthesizes the differences for the a and b approaches for ga the pearsons_correlation r between a and b sequences with length n yields r while for hoy the corresponding coefficient r is we conclude that both approaches are statistically equivalent for the envisaged dna decoding therefore we opted to discard the n symbol before histogram construction different statistics may be produced when considering the length ranging from n representing merely a static counting of m states up to n representing the dynamics of a system with m states for bin counting a one base sliding_window i e shift of one base and overlap of n consecutive bases method was adopted shows the differences between the relative_frequencies of human x and human y chromosomes histograms for n the large number of bins visually helps understanding the differences in the dna_base sequences of both chromosomes these differences are our main motivation to study the genomic_dna and find out if some high_level structural_information will emerge in short for our dna sequence_analysis process we adopted i the histogram for translating the t c a g symbols into numerical_values ii the dynamical code characterization by means of n tuple sequences iii the sequence_similarity comparison using a correlation method and iv the identification of hidden patterns in the numerical sequence and subsequent high_level visualization of those patterns we described a novel approach to dna analysis based on a methodology that takes as input whole genomic chromosome sequences and then using alignment_free sequence techniques extracts high_level information from histogram correlations this information is used to generate several types of tabular and or graphical outputs relating chromosomes or species in this study an important parameter is the word length n used in the sequence processing and histogram constructions steps the n case is just a mere counting of t c a g but when n goes from to the corresponding d mds plots reveal increasingly evident spatial and structural patterns related to chromosomes as shown infor n in this d rendering with shadows on the floor we can observe the individual chromosomes and many page spatial groupings a big grouping including all the mammals with op slightly apart a grouping with ga and tg and a grouping with ce and cb fish_species zf and tn are spatially far away from each other it is also noteworthy the existence of spatial_structure in most species other than cb ce sc zf the remaining species reveal a chromosomal linear organization with lines mostly parallel between species in most of the species it is the sexual chromosome that lies more far apart from the corresponding species line but this also happens with other non sexual chromosomes we do not have an immediate explanation for this remarkable structuring but it may be related with higher levels of information in chromosomes and genomes the emergence of this apparently new structural knowledge from chromosomal_dna seems to be unique to our approach and suggests novel ways to investigate the higher levels of information referred by we also performed a study using nuclear and mitochondrial chromosomes from species with results at the chromosome genome and species levels bullet d mds plots of nuclear and mitochondrial chromosomes have shown the emergence of intra and interspecies spatial_patterns based on an alignment_free sequencing and data_mining of the whole chromosomal_dna data instead of genes or other small sequences bullet directed_graphs of nuclear and mitochondrial chromosomes demonstrated that chromosomal relationships can be derived from histogram correlations as well as genomic species relationships bullet chromosomal based dendograms have shown that histogram correlations can be used to compute diagrams depicting hierarchical clusterings of chromosomes and species
