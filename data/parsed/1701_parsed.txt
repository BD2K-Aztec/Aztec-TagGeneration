exploring peptide mhc detachment processes using hierarchical natural move monte_carlo motivation the binding between a peptide and a major_histocompatibility mhc is one of the most important processes for the induction of an adaptive_immune many algorithms have been developed to predict peptide mhc pmhc binding however no approach has yet been able to give structural insight into how peptides detach from the mhc results in this study we used a combination of coarse_graining hierarchical natural move monte_carlo and stochastic conformational optimization to explore the detachment processes of different peptides from hla a we performed independent repeats of each stochastic_simulation and found that the presence of experimentally known anchor amino_acids affects the detachment trajectories of our peptides comparison with experimental binding_affinity data indicates the reliability of our approach area under_the we also compared to a ns molecular_dynamics of a non binding_peptide aaaktpviv and hla a even in this simulation the longest published for pmhc the pep tide does not fully detach our approach is orders_of and as such allows us to explore pmhc detachment processes in a way not possible with all atom molecular_dynamics simulations availability_and the source_code is freely_available for download atpresentation of protein_fragments on the surface of antigenpresenting cells is a fundamental part of the human immune system in virus_infected proteosomes degrade viral_proteins into peptides these peptides are then transported via the transporter_associated into the lumen of the endoplasmic_reticulum where the peptides are loaded on major_histocompatibility mhc_class these peptide mhc pmhc complexes are then presented on the surface of antigen_presenting to the t cell receptors tcr of t cells the linkage between mhc peptide and tcr determines if an immune_reaction is triggered against this peptide van_der only if the binding_affinity between peptide and mhc is strong enough a peptide can be presented to tcr and a productive immune_response against this peptide can take place a wide_range of pmhc binding_affinity prediction_methods have been developed reviewed in sequence_based usually achieve high_accuracy if sufficient training data are available structure based_methods are often worse at predicting binding_affinity but give insight into the binding_mode of the peptide prediction_methods v c the author published_by a large number of md studies have investigated the structural interaction between peptide and mhc reviewed in in none of these studies has full detachment of the peptide been observed the longest reported pmhc md_simulation was ns by in this study we ran a ns simulation of an experimentally known non binding_peptide in complex with mhc and observed only partial peptide detachment this shows that current standard md_simulations are not giving insight into the pmhc detachment processes within a reasonable time frame consequently most structural analysis has been carried_out on bound pmhc and tcr pmhc structures or empty mhc binding grooves to obtain insight into the peptide detachment processes we used the combination of three technologies first the coarse_grained point model which allowed for a reasonable runtime while keeping specific features of the amino_acid second hierarchical segmentation of the protein which further restricted the degrees_of and prevented global denaturation or local spoiling at high amplitudes third repeated simulated_annealing which allowed for an efficient sampling of low_energy states along the energy surface in this way we were able to bypass the bottleneck of computational power and show how a detachment process of a peptide from mhc may occur there are alternative_techniques to our coarse_grained hierarchical monte_carlo simulated_annealing approach that could also enhance the sampling see introduction however to our knowledge none of these methods have been employed for pmhc detachment yet structural sampling methods will always produce a diverse collection of conformations of the structure under investigation these movements are based on several parameter choices in the simulation setup how meaningful these conformations are can be determined by comparison to experiments therefore we compared our detachment data to two different types of experimental_data first we compared the detachment process with preferred anchor amino_acids deduced from the iedb while anchor residues are not exclusively responsible for pmhc binding we found frequent agreement between an n or c terminal detachment and the presence absence of preferred anchor residues e second we investigated if our detachment trajectories can discriminate between experimentally known binders and non binders we achieved high agreement between predicted detachment speed and experimental binding_affinity data of an aroc of of our training free approach is roughly in the range of sequence trained pmhc binding prediction_methods and superior to structural ligand protein_docking methods applied to pmhc these findings demonstrate that our coarse_grained hnmmc pmhc model is biophysically accurate and can capture the main factors contributing to the outcome of binding even if methods such as temperature modulation zhang et_al a or hnmmc are used there is a finite probability that simulations will get trapped in local_minima or run outlier trajectories leading to a questionable convergence therefore we decided to run a total of replica simulations with different initial seeds per pmhc on the basis of a boot strapping analysis we found that about replicas are needed for reliable conclusions this is in agreement with recent_studies that showed that the comparison between few md_simulations can yield to misleading_results and that replicas are necessary for reliable binding_free prediction of hiv drugs to hiv_protease and peptides to mhc in this study we showed that hnmmc is able to give insight into the peptide detachment process from mhc for the first time we were able to analyse peptide detachment trajectories and thereby provide new views of the mhc structural landscape
