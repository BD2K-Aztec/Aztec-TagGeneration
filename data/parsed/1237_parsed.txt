cytoscape app store cytoscape is an open_source for biological network_visualization and analysis which can be extended with independently developed apps we launched the cytoscape app store to highlight the important features that apps add to cytoscape enable researchers to find and install apps they need and help developers promote their apps availability the app store is available at http apps cytoscape is an open_source for network_visualization and analysis primarily for biological data when users first install cytoscape it has a small well defined set of functionality for working with networks in addition cytoscape has an open architecture so that others can extend its functionality with apps cytoscape apps are additional software_packages independently developed licensed and installed the wide_ranging functionality and specialization of cytoscape principally reside in its apps over free apps have been contributed to our web_site by developers from over a dozen countries originally the cytoscape team maintained a catalog of submitted apps called plugins at the time that were accessible from a web_page or from within cytoscape the catalog had several limitations search was limited to exact_matches to app names users could not search by app description category or author and apps were categorized by single terms chosen by the cytoscape team not app developers each app entry in the catalog listed all versions of an app and did not emphasize the latest_version this catalog did not make it easy for users to discover apps in which they might be interested e g based on their functionality moreover when users did find an interesting app through the web_page catalog they had to search for the app again in cytoscape to install it to help address the needs of users we launched the cytoscape app store to coincide with the release of cytoscape a major re architecturing of cytoscape for improved_stability performance and versatility the overarching goals of the cytoscape app store are to highlight the important features apps add to cytoscape to enable researchers to find apps they need and for developers to promote their apps here we describe the features of the app store for both users and app developers
