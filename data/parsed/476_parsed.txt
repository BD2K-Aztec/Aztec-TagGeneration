genetics_and argon fast whole_genome simulation of the discrete time wright fisher process motivation simulation under the coalescent model is ubiquitous in the analysis of genetic data the rapid_growth of real_data from multiple human populations led to increasing interest in simulating very large_sample at whole chromosome scales when the sample_size is large the coales cent model becomes an increasingly inaccurate approximation of the discrete time wright fisher model dtwf analytical and computational treatment of the dtwf however is generally harder results we present a simulator argon for the dtwf process that scales up to hundreds of thousands of samples and whole chromosome lengths with a time memory_performance comparable or superior to currently available methods for coalescent_simulation the simulator supports arbitrary demographic_history migration newick tree output variable mutation recombination_rates and gene_conversion and efficiently outputs pairwise identical by descent sharing data the coalescent can be constructed as an approximation of the discrete time wright fisher process dtwf and leads to simplified analytical and computational treatment simulators based on the coalescent_process e g have been extensively adopted in computational_methods the coalescent approximation however relies on the assumption that the sample_size is small compared with the effective_population and violations of this assumption may result in substantial distortions of key genealogical properties until very recently coalescent simulators did not scale up to long chromosomes and the very large_sample of modern day data_sets which now comprise hundreds of thousands of individuals the recently_developed simulators cosi and scrm enable fast simulation under approximate coalescent models the cosi algorithm uses a standard backwards in time approach while scrm adopts a sequential approach both can be also used to simulate large_sample and chromosomelong regions under the exact coalescent_process with reasonable time and memory_requirements here we present argon an efficient simulator of the dtwf process that scales up to very large chromosomes and hundreds of thoudsands of samples the simulator offers substantially improved_performance compared with recent dtwf simulators e g genome and is comparable or superior to current coalescent simulators in terms of speed and memory_usage population_structure and migration each individual is represented as a list of regions for which not all samples have found a common_ancestor crossover and non crossover recombination_events are sampled in genetic space and rounded to the closest physiscal base_pair position based on the desired uniform or variable recombination_rate whenever a coalescence occurs regions within individuals are annotated with links to descendant nodes in the ancestral recombination graph arg when compared with other dtwf implementations e g genome argon offers substantially improved speed and memory_usage see supplementary_materials in argon large regions are represented as intervals with arbitrary boundary values and hash map data_structures are extensively used to take advantage of sparsity avoiding explicit representation of all individuals argon can run in approximate mode so that recombinations breakpoints are rounded to blocks of a user specified genetic length as implemented in the genome simulator this reduces the granularity of the recombination_process improving speed and memory_usage at the cost of slightly inflated correlation of nearby markers argon can efficiently output a list of identical by descent ibd segments which are delimited by the occurrence of recombination_events that change the most_recent for pairs of samples in argon these events are detected by visiting internal arg nodes while previous_approaches to output simulated ibd_sharing data e g required comparing recent ancestry for all pairs of individual at each marginal tree
