data_driven integration of epidemiological and toxicological_data to select candidate interacting genes and environmental_factors in association with disease motivation complex_diseases such as type_diabetes t d result from the interplay of both environmental_and however most studies investigate either the genetics or the environment and there are a few that study their possible interaction in context of disease one key challenge in documenting interactions between genes and environment includes choosing which of each to test jointly here we attempt to address this challenge through a data_driven integration of epidemiological and toxicological_studies specifically we derive lists of candidate interacting genetic_and by integrating findings from genome_wide and environment wide association studies next we search for evidence of toxicological relationships between these genetic_and that may have an etiological_role in the disease we illustrate our method by selecting candidate interacting_factors for t d complex_diseases and phenotypes such as type_diabetes t d have multifactorial_etiology in which both genetic_and play a role through multiple genetic_association such as the genomewide association study gwas we have discovered many common_variants associated with complex disease however these variants confer very little disease risk and cumulatively explain a limited portion of heritability it is hypothesized that perhaps some of the unexplained risk may be due to gene_environment or joint_effect of a genetic and environmental_factor are different than that of each of the factors alone we recently put forth an analogous framework to investigate possible environmental_influences on disease called an environment wide association study ewas where we connected over environmental_factors to t d and serum_cholesterol humans are not exposed to a few environmental_factors at a time but many types of infectious_agents pollutants nutrients and vitamins at once all of which may play a role in disease ewas evaluates multiple environmental_factors to capture the complex nature of environmental_exposure in relation to disease nevertheless gwas and ewas only examine genetic or environmental_factors respectively without consideration of the to whom correspondence should be addressed other examining interactions is complex power intensive and exacts a multiple comparison burden for example a list of g genetic_variants and e environmental_exposures would result in g or e hypothesis_tests in gwas and ewas respectively however to screen the possible space of interactions would many more tests equal to g times e to accommodate these challenges statistical_methods have been developed to larger space of interactions another option includes adapting methods used to detect genegene_interactions or epistasis yet another way includes paring down the list of g and e factors to test in many variant by environment investigations factors are selected by convenience without sufficient documentation of the strength of their marginal associations there is a need for methods to select common_variants and exposures resulting from comprehensive studies such as gwas and ewas further still gwas and ewas operate on the population scale and there is need to integrate molecular_scale toxicological evidence such as how an environmental_factor might modulate a biological processbetween exposures and genes as yet there are few ways to integrate environmental findings from epidemiological and toxicological_studies here we propose integrating findings from genetic and environmental association studies with knowledge regarding molecular and toxicological scale interactions by integrating these data we aim to assemble a list of genetic_and to later test jointly against a phenotype or disease of interest specifically we attained a comprehensive list of genetic_variants associated with disease from a curated database variants informing medicine varimed varimed contains results from over peer_reviewed genetic_epidemiology studies e g gwas covering over variants in genes associated with over phenotypes to prioritize environmental_factors we used an ewas approach with the health and nutrition examination survey nhanes a biannual health_survey whose participants are representative of the us population centers_for cdc last we connected these findings from varimed and ewas with the comparative_toxicogenomics ctd a database of curated findings in toxicology toxicology is the study of the biological response to chemicals such as how a chemical_exposure might induce a gene_expression change as an example one such toxicological interaction is derived from an investigation studying gestational exposure of the plasticizing agent bisphenol a on adipogenesis in a rattus_norvegicus model system in which mrna_levels of the gene lpl increasedwe have described a method to combine epidemiological association findings with results from toxicological experiments to create a tractable list candidate of genes variants and environmental_factors that might interplay in the context of disease additionally the method is a data_driven integration of three disparate datasets that span the population to toxicological scale of interest this method has drawn attention to nutrient factors that may interact with a gene known to be functional and have a therapeutic role in t d pparg tocopherol associated with t d risk in ewas has been observed to increase expression of pparg mrna further forms of carotene protective for t d have an opposite role reducing pparg expression of note these candidate interactions are derived from two very different toxicological investigations one studying the influence of tocopherol on pparg expression in human cell_lines and the other observing the effects of carotenoids on pparg in adipocyte_differentiation in mus_musculus a next possible step includes testing these candidate interactions in the context of disease specifically we propose an epidemiological_study in which the interaction between functional_variants in pparg such as rs be examined along with increases gene_expression cis carotene pparg decreases gene_expression vitamin_d pparg affects gene_expression trans carotene pparg decreases gene_expression
