sequence_analysis codonlogo a sequence_logo based viewer for codon patterns motivation conserved patterns across a multiple_sequence can be visualized by generating sequence_logos sequence_logos show each column in the alignment as stacks of symbol s where the height of a stack is proportional to its informational content whereas the height of each symbol within the stack is proportional to its frequency in the column sequence_logos use symbols of either nucleotide or amino_acid alphabets however certain regulatory_signals in messenger_rna mrna act as combinations of codons yet no tool is available for visualization of conserved codon patterns results we present the first application which allows visualization of conserved_regions in a multiple_sequence in the context of codons codonlogo is based on weblogo and uses the same heuristics but treats codons as inseparable units of a letter alphabet codonlogo can discriminate patterns of codon conservation from patterns of nucleotide conservation that appear indistinguishable in standard sequence_logos availability the codonlogo source_code and its implementation in a local version of the galaxy browser are available at http recode ucc ie codonlogo and through the galaxy tool shed atsequence logos are simple graphical_representations of conserved elements in multiple_sequence sequence_logos were first introduced by tom schneider and colleagues however the popularity of sequence_logos was greatly boosted by the advent of weblogo which provides a web_based interface for sequence_logo generation weblogo allows the processing of multiple_sequence and generates a logo where each column of the alignment is represented by a stack of letters the height of the entire stack is proportional to its informational content maximum bits for nucleotides and bits for amino_acids whereas the height of each symbol is proportional to its frequency sequence_logos inspired development of several other tools that use principles of shannons information_theory for graphical visualization of conserved biological elements for
