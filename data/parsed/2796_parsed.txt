genome_analysis mapping personal functional data to personal genomes motivation the sequencing of personal genomes enabled analysis of variation in transcription_factor tf_binding chromatin_structure and gene_expression and indicated how they contribute to phenotypic_variation it is hypothesized that using the reference_genome for mapping chip_seq or rna_seq may introduce errors especially at polymorphic genomic_regions results we developed a personal genome editor pereditor that changes the reference human_genome ncbi hg into an individual genome taking_into single_nucleotide snps insertions_and copy_number and chromosomal_rearrangements pereditor outputs two alleles maternal paternal of the individual genome that is ready for mapping chip_seq and rna_seq and enabling the analyses of allele specific binding chromatin_structure and gene_expression
