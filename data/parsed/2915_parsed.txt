metapsicov combining coevolution methods for accurate prediction of contacts and long_range hydrogen_bonding in proteins motivation recent_developments of statistical_techniques to infer direct evolutionary couplings between residue pairs have rendered covariation based contact_prediction a viable means for accurate d modelling of proteins with no information other than the sequence required to extend the usefulness of contact_prediction we have designed a new meta predictor metapsicov which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple_sequence considers a broad range of other sequence derived features and uniquely a range of met rics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple_sequence finally we use a two stage predictor where the second stage filters the output of the first stage this two stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately_predict the long_range network of hydrogen_bonds including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues results using the original psicov benchmark set of protein_families metapsicov achieves a mean precision of for top l predicted long_range contactsaround higher than psicov and around better than ccmpred in de_novo using fragfold metapsicov is able to improve the tm scores of models by a median of compared with psicov lastly for predicting long_range hydrogen_bonding metapsicov hb achieves a precision of for the top l hydrogen_bonds compared with just for the baseline metapsicov availability_and metapsicov is available as a freely_available web_server atdetermining protein_structure from its amino_acid remains an unsolved_problem within bioinformatics in order to make this notoriously complex goal more tractable one simplification which can be made is to reduce the problem to identifying pairs of interacting residue pairs within the native_structure termed contacts for many years accurate contact_prediction was hampered by the effects of the relatedness of homologous_sequences and the inability to extract correct residue pairings from vastly intertwined networks of contacts recently there has been considerable progress in reducing the effects of these two sources of noise allowing for superior prediction_accuracy current methods for contact_prediction use large multiple_sequence to identify interacting residues through correlated mutation analysis extracting contacts using correlated mutation v c the author published_by although recent_developments in algorithms to determine coevolution patterns in large multiple_sequence have created a lot of excitement in structural_bioinformatics coevolution alone is clearly not enough to derive all of the likely contacts in a protein_structure although it is an impressive feat to deduce distance constraints purely from a statistical_analysis of a multiple_sequence it is evident that other sources of information can also contribute to producing more accurate predicted contact_maps it makes no sense to limit ones analysis solely to one source of information and ignore other sources albeit sources that are weaker predictors in their own right metapsicov is an effective hybrid of a fairly standard machine_learning contact_prediction method with three state of the art coevolution based_methods the neural_network is able to make a balanced decision between the coevolution signals and the generic structural_features that provide orthogonal information on the likelihood of residue pairs making a contact for target_proteins with poor_quality or sparse multiple_sequence the appropriate strategy is to de emphasize coevolution in favour of generic structural_features but where sufficient homologous_sequences are available the overwhelming value of coevolution is clear compared with the best single coevolution method metapsicov achieves a precision that is higher than the best individual coevolution method ccmpred for the top l long_range furthermore the mean precision for metapsicov of indicates that correct predicted contacts are more likely than incorrect contacts which is an important performance threshold in terms of accurate d model_building from predicted contacts one of the more interesting observations has been the apparent effect of redundancy in predicted contacts by constructing a twostage classifier it is possible to produce a more accurate contact predictor but at the expense of biasing the distribution of contacts to regions of the protein where adjacent contacts are made beta_sheets although benchmarks clearly show that more correct contacts are predicted by the second stage of the metapsicov the added bias in fact results in generally poorer d models when the contacts are used for de_novo structure_prediction using fragfold better contact constraint scoring_functions which more evenly weight contact constraints according to both sequence separation and neighbourhood density are needed to deal with this problem comparing metapsicov to pconsc another published coevolution based consensus contact predictor metapsicov evidently outperforms the earlier method on the same benchmark set however there are interesting aspects of pconsc that are not currently considered within the metapsicov feature_set e g features from sampling more than one sequence_alignment from different methods or alignment parameters consequently even better hybrid methods may be envisaged by considering even larger feature spaces finally we show that it is possible to apply metapsicov to predicting not just contacting residue pairs but explicitly identifying donor_acceptor pairings in beta_sheets by combining the accurate prediction of side chain contacts with this much more discriminating structural_information it should be possible to greatly enhance the quality of de_novo modelling in beta_sheet rich target_proteins
