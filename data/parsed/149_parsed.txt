gene_expression affyrnadegradation control and correction of rna quality effects in genechip expression data motivation gene_expression experiments aim to accurately quantify thousands of transcripts in parallel factors posterior to rna_extraction can however impair their accurate representation rna degradation and differences in the efficiency of amplification affect raw intensity_measurements using affymetrix expression arrays the pos itional intensity decay of specifically hybridized probes along the transcript they intend to interrogate is used to estimate the rna quality in a sample and to correct probe intensities for the degradation bias this functionality for which no previous software solution is available is implemented in the r bioconductor_package affyrnadegradation presented here availability the package is available via bioconductor at the urla basic assumption in gene_expression experiments is that the obtained data represent a snapshot of transcript_abundances within the original_sample however several effects can distort the amount of rna during sample_extraction and preparation and thereby impair the reliability of those measurements rnases introduced by improper purification or incautious sample handling can degrade the rather unstable rnas during storage also the amplification of rna mandatory to most rna analytics differs in its efficiency and can therefore lead to variation in transcript yield and lengths gene_expression experiments are frequently conducted using high_density microarrays because of the importance of rna quality for the reliability of the results it is advised to check the integrity of the rna before hybridization to the array rna integrity rin values that are determined on the basis of an electropherogram trace have become the standard measure of rna quality samples with rin values should be discarded researchers increasingly conduct large_scale meta_analysis on the plethora of publicly_available microarray_data for these data rna quality_measures are mostly not available however it is strongly advised to identify and to remove low rna quality experiments as they can lead to erroneous_results methods to estimate rna quality directly from microarray_data are thus required existing options are the use of intensity ratios of control probe_sets included on the microarray as well as summary degradation measures as provided by software_tools such as the affy package both methods have been shown to have drawbacks under circumstances that are relevant in large_scale studies particularly control probes might be affected by saturation whereas affyslope estimates are affected by background hybridization both methods are prone to systematically overestimating rna quality beyond strict quality_control and the removal of bad quality samples the continuous levels of rna quality transform into a gray area of biased expression results with questionable reliability it has been previously found that although moderate levels of rna degradation are tolerated by differential_expression especially long targets provide erroneous_results in this work we present an r package that assesses rna quality of affymetrix expression data it provides a rna quality measure that overcomes the drawbacks of existing_methods by strictly referring to specific hybridization furthermore it enables correction of the probe intensity bias for improved downstream_analysis for illustration we here use data from an experiment done bywhere the same cell_extract has been used for multiple microarray hybridizations however either prepared with rneasy to remove rna degrading_enzymes or not
