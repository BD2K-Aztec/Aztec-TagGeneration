rampart a workflow management system for de_novo motivation the de_novo of genomes from whole_genome shotgun sequence_data is a computationally_intensive multi_stage task and it is not known a priori which methods and parameter_settings will produce optimal results in current de_novo projects a popular strategy involves trying many approaches using different tools and settings and then comparing and contrasting the results in order to select a final assembly for publication results herein we present rampart a configurable workflow management system for de_novo which helps the user identify combinations of third_party tools and settings that provide good results for their particular genome and sequenced_reads rampart is designed to exploit high_performance environments such as clusters and shared memory systems where available the de_novo of whole_genome sequence_data is a complex task and typically involves testing multiple tools parameters and approaches to produce the best possible assembly for downstream_analysis this is necessary because it is not always known a priori which tools and settings will work best on the available sequence_data given the organisms specific genomic properties such as size ploidy and repetitive content despite advances in computing hardware and sequencing_technologies de_novo particularly for more complex eukaryotic_genomes remains a nontrivial task and an ongoing challenge recently several tools such as imetamos and a approach this problem by exhaustively testing many tools in parallel and then identifying and selecting the best assembly however these pipelines focus on prokaryote assemblies where the computational_demands are manageable and the genomes are easier to assemble the complexities of eukaryotic_genomes prohibit exhaustive testing of all tools and parameters with current computing hardware for these projects the user must use the literature and their own experience to decide which avenues are worth considering
