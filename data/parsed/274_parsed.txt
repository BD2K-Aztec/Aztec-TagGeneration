sequence_analysis an alignment_free method to identify candidate orthologous enhancers in multiple drosophila genomes motivation evolutionarily_conserved non coding genomic_sequences represent a potentially rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory_region such as transcriptional enhancers however detecting orthologous enhancers using alignment_based in higher eukaryotic_genomes is particularly challenging as regulatory_regions can undergo considerable sequence changes while maintaining their functionality results we have developed an alignment_free method which identifies conserved enhancers in multiple diverged species our method is based on similarity_metrics between two sequences based on the co occurrence of sequence_patterns regardless of their order and orientation thus tolerating sequence changes observed in non coding evolution we show that our method is highly_successful in detecting orthologous enhancers in distantly_related without requiring additional information such as knowledge about transcription_factors involved or predicted binding_sites by estimating the significance of similarity_scores we are able to discriminate experimentally_validated functional enhancers from seemingly equally conserved candidates without function we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a wide_range of enhancers in drosophila and also present encouraging_results to detect conserved functional_regions across large evolutionary_distances our work provides encouraging steps on the way to ab_initio unbiased enhancer prediction to complement ongoing experimental efforts the identification of functional regulatory_elements present in non coding dna_sequences is complicated by the fact that such elements are highly_variable and the sequence_features are not sufficiently understood however functional_elements tend to evolve at slower rates than non functional_regions because they are subject to whom correspondence should be addressed to selection due to this slower rate of evolution comparisons among evolutionarily distant genomes make it possible to use sequence_conservation to identify functional_regions in the sea of non coding_dna the performance of this phylogenetic_footprinting strategy depends on the evolutionary distance between given species and on the conservation level of individual regulatory_regions a number of methods have used cross_species alignments to identify regulatory_regions or elements in addition standard_tools such as blast are regularly used to identify_conserved segments of enhancers as well the availability of complete_genomes also allows for applying general approaches to detect regions under selection in a multiple_alignment such as phastcons which is based on a phylogenetic hidden_markov despite many individually successful applications conservation based on sequence_alignments can be a poor predictor of functional enhancers in contrast to protein_coding functional non coding_sequences are frequently not constrained in the ordering and number of functional_elements within them comparative_sequence have identified significant smallscale insertions deletions and rearrangements of transcription_factor tfbss within functional_modules tracking the evolutionary path of such noncoding elements is proving difficult with current alignment_based a recent study on the conservation of the best characterized eukaryotic enhancers of the even skipped gene between drosophila and the highly diverged sepsid flies shows that blast finds some short stretches of sequence_similarity but scores too low to confirm the evolutionary_relationship between those species it has also been shown that especially in distantly_related the enhancer sequences are simply not alignable the basic problem we address here thus poses itself as follows given a regulatory_region such as an enhancer without any prior_knowledge of functional sites within can we devise a way to identify its location in a distantly_related and given a candidate_region can we predict its functionality as an enhancer based on its conservation with the availability of enormous sets of uncharacterized putative regulatory_regions e g based on assays detecting regions of open chromatin methods tailored to these problems would be immensely useful for providing complementary evidence and for studying the evolution of gene_regulation at a larger scale we address these two questions based on so_called alignment_free these methods work under the assumption that similar sequences will share their word k_mer composition to some extent comparing two sequences based on co occurring words regardless of their order and orientation thus making no prior assumptions on the presence of particular tfbss vinga and almeida performed an early systematic_review on a number of different word frequency measures to identify similar regions between two given sequences recent_studies have proposed and applied alignment_free to regulatory_sequence problems introduced the d z_score and used it to identify enhancers ab_initio for genes with similarly annotated function in benchmark drosophila_melanogaster data combined motif_detection in a set of enhancers with a score allowing for local permutations of motifs to identify_conserved enhancers our work is based on vanwho introduced a poisson based metric which relies on probability theory for comparing sequences on the basis of pattern counts in the original study sets of yeast promoters of co expressed genes were used to identify overrepresented words the metric restricted to this subset of words was then successfully_applied to cluster genes based on promoter similarity in summary previous_approaches use alignment_free metrics in the same genome to either compare and cluster promoters van or to identify enhancers for sets of genes known to share regulatory_patterns some also use sets of enhancers with similar function to first determine a subset of words on which similarity is calculated different from these approaches we here apply alignment_free approach on phylogenetic_footprinting problems each candidate enhancer is regarded separately eliminating the need of any additional information on known or predicted motifs or on similarly regulated_genes we extend the poisson based metric to work with multiple related genomes and show that it successfully identifies the location of enhancer orthologs in distantly_related we also show that appropriate significance values allow for separating functional from non functional candidates a task on which other alignment_based fail we evaluate our approach on different sets of validated enhancers from the d melanogaster genome a well studied model system for gene_regulation we show that candidate orthologous enhancers in multiple drosophila and non drosophila genomes can be identified by an unbiased alignment_free method which uses no information of predicted or known functional_motifs our results show promise in the effort to characterize non coding sequence_conservation on a higher functional rather than the nucleotide level since our method showed encouraging_results in a wide_range of drosophila enhancers with different functions and active at different life_stages it will be interesting to explore its application for the discovery of regulatory_modules in other organisms with larger and more complex non coding_sequence spaces
