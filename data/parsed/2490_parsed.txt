structural_bioinformatics in silico identification software isis a machine_learning approach to tandem mass_spectral identification of lipids motivation liquid chromatographymass spectrometry based_metabolomics has gained importance in the life_sciences yet it is not supported by software_tools for high_throughput identification of metabolites based on their fragmentation spectra an algorithm isis in silico identification software and its implementation are presented and show great promise in generating in silico spectra of lipids for the purpose of structural identification instead of using chemical_reaction rate_equations or rules based fragmentation libraries the algorithm uses machine_learning to find accurate bond cleavage_rates in a mass_spectrometer employing collision_induced tandem_mass results a preliminary test of the algorithm with lipids from a subset of lipid_classes shows both high_sensitivity the field of proteomics has enjoyed considerable success in part due to software_tools like sequest and mascot which enable highthroughput identifications of detected peptides and their corresponding proteins based on their fragmentation spectra generated by collision_induced cid mass_spectrometry these tools have benefited from the close link between dna and protein_sequences and the fact that the polymeric structure of amino_acid in proteolytic peptides provides a convenient basis for interpreting peptide tandem_mass however small_molecules other than peptides have to be considered as d or d structures of atoms or functional_groups of atoms these differences require novel algorithms to date the main approaches to predict in silico tandem_mass are based on either chemical_reaction equations libraries of fragmentation spectra pathways or bond_cleavage probabilities based upon bond_strengths none of these approaches briefly_discussed below have shown sufficient accuracy in generating in silico spectra to enable automated and correct identifications of non peptide small_molecules to whom correspondence should be addressed chemical_reactions involving unimolecular dissociation are commonly_studied using the riceramspergerkasselmarcus rrkm and quasiequilibrium theories qet chemical_reaction time evolutions are described in systems of differential_equations as in a master_equation approach these theories are invaluable to understanding chemical reaction_mechanisms and energies required for state_transitions yet while quantum calculations like rrkm and qet explain the dissociation of activated ions they are insufficient in explaining the activations of ions in inelastic collisions for molecules larger than a few atoms predicting or identifying fragment_ions in tandem_mass is difficult for large_molecules indeed little is known regarding the rates at which ions gain internal energy in activation methods and at which bonds dissociate a few small_peptides such as leucine enkephalin and bradykinin have been empirically studied as to their fragmentation behaviors however these results cannot be translated to the fragmentation of non peptide small_molecules hence it remains difficult to explain many ions and their intensities in fragmentation spectra or to generate accurate in silico spectra knowing only the molecular compositions tools such as mass frontier from thermo scientific highchem http www highchem com and acd ms fragmenter acdlabs http www acdlabs com products adh ms_ms frag generate fragments using a large library of rules describing fragmentation pathways this can become unmanageable in that rules are not necessarily exclusiveone rule can affect another rule sometimes the correct rules are not available entirely or are not available with sufficient specificity mass frontier generates bar_code spectra where all ions have the same intensity because bond cleavage_rates are not considered bar_code spectra are not sufficient when many molecules generate the same fragment_ions in these instances only the relative ion intensities will aid the correct identification it may be surmised that many bdes are either not available or sufficiently accurate thus defining an accurate algorithm that identifies non peptide small_molecules from cid tandem_mass is still an open_problem in a proof_of demonstration the algorithm presented here shows_promise in generating accurate in silico cid tandem_mass for identification of lipids knowing only the molecular_structures that is the algorithm uses no chemical_reaction equations in which parameters have to be estimated no fragmentation rules from observed pathways and no bond cleavage_rates provided by bond_strengths instead the algorithm simulates the fragmentation process in an ion_trap mass_spectrometer model using a machine_learning approach to overcome the difficulties that result from unknown quantities and simplifying assumptions in the cid process importantly the algorithm uses a model of the cid process in a linear_ion mass_spectrometer we believe the model is qualitatively accurate and do not claim that the algorithm describes the actual physical quantities in the variables discussed the results from a first test using lipids are presented as a class of non peptide small_molecule lipids have been extensively_studied providing relatively well understood fragmentation pathways as such they provide a good set for both initial development and testing of the algorithm a rank test was performed with lipids not included in the training_set but which were selected from the same lipid_classes subclasses as those in the training_set the test of each lipid proceeded by first finding the subset of lipids in the in silico spectral library that matched the experimental mass of the precursor ion within ppm next the in silico spectra for these subset lipids were compared to the experimental test spectrum and pearson r scores were generated the subset lipids were sorted in descending order based on these scores shows the results from screening the spectral library with test lipid ps observed at m z shows that the first four hits true_positives have high r s starting with the fifth hit the r s fall rapidly and corresponds to false_positives the test lipids within ppm resulted in a total of candidates against the in silico spectral library a candidate is a hit against one molecule in the database that has a mass within a mass margin of the observed precursor mass shows the distributions of the true and the false_positive r scores for these hits clearly most true_positives have high scores and false_positive have low scores observe that hits were counted as true_positives if they only varied in chirality locations of double_bonds in the fatty_acids or by the distribution of the correct total number of carbons over two fatty acidsinformation that cannot be determined by simple cid ms_ms analyses in positive mode the test ranked of the test lipids at the top position and five at the second position these five test lipids were ester lipids which each had one ether lipid from the same class ranked above it for example the ester test lipid pc mass da ranked second after a false_positive identification of ether pc o mass da these two masses differ by ppm which is below the mass resolving_power of the linear_ion the confusion between ester and ether lipids is a result of the training_set not having ether lipids examining the experimental_spectra of lpc and pc ester and ether lipids it appears that the algorithm should learn to separate these subclasses by the relative intensities of the da ion from the head group discussed in the supplementary data incorporating the five new ether lipids into the training required the vector lengths to increase from to observed indicesa significant increase this means that having only used the indices when the ether lipid in silico spectra were generated for the library many of the atom types and bond orders did not contribute to predict correct ion intensities the results presented were from direct injected lipid standards that were identified against a relatively small database in studies of biological_samples using a large database isis will encounter similar issues as for example sequest applied in proteomics i e the fraction of ambiguous identifications is large multiple species in one spectrum occur frequently and only a small fraction of the ions are actually recognized as peptides producing a rank list of candidates consists of comparing the observed mass of the unknown species against the masses of the molecules in the lipidmaps database the in silico spectra of those molecules with a mass within a specified mass margin are compared to the observed spectrum and squared pearson coefficients are computed between the pairs each rank list is sorted and written to a file the preliminary test results presented covers a subset of lipid_classes that isis has been trained to recognize this subset includes most glycerophospholipid classes that are of interest to many in lipid research in the future we will extend isis to identify other lipid metabolite classes our test only searched a lipid database as would be expected in lipidomics research of biological_samples where the lipids have been extracted by the method developed by folch et_al or a variation thereof
