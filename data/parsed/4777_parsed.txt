unbiased classification of spatial strategies in the barnes_maze motivation spatial_learning is one of the most widely_studied cognitive_domains in neuroscience the morris_water and the barnes_maze are the most commonly used techniques to assess spatial_learning in rodents despite the fact that these tasks are well validated paradigms for testing spatial_learning abilities manual categorization of performance into behavioral_strategies is subject to individual interpretation and thus to bias we have previously described an unbi ased machine_learning algorithm to classify spatial strategies in the morris_water results here we offer a support_vector svm based automated barnes_maze unbiased strategy buns classification algorithm as well as a cognitive score scale that can be used for memory acquisition reversal training and probe trials the buns algorithm can greatly benefit barnes_maze users as it provides a standardized method of strategy classification and cognitive scoring scale which cannot be derived from typical barnes_maze data analysis availability freely_available on the web at http okunlab wix com okunlab as a matlab application while the molecular and genetic_tools applied in neuroscience are becoming ever more sophisticated the most robust tasks that assess cognitive spatial_memory have been largely unchanged since the early s the morris_water mwm described by richard morris and the barnes_maze described by carol barnes are the most widely used paradigms for assessing spatial_learning in rodents we have recently described the must c morris_water unbiased strategy classification algorithm which rapidly classifies spatial swim strategies in the mwm and provides an unbiased assessment of the cognitive_capacity of rodents similar to the mwm the convenient and robust nature of the barnes_maze has facilitated the investigation of spatial_learning in both control and disease_states for example assessing spatial_learning using the barnes_maze has important implications for many pathologies in which learning is impaired such as aging alzheimers_disease ad neurodevelopmental_disorders mental_retardation pharmacological assays to assess drug efficiency and more the barnes_maze also has advantages in assessing improvements in spatial capacity such as following enriched environment caloric_restriction or exercise in contrast to the mwm paradigm the barnes_maze is a dry maze reducing water related stress that enables the use of in vivo devices such as optogenetics however assessment of performance in the barnes_maze is susceptible to experimenter bias calling for a more objective method of data analysis the difference between the mwm and barnes_maze tasks often results in different sets of navigation strategies utilized by rodents illouz associate editor dr jonathan wren the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup as a consequence these differences call for a novel classifier dedicated to the barnes_maze in the barnes_maze rodents are trained to find an escape box hidden under the surface of a circular table by relying on extra maze cues o the high illumination used in this task lux causes anxiety in the mice providing the motivation to find the hidden chamber performance in this task relies on hippocampal_place validating its use as a task for spatial_learning the efficiency in which mice perform this task is then quantified using specific parameters such as the latency to reach the escape chamber total distance_traveled mean moving speed and path efficiency calculated as the distance between the first and last locations divided by the total distance additional attributes are typically used to control for the animals behavior such as immobility and mean speed both cognitive and non cognitive traits are evident during spatial_navigation including changes in mean speed path efficiency duration and body rotations mice typically exhibit specific navigation strategies when tested in the barnes_maze reflecting the extent of their spatial acquisition of the environment and thus provide information about the integrity of hippocampus dependent functions and cognitive_state based on narrower previous strategy definitions direct serial and mixed as well as our empirical data we have defined main navigation strategies for the barnes_maze this broader range of spatial strategies is described from highly spatial to non spatial strategies a direct reflects the optimal acquisition of the targets location as the animal efficiently identifies its location and the targets location and thus uses the shortest trajectory possible b corrected reflects a slightly_lower efficiency as the animal makes a minor correction in the trajectory towards the target and often follows re angualtion c long correction consist of a major correction in the trajectory as the animal navigates to a distal_region of the environment re angulates and make a direct movement towards the target d focused search reflects a localized scanning of the region_surrounding the target e serial search reflects a systematic non spatial method of enhancing the probability of finding the target as the animal travels from one hole to the adjacent hole in a serial manner f random search reflects no acquisition of the target_location as the animal utilizes a non systematic method of enhancing the probability of finding the target by traveling randomly in the environment the specific combination of strategies employed by mice in the barnes_maze are considered representative of the level of cognitive resources being used for the task however despite thorough assessment of trajectory parameters non spatial_navigation strategies can increase in efficiency over time resulting in a decreased latency to reach the escape box moreover simple quantification of latency mean speed distance and other parameters describing performance in the barnes_maze often result in only a partial understanding of mouse behavior and cognitive_capacity in order to avoid such erroneous or incomplete interpretation of behavioral data in the barnes_maze manual assessments of mouse behavior are often required manual assessments of spatial strategies are time consuming and different experimental_conditions alter searching attributes used in the apparatus hindering cross experiment analysis of mouse behavior moreover manual assessments are prone to experimenter bias during analysis thus manual assessment fails to reliably detect important aspects of cognitive spatial behavior in the barnes_maze due to reduced sensitivity to nuances bias and environmental_factors for these reasons we constructed the barnes_maze unbiased strategy buns classification_tool an automatic classification algorithm freely_available for the analysis of mouse behavior this tool uses generic features of the mouse path to enable unbiased analysis of spatial learning_strategies and presents a cognitive scoring scale based on the spatial learning_strategy used by the mice we have compared performance of mice in the barnes_maze in order to validate and assess the sensitivity of our algorithm our data demonstrate that the buns algorithm provides unbiased analysis of barnes_maze behavioral data and extends the capacity of researchers to understand the mechanisms of spatial_learning in rodents
