genome_analysis rmat an r bioconductor_package for analyzing chip_chip experiments chromatin_immunoprecipitation combined with dna_microarrays chip_chip has evolved as a popular technique to study dnaprotein binding or post_translational chromatin histone_modifications at the genomic_level however the raw microarray intensities generate a massive amount of data creating a need for efficient analysis algorithms and statistical_methods to identify enriched regions results we present a fast free and powerful open_source r package rmat that allows the identification of regions enriched for transcription_factor in chip_chip experiments on affymetrix tiling arrays availability the r package rmat is available from the bioconductor web_site at http bioconductor org and runs on linux mac os and ms windows rmat is distributed under the terms of the artistic licence chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip has become an important assay for the genome_wide study of proteindna_interactions and gene_regulation in a typical chip experiment protein_complexes on contrast with dna are cross_linked to their binding_sites the chromatin is sheared into short fragments and the specific dna fraction interacting with the protein of interest is isolated by immunoprecipitation a genome_wide readout of the binding_sites is produced by hybridization of the dna pool to a tilling array chip_chip one problem in the analysis of chip_chip and microarrays in general is that the fluorescence_intensity values obtained from microarray_hybridization are not directly comparable because of systematic probe biases due to non specific binding_affinity if not accounted for such biases can severely deteriorate any subsequent results the statistical_method of normalization aims at making the probe measurements more comparable by reducing these biases once the data have been normalized probe measurements can be processed and enriched regions detected several tools and methods have already been proposed for analyzing chip_chip data to whom correspondence should be addressed introduced the first normalization method for affymetrix chip_chip arrays based on nucleotide_composition have proposed ringo an open_source r package that facilitates the analysis of nimblegen and agilent chipchip experiments tileprobe is a recent extension of mat which uses publicly_available datasets to improve upon mats original normalization the authors have shown that tileprobe can perform better than mat but it requires a large number of independent arrays to estimate the probe effect in this article we present an open_source r package rmat which is based on the popular mat software rmat has been written in c and r and provides an efficient implementation of the functionality of mat as well novel statistical normalization techniques not available in the original mat we show that these model refinements can improve normalization and increase power when detecting enriched regions in addition rmat is well integrated with other bioconductor_packages which makes it easy for users to construct sophisticated analysis approaches that also leverage other r bioconductor functionally see_supplementary
