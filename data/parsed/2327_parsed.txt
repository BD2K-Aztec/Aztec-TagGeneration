databases_and identifying informative subsets of the gene_ontology with information bottleneck methods motivation the gene_ontology go is a controlled_vocabulary designed to represent the biological_concepts pertaining to gene_products this study_investigates the methods for identifying informative subsets of go terms in an automatic and objective fashion this task in turn requires addressing the following issues how to represent the semantic context of go terms what metrics are suitable for measuring the semantic differences between terms how to identify an informative subset that retains as much as possible of the original semantic_information of go results we represented the semantic context of a go term using the word usage profile associated with the term which enables one to measure the semantic differences between terms based on the differences in their semantic contexts we further employed the information bottleneck methods to automatically identify subsets of go terms that retain as much as possible of the semantic_information in an annotation database the automatically retrieved informative subsets align well with an expert picked go slim subset cover important concepts and proteins and enhance literature based go annotation many controlled_vocabularies have been developed to define and represent biomedical knowledge in the form of ontology among which the unified_medical umls the gene_ontology go and the open biological ontology obo are three well established biomedical_ontologies covering different aspects of biomedical knowledge domains for example umls is a collection of controlled_vocabularies representing broad biomedical knowledge obo consists of a collection of ontologies representing a variety of biology concepts and go is a controlled_vocabulary representing molecular_biology aspects of genes and proteins designed to provide comprehensive representations of to whom correspondence should be addressed the knowledge in their corresponding domains the sizes of these controlled_vocabularies are often overwhelmingly large and many terms concepts defined in the vocabularies are seldom used in the real_world of annotation or indexing therefore there are needs to identify subsets of the controlled_vocabularies to represent knowledge in a concise manner recognizing such needs the go consortium provides several subsets of go terms referred to as go slims http www geneontology org go slims shtml these terms are manually picked by domain_experts to cover the major concepts of specific domains with a trade_off between specificity of the concepts and the size of the ontology that is deemed acceptable to the experts however it is of both theoretical and practical interests to develop methods that can automatically identify informative subsets of go terms to represent the major semantic concepts in an objective manner and to meet different needs of different domains as a concrete example we have developed a method for assessing the functional coherence of a gene_set by constructing a graph with go terms and genes as nodes and a part of evaluation is to visualize such graphs enabling users to capture the major theme of the functions and their relations to the genes however such a graph usually has a large number of specific terms making_it for users to identify the main concepts associated with the genes recently the database for annotation visualization and integrated discovery david tool box provides tools to identify representative go terms based on the genes associated with them similarly reported clustering disease ontology do concepts using genedo associations as features in this study instead of using gene centered approaches we address the task of automatically identifying subsets of go within the framework of semantic representation and information theoryidentifying subsets of go terms that retain as much as possible of the original semantic_information contained in an annotation database in order to achieve the goal some fundamental issues related to the semantic_information of go terms need to be addressed i how to represent the semantic context of a go term ii how to measure the difference in semantic context a k a semantic distance between a pair of go terms and iii how to identify an informative subset of go that retains as much as possible of the semantic_information within an annotation database measuring semantic distances between go terms has attracted_much in the bioinformatics field in particular a quantity referred to as information content ic has been widely used as a measure to assess the amount of information that a go term contains and the difference in the ic between a pair of terms is used to measure their semantic distance from the information_theory point_of ic measures the amount of uncertainty associated with observing a term as such it does not represent the semantic context and therefore a difference in ics does not necessarily reflect the semantic difference between two terms per se on the other hand the definitions of go terms are usually parsimonious and render insufficient_information for assessing the relationships and semantic distances among the terms as illustrated by the following examples in the go the semantic meaning of a go term is reflected by its synonym a human understandable name and its definition for example the synonym and definition for the term go are respectively they share very few biological words in their synonyms and definitions and the organization of the terms in the go hierarchy is guided by additional information knowledge that is not explicitly reflected in the definitions as a result unless a reader is equipped with sufficient biological_knowledge it would be difficult to discern and quantify the relationship of the two terms solely based on their definitions in this study we propose to represent the semantic context of go terms using the word usage profiles derived from the biomedical_literature associated with the go terms this representation enables us to measure differences in the semantic context between terms through quantifying the differences in their word usage profile this framework further allows us to use information bottleneck ib methods to identify subsets of go terms striving to retain the information with respect to the word usage profiles of go terms here we demonstrate that i our approach to representing semantic context and semantic distances is intuitive and consistent ii automatically identified informative go subsets align well with the expert picked go slim set and cover broad concepts and proteins and iii automatic_annotation with the informative subsets achieves better accuracy combining word usage profiles with ib methods provides a means to identify within the complexity of go informative subsets for specific purposes funding national_institutes
