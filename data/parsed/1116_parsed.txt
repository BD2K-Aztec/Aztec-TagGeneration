computational phosphorylation_site in plants using random_forests and organism specific instance weights motivation phosphorylation is the most important post_translational in eukaryotes although many computational phosphor ylation site prediction_tools exist for mammals and a few were created specifically for arabidopsis_thaliana none are currently available for other plants results in this article we propose a novel random_forest based method called phosfer phosphorylation_site finder for applying phosphorylation data from other organisms to enhance the accuracy of predictions in a target_organism as a test case phosfer is applied to phosphorylation_sites in soybean and we show that it more accurately_predicts soybean sites than both the existing arabidopsis specific predictors and a simpler machine_learning scheme that uses only known phosphorylation_sites and non phosphorylation_sites from soybean in addition to soybean phosfer will be extended to other organisms in the near future availability phosfer is available via a web_interface atkinase mediated protein_phosphorylation is a critical mechanism for the regulation of virtually all cellular_processes in eukaryotes to fully understand signaling_mechanisms in an organism of interest it is necessary to identify both its protein_kinases and the sites that those kinases phosphorylate although the protein_kinase complement of many organisms is known many phosphorylation_sites have yet to be identified particularly in less well studied organisms although mass_spectrometry enables phosphorylation_sites to be detected in a high_throughput manner most laboratories do not have access to the instruments and expertise required to use this technique as a result computational_methods for predicting phosphorylation_sites have become increasingly popular dozens of predictors are now available to review these see xue et_al most current predictors focus on human phosphorylation_sites however the protein_kinase complements in various organisms differ significantly both in quantity and in kind for example the plant arabidopsis_thaliana encodes twice as many protein_kinases as does human but it seems to lack any that are similar to classical human tyrosine_kinases this makes most current predictors suboptimal for predicting phosphorylation_sites in non human organisms although three toolsphosphat plantphos and an unnamed tool developed byare specific to arabidopsis predictors are lacking for other plants this article_describes phosfer phosphorylation_site finder a phosphorylation_site prediction_tool for plants particularly those for which little phosphorylation_site data are available as a test case we use soybean glycine_max an economically_important crop in many areas of the world we use a novel strategy for using phosphorylation_site data from other organisms to boost predictive_performance specifically basic_local blast_searches are used to determine the degree of conservation between phosphorylation_sites in soybean and those in several other organisms for which known phosphorylation_sites are available a machine_learning scheme is used in which a specific training instance from organism x is given a weight proportional to the level of phosphorylation_site conservation between soybean and x with greater weights implying more influence on the learning_process we show that the resultant predictors outperform the aforementioned arabidopsis specific tools when applied to soybean and they also outperform a simpler machine_learning that uses only known phosphorylation_sites from soybean in the near future phosfer will be extended to predict phosphorylation_sites in other organisms in this article we have described a novel machine_learning model for predicting phosphorylation_sites in soybean using known phosphorylation_sites from both soybean and other organisms the use of data from other species resulted in a large improvement in predictive_accuracy for t and y sites and a more modest improvement for s sites the species specific instance weights generally imparted a modest but noticeable increase in predictive_performance over similar models that lacked them however surprisingly a model using only arabidopsis data for training was able to achieve roughly_equivalent performance we hope that the techniques outlined hererandom forests aaindex features and the use of cross_species training datacan be used as the basis for even more accurate phosphorylation_site predictors especially for organisms having few experimentally_characterized phosphorylation_sites
