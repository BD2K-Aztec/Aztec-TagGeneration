data_and chener chemical named entity recognizer motivation chemical named_entity is used to automatically identify mentions to chemical_compounds in text and is the basis for more elaborate information_extraction however only a small number of applications are freely_available to identify such mentions particularly challenging and useful is the identification of international_union of pure and applied chemistry iupac chemical_compounds which due to the complex morphology of iupac names requires more advanced_techniques than that of brand names results we present chener a tool for automated identification of systematic iupac chemical mentions we evaluated different systems using an established literature corpus to show that chener has a superior_performance in identifying iupac names specifically and that it makes better use of computational_resources availability_and automated ner named_entity of chemical_compounds is receiving increased attention from researchers because it can facilitate the application of information_extraction to the pharmaceutical treatment of diseases and to understanding how those compounds modulate gene protein activities chemical ner draws from the experience in performing gene and protein ner but differs from it in three ways first catalogs of names and compositions of chemical_compounds have been traditionally less accessible fortunately freely_available chemical databases such as pubchem or drugbank are helping to correct this issue this makes it possible to do ner of common drug names such as aspirin or acetone by using a dictionary based_approach second the complexities and the variability in the morphological structure of systematic iupac international_union of pure and applied chemistry chemical names make it impossible to create a finite dictionary of such names this poses the main_challenge for ner of chemical names iupac names can be simple words or contain different punctuation marks sequences of numbers separated by commas and so forth they can also be combined in different forms e g bromo butyl chloro diethyl hydroxy methoxy making it impossible to enumerate them all this means that ner of such names cannot be done using a dictionary matching requiring alternative_approaches third systematic nomenclatures of chemicals like iupac can be used directly to unambiguously derive their chemical_structure the number of applications that are freely_available to do ner of common and systematic names of chemical_compounds is still incipient and their usability efficiency and accuracy are far from perfect to help alleviate these problems in this work we present and benchmark chener a machine_learning application based on conditional_random crfs that performs ner of iupac chemical_entities with improved_performance over comparable tools performance and selection are described in sections of the supplementary_materials because iupac names are the standard in important types of documents such as patents and the chemical_structure is often derivable from the mention itself it is important to have an application specifically devised for their identification given the potentially infinite number of iupac entities it is not feasible to develop a dictionary based_approach to identify them and natural_language methods are more suitable to identify those entities thus we developed chener an ner approach for finding iupac names in text using crfs we demonstrate that chener annotates iupac names in documents with a better f score than chemspot and oscar chener is the only tool that is specifically developed to identify only such names whereas chemspot and oscar do not differentiate between entity types we also show that chener needs less memory and cpu than the others to perform the same tasks in addition chener is self contained requiring only that java is installed to run which makes it easier to integrate in other systems
