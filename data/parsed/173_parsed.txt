genetic and population analysis a haplotype_based framework for group wise transmission disequilibrium tests for rare_variant analysis downloaded from motivation a major focus of current sequencing studies for human_genetics is to identify rare_variants associated with complex_diseases aside from reduced power of detecting associated rare_variants controlling for population_stratification is particularly challenging for rare_variants transmission disequilibrium tests tdt based on family designs are robust to population stratifi cation and admixture and therefore provide an effective approach to rare_variant studies to eliminate spurious_associations to increase power of rare_variant analysis gene based collapsing methods become standard_approaches for analyzing rare_variants existing_methods that extend this strategy to rare_variants in families usually combine tdt statistics at individual variants and therefore lack the flexibility of incorporating other genetic_models results in this study we describe a haplotype_based framework for group wise tdt gtdt that is flexible to encompass a variety of genetic_models such as additive dominant and compound_heterozygous ch i e recessive models as well as other complex interactions unlike existing_methods gtdt constructs haplotypes by transmission when possible and inherently takes_into the linkage_disequilibrium among variants through extensive simulations we showed that type_i was correctly controlled for rare_variants under all models investigated and this remained true in the presence of population_stratification under a variety of genetic_models gtdt showed increased power compared with the single marker tdt application of gtdt to an autism exome_sequencing of trios identified potentially interesting candidate_genes with ch rare_variants availability_and we implemented gtdt in c and the source_code and the detailed usage are available on the authors website https medschool next_generation is routinely employed to identify rare_variants e g variants with minor_allele maf associated with complex_traits although there are examples of studies implicating rare_variants in complex_diseases traits it is clear that such studies remain underpowered and elucidating the contribution of low_frequency variants to disease_etiology should benefit from additional methodology advances major challenges include the low power of traditional analysis methods and the severe multiple_testing for casecontrol_studies group wise methods such as cast and cmc collapse rare_variants into a single genetic unita gene region or pathwayto test the association of multiple rare_variants as a whole the underlying rationale of collapsing approaches is that if multiple_variants at a locus confer disease risk independently aggregating individual variants strengthens the overall signal and avoids multiplicity in single and multi marker tests resulting in increased power for association analysis of rare_variants a more powerful approach is to take a weighted_sum of rare_variants with weights reflecting the genetic effects of the corresponding variants such a strategy has the potential to achieve much improved power by assigning weights proportional to the genetic effect of corresponding variants a variety of methods have been developed with varying ways of selecting and weighting rare_variants in an effort to increase power of rare_variant studies and new methods continue to emerge see reviewsfor more details this rationale in group wise strategy to increase power however is able to aggregate and amplify spurious association_signals as well if such undesired signals exist such spurious association can be due to population_stratification for common_variants this confounding has been long_recognized and can be effectively accounted for by existing_methods most rare_variants are relatively young and often show differential allelic spectra in populations traditionally considered as homogeneous of rare_variants are population specific population_stratification effects due to rare_variants can be stronger than that due to common_variants and methods routinely used for controlling population_stratification in association studies of common_variants may fail for rare_variants family based analysis such as the transmission_disequilibrium tdt uses only transmission information from parents to offspring and is therefore robust to such confounding the collapsing approaches of rare_variants originally developed for unrelated samples have been extended to gene based tdt and show improved power over single marker tdt while controlling for population_stratification admixture providing a robust approach to rare_variant the general_strategy of these methods involves initial analysis done based on single variants and statistics across all rare_variants are then aggregated usually in a linear fashion to form a gene or group wise statistic these methods essentially implement additive genetic_models and are unable to model interactions among rare_variants in a gene or pathway such interactions may play_important in complex disease for example the compound_heterozygous ch model of loss of function variants has been implicated in autism given that causal rare_variants may act in complex mechanisms at different loci for different diseases it is critical to develop methods that can encompass flexible models in a unified_framework and to provide tools that enable the community to carry out such analyses in this study we describe a general framework for group wise tdt gtdt for rare_variants and implement a few classical genetic_models in a user_friendly and computationally_efficient tool the gtdt is haplotype_based and models the transmission of rare_variant carrying haplotypes rather than single variants directly modeling haplotypes is advantageous because i the transmission unit is haplotype and therefore it is the logical unit to model and ii gene_products originate from haplotypes so it is biologically_meaningful to model haplotypes iii it is straightforward to model interactions among variants along haplotypes or between father or mothers haplotypes and iv linkage_disequilibrium ld among variants is precisely accounted for without explicit estimation of ld given the flexibility of the framework a variety of models can be implemented for example models implemented in our tool include not only simple models such as additive and ch models but also a hybrid that fuses ch and weighted additive models to test for recessive effects while incorporating prior_knowledge on different variants it is straightforward to extend to other customized models tailored to specific diseases or genes to meet specific needs through extensive simulations we showed that type_i was correctly controlled for rare low_frequency variants e g up to maf under a variety of scenarios including various levels of population_stratification we evaluated the power of gtdt for different underlying genetic_models and gtdt significantly_outperformed single marker tdt for additive models we were able to compare gtdt with other methods and observed comparable power overall our gtdt provides a flexible framework and an efficient computational_tool to identify rare_variants implicated in diseases identifying genes harboring rare_variants associated with human complex_traits is of great interest on the other hand it is also intrinsically challenging owing to the dramatically_reduced power as well as the difficulty to account for rare_variant population_stratification admixture the framework we described in this study tackles this problem by aggregating rare_variants in a group and uses a haplotype_based tdt to control for population_stratification admixture compared with existing_methods our framework is better able to deal with complex genetic_models given the ubiquity of allelic_heterogeneity in disease_etiology it is natural to assume that there exist complex interactions between causal_variants our work provides a framework that enables the exploration of such complex models in addition customized weighting_schemes can be readily provided to gtdt so that effective weights such as functional prediction scores or the weights based on the clever use of controls can be incorporated to various models in gtdt to take advantage of specialized weights if the focus is on rare_variants e g maf our results show that it is adequate to use phasing by transmission implemented in gtdt we believe that this is the most commonly_employed strategy so that gtdt is able to handle the majority of situations for variants with maf we recommend using ld based_methods to phase genotypes before gtdt analysis t t n transmission transmission non transmission
