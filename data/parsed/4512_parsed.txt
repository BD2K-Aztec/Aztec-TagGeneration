systematic exploration of error sources in pyrosequencing flowgram data motivation pyrosequencing by roche diagnostics has emerged as an alternative to sanger_sequencing when it comes to read_lengths performance and cost but shows higher per base error_rates although there are several tools available for noise removal targeting different application fields data interpretation would benefit from a better understanding of the different error types results by exploring raw_data we quantify to what extent different factors account for sequencing_errors in addition to the well known homopolymer length inaccuracies we have identified errors likely to originate from other stages of the sequencing_process we use our findings to extend the flowsim pipeline with functionalities to simulate these errors and thus enable a more realistic simulation of pyrosequencing_data with flowsim second generation sequencing_techniques have revolutionized dna_sequencing in comparison with illumina solexa genome_analyzer and applied_biosystems solid pyrosequencing stands out with its longer_reads up to bp however higher sequencing_error compared with traditional_sanger and the lack of a detailed understanding of error characteristics still hamper the effective utilization of pyrosequencing in de_novo whole_genome high coverage may compensate for erroneous sequences however erroneous reads are problematic for snp_detection and especially for metagenomics as they can lead to a considerable overestimation of diversity in a sample hence there has been a strong focus on examining the quality of pyrosequencing_data and noise removal also artificial duplicates are an important issue because they may lead to incorrect conclusions about the abundance of species and genes
