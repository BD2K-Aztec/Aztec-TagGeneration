genetics_and varying coefficient model for gene_environment a non linear look motivation the genetic_basis of complex_traits often involves the function of multiple genetic_factors their interactions and the interaction between the genetic_and gene environment ge interaction is considered pivotal in determining trait variations and susceptibility of many genetic_disorders such as neurodegenerative_diseases or mental_disorders regression based_methods assuming a linear relationship between a disease response and the genetic_and as well as their interaction is the commonly used approach in detecting ge interaction the linearity assumption however could be easily violated due to non linear genetic penetrance which induces non linear ge interaction results in this work we propose to relax the linear ge assumption and allow for non linear ge interaction under a varying coefficient model framework we propose to estimate the varying coefficients with regression spline technique the model allows one to assess the non linear penetrance of a genetic_variant under different environmental_stimuli therefore help us to gain novel insights into the etiology of a complex disease several statistical_tests are proposed for a complete dissection of ge interaction a wild bootstrap method is adopted to assess_the both simulation and real_data analysis demonstrate the power and utility of the proposed method our method provides a powerful and testable framework for assessing non linear ge interaction the genetic_basis of a complex_trait often involves multiple genetic_factors functioning in a coordinated manner the extent on how our genetic blueprint expresses also depends on the interactions between genetic_and increasing evidences have shown that geneenvironment ge interactions play_pivotal determining the risk of diseases for instance the psychiatric_diseases reviewed in the neurodegenerative and to whom correspondence should be addressed cardiovascular_diseases and cancer due to the complex nature of the form and mechanism of ge interaction in different living_organisms hunting down the molecular_machinery of ge interaction has been a daunting task in the post genomic era there is a pressing need in developing_efficient and powerful statistical_methods for a rigorous investigation of ge interaction ge interaction refers to how genotypes influence phenotypes differently in different environments from a biological point_of ge interaction can be better viewed as the genetic responses to environment changes or stresses in a typical ge interaction study_design environment is often defined as different conditions coded as a discrete variable in a statistical_model for example in a study of ge interaction related to lung_cancer smoking_status can be defined as an environment condition coded as smoking or no smoking in many other studies the environment condition is defined as a continuous measure for one example studies show that of type_ii and of cardiovascular_disease are related to obesity defined by body_mass bmi to track down genetic_factors responsible for diabetes or cardiovascular_disease obesity can be defined as an environment factor that may induce or reduce the expression of particular genes to affect the disease status the contribution of the same gene to a disease status may be largely different under different bmi levels as another example the peak bone_mineral bmd in adulthood varies a lot across different age_groups the amount of nutrition intake e g vitamin_d is also an important environment factor_influencing the variation of bmd individuals carrying the same gene may respond differently to the rate of density decrease as they get older also the peak bmd measure may vary a lot across groups with different nutrition intake potentially due to the interaction of specific genes with the amount of nutrition intake e g vitamin_d statistical_methods for testing ge interaction can be broadly categorized into two areas the model_based either parametrically non parametrically or semi parametrically e g and the model free method such as the multifactor_dimensionality method in a modelbased regression_framework traditional parametric methods need strong model_assumptions such as assuming linear ge interactionpage the natural_variation of a quantitative phenotype is not only determined by the inherited genetic_factors but also can be explained by how sensitive a genetic factor responds to environmental_stimuli geneenvironment interaction the genetic control of sensitivity to environment plays_a in determining trait variations in humans most diseases results from a complex interaction between an individuals genetic blueprint and the associated environmental condition for example type_ii and cardiovascular_disease are often due to the complex interaction between an individuals genes and obesity condition the more we learn about how genes interact with environment in determining trait variations and disease risks the more we can achieve in prevention and treatment of illnesses the importance of ge interaction in human disease has been historically recognized e g many statistical_methods have been proposed to target ge interaction in this work we relaxed the linear ge interaction assumption and proposed a new method considering non linear ge interaction we focused our attention on environment with continuous measurement e g dietary_intake obesity condition and the amount of addictive substances we adopted the well known vc model into a genetic_mapping framework and proposed to estimate the functional coefficient by the non parametric b spline technique the superior_performance of the vc model in detecting non linear ge interaction has been demonstrated with extensive monte_carlo when the genetic_contribution to the variation of a phenotype varies largely across environmental_conditions the proposed vc model achieves the optimal power compared with models assuming constant or linear coefficient although in theory the b spline estimator converges to the true underlying function depending on various factors the vc model may not achieve the optimal power when the true function is constant or linear in real_data analysis often the heritability level is unknown before we fit a model thus it is necessary to conduct a hypothesis_test to assess the true underlying functional coefficient based on the results from simulation and real_data analysis we conclude that the vc model cannot completely substitute the linear parametric model in ge analysis our practical recommendation is to do a hypothesis_test first to assess the function of the coefficients then fit the appropriate model in many cases linear or constant coefficients are preferred and a linear_model can be fitted noted that the estimation of the varying coefficients is essentially a least_squares problem hence is computationally fast the computational_cost comes with the wild bootstrap procedure to assess the significance of the coefficients by first assessing the function of the coefficients we could save computation time dramatically we applied the method to a real_dataset to identify genetic_factors interacting with mothers mbi to explain the normal variation of babys birth_weight we adopted a two parameter model which is biologically more attractive than a one parameter model we found a few snps showing non linear penetrance across different environmental_stimuli i e different mbmi levels even though only two snps showed statistical_significance after multiple testing adjustments following the fdr procedure we still found a few others with relatively strong signals p in checking the function of the snps some of those are growth_factors that are directly related to fetal_growth for example platelet_derived b pdgfb and fibroblast_growth fgf fgf is essential for mammalian embryogenesis and fetal_growth snp in exon located in fgf was also identified by a different model showing a strong dominance effect on small_for along with maternal body_weight when searching for genetic conflict effect like many other statistical_methods in association analysis genotyping_errors and missing_data are certainly obvious issues as pointed_out by one referee in the current analysis we focused on the model in a general setting these issues need to be evaluated with extensive simulations and will be considered in our future work in addition to these two issues our method does not apply to rare_variants either further model development is needed to take rare_variants into consideration for snps with highly unbalanced page
