sina accurate high_throughput multiple_sequence of ribosomal_rna motivation in the analysis of homologous_sequences computation of multiple_sequence msas has become a bottleneck this is especially troublesome for marker_genes like the ribosomal_rna rrna where already millions of sequences are publicly_available and individual studies can easily produce hundreds of thousands of new sequences methods have been developed to cope with such numbers but further improvements are needed to meet accuracy requirements results in this study we present the silva incremental aligner sina used to align the rrna gene databases provided by the silva ribosomal_rna project sina uses a combination of k_mer searching and partial order alignment poa to maintain very high alignment_accuracy while satisfying high_throughput performance demands sina was evaluated in comparison with the commonly used high_throughput msa programs pynast and mothur the three bralibase iii benchmark msas could be reproduced with and accuracy a larger benchmark msa comprising sequences could be reproduced with and accuracy using reference msas comprising and sequences sina was able to achieve_higher than pynast and mothur in all performed benchmarks availability alignment of up to sequences using the latest silva ssu lsu ref datasets as reference msa is offered atmultiple sequence_alignment msa is a core building_block in the analysis of biological sequence_data phylogenetic_tree structure_prediction or hidden_markov modeling require msa to infer residue_level homology or structural or functional identity the ubiquitous need for msa computation has made this field an active research_topic with over methods to whom correspondence should be addressed published in the past_years and numerous review_papers discussing their relative_merits and deficiencies the dependency of the subsequent analysis methods on the results of the msa stage and the drastic effect differing msas can cause make alignment_accuracy the primary benchmark for novel and improved methods the task of computing the optimal alignment as determined by the sum of pairs sp score was shown to be non deterministic polynomial np complete and is therefore only feasible for very few sequences for sets of sequences comprising several thousand or more sequences heuristic_algorithms are used the most prevalent algorithms are based on the progressive alignment technique which builds the msa via a series of pairwise_alignments of sequences and partial alignments along the branches of a guide_tree sequence data_volumes are growing_exponentially this was already observed almost years_ago and the effect has not diminished since msa has long been largely unaffected because the numbers in which homologous_gene sequences were available remained_low for many genes however this situation is changing especially frequently sequenced marker_genes such as the ribosomal_rna are rapidly becoming available in volumes exceeding the scalability of traditional alignment_techniques in the first release of the silva ssu database contained over small_subunit ssu gene sequences until september that database grew more than sevenfold to contain sequences the two other large rrna databases greengenes and rdp are of similar size the large_subunit rrna lsu provided only by silva grew only slightly slower in the database contained sequences currently it contains almost six times as many sequences although each of these databases uses a different tool to compute their alignments the used methods share one important characteristic rather than computing an alignment de_novo the alignment of each individual sequence is derived from a static reference msa the reference msa implicitly defines a fixed set of alignment columns into which the bases comprising the query_sequence are placed by avoiding mutual comparisons between the sequences considered for inclusion in the final msa candidate_sequences the alignment process becomes inherently scalable furthermore the msa offered by the database provider can bewe reported the average q scores because they are commonly used as accuracy indicator for sequence_alignment however the values are not directly comparable to results obtained for de_novo methods as these lack the benefit of a guiding reference alignment given a consistent reference alignment selecting a reference_sequence closely_resembling the candidate sequence and transferring the alignment positions of the shared segments suffices to perfectly align those shared segments the identity between the candidate_sequences and the available reference_sequences should therefore be considered as a baseline when interpreting the results this also affects the precision with which accuracy can be measured as can be seen in the variance among sampled test cases was extremely_low when considering only those sequences that had an identity with the reference_sequences of variance increased by an order of magnitude we therefore believe that assessing alignment_accuracy to a precision of is permissible for the benchmarks we performed in interpreting the results it may also be more informative to consider error_rates rather than the fraction of correctly aligned bases for example pynast achieves accuracy q on the bralibase s rrna dataset whereas sina achieves this amounts to error_rates of and thus sina placed only half as many bases in the wrong columns because sequence_alignment is only one of many sources for error in sequence_alignment the permissible margin of error depends on many factors we can however determine an upper_bound at which it is more sensible to forgo extension of the reference msa and instead use a homology_search to map candidate_sequences to results based solely on the reference msa in this case the error would be equivalent to the distance between candidate and best matching reference because both error and distance are measured as a fraction of differing base positions the average distance may therefore be used as a point of reference for the permissible error methods expecting a msa as input do not commonly incorporate measures to deal with errors in the msa they will also make mutual comparisons between the aligned candidate_sequences demanding that the error be at least an order_of the distance therefore seems prudent according to the ssu benchmark the distance between candidates and references averages to using reference_sequences and using reference_sequences the same benchmark shows error_rates for the nast based_methods of above and in absolute_numbers this means that when using a k reference msa the candidates and their best matching reference_sequences where on average distinguished by positions according to the original alignment thirty two positions where misaligned by nast sina fares much better at error_rate or misaligned positions its error was only a third of that produced by pynast and mothur although the aforementioned order of magnitude difference between error and distance would demand at most seven misaligned positions we may have reached the resolution of the benchmark when manually inspecting the positions comprising the error we found that most cases were related to extensions of homo polymers conflicts between primary and secondary_structure alignment or inconsistencies in the reference msa from the silva rrna gene datasets and the online sina alignment service both of which having been available for several years now we were able to gather user feedback on these shortcomings in general users stated that the changes they made in manually refining the sina alignment were related to the secondary_structure however we were unable to collect sufficient problematic sequences in which secondary_structure awareness would clearly improve alignment_accuracy to build a dataset for benchmarking we therefore concur with the observation made by kemena that much larger high_quality benchmark msas are needed especially for improving and evaluating the accuracy of high_throughput msa methods although the dataset extracted from the silva ssu ref database used in the evaluation of sina is of high_quality it is merely a subset of the silva ssu seed as such it lacks a representative distribution of distances between sequences and would require further refinement and extension to become a good benchmark furthermore a benchmark msa explicitly constructed to comprise fewer columns than a correct alignment demands would be required to test the performance of alternative_methods for constraining the number of columns because we expect that many other genes besides the rnas will soon become available in numbers surpassing what can be feasibly aligned using de_novo techniques we also see a need for advanced interactive tools to support building and curating large msas to be used as benchmark or reference msas once benchmarks of sufficient resolution at high alignment_accuracy levels become available it may be interesting to investigate whether improving the poa based stage in sina with methods used by de_novo msa tools such as infernal muscle or mafft can further enhance alignment_accuracy we have shown that combining a k_mer distance search with poa incremental msa to integrate candidate_sequences into an existing msa yields highly_accurate results using multiple reference_sequences as a basis for the alignment of the candidate_sequences significantly_improves alignment_quality dynamically selecting a low fixed number of sequences from which the alignment template is constructed rather than basing the alignment on a global template built from all reference_sequences allows the use of very large reference msas lowering the number of bases remaining unaligned because they do not occur in the reference msa furthermore suboptimal alignment behaviour for groups of novel candidate_sequences can be easily corrected by manually optimizing the alignment of one of these sequences and adding it to the reference msa with sina we provide a versatile and flexible tool for accurate high_throughput msa that has proven its reliability and robustness over several years of testing in the context of the silva project
