microrna modules prefer to bind weak and unconventional target_sites motivation micrornas mirnas play_critical gene_regulation although it is well known that multiple_mirnas may work as mirna modules to synergistically regulate common target_mrnas the understanding of mirna modules is still in its infancy results we employed the recently generated high_throughput experimental_data to study mirna modules we predicted mirna modules and potential mirna modules we observed that the target_sites of these predicted modules were in general weaker compared with those not bound by mirna modules we also discovered that mirnas in predicted modules preferred to bind unconventional target_sites rather than canonical sites surprisingly contrary to a previous study we found that most adjacent mirna_target from the same mirna modules were not within the range of nucleotides interestingly the distance of target_sites bound by mirnas in the same modules was shorter when mirna modules bound unconventional instead of canonical sites our study shed new light on mirna binding and mirna_target which will likely advance_our of mirna regulation availability_and the software mirmodule can be freely downloaded atmicrornas mirnas play_critical gene_regulation mirnas are a family of small nucleotides non_coding they can bind mrnas at untranslated_regions utrs coding_sequences cdss and utrs the binding is traditionally thought to be through base_pairing of the seed regions in mirnas with the partially complementary_sequences in target_mrnas the seed_region refers to the end of mirnas from position to position depending on the pairing quality mirna_target are classified into two categories canonical sites and non canonical sites the former are target_sites that are perfect complementary to the seed regions while the latter are target_sites with imperfect seed complementarity g u wobbles or mismatches with the advance of biotechnology it is accepted that base_pairing can involve both seed regions and non seed regions that is other types of target_sites exist in addition to the canonical and non canonical target_sites we define unconventional sites as target_sites other than the canonical sites regardless of the types of target_sites the binding of mirnas to their target_mrnas during diverse_cellular may degrade target_mrnas and or repress the translation of target_mrnas to proteins due to such pivotal roles in gene_regulation it is critical to study mirnas and their target_sites mirnas often form modules to regulate target_mrnas in this study a mirna module is v c the author published_by we studied mirna modules based on experimentally_determined mirna_target we predicted mirna modules and potential mirna modules we demonstrated that mirna modules preferred to bind weak sites and favoured a combination of all unconventional sites we also observed that mirna modules preferred to bind in cdss and favoured the first and the last exons we confirmed that more than of mirna modules bound sites within specific ranges with enrichment in two previously known ranges however many more adjacent sites bound by mirna modules were nucleotides apart we further showed that unconventional target_sites of mirna modules were often within shorter distances than other combinations of target_sites our study shed new light on mirna binding the majority of adjacent target_sites of mirna modules were nucleotides apart which contradicted with previous observations to understand what resulted in different observations we focused on target_sites of the mirna modules in utrs we found even when we considered only target_sites in utrs more than of adjacent target_sites of mirna modules were nucleotides apart we also predicted mirna module candidates using only the clash target_sites in utrs and then studied the distances of adjacent target_sites of these candidates we still observed that the majority of adjacent target_sites of these candidates were nucleotides apart supplementary_file s therefore the different observations were unlikely because we used target_sites in entire mrna regions while previous_studies used only target_sites in utrs instead it may be due to the small number of experimentally_determined sites in previous experimental_studies and the limited quality of predicted sites in the previous computational study compared with the high_quality experimentally_determined sites we used we predicted potential mirna modules on the condition that they downregulated target_genes significantly more than some of their mirna subsets we further checked whether these potential modules downregulated their target_genes significantly more than any subset contained in the modules we confirmed that for all potential mirna modules their target_genes were significantly more down_regulated than the target_genes of any of their subsets we discovered non synergistic modules the non synergistic modules may also play_important target_genes as supported by go and pathway analyses order preference and the literature moreover these non synergistic modules may be competitive mirna modules that are worth further investigation
