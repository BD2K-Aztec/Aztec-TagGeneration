systems_biology a computational_model to predict the immune system activation by citrus derived vaccine_adjuvants motivation vaccines represent the most effective and cost efficient weapons against a wide_range of diseases nowadays new generation vaccines based on subunit antigens reduce adverse_effects in high_risk individuals however vaccine antigens are often poor immunogens when administered alone adjuvants represent a good strategy to overcome such hurdles indeed they are able to enhance the immune_response allow antigens sparing accelerate the specific immune_response and increase vaccine_efficacy in vulnerable_groups such as newborns elderly or immuno compromised people however due to safety_concerns and adverse_reactions there are only a few adjuvants approved for use in humans moreover in practice current adjuvants sometimes fail to confer adequate stimulation hence there is an imperative need to develop novel adjuvants that overcome the limitations of the currently available licensed adjuvants results we developed a computational framework that provides a complete pipeline capable of predicting the best citrus derived adjuvants for enhancing the immune system response using as a target disease model influenza a infection in silico simulations suggested a good immune efficacy of specific citrus derived adjuvant beta_sitosterol that was then confirmed in vivo vaccines are the most effective and cost efficient means to prevent infectious_diseases nowadays the approaches to develop novel and safer vaccines require the use of well characterized antigens such as purified_proteins peptides or carbohydrates unfortunately often these so_called subunit antigens are poor immunogens when administered alone therefore additional adjuvants are required to potentiate the immune_response adjuvants can be used for various purposes i to enhance accelerate or prolong the immunogenicity of highly_purified or recombinant antigens ii to reduce the antigen dose or the number of immunizations needed for protective_immunity iii to improve the efficacy of vaccines in high_risk population such as newborns elderly or immuno compromised people iv as antigen delivery_systems for the uptake of antigens by the mucosa and or v to protect the antigens from degradation depot effect adjuvants may also have significant effects on the nature of the immune_responses and can tilt the immune system in favor of t_helper th or t_helper th type response adjuvants can be generally classified into two groups the first group is composed of delivery_vehicles that are used to manage the storage releasing and presentation of vaccine antigens to the immune system this group includes mineral salts emulsions liposomes and virosomes the second group is composed of immunostimulants immunostimulants are compounds that aim to improve the immune_responses to specific vaccine antigens by stimulating the releasing of cytokines through various mechanisms i e mhc_molecules costimulatory_signals or intracellular_signaling in this group it is possible to find toll_like tlr_agonists cytokines and saponins the first adjuvant_activity was discovered empirically in with diphtheria_toxoid absorbed to alum since then despite several decades of research aluminium based mineral salts alum remains the most used and approved adjuvant for human vaccines alum has a good track record of safety and it has been considered the adjuvant of choice for vaccination against infections that can be prevented by antibody_responses and as such it has been widely and successfully used in many licensed vaccines however some limitations of alum are also well known alum fails to confer adequate increase of antibody_response to small_peptides as well as certain vaccines such as typhoid_fever and influenza_vaccines notably alum is known to be a poor adjuvant for induction of cytotoxic t cell immunity and th responses which are required to combat several life_threatening there is then an urgent need to develop novel adjuvants to support the development of vaccines against pathogens that have been so_far refractory to the traditional vaccination strategies to address effective_vaccines against unmet medical need in particular the need of new adjuvants capable of boosting the immune_responses of individuals with a lower or compromised immune system response such as the elderly and immuno compromised populations represents_a of our times although a lot of effort has focused on the development of new adjuvants which include mineral salts detoxified toxins lipopeptides emulsions cytokines polysaccharides and nucleic_acids very few are presently approved for human use there are in fact many issues that hinder the development of new adjuvants including the development of local or systemic side_effects if the most common local_reactions to adjuvants include pain injection_site necrosis swelling granulomas lymphadenopathy ulcers and abscesses the most common systemic side_effects are represented by nausea arthritis fever eosinophilia uveitis anaphylaxis immunosuppression or autoimmune_diseases even alum is not free from side_effects such as fever and muscle_soreness moreover difficulty of manufacture poor stability and high production_costs represent other unresolved_issues of the adjuvant development pipeline a deep scientific_understanding of novel adjuvants is indeed compulsory to set up the required nonclinical safety_testing programs and even more testing programs are in general required for synthetic nonhuman derivatives of toxic_compounds and protein based adjuvants accumulating_evidence selected naturally derived components such as e g flavonoids and vitamins collectively referred to as nutritive adjuvants have immunomodulating properties consequently a good starting_point for the development of new and potentially_effective adjuvants may to adopt naturally derived_products and their use may also lead to reduced_toxicity and faster development there are many biotechnological methodologies for evaluating the efficacy of potential adjuvants ranging from in vitro to in vivo techniques such techniques have often been coupled with the use of in silico techniques to speed up the identification of novel candidate adjuvants however a complete pipeline encompassing initial selection based on literature_searches or in vitro studies in silico evaluations at the molecular and cellular_level and in vivo trials has yet to be developed the combination of in silico in vitro and in vivo studies organized in a rationale manner at both molecular cellular and systemic scales may represent major advance in the identification of potential novel adjuvants in this article we present a computational framework that connects and integrates an in silico molecular evaluation based on the virtual_screening technique with an ad_hoc agent based simulator to search and predict the best citrus derived adjuvants able to enhance the immune system response as a target disease model we chose influenza a using as a candidate vaccine the influenza a virosome finally the predictions made by the simulation framework were validated in vivo the database of ligands for the virtual screenings was built from the molecules known in the literature to be found in orange fruit extracts and their d structures were downloaded from pubchem or built manually when not available moreover to consider the possibility of finding ligands not yet identified or present in very low quantities in extracts the database was merged with the molecules included in aritas flavonoid library that were previously converted to d so the final library consists of molecules in a microsoft access database the structure_based was carried_out using the plants software defining a sphere of a radius centered on the lps barycentre in its crystallographic pose and using plp as the scoring_function betasitosterol linoleic_acid ethyl_ester and hesperidin were selected among the best ranked score candidate adjuvants because as already detailed in section we found evidences of immune we present the total_igg igg and igg a levels obtained at day according to the in silico predictions the best adjuvant is represented by beta_sitosterol which is capable of promoting a very strong humoral_response when administered in conjunction with the virosome a lower immune system response is also obtained by using hesperidin as the adjuvant whereas the administration of linoleic_acid did not bring any significant_improvement in respect to the virosome administration only in we show the temporal evolution of igg dynamics for virosome combined with hesperidin b beta_sitosterol c linoleic_acid d and virosome only e in silico simulations show that the administration of linoleic_acid d seems to initially have a detrimental_effect in respect to the administration of the virosome only e however after the second immunization day a somewhat stronger immune_response is capable of filling the gap between the two treatments as highlighted by the behavior of igg_antibodies interestingly both the administration of hesperidin b and beta_sitosterol c are able to elicit a very strong first response but as showed by igg temporal_dynamics only the latter is able to improve the immune_response after the second immunization whereas the former partially loses its efficacy we also report the dynamics of igm titers however these levels were not measured in in vivo experiments hence we used the same parameter_values as in our previous_works without tuning them from a qualitative point_of the low concentration of igm may be in agreement with the general immunology literature in silico predictions have then been tested in vivo according to the procedure described in section in we show the igg levels obtained in vivo at day from a comparison of the in vivo and in silico experiments figs and it is possible to confirm that the simulator is clearly able to capture the complexity of the problem by predicting beta_sitosterol as the best adjuvant of the pool the predicted hesperidin effects seem to be slightly over estimated however the in vivo experiment confirms that the use of hesperidin as adjuvant has a positive effect in comparison to the administration of the virsome only even if with less efficacy finally as showed by the in silico predictions the use of linoleic_acid is useless for promoting the immunization indeed the in vivo results show that it negatively influences the effects of the immune the second group b is treated with the influenza a virosome in conjunction with hesperidin the third group c is treated with the influenza a virosome in conjunction with beta_sitosterol the fourth group d is treated with the influenza a virosome in conjunction with linoleic_acid the fifth group e is treated with the influenza a virosome only the levels of igg igg and igg a are shown at day adjuvants dosage was of lg administered at day and the experiments last days in vivo trials confirmed the predictions made by the in silico simulation framework in silico influenza specific antibody_titres five groups of in silico mice were simulated the first group a has no treatment placebo the second group b is treated with the influenza a virosome in conjunction with hesperidin the third group c is treated with the influenza a virosome in conjunction with beta_sitosterol the fourth group d is treated with the influenza a virosome in conjunction with linoleic_acid the fifth group e is treated with the influenza a virosome only the levels of igg igg and igg a are shown at day adjuvants plus virosome and virosome alone dosage were of lg administered at day and the in silico experiments last dayspredicting the best citrus derived adjuvantsresponse this was also partially highlighted by the sfa simulator but only at the time of the first immunization
