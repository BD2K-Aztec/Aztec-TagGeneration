genevalidator identify problems with protein_coding predictions genomes of emerging model_organisms are now being sequenced at very low_cost however obtaining accurate gene predictions remains_challenging even the best gene prediction_algorithms make substantial errors and can jeopardize subsequent analyses therefore many predicted genes must be time consumingly visually inspected and manually_curated we developed genevalidator gv to automatically identify problematic gene predictions and to aid manual_curation for each gene gv performs multiple analyses based on comparisons to gene sequences from large_databases the resulting report identifies problematic gene predictions and includes extensive statistics and graphs for each prediction to guide manual_curation efforts gv thus accelerates and enhances the work of biocura tors and researchers who need accurate gene predictions from newly_sequenced availability_and gv can be used through a web_interface or in the command_line gv is open_source agpl available at https wurmlab github io tools genevalidator the plummeting costs of dna_sequencing have made de_novo genome_sequencing accessible to individual laboratories and even researchers however identifying genes in a newly assembled genome remains_challenging traditional gene prediction_approaches involve either ab_initio prediction via modelling of coding versus non coding_sequence or similaritybased prediction using independent sources relevant sources include protein_coding from other organisms or peptide or transcriptome sequences from the organism being studied modern algorithms combine both approaches the recent ability of obtaining large_amounts of rna_sequences at low_cost has led to a dramatic_improvement in the performance of similarity based_algorithms and thus gene prediction quality albeit only for expressed genes despite this the accuracy of gene prediction_tools e g remains disappointing typical errors include missing exons noncoding sequence retention in exons fragmenting genes and merging neighboring genes automated gene prediction quality evaluation_tools analyze exon boundaries or focus on subsets of highly_conserved genes unfortunately such tools ignore most of the information present in frequently updated databases such as swissprot or genbank nr visual_analysis is thus required to identify errors and manual_curation is needed to fix them this requires tens of minutes to days for one gene a daunting task when considering analyses of dozens of species each with thousands of genes gvs power comes from leveraging large frequently updated databases using multiple metrics input_output format flexibility and importantly its multiple data visualization approaches indeed visualization is crucial for understanding genomic comparisons the code underlying gv respects best practices in scientific software_development however gvs analyses depend h conserved_regions graphs ad were produced with a sequence for which gv detected no problems the other graphs show typical problems e query is short f g query_sequence is a fusion of unrelated genes h query includes sequence absent from first hits on blast identification of homologs in databases which include low quality sequences on expecting similar gene sequence and structure among homologs and on empirically chosen cutoffs binary results of individual_tests are thus indicative rather than infallible similarly gvs overall quality evaluations are not ground truths but indicate consistencies with database sequences we used two approaches to determine the appropriateness of gvs scoring system gv scores for randomly_selected swissprot genes were significantly_higher than gv scores for randomly_selected trembl genes supplementary similarly of recently updated gene models from four eukaryotic_genomes had higher gv scores than older versions supplementary supplementary both results are consistent with gv appropriately quantifying gene prediction improvements due to manual_curation or improved gene prediction technologies lower gv scores for some gene predictions could be due the reference_databases containing sequences of low quality new automated predictions introducing new errors and scores being noisy for queries with few blast hits
