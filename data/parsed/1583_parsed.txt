ensemble based evaluation for protein_structure models_motivation comparing protein tertiary_structures is a fundamental procedure in structural_biology and protein bioinformatics structure comparison is important particularly for evaluating computational protein_structure models most of the model structure evaluation methods perform rigid_body superimposition of a structure model to its crystal_structure and measure the difference of the corresponding residue or atom positions between them however these methods neglect intrinsic flexibility of proteins by treating the native_structure as a rigid molecule because different parts of proteins have different levels of flexibility for example exposed loop_regions are usually more flexible than the core_region of a protein_structure disagreement of a model to the native needs to be evaluated differently depending on the flexibility of residues in a protein results we propose a score named flexscore for comparing protein_structures that consider flexibility of each residue in the native_state of proteins flexibility information may be extracted from experiments such as nmr or molecular_dynamics flexscore considers an ensemble of conformations of a protein described as a multivariate_gaussian of atomic displacements and compares a query computational_model with the ensemble we compare flexscore with other commonly used structure similarity_scores over various examples flexscore agrees with experts intuitive assessment of computational_models and provides information of practical usefulness of models availability_and https bitbucket org mjamroz flexscoreproteins are intrinsically flexible molecules flexibility is essential in understanding protein activity where conformational_entropy has a major role including protein ligand proteinprotein_interactions protein allostery and protein_folding although it is conventional to consider a single structure for a protein particularly when the structure was solved by x_ray a protein can change its conformation in different experimental_conditions furthermore there is compelling_evidence that indicates even x_ray data contains flexibility information and that diffraction data can be interpreted into different conformations indeed a group of structural biologists proposed to deposit an ensemble of structures even for x_ray to public_databases so that data represent structural_heterogeneity and dynamics more properly thus in principle it is more appropriate to represent a protein_structure as an ensemble of alternative conformations in practice flexibility information of a protein can be obtained either from experiments such as nmr or computational_analysis including molecular_dynamics md_simulations and normal_mode by bringing flexibility into the picture of proteins the protein_sequence tostructure to function paradigm must be revised to sequence to structure to dynamics to function reflecting the current situation that a protein is usually represented with a single conformation most of the commonly used protein_structure model evaluation methods compare a model against a single structure of the protein the native_structure for example we proposed a new score named fs and its variant fs gdt which evaluates the quality of computational protein_structure models by considering flexibility of protein_chains fs effectively distinguishes deviations of a model from a reference structure at intrinsically flexible and rigid regions and assigns more permissive scores to the former than the latter this is reasonable from the biophysics perspective of protein_structures the flexibility of a protein was measured from a md_simulation of ns because it was long enough to observe large flexibility in protein terminal regions and to highlight incorrect regions of structure models that are beyond the range of chain flexibility for a casp model t we extended the md run to ns but fs did not show meaningful change supplementary table s and the framework provided here is valid in principle with any data of protein_flexibility and fs would provide_reasonable evaluation to these models under the provided flexibility information we point out that md_simulations are easier to perform than it used to be for example by using web_based md tools previously we developed a method_named flexpred which predicts absolute_values of residue fluctuation from a tertiary_structure i e a pdb_file of a target protein which can be also used to obtain flexibility at this juncture it would be of interest to discuss difference of using md_simulations and using b factors as the source of fluctuation as mentioned in introduction the work by wu wu introduced a b factor weighted rmsd first of all the level of fluctuation considered are different between them b factors indicate discrepancy of a solved structure to the x_ray pattern of the protein thus although the b factors were shown to have correlation to residue flexibility observed in computational simulation it is flexibility in the crystal condition of proteins it was shown that b factors are appropriate measure of fluctuations for stable parts of proteins but significantly underestimate motion in flexible regions in contrast md used in fs is aimed at considering flexibility of proteins in solution which is a more natural environment for proteins from a technical stand point to use b factors for flexibility value a weight parameter needs to be arbitrarily selected because b factors do not provide absolute_values of flexibility also in fs flexibility is used more explicitly in the structure superimposition step than the b factor weighted rmsd the results in the prediction group ranking shows that fs is in reasonable agreement with the other existing scores in recent rounds of the casp experiments computational_models are evaluated with a combination of several scoring terms that examine different structural_aspects of models combined with other scores fs will be able to provide a new viewpoint to the protein_structure evaluation the technique
