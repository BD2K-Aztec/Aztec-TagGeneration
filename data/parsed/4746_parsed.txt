sequence_analysis triplex an r bioconductor_package for identification and visualization of potential intramolecular triplex patterns in dna_sequences motivation upgrade and integration of triplex software into the r bioconductor framework results we combined a previously_published implementation of a trip lex dna search algorithm with visualization to create a versatile r bioconductor_package triplex the new package provides functions that can be used to search bioconductor genomes and other dna sequence_data for occurrence of nucleotide patterns capable of forming intramolecular triplexes h dna functions producing d and d diagrams of the identified triplexes allow instant visualization of the search results leveraging the power of biostrings and granges classes the results get fully integrated into the existing bioconductor framework allowing their passage to other genome visualization and annotation packages such as genomegraphs rtracklayer or gviz availability r package triplex is available from bioconductordna sequence_analysis and annotation are important_steps in uncovering the molecular basis of life although protein_coding have been intensively_studied in the past recent focus has shifted toward the less known biological_functions encoded in intergenic dna as well as the study of structural and regulatory aspects of genetic_information packaging in chromosomes tools for the necessary sequence_analysis of non coding_sequences are less common than their gene centered counterparts we have recently formulated and implemented an algorithm to detect potential triplex forming sequences in genomes such sequences have been implicated as important_players in several key_processes such as transcriptional_regulation or dna_recombination triplex dna forms when a third strand of nucleotides is allowed to align with a watsoncrick duplex using hoogsteen
