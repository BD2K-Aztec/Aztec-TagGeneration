structural_bioinformatics strum structure based prediction of protein_stability changes upon single_point downloaded from motivation mutations in human_genome are mainly through single_nucleotide some of which can affect stability and function of proteins causing human_diseases several methods have been proposed to predict the effect of mutations on protein_stability but most require features from experimental structure given the fast progress in protein_structure this work explores the possibility to improve the mutation induced stability change prediction using low_resolution structure modeling results we developed a new method strum for predicting stability change caused by single_point starting from wild_type sequences d models are constructed by the iterative threading assembly refinement i tasser simulations where physics and knowledge based energy_functions are derived on the i tasser models and used to train strum models through gradient_boosting regression strum was assessed by fold_cross on experimentally_determined mutations from proteins the pearson_correlation pcc between predicted and measured changes of gibbs_free gap ddg upon mutation reaches with a root_mean kcal_mol in the mutation based cross_validations the pcc reduces if separating training and test mutations from non homologous_proteins which reflects inherent correlations in the current mutation sample nevertheless the results significantly_outperform other state of the art methods including those built on experimental protein_structures detailed_analyses show that the most sensitive features in strum are the physics based energy_terms on i tasser models and the conservation scores from multiple threading template alignments however the ddg prediction_accuracy has only a marginal dependence on the accuracy of protein_structure models as long as the global fold is correct these data demonstrate the feasibility to use low_resolution structure modeling for high_accuracy stability change prediction upon point_mutations availability and implementationmutation and evolution in the human_genome are mainly through single_nucleotide snps with the developments of high_throughput array based genotyping_methods and the next_generation a large_volume of snp data has been recently accumulated it is estimated that around of the exonic snps in the human_genome can result in change in protein amino_acid called non synonymous snp or nssnp in many cases the nssnp mutations have little or no discernible effect on protein functions but others are known to be responsible for many human_diseases experimental_measurements showed that nearly one third of nssnp mutations are deleterious to human_health recognizing such deleterious nssnp mutations is of critical importance to both protein_function and disease diagnosis in the viewpoint of thermodynamics the effects of the mutations can be assessed through changes on the thermal_stability of protein systems the stability of proteins can be quantitatively characterized by a simple two state model folded and unfolded where the difference in gibbs_free between the unfolded g u and the folded g f states dg g u g f is used to specify the fold stability the higher and more positive dg is the more stable the protein is against denaturation when a mutation_occurs the free_energy and the stability can change where the free energy_gap difference between wild_type dg m and mutant protein dg w ddg dg m dg w is a measure of how mutation affects protein_stability illustrates an example where the mutation destabilized the protein by reducing the free energy_gap between folded and unfolded_states in general a ddg below zero means that the mutation causes destabilization otherwise it induces stabilization although mutagenesis_studies are important approach to experimentally characterizing the thermodynamic and physiological effects of nssnps it is often too expensive_and for largescale mutation studies computational mutation prediction becomes increasingly important with the rapid accumulation of sequence mutation data current computational_approaches can be generally categorized into sequence_based and structure based_methods one of the most popularly used sequenced based_methods is sift which predicts whether an amino_acid affects protein_function based on the degree of conservation of amino_acid in multiple_sequence msas that are derived from closely_related sequences a pearson_correlation pcc of was obtained by sift between the residue conservation and the number of experimentally_determined deleterious_mutations inps is another sequence_based method recently_developed on svm regression by appropriate combination of evolutionary_information a pcc of was obtained by insp when tested in the protein level cross_validations recent_studies considerable advantages in exploiting information of protein d structures in the mutation induced stability change prediction for instance foldx used a full atomic description of protein_structure to estimate the importance of the interactions contributing to the stability of proteins and protein_complexes which generated ddg predictions with a correlation to the experimental_data for single_point foldx was recently exploited by bindprof which shows that it can improve_the of mutation effects on protein binding_interactions when combined with structure based interface profiles i mutant trained the stability models on the neighboring residue_types within a a radius sphere and achieved an increase in the correlation of predicted and measured ddg by compared with the model based on sequence_features alone popmusic went further to take the spatial descriptors from the native_structure of the wild_type protein and had the ddg calculated by a linear combination of knowledge based terms on the protein_structure which resulted in a correlation of between predicted and measured stability changes after exclusion of outliers promaya considered a meta server approach to combine the structure features with ddg predicted from different programs which resulted in improved correlation of on the validation datasets more recently neemo used residue connection networks in d structure to assess residue stability achieving a pcc of mcsm considered a similar idea of distance maps of vicinity atoms from the wild_type protein_structure which was combined with the pharmacophore counts to estimate the impact of mutations and achieved improved correlation over several competing_methods despite the advantage of the structure based prediction the majority of the methods were trained and benchmarked on the experimental structure of the target_proteins some methods e g promaya require specifically the x_ray crystal_structures as crystallography features such as b factor are used however experimental_structures are often not available for proteins in fact only of proteins in the uniprot have a d structure in the pdb library the lack of experimental_structures renders many of the structure based_methods unfeasible for the practical_application given the fast progress in protein_structure as witnessed by the community_wide casp experiment here we explore the possibility to use low_resolution models from nonhomologous structure_prediction to improve the mutation induced stability change predictions a new structure modeling_approach strum is developed to combine various physics based and knowledge based energy_terms built on the i tasser predicted models with the various sequence and template based conversation scores to generate the stability change predictions to examine the strength and weakness of the proposed method multiple datasets are collected from experimental mutation databases which will be used to carefully benchmark strum with other state of the art methods the online server and standalone package of strum are freely_available zhanglab ccmb med umich edu strum prediction on the snp mutation induced stability changes ddg is of critical importance to protein_function and human disease diagnosis recent_studies have showed advantage for the methods that use experimental protein_structure information to improve the ddg prediction_accuracy over the sequence based_approaches however the experimental structure is often unavailable to protein_sequences which compromises the usefulness of the structure based prediction_methods in practical_applications we developed a new algorithm strum to explore the possibility to improve the ddg prediction based on low_resolution models from the iterative assembly refinement i tasser simulations in which three groups of features from sequence_profile multiple template threading and i tasser atomic_models are combined through the gradient_boosting regression tree training the algorithm was tested on a set of experimentally_characterized mutations from proteins after homologous templates with sequence_identity to the target or detectable by psi_blast with e value were excluded i tasser was able to build structure model of correct fold with a tm_score for proteins using the i tasser model strum generated ddg prediction for all proteins with a pcc and rmse kcal_mol in the mutation level fold_cross compared with the experimental mutation data but the performance can be reduced when tested on the protein level cross_validation probably due to the correlation among mutation samples that are from the same proteins the detailed data analysis showed that the most predictive features are those from the physics based energy_terms on the itasser structural_models and the conservation score based on multiple threading alignments demonstrating the importance and usefulness of the low_resolution structure predictions in the ddg predictions interestingly features built on the mutated amino_acids are generally more sensitive to the ddg prediction_accuracy than those on the wild_type amino_acids this is understandable considering the fact that the wild_type amino_acids are usually more stable and adoptable to the protein environments due to the long_term evolution than the new mutations thus compared with the relatively uniform stability from the wide type amino_acids the identity of the mutated amino_acids should provide more information with regard to the stability changes upon new mutations this insight that the wild_type amino_acids have a uniformly higher stability than the mutant ones is partly supported by the fact that the majority of the mutations in the database destabilize the protein fold see strum was also examined in four other datasets s s q and p in control with four state of the art algorithms including i mutent inps mcsm and popmusic which have the web_server available for exacting on line ddg predictions the results showed that strum based on predicted structural protein models are comparable with or outperform most of the methods that are built on the experimental_structures one reason for the advanced performance by strum is probably due to the combination of multiple complimentary features extracted from a wide_range of resources the gradient_boosting regression training also helps to improve the robustness of the training_procedure by the reduction of the over fitting effect finally the data results show that the ddg prediction is not sensitive to the accuracy of protein structural_models as long as the global fold is correct i e with tm_score however when the target structure model has an incorrect fold the structure based dd g prediction can be obviously degraded which highlights the importance of further improvement of protein_structure for mutation change modeling especially for the targets in the twilight zone where the creation of correct fold remains a challenge to most structure prediction_algorithms
