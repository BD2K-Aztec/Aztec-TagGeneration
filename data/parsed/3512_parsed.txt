sequence_analysis pfsearchv a code acceleration and heuristic to search prosite profiles the prosite resource provides a rich and well annotated source of signatures in the form of generalized profiles that allow protein domain detection and functional_annotation one of the major limiting_factors in the application of prosite in genome and meta genome annotation_pipelines is the time required to search protein sequence_databases for putative matches we describe an improved and optimized implementation of the prosite search tool pfsearch that combined with a newly_developed heuristic addresses this limitation on a modern x hyper threaded quad core desktop computer the new pfsearchv is two orders_of than the original algorithm availability_and source_code of pfsearchv are freely_available for download at http web expasy org pftools pfsearchv implemented in c and supported on linux prosite generalized profiles including the heuristic cutoff scores are available at the same address falling costs and continuing technological_developments have led to a dramatic_increase in the rate of sequencing of individual species genomes and the diversity of the ecological_niches sampled by metagenomic_sequencing the identification classification and functional_annotation of the putative protein_sequences encoded by these samples is essential to understand the diversity of the underlying biological_systems and will ultimately allow the construction of biological_models that simulate and make testable_predictions about their behaviour most functional_annotation is predicted using sequence_homology based_methods that infer the function of uncharacterized protein_sequences based on their similarity to characterized templates these methods include generalized profiles and hidden_markov hmms which can detect more subtle homologies than pairwise sequence_alignments the application of these computationally_expensive methods on large_datasets has been made feasible by the development of heuristics for sequence database_search and faster more efficient code e g our prosite method combines manually constructed generalized profiles for efficient domain detection with rules for precise functional_annotation here we describe a new heuristic_method and code optimization and parallelization for the prosite profile sequence database_search tool pfsearch these developments increase the speed of pfsearch by two orders_of using a modern x hyperthreaded quad core computer seelegend for specifications of the computer used in our tests making the annotation of large sequence_datasets using prosite feasible
