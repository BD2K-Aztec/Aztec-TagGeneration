sequence_analysis fast and accurate read_alignment for resequencing motivation next generation sequence_analysis has become an important task both in laboratory and clinical_settings a key stage in the majority sequence_analysis workflows such as resequencing is the alignment of genomic reads to a reference_genome the accurate alignment of reads with large indels is a computationally challenging_task for researchers results we introduce seqalto as a new algorithm for read_alignment for reads longer than or equal to bp seqalto is up to faster than existing algorithms while retaining high_accuracy and the ability to align_reads with large up to bp indels this improvement in efficiency is particularly important in the analysis of future sequencing_data where the number of reads approaches many billions furthermore seqalto uses less than gb of memory to align against the human_genome seqalto is benchmarked against several existing_tools with both real and simulated_data availability linux and mac os x binaries free for academic use are available atresequencing with next generation sequencers has become a popular method for characterizing genetic_variation between individuals a critical step in a typical resequencing workflow is accurate alignment of genomic reads to a reference_genome the resulting variants called from the aligned_reads strongly depend on the accuracy of this initial alignment stage in this article we introduce seqalto a fast and accurate read alignment_tool that reliably align_reads with large insertions_and indels next generation sequencers such as hiseq from illumina are generating ever increasing volumes of data simply aligning these reads to a reference_genome is a daunting task the computational_cost of sequencing is rapidly approaching the experimental cost in the recently_published genomes pilot article it was stated that a node cluster was used to align all of the reads to the reference_genome with maq this kind of computational resource is not available to most laboratories or is not feasible in a clinical_setting at over billion reads generated per run for a illumina_hiseq sequencer the computational capacity required to align such large_datasets in a reasonable amount of time far exceeds the capability of small laboratories or clinics this is especially true if any analysis needs to be repeated with different parameters in addition to increases in the throughput of each sequencer maximum read_lengths of all sequencing_platforms are steadily_increasing beyond bp this poses a problem for many popular short_read as shown in section on the other hand seqalto is able to exploit this increased read_length to improve the speed as well as accuracy of the alignment process in fact seqalto is not suitable for read_lengths much less than bp when aligning to the human_genome this is not a significant limitation as the majority of future sequencing_platforms are able to output read_lengths bp and we expect this length to only increase in the future there are numerous read_aligners available to researchers today they can be broadly grouped into four classes hashing the genome hashing the reads fm_index or sorting snap stampy novoalign http novocraft com bfast gassst and shrimp index the genome with a hashtable of k_mers bfast and shrimp use large spaced seeds to improve sensitivity gassst uses a large array of filters to improved alignment speed snap follows a similar approach to seqalto by using large continuous seeds maq and seqmap hash the reads this approach is useful when the reference is small such as a transcriptome bowtie bwa bwa_sw and soap rely on the burrowswheeler_transform bwt and fmindex this approach has been shown to be very efficient for short_reads and large_genomes however we will see that it is problematic for longer_reads section bwa_sw stands out as it finds local_alignments of the read rather than global alignments slider and syzygy use a sorting and merging approach this approach places a high_demand on the storage system to be fast a selection of these read_aligners is compared to seqalto in this article both real and simulated sequencer reads are used for the comparison in addition to comparing the alignments generated the variants called from the alignments are also compared seqalto is compared to snap bowtie soap bwa novoalign and stampy in terms of alignment_accuracy and efficiency snap is a new read_aligner that follows a similar approach to seqalto but puts its emphasis on alignment speed bowtie soap and bwa are based on the bwt and are among the most popular tools for read_alignment novoalign is a commercial read_alignment package not based on the bwt and is among the most accurate read_aligners stampy is a relatively new alignment_tool that is targeted towards resequencing with illumina_reads similar to seqalto stampy was run in hybrid mode as recommended by the documentation where a combination of bwa with a hash based_approach is used seqalto is run in two modes one with only a sub set section of seeds in the genome indexed seqalto and the other with all seeds indexed seqalto all a simulated dataset section with single and paired_end is used to compare each algorithm the algorithms supporting gapped_alignment are compared at aligning_reads with various indel sizes the algorithms are also compared with real illumina_hiseq data short_read archive accession_number srx alignment_accuracy does not always indicate variants called will be accurate and comprehensive for example an aligner may place many reads very accurately but fail to place a few polymorphic reads this could result in increased confidence in already confident variants while missing other variants hence variants are called from simulated paired_end and also the real_dataset to directly evaluate the effect of each aligner on the variants called all simulations were run with a single thread on an core ghz intel_xeon x unless otherwise specified an alignment is called correct if its start location is within bp of the simulated location not counting bases inserted or deleted the effect of varying this correctness criteria is discussed in the supplementary_material for seqalto bp and bp seeds were used for bp and bp reads respectively for snap bp and bp seeds were used for bp and bp reads respectively as suggested by the author exact parameters used for each program can be found in the supplementary_material the err given in each table refers to the percentage aligned incorrectly among the reads satisfying each uniqueness criteria the elapsed time recorded for novoalign and stampy includes the index loading time since they do not provide an option to record only the alignment time empirically the index loading time is independent of the number of reads aligned and not more than s overall seqalto is an efficient alignment_tool that targets the future of resequencing where reads are long and high_quality when aligning longer_reads seqalto is faster than most existing_tools while retaining the ability to accurately align complex variants this is particularly important for the high volume of resequencing that will be required as sequencing enters clinical_applications for convenience seqalto outputs in the common sam format that is compatible with numerous downstream_analysis tools the comparison of alignment_algorithms is primarily performed with simulated reads as real reads do not have a clear ground_truth available on simulated reads seqalto is shown to be faster than most current_tools and able to accurately align_reads with large indels when aligning real illumina_reads seqalto maintains its efficiency advantage over most of the tools this advantage is expected to increase as read quality improves the ability to align_reads with large indels is particularly evident when variants are called from the aligned_reads both gatk and samtools were able to correctly call more indel variants from seqaltos aligned_reads from both real and simulated_data compared to all the other tools except stampy in the cases where less variants were called seqalto was more accurate there is a clear trend towards longer read_lengths among high_throughput sequencers seqalto has been shown to be ideal for aligning long high_quality reads for the purpose of resequencing we expect that the large seed approach taken by seqalto to be the standard approach for read_alignment as the volume and length of reads increase
