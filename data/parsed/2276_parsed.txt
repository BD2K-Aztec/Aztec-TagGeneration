gene_expression identification of active transcription_factor and mirna regulatory_pathways in alzheimer's_disease motivation alzheimers_disease ad is a severe neurodegenerative_disease of the central_nervous that may be caused by perturbation of regulatory_pathways rather than the dysfunction of a single gene however the pathology of ad has yet to be fully elucidated results in this study we systematically_analyzed ad related mrna and mirna_expression as well as curated transcription_factor tf and mirna regulation to identify active tf and mirna regulatory_pathways in ad by mapping differentially_expressed and mirnas to the curated tf and mirna regulatory_network as active seed nodes we obtained a potential active subnetwork in ad next by using the breadth first search technique potential active regulatory_pathways which are the regulatory cascade of tfs mirnas and their target_genes were identified finally based on the known ad related genes and mirnas the hypergeometric_test was used to identify active pathways in ad as a result nine pathways were found to be significantly activated in ad a comprehensive literature_review revealed that eight out of nine genes and mirnas in these active pathways were associated with ad in addition we inferred that the pathway hsa_mir a stat myc which is the source of all nine significantly active pathways may play_an in ad progression which should be further validated by biological_experiments thus this study provides an effective approach to finding active tf and mirna regulatory_pathways in ad and can be easily applied to other complex_diseases in the developed_countries alzheimers_disease ad is the sixth leading cause of all deaths deaths attributable to ad have been increasing dramatically whereas other major causes of death have been decreasing in addition ad is one of the most costly diseases for society however the molecular_mechanism of ad is not fully clear it is thought that many factors and their interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of ad thus advanced research regarding the mechanism of ad is of great_importance with the emergence of molecular_networks such as protein_protein ppins and transcription regulatory_networks many studies initially focus on topological_properties when analyzing network_organization architecture or evolution however most existing_studies are based on ppins and transcription regulatory_networks and do not integrate important post_transcriptional mirna is a type of short non coding rna that participates in post_transcriptional by binding to target_mrnas with partially complementary_sequences it causes translational_repression or target degradation studies have increasingly shown that mirna is closely associated with the onset and development of complex human_diseases such as cancer diabetes and neurodegenerative_disease with increasing research on ad many studies have shown that mirnas are important_players in the development of ad for example wang et_al found that mir expression levels decreased_significantly even in patients who were in the earliest_stages of pathology further indicated that mir may cause ad through the regulation of bace a recent study byfound that the underexpression of mir a affected neurodegenerative_processes by enhancing neuronal nav expression in ad brains in addition characterized a mirna cluster mir a b that was significantly and specifically downregulated in ad patients and found that the loss of mirna increases bace and a expression levels in ad these findings_suggest that aberrant mirna_expression is strongly related to ad in addition mirna and transcription_factor tf do not function in isolation found that the coordinated regulation of tf and mirna may be involved in various biological_processes and the disruption of this coordination may lead to cancer thus integrated analysis of transcriptional_and could provide a comprehensive regulatory map for the etiological study of complex_diseases in recent_years gene_expression have been taken into account during network_analysis to identify the underlying_mechanisms of complex_diseases ruan et_al developed a general to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as coexpression_network based_approach to discovering network modular structures that was effectively applied to the study of the pathological mechanisms_underlying lymphoma presented a method for predicting the activities of curated pathways from the pathway interaction_database in glioblastoma multiform and breast_cancer by considering gene coordinate expression and the correlation between copy_number and gene_expression in the same pathway in addition much effort has been devoted to identifying the active subnetworks or modules in diseases from large molecular_networks for example proposed a method for screening a molecular_interaction that contained proteinprotein and proteindna_interactions to find active subnetworks a scoring system was implemented to capture the degree of change in gene_expression a search algorithm based on simulated_annealing was used to identify the subnetwork with the highest_score gene_expression differences between normal and disease samples were interpreted as the degree of gene activation exploited the same active concept to find the deregulated subnetwork in the regulatory_network of kegg using an integer_linear approach extracted the active subnetwork in the network that consists of protein_interaction and gene_regulatory by applying a mixed integer_programming model however finding the subnetwork or module that is significantly related to a disease_state is still challenging compared with coexpression_networks curated pathways and complex subnetworks the regulatory_pathway which presents a cascade of regulators and target_genes is easily elucidated and validated by biologists from disease related pathways we may find key_factors that are located_upstream of the pathway and that participate in multiple pathways the activation of key_factors may be the cause of disease_onset thus identifying active regulatory_pathways is crucial for dissecting the pathology of complex_diseases presented an algorithm for detecting differentially_regulated paths pathways from a given biological_network based on gene_set however they did not consider genes whose expression_level were not detected by microarray_technology and restricted the length of paths pathways in this study we identified active transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory_pathways in ad based on ad related mrna and mirna_expression as well as mirna and tf regulation to obtain stable ad signatures differentially_expressed de genes we used a meta_analysis to analyze_multiple ad related gene_expression in addition a breadthfirst search bfs approach was applied to find potential active tf mirna regulatory_pathways that may contain non de genes finally the significance of all of the potential pathways was evaluated by a hypergeometric_test based on known adrelated genes and mirnas the identified pathway had a simple network_structure and an easy interpretation that could feasibly be validated by biological_experiments our study thus provides a novel insight into the causes and mechanisms of ad the dysregulation of mirnas a type of key post transcriptional_regulators has been found in many diseases such as cancers and ad in this study we proposed a novel approach to identify active tf mirna regulatory_pathways by integrating adrelated mrna and mirna_expression and transcriptional_and the pathways we identified could help to provide biological_insights in ad and could feasibly be validated by biological_experiments we defined the de genes and mirnas as active seed nodes in the curated tf mirna regulatory_network to incorporate regulators without aberrant expression or expression values we constructed a potential active subnetwork by connecting the active seed nodes with their immediate neighbors next the bfs method was used to find the potential active regulatory_pathways finally based on the known ad related genes and mirnas we used the hypergeometric_test to evaluate the significance of the associations between potential active pathways and ad as a result we identified nine active tf mirna regulatory_pathways that were significantly related to ad all of the regulators and target_genes in these active pathways had direct literature support except for prkca we also found two active pathways that may contribute to the accumulation of a peptides and the formation of amyloid_plaques in the brain_parenchyma which are key_steps in the pathogenesis of ad in addition the pathway hsa_mir a stat myc appeared in all nine active pathways and was the source of the cascade regulation thus we inferred that the pathway hsa_mir a stat myc may have a crucial_role in ad progression which should be further validated by biological_experiments our study provides an effective approach to identifying active tf mirna regulatory_pathways and a novel insight into the pathogenesis and development of ad however the regulation between mirna and mrna is complex as suggested by the mirna sponge model which is a new type of mirna mediated post_transcriptional many studies have suggested that mirna sponges play_important in the occurrence and development of diseases such as autoimmune inflammation innate_and and spinal motor_neuron development integrating mirna mediated rnarna_interactions is helpful for constructing more comprehensive regulatory_networks our approach is flexible to analyze the integrated networks with the increase in available mirna_expression for ad and the accumulation of validated mirna regulations our results will become more precise in addition the approach was general and could be applied to other complex_diseases
