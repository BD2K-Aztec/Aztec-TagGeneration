sequence_analysis turnip tracking unresolved nucleotide polymorphisms in large hard to assemble regions of repetitive dna_sequence turnip comprises a suite of perl scripts and modules that facilitates the resolution of microheterogeneity within hard to assemble repetitive_dna turnip was originally developed for the saccharomyces genome resequencing project sgrp within which the ribosomal_dna rdna of strains of s cerevisiae were analysed to investigate the occurrence of potential polymorphisms here partially resolved snps or psnps as well as indels were found to be far more prevalent than previously_suspected more generally the turnip software ascertains degrees of variation between large tandem_repeats within a single locus offering insights into mechanisms of genome_stability and gene_conversion in any organism for which genome sequence_data are available availability the turnip source_code results files and online help are available atthe drive to continually decrease the cost of dna_sequencing to achieve better sequence value for money has led to a whole host of new sequencing_platforms and analytical_techniques highthroughput next generation platforms such as abi solid roche and solexa illumina inc can generate so much data in a single run that where previously major_concerns centered around read quality and coverage now the challenges are shifting towards data storage data management and timely analysis assembly strategies and tools have had to keep up with the deluge of nucleotide_bases and as a result many are now highly sophisticated alongside and often coupled with these tools are a large number of snp_calling algorithms that aim to categorise point variation using reference based or de_novo however these algorithms are not appropriate in all cases such as dealing with repetitive_regions an extreme case of a large repetitive genomic_region is the ribosomal_dna rdna tandem_repeat array for example in the brewers yeast_saccharomyces this array which typically comprises between and copies of a kb repeat_unit dependinginserted gaps in the template and subject sequences are spanned with surrounding known quality_scores aligned seed read mers at a given window position are discarded if they have any single base below a set sequence quality_score threshold this does not mean that a particular read is discarded for the whole analysis but just at the current mer window see if they pass these constraints the seed read mers are then compared with the consensus and called for variation in this way the turnip software encapsulates and contains improvements to the method suggested by us and used in in particular due to fine_scale alignment and filtering mechanisms employed within turnip is able to resolve variable_length indels as well as point_mutations and other problematic features such as long homopolymeric polya and polyt tracts the turnip algorithmic process is described in greater detail in the online documentation portions of the turnip software such as blast muscle and the sliding_window approach can be configured to run concurrently on a multi core cluster environment and hence analyse multiple window positions simultaneously as an example strain ys from the saccharomyces genome resequencing project sgrp strain set sequenced using sanger wholegenome shotgun_sequencing at approximately coverage has an estimated repeat copies giving a complete dataset of just under mb on a dual core ghz desktop machine with gb ram this dataset took min to process using turnip at each stage of the analysis turnip writes output_files that allow it to use precomputed data in case of process interruption or if certain variationcalling threshold parameters are changed and a simple reanalysis of the final alignments is needed turnip produces simple text_file output describing the positions types and frequencies of the resolved polymorphisms as well as sql files for database importing and gff for bulk loading into a gbrowse database a custom pie chart glyph and an example gbrowse configuration file are included in the turnip distribution the turnip suite also provides scripts to produce distance_matrices and phylogenetic_trees from the output variation frequency data trees generated from analysis of the sgrp s cerevisiae dataset can be viewed and interactively modified by strain subset selection at the ncyc web_site see availability the trees generated from psnp distances closely match those produced as part of the study of showing that analysis of the rdna region of the yeast_genome alone can be sufficient to produce informative phylogenies based on variation that is not fully resolved this information could be used in future for the purposes of precision strain characterization and evolutionary_studies including investigation into gene_conversion in closely_related lineages
