been applied to help in the investigation of substrate motifs of potential kinases and in the improvement of the identification of plant phosphorylation_sites with various substrate_specificities in this study mddlogo is comparable with another well known motif discover tool motif x the conservative analysis of a group of sequences associated with a specific biological_function such as the investigation of protein post_translational ptm_sites analysis of micro_rna mirna_target or the identification of transcription_factor is often required in bioinformatics_research sequence_logos were first proposed by tom schneider and mike stephens in to display patterns in sequence_conservation and to assist in discovering and analyzing such patterns in a web_based sequence_logo generator weblogo was developed for creating graphical_representations of the patterns within a multiple_sequence several to whom correspondence should be addressed extensions of sequence_logo have also been developed e g rna_structure logos pssm logos energy normalized sequence_logos subfamily logos d sequence_logos of dna or rna and rna structural_alignment logos in the case of functionally associated sequence_patterns e g protein phosphorylation_sites two sample logo has been developed for generating graphical_representations of statistically_significant position specific differences in amino_acid between phosphorylated sequences and non phosphorylated sequences with regard to motif_discovery a wealth of popular approaches have been proposed such as meme teiresias gibbs motif sampler and emotif additionally an iterative statistical_approach motif x has been proposed for identifying motifs from large_scale datasets motif x has demonstrated results that outperform other methods based on the identification of phosphorylation motifs according to the basic concept of sequence_conservation a sequence_logo displays the nucleotide or amino_acid for each position in a group of aligned signal_sequences however it is difficult to explore conserved_motifs for large_scale sequence_data for instance a sequence_logo for all phosphorylation data involved with various catalytic kinases fails to obviously present the kinasespecific substrate_specificity thus a new method is developed mddlogo which applies maximal dependence decomposition mdd to cluster a group of aligned signal_sequences into subgroups containing statistically_significant motifs assuming that each position in a set of aligned sequences is a sample of symbols nucleotides_or generated according to a probability_distribution a null_hypothesis is based on the assumption that the symbol distribution of two positions are mutually independent mdd is a recursive methodology that adopts the chi_square to capture the most significant dependencies between each position in a previous study mdd was proposed to group the splice_sites during the identification process of splice_site prediction in order to extract motifs containing conserved biochemical_properties of amino_acids in protein_sequences the set of amino_acids is further categorized according to their physicochemical_properties e g hydrophobicity charge or molecular_size after mdd clustering each subgroup containing statistically_significant motifs is graphically visualized using weblogo with the exponential_increase of protein ptm_sites identifiedmddlogo has been demonstrated to accurately identify kinasespecific substrate motifs for human phosphorylation_sites associated with seven well known kinase families from phospho elm the ability of mddlogo to discover motifs is comparable with another well known motif_discovery tool motif x the importance of phosphorylation has been indicated in the regulation of protein functions and cell_signaling in plants but the state of research in this field is hindered by experimental_difficulties especially for the investigation of substrate_specificity in various catalytic kinases due to the limitation in experimental_data regarding protein_kinases that phosphorylate substrates in plants mddlogo has been adopted to investigate the substrate_specificity of various plant kinases after the application of mdd clustering a total of and groups are detected for pser pthr and ptyr respectively interestingly some of the groups are similar to the substrate motifs of known kinase groups from the non plant organisms in phospho elm although the newly_identified motifs could not be experimentally_verified it is important how mddlogo can help biologists to further investigate the substrate_specificity of potential catalytic kinases in plants a more noteworthy benefit is that mdd clustered motifs can be applied to improve the predictive_power of computationally identifying plant phosphorylation_sites with various substrate_specificities especially for pser and pthr sites with a sufficient data size furthermore the acquisition of additional experimentally_verified plant phosphorylation data will allow the re calibration of more robust mdd clusters in analyzing protein_sequences the grouping of amino_acids can be defined by the users the user can group amino_acids according to various physicochemical_properties basically mdd clustering without the grouping of amino_acids is provided everal major grouping methods have been given also in applying mdd clustering it is important to optimize the value of the maximum cluster_size in general mdd clustering could help users investigate the conserved_motifs behind a large_sized sequence_data however in some cases more groups could produce more noise therefore users need to optimize the value of the maximum cluster_size to produce more meaningful clusters from a set of uncharacterized sequence_data mddlogo can be freely accessed at http csb cse yzu edu tw mddlogo a stand alone program is available as well dna and rna_sequences are both allowed for use in mddlogo
