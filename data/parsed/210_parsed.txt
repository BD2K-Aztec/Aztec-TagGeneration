genome_analysis alignment_free estimation of nucleotide_diversity motivation sequencing capacity is currently growing more rapidly than cpu speed leading to an analysis bottleneck in many genome_projects alignment_free sequence_analysis methods tend to be more efficient than their alignment based counterparts they may therefore be important in the long_run for keeping sequence_analysis abreast with sequencing results we derive and implement an alignment_free estimator of the number of pairwise mismatches m our implementation of m pim is based on an enhanced suffix_array and inherits the superior time and memory_efficiency of this data_structure simulations_demonstrate that m is accurate if mutations are distributed randomly along the chromosome while real_data often deviates from this ideal m remains useful for identifying regions of low_genetic using a sliding_window approach we demonstrate this by applying it to the complete_genomes of strains of drosophila_melanogaster and to the genomes of two closely_related drosophila species d simulans and d sechellia in both cases we detect the diversity minimum and discuss its biological_implications availability pim is written in standard c and its sources can be downloaded fromthe study of sequence_diversity within natural_populations provides a powerful link between raw_sequence and functional knowledge such population genetic_studies have traditionally been centered on a few transcribed loci however the exponential_decay of sequencing_costs over the past_two has recently made it possible to carry out population_genetics on a genome_scale in a comprehensive early example of such studies surveyed the resequenced genomes of six drosophila simulans lines with the closely_related d yakuba serving as outgroup they described the large_scale patterns of within population_diversity and between species divergence along the three major d simulans chromosomes while diversity declined toward the telomeres and centromeres where recombination_rates are low divergence and thus mutation_rates remained_constant across the chromosomes which is a classical hallmark of selection at linked sites to whom correspondence should be addressed similar genome_wide studies of population_genetic processes are poised to become the norm there are currently several projects under way aimed at sampling genomes of single model species this shift to genome_scale sequence comparison has sparked interest in new population centered sequence_analysis methods these fall into two categories alignment based and alignment_free as to alignment_based a number of recent_studies have focused on the problem of estimating population mutation and recombination_rates from aligned shotgun reads the main_challenge in this work is to account for variable coverage and the errors introduced by the diverse chemistries of next_generation approaches in contrast alignment_free of sequence comparison usually start from finished genomes or contigs given two homologous_sequences the most popular approaches are based on one of two kinds of measurements the correlation between the frequencies of short words such as mers found in each sequence and the lengths of matches between sequences in bioinformatics such methods have a long_tradition due to their superior computational_efficiency when compared with sequence_alignment however until recently a disadvantage of alignment_free was that word frequencies or match lengths could not be transformed into mutation_rates in order to combine the computational_efficiency of alignmentfree sequence comparison with the biological_relevance of alignment based divergence estimation have derived and implemented a moment based estimator of the substitution_rate from match lengths this estimator can be used to rapidly compute meaningful phylogenies from closely_related genomes ranging in size from to bases domazet here we extend this work by deriving a maximum_likelihood of pairwise nucleotide_diversity that can be computed without alignment we explore the accuracy of this estimator using simulations in addition we survey the genetic_diversity along the chromosomes of strains of d melanogaster and the genome_wide divergence between d simulans and d sechellia in the following sections we apply m to simulated_data with and without recombination and to two empirical datasets genomes of d melanogaster and the genomes of the two closely_related drosophila species d simulans and d sechellia much has recently been written about the impressive speed of next_generation equipment which is driving the current generalization of population_genetics to population_genomics however technology change in sequence_analysis algorithms has been equally remarkable a substantial portion of these advances is based on the progressive abstraction of suffix_trees to enhanced_suffix and more recently to highly memory_efficient fm indexes
