structural distinctions of fast and slow bacterial luciferases revealed by phylogenetic_analysis motivation bacterial luciferases are heterodimeric enzymes that catalyze a chemical_reaction so_called bioluminescence which causes light_emission in bacteria bioluminescence is vastly used as a reporter system in research_tools and commercial developments however the details of the mechanisms that stabilize and transform the reaction intermediates as well as differences in the en zymatic kinetics amongst different bacterial luciferases remain to be elucidated results amino_acid alignments for bacterial luciferases both a and b subunits were analyzed for a subunit containing the enzyme active_center polymorphic amino_acid were identified according to them the sequences fell into two distinct groups known as slow and fast based on the decay_rate of the bioluminescence reaction the differences in the enzyme active_site induced by structural polymorphism are analyzed availability_and three_dimensional models of photobacterium leiognathi lucifer ase and vibrio_harveyi luciferase with reconstructed mobile loop are freely_available at pmdb database pm and pm respectively luminous bacteria are known as the most abundant and ubiquitous bioluminescent organisms their traditional classification was rooted in the morphological peculiarities metabolism and ecological distribution of light emitting species currently according to the sequence_analysis of s rrna and gyrb genes all known luminous bacteria are assigned to three gammaproteobacteria families vibrionaceae shewanellaceae and enterobacteriaceae in spite of several studies many details about the mechanism of bacterial bioluminescence including the differences in reaction_kinetics are yet to be known although the investigations has identified the sequence of about bacterial luciferases but could only solve the crystal_structure of luciferase from vibrio_harveyi bacterial luciferase consists of a and b subunit folded into the same type of b a or tim barrel structure and encoded by luxa and luxb genes in addition to the structure similarities a and b subunits share about of sequence_identity indicating that luxb gene might have evolved as a result of luxa gene_duplication however a subunit is larger due to additional amino_acid which constitutes a mobile loop flanking the active_site of the enzyme and playing an important role in binding to the substrates all known bacterial luciferases catalyze the same oxidative reaction where r cho and r cooh are a long_chain aliphatic aldehyde and corresponding carboxylic_acid fmnhstudy of the conservative motifs critical for the interaction of the bacterial luciferase with substrates and intermediates stabilization is far reaching in terms of understanding the mechanism of bioluminescence in this study we presented a phylogenetic_analysis of amino_acids important for light emitting reaction our data suggested the conservative positions in structure of all known bacterial luciferases and amino_acids causing the division into fast and slow types of this enzyme we found two sets of critical amino_acids exactly matching each types of luciferases and probably responsible for kinetic decay_rate through protein_structure homology_modelling we observed the formation of two different binding platforms that probably stabilize the reaction intermediates two evolutionary fixed types of reaction_kinetics could indicate the appearance of two different functions carried by bacterial luciferases that never been discussed before from the structural point_of
