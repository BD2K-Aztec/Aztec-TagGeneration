databases_and the functional therapeutic chemical classification system motivation drug_repositioning is the discovery of new indications for compounds that have already been approved and used in a clinical_setting recently some computational_approaches have been suggested to unveil new opportunities in a systematic fashion by taking_into gene_expression or chemical_features for instance we present here a novel method based on knowledge integration using semantic technologies to capture the functional role of approved chemical_compounds results in order to computationally generate repositioning hypotheses we used the web_ontology to formally define the semantics of over terms with axioms to correctly denote various modes of action moa based on an integration of public data we have automatically assigned over a thousand of approved drugs into these moa categories the resulting new resource is called the functional therapeutic chemical classification system and was further evaluated against the content of the traditional anatomical_therapeutic classification system we illustrate how the new classification can be used to generate drug_repurposing hypotheses using alzheimers_disease as a use case drug_repurposing is the use of known active_compounds for new therapeutic_indications when administered in a living organism a compound can indeed play various roles and affect different biological_processes called mode of action accurately identifying these different functions helps to predict the potential side_effects a drug could have and can also lead to interesting repurposing opportunities for instance sildenafil was initially_developed to relieve angina_pectoris symptoms and has been repurposed towards erectile_dysfunction during the clinical_trials when a new function of the target_enzyme was discovered approved compounds are attractive because they have been extensively_studied and have by definition already successfully passed clinical_trials where most drugs fail because of safety or efficacy issues there is increasing number of approaches to predict repurposing opportunities using computational_methods most methods operate on the profiles of physicochemical descriptors derived from molecular_structures other methods characterize the drugs on more abstract levels such as the gene_expression or via the reported sideeffects these approaches have in common to look for similarities within existing_drugs and forward similar compounds as repurposing hypotheses a feature of particular interest to describe drugs is the moa according to wikipedia the moa describes a functional or anatomical change at the cellular_level resulting from the exposure of a living organism to a substance for instance terms such as transcriptional_regulation agent or anticoagulant define moas and characterize the roles of a certain type of drugs the moa abstracts over the relations between molecular_functions protein targets and drug activities it is the central concept linking a chemical_structure to a set of biological_activities intuitively the indication of a drug logically depends on its moa despite its widespread use in drug_discovery the moa has not been used yet as a descriptor for repurposing analyses one reason for this might be the challenge of formally defining moas indeed moas are terms or categories it is not possible to represent them straightforwardly with values and numbers like one can do for a d molecular_structure or for a gene_expression nonetheless the meaning of a concept can be formalized with controlled_vocabularies and ontologies originating from description logics such frameworks help to formalize the semantics of symbols and strings of characters with explicit axioms in an ontology or knowledge_base concepts interchangeable with category term and class in this article are organized and linked following the logical type of relation they have among them in the gene_ontology go for example biological_processes and molecular_functions terms are manually_curated and their meaning specified by the relation types linking two go terms moa definitions are present in other classifications such as the medical_subject or the chemical_entities of biological interest for example the anatomical_therapeutic classification system atc also describes to some extent the action of drugs at the anatomical level all these resources are valuable for the community as a source of carefully and manually_curated information moreover the categories described in these classification_systems are sometimes used to annotate drugs for instance the compound sildenafil has been manually_annotated as vasodilator agent chebi or mesh d the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work classifications mentioned previously are not specially_designed for drug_repurposing they purposefully report only the wellknown and major moas of chemical_compounds the pharmacological spectrum of each drug is not necessarily well covered yet it would be the best way to predict new indications in our context an ideal knowledge_base would feature the known moas of a drug as well as some predicted ones to be tested in experiments the moa categories should derive and scale over primary molecular evidences exposed in biomedical databases in an automated way to address the lack of systematic moa annotations we have implemented the functional therapeutic chemical classification system ftc presented here in this article the ftc is automatically built by leveraging the content of various biomedical databases using description logics and automated reasoning over new moa categories are defined in the resource and further populated with approved drugs using the web_ontology owl in combination with a reasoner the population step takes in account the type of pharmacological action the molecular_targets of the drugs and their involvement into biological_processes drugs can exhibit several moas and the same moa can be reached through different mechanisms most of the drugs are present in multiple ftc categories reflecting the various roles a compound can play inside a biological system which can serve as starting_point for repurposing the resource was evaluated against the atc traditional classification_scheme introduced before we present as well some preliminary analyses over the data by looking at the relation between the moa and the indication of a compound using semantic_similarity finally we illustrate also how the ftc can be used as a pharmacological toolbox to analyze drug_repurposing for alzheimers_disease the knowledge_base behind the ftc is built by integrating information coming from various sources the go terms serve as template to create the ftc categories describing the moas drugbank provides the known links between drugs and their protein targets and uniprot maps targets to their respective go annotations drugs are further assigned into moa categories according to the owl constructs and axioms defined in the ftc a reasoner a program capable of understanding such axioms performed this task see section for details the process to build the ftc is summarized inalongside an example the core step is the generation of axiomatic representations of moas by decomposing go types into positive_and regulations of biomolecular functions and processes with the help of reasoning techniques we can further derive and assign moa across the knowledge_base to given drugs it requires a few seconds four processing cores gb ram to classify the knowledge_base elk reasoner other owl reasoners e g hermit pellet etc disqualified mainly due to long processing time data not shown the ftc forms a taxonomic structure as illustrated on which arises when the reasoner classifies the knowledge_base in general categories may have multiple parents and multiple children see https www ebi ac uk chembl ftc for interactive use in total there are fda_approved drugbank compounds chemical and biotherapeutics associated with human protein targets where each drug is acting on at least one human protein target the ftc introduces new categories describing the mode and mechanism of action of therapeutic_compounds of these categories belong to the biological_processes in go and to the molecular_functions a summary of the metrics behind the latest build is available online at https www ebi ac uk chembl ftc evaluation out of all ftc categories categories directly contain at least one approved drug this number increases up to when direct and indirect drugs are considered ftc categories not containing drugs e g ftc a anti immunological synapse_formation agent represent moas for which no approved compounds has qualified yet or that have not been identified as such in the ftc the ftc is public resource which should assist drug_repurposing initiatives or enhance computational studies that judge drugs according to their mode of action the resource attributes biomolecular functions and processes to drugs the same way as go types have been assigned to gene_products the construction of ftc relies on axiomatic representations of moa as the core means to attribute and derive the moa for approved drugs we shown the validity of the approach by comparing the content of the ftc to a well established gold_standard the atc we further illustrate the tight relationship between the moa and the indication of a drug and demonstrate using alzheimers_disease as an example how the resource helps to formulate drug_repositioning hypotheses the work leverages the semantics of distinct databases working in parallel on different thematics the platform will be further used to generate predictions in a systematic fashion which can then be experimentally tested in the laboratory for validation
