data_and ifad an integrative factor_analysis model for drug pathway association inference motivation pathway based_drug considers the therapeutic_effects of compounds in the global physiological_environment this approach has been gaining_popularity in recent_years because the target pathways and mechanism of action for many compounds are still unknown and there are also some unexpected off target effects therefore the inference of drug pathway associations is a crucial step to fully realize the potential of system based pharmacological_research transcriptome_data offer valuable information on drug pathway targets because the pathway activities may be reflected through gene_expression levels hence it is of great interest to jointly analyze the drug_sensitivity and gene_expression data from the same set of samples to investigate the gene pathwaydrug pathway associations results we have developed ifad a bayesian sparse factor_analysis model to jointly analyze the paired gene_expression and drug_sensitivity datasets measured across the same panel of samples the model enables direct incorporation of prior_knowledge regarding gene pathway and or drug pathway associations to aid the discovery of new association relationships we use a collapsed gibbs_sampling algorithm for inference satisfactory_performance of the proposed model was found for both simulated_datasets and real_data collected on the nci cell_lines our results suggest that ifad is a promising approach for the identification of drug_targets this model also provides a general statistical_framework for pathway based integrative_analysis of other types of omics_data availability the r package ifad and real nci dataset used are available atidentification of drug_targets the gene_products that bind to specific therapeutic_molecules is essential for understanding drugs action_mechanism and possible side_effects and for maximizing treatment efficacy and minimizing drug_toxicity traditional pharmaceutical_research and development process is deeply rooted in the one target one drug mindset which tries to interfere the pathological_process through blocking an important molecular player e g a specific enzyme using a compound unfortunately most drug_candidates identified through high_throughput based on this philosophy have failed due to either poor efficacy or serious side_effects high hope has been placed on using systems_biology for drug_discovery through the application of novel computational_methods to high_throughput genomics and proteomics_data in contrast to the traditional one target one drug perspective that ignores the intricate interaction among genes proteins systems_biology approaches consider the drug effects in the global physiological_environment they may be more effective in drug discoveries because it has become apparent that most common diseases result from system level malfunctions rather than problems with individual genes in practice drug_combination or polypharmacy is more commonly used in recent_years to modulate multiple drug_targets existing computational_methods for drug target_identification can be generally categorized into three classes the first class of methods uses the classical gene_expression strategies to infer drug_targets for example drug_targets can be identified by comparing the mrna responses in human cell_lines induced by drugs with unknown_mechanisms with a set of well understood drugs the connectivity_map project used a non parametric rank_based pattern matching strategy based on the kolmogorovsmirnov statistic which requires extensive data_mining procedures another study proposed a bi clustering method named iterative signature algorithm isa to search for co modules representing genedrug associations the second class of methods aims to integrate various types of biological data including knowledge about bioactive_molecules and their protein targets e g sequences structures and molecular_mechanisms along with the phenotypic_effects of drug treatment to deduce the probability of two proteins being bound by the same ligand drug docking_studies have also been incorporated to measure the binding probabilities based on d structural complementarities one disadvantage of these methods is that they only evaluate the likelihood of presumed drug_target pairs and make no inference of unknown drug_targets proposed a probabilistic network to calculate the probability of two drugs sharing the same target by comparing their clinical side_effects however this method provides limited information on the drug_action mechanisms we first tested the performance of ifad using simulated_datasets and then applied the method to real nci datasets to infer unknown drug pathway associations drug target_identification is one important problem in translational bioinformatics as well as a crucial step in the early_stage of drug_discovery although there exist many different high_throughput for molecular phenotype profiling how to perform knowledge based informative data_integration
