data_and facpad bayesian sparse factor modeling for the inference of pathways responsive to drug treatment motivation it is well recognized that the effects of drugs are far beyond targeting individual proteins but rather influencing the complex interactions among many relevant biological_pathways genome_wide before and after drug treatment has become a powerful approach for capturing a global snapshot of cellular response to drugs as well as to understand drugs mechanism of action therefore it is of great interest to analyze this type of tran scriptomic profiling data for the identification of pathways responsive to different drugs however few computational_tools exist for this task results we have developed facpad a bayesian sparse factor model for the inference of pathways responsive to drug_treatments this model represents biological_pathways as latent_factors and aims to describe the variation among drug_induced gene_expression alternations in terms of a much smaller number of latent_factors we applied this model to the connectivity_map data_set build and demonstrated that facpad is able to identify many drugpathway associations some of which have been validated in the literature although this method was originally designed for the analysis of drug_induced transcriptional alternation data it can be naturally applied to many other settings beyond polypharmacology availability_and the r package facpad is publi cally available at http cran open_source solution org_web one of the common features of complex_diseases such as cancer cardiovascular_diseases and neurological_disorders is the involvement of many genes and biological_pathways during the pathogenic_process on the other hand human physiological_systems show different degrees of robustness against singlepoint perturbation due to functional_redundancy various feedback_mechanisms and other immune_response therefore successful treatment of complex_diseases requires polypharmacology which aims to design multi targeting therapeutics and may represent a new paradigm_shift in drug_discovery comprehensive and accurate understanding of the targeting spectrum of various drugs is the prerequisite for practical_application of polypharmacology although the molecular_mechanisms of some drugs are well studied unexpected side_effects or toxicity of a large number of preclinical and clinical drugs are often observed therefore the construction of genome_wide drugtarget network is a problem of great interest in the bioinformatics community and beyond current approaches for computational drug target_identification can be roughly categorized into three groups ligand phenotype or target based ligand based_approaches assume that similarity in chemical_structures between drugs indicates similar targeting activities a well known example in this category is the qsar method quantitative_structure which uses d topological feature_vectors which usually encode atom types and their bonding structure of drugs to train machine_learning in order to predict their binding activity toward specific target_proteins however decent performance of ligand based approach_requires a large enough number of known ligands for target_proteins of interest which may be difficult to meet in practice a second class of methods associates different drugs by comparing the biological phenotype responses such as cell_lines gene_expression or proteomic_data seminal work in this direction includes the national nci project which screened human_tumor against more than compounds and constructed a public repository for the basal gene_expression and drug_sensitivity information the connectivity_map project initiated by the broad institute went a step further although it only focused on five human_cancer the project generated genome_wide expression_profiles both before and after drug treatment for compounds in this way compounds can be connected into a network by comparing their ranked lists of up and down regulated_genes other phenotype information such as cell imaging and side_effects have also been utilized to associate different drugs and to make inference about their potential targets the third category of methods looks at the similarity between target_proteins to predict drugtarget_interactions based on structure sequence evolutionary as well as functional information several recent_studies integrate sequence_features of targets with ligand fingerprints to train statistical to whom correspondence should be addressed learning models for drugtarget_interaction prediction another well known method in this category is docking analysis which predicts the preferred orientation of drug_candidates to potential target_proteins when they are bound to each other to form a stable complex however docking cannot be applied to proteins whose d structures are unknown therefore it is difficult to use the docking on a genome_wide scale the method proposed in this article falls into the second category phenotype based_approaches it is designed for the analysis of genome_wide transcriptional_response profiles upon screening of a large number of compounds which shares similar data_structure with the connectivity_map project previous_studies on treatment response data usually focus on differential_expression to identify the most up and down regulated_genes for each drug and then check for pathway enrichment of these response signatures or to define certain drug similarity_metrics based on the ranked gene_list as the connectivity_map project drawbacks with the former approach include that it only utilizes the information of the most differentially_expressed de genes while disregarding all the other data_points moreover the choice of the de cutoff is subjective leading to potentially inconsistent pathway enrichment results the connectivity_map approach mainly aims at assessing the similarity between different drugs or the construction of a drug network rather than direct identification of target biological_pathways of various compounds target pathway identification is a critical step for therapeutics design in the age of systems pharmacology compared with traditional_methods focusing on the inference of separate target_genes taking the pathway perspective allows a more integrative understanding of the mechanism of action and physiological effects of compounds in order to address the aforementioned limitations of existing analysis procedures we propose facpad which applies a bayesian sparse factor model to explain the gene wise treatment response in terms of latent biological_pathway activity changes upon individual treatment by encoding pathways as latent_factors facpad naturally incorporates prior_knowledge on pathwaygene association structure to aid the inference on drug_targets the idea of facpad is conceptually related to one of our previous_studies ifad which stands for an integrative factor_analysis model for drugpathway association inference however distinct from facpad ifad aims to jointly analyze two phenotype profiles measured across the same set of samples that is two matrices with the same number of columns sample_size but different number of rows dimension of the feature_space the two data_matrices are decomposed using a common set of latent_factors which represent biological_pathways therefore ifad can be applied to the analysis of paired transcription profiles basal_level gene_expression before drug treatment and drug_sensitivity data gi_values drug concentrations required to inhibit_growth by across the same cell_lines in order to infer the genepathway and drugpathway associations simultaneously due to its general factor model framework facpad can be easily applied to many other settings apart from drug_induced pathway response data from the perspective of data_mining this method is basically performing dimension_reduction analysis it aims to explain the variation in the original observed variables in terms of a much smaller number of latent_factors different from traditional factor_analysis or pca facpad is more convenient to use when there exist certain prior_knowledge on the association pattern between the latent_factors and the observed independent features the remaining of this article is structured as follows we will first describe the statistical_model of facpad in section in section application of the model on the connectivity_map data_set is presented the article_concludes with a brief discussion on issues worth of note and potential future work we then applied facpad to the analysis of the treatment response profiles of three tumor cell_line panels from the connectivity_map project after preprocessing as described in section there remained treatment profiles for the mcf cell_line panel profiles for the hl panel and profiles for the pc panel for each panel around probe_sets mapped to kegg_pathways were used in the analysis the binary matrix l was also constructed based on these probe setpathway associations which in turn determines the sparsity structure of loading matrix w therefore for the mcf cell_line panel dim matrix y dim matrix l for hl dim matrix y dim matrix l for pc dim matrix y dim matrix l shows the sparsity pattern of matrix l of the three cell_line panels in this article we have presented a bayesian sparse factor_analysis model facpad for the inference of drugpathway associations using treatment response data generated from microarray_platforms this method treats biological_pathways as latent_factors and explains the gene wise treatment response variation in items of the latent pathway variables this approach is different from previous methods for such data since it does not merely calculate the similarity among different drugs but tries to detect the association strength between drugs and pathways through large_scale data_mining although this method was designed for the analysis of gene_expression data it can also be directly applied to proteomic and other high_dimensional data_sets the latter half of this article focuses on information mining on the
