genome_analysis realtime analysis and visualization of minion sequencing_data with npreader motivation the recently released oxford nanopore minion sequencing_platform presents many innovative features opening up potential for a range of applications not previously possible among these features the ability to sequence in real_time provides a unique_opportunity for many time critical applications while many software_packages have been developed to analyze its data there is still a lack of toolkits that support the streaming and real_time analysis of minion sequencing_data results we developed npreader an open_source software_package to facilitate real_time analysis of minion sequencing_data npreader can simultaneously extract sequence_reads and stream them to downstream analysis_pipelines while the samples are being sequenced on the minion device it provides a command_line for easy integration into a bioinformatics work flow as well as a graphical_user which concurrently displays the statistics of the run it also provides an application_programming for development of streaming algorithms in order to fully utilize the extent of nanopore sequencing potential availability_and npreader is written in java and is freely_available at https the recent introduction of the oxford nanopore minion sequencing_platform has added a new dimension into genomics sequencing the platform can read ultra long dna_segments due to the ability to directly sense dna_fragments with biological nanopores without the need of amplification its portability also proves useful to many studies under critical conditions such as disease_outbreaks and field work a number of labs around the world have been evaluating the platform through the minion access programme map and have also used the platform to develop numerous novel applications one of the most innovative features of the oxford nanopore minion platform is that it can output sequence_reads in real_time i e the electrical_current data and the base called sequence of a dna_fragment can be obtained as soon as it passed through the nanopore this is attractive for many time critical applications such as rapid infection diagnosis while several excellent software_packages e g loman and quinlan were introduced as soon as the minion devices were released there is still a lack of tools supporting the extraction and analysis of minion sequence_data in real_time we developed npreader an open_source software_package to facilitate real_time analysis of oxford nanopore minion sequencing_data npreader is written in java and hence can run seamlessly on any platforms with minimal dependency it provides a flexible and comprehensible command_line allowing it to be easily incorporated into an analysis_pipeline in addition it provides a graphical_user gui for users to visually assess the statistics of the run the package also provides a java application_programming api allowing developers to extract both based called sequences and native electrical_current data to further develop algorithms for other analyses the npreader package provides a simple and yet powerful solution for analysis of minion sequencing_data in real_time it provides a gui to allow users to visually examine quality statistics of a run when a dna_sample is being sequenced importantly it can extract the desired information from the run simultaneously and stream into multiple downstream analysis_pipelines on high_performance facilities or on computing clouds thereby facilitating real_time analysis of the dna_sample this will allow answering the biological_questions at hand in a timely_manner and as soon as sufficient data are obtained a screen shot of npreader user can specify options of data to be extracted and details of outputs in the left panel the right panel displays statistics of data including read_counts read_length histogram and read quality in real_time
