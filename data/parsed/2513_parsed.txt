data_and integration of gene normalization stages and co reference resolution using a markov logic network motivation gene normalization gn is the task of normalizing a textual gene mention to a unique gene database id traditional top performing gn systems usually need to consider several constraints to make decisions in the normalization process including filtering out false_positives or disambiguating an ambiguous gene mention to improve system performance however these constraints are usually executed in several separate stages and cannot use each others input_output interactively in this article we propose a novel approach that employs a markov logic network mln to model the constraints used in the gn task firstly we show how various constraints can be formulated and combined in an mln secondly we are the first to apply the two main concepts of co reference resolutiondiscourse salience in centering theory and transitivity to gn models furthermore to make our results more relevant to developers of information_extraction applications we adopt the instance based precision_recall f measure prf in addition to the article wide prf to assess system performance results experimental_results show that our system outperforms baseline and state of the art systems under two evaluation schemes through further analysis we have found several unexplored challenges in the gnthe task of recognizing named_entities in text i e identifying words phrases that indicate the presence of entities and associating them with their corresponding semantic types has been studied extensively in biomedical fields the most commonly used type of named_entity is gene mention recognition in the largest public biomedical_text competitions biocreative i and ii the top gene mention recognition systems achieve f scores of however gene mention recognition results are still hard to apply in real_world research applications because of two main_issues name variation and entity ambiguity name variation to whom correspondence should be addressed is when one gene is referred to by many textual expressions for example in the authors refer to the gene entrezgene id as cd protectin membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis and mirl entity ambiguity is when the same name can refer to more than one gene for example a search for the name cd in entrezgene returns matches belonging to over species to spur development in regards to the above two issues biocreative has held several open competitions for the task gene normalization gn mapping recognized gene mentions to standard database ids such as entrezgene or uniprot ids continuing with the example in a gn system must normalize the human gene cd and all its instances in the first sentence to the entrezgene id however cd in the title must be normalized to because it is a murine gene biocreative has also curated and released standard evaluation datasets as part of its gn tasks and many novel and useful approaches have come out of the biocreative workshops generally_speaking after gene mention recognition the current top performing systems include three main steps i candidate id matching ii false_positive fp filtering and iii disambiguation some research only focuses on improving one of these steps for example utilized logistic_regression to improve the accuracy of candidate ids matching proposed a knowledge based disambiguation approach that combines features from text and knowledge sources via an information_retrieval method used the maximum_entropy model to classify valid ids from candidate id lists collected external knowledge for each gene such as chromosome locations gene_ontology etc and calculated the likelihoods stating thepage
