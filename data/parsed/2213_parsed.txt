hitwalker visual_analytics for precision_medicine and beyond the lack of visualization frameworks to guide interpretation and facilitate discovery is a potential bottleneck for precision_medicine systems_genetics and other studies to address this we have developed an interactive reproducible web_based prioritization approach that builds on our earlier work hitwalker is highly_flexible and can utilize many data types and prioritization methods based upon available data and desired questions allowing it to be utilized in a diverse range of studies such as cancer infectious_disease and psychiatric_disorders availability_and source_code is freely_available at https github com biodev hitwalker and implemented using python django neo j and javascript d js and jquery we support major open_source browsers e g firefox and chromium chrome across domains the need to integrate and prioritize genes or variants is a common themefor therapeutic selection as well as for mechanistic and perturbation studies network context methods can facilitate the ranking of genes and associated genetic_variants mutations for instance some serve to rank the variant genes of individual subjects relative to orthogonal biological assay data whereas others can be used for gwas or qtl studies as a whole these approaches can integrate different data types and statically report results but up to now have not focused on making the data accessible with respect to discovery interpretation and knowledge acquisition to this end we developed hitwalker which is a highly customizable approach to both producing a ranked_list of genes utilizing network and external_information and exploring these results using graph centric interactive_visualizations details of the hitwalker workflow and framework itself can be found in the supplementary_material hitwalker provides a visual reproducible and flexible framework for prioritization that is applicable to a large number of clinical translational and basic_science use cases the interactive framework facilitates discovery and guide interpretation in a robust and scalable way this is timely given the growing recognition for more emphasis on humandata interactions the hitwalker framework is datatype agnostic and can include any type of experiment assay which at the end suggests an effect on a gene such as variant mutation data copy_number expression as well as sirna or drug screens nras mutant skin cell_lines mutations in the tlr cascade pathway the set of cell_lines with nras_mutations in the exome data was first retrieved and subsetted to only those cell_lines skin drug treatment data were used to identify mapk as the most frequently perturbed gene target genescore the user can then explore the mutational burden of the pathways containing mapk in this example the toll_like cascade pathway from reactome
