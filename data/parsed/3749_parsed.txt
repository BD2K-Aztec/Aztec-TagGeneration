protein protein binding_affinity prediction from amino_acid motivation proteinprotein_interactions play crucial roles in many biological_processes and are responsible for smooth functioning of the machinery in living_organisms predicting the binding_affinity of pro teinprotein complexes provides deep insights to understand the recognition mechanism and identify the strong binding_partners in proteinprotein_interaction results in this work we have collected the experimental binding_affinity data for a set of proteinprotein_complexes and analyzed the relationship between binding_affinity and properties obtained from amino_acid we noticed that the overall correlation is poor and the factors_influencing affinity depends on the type of the complex based on their function molecular_weight and binding_site residues based on the results we have developed a novel methodology for predicting the binding_affinity of proteinprotein_complexes using sequence_based features by classifying the complexes with respect to their function and predicted percentage of binding_site residues we have developed regression_models for the complexes belonging to different classes with three to five properties which showed a correlation in the range of using jack knife test we suggest that our approach adds a new aspect of biological_significance in terms of classifying the proteinprotein_complexes for affinity prediction proteinprotein_interactions are crucial prerequisite for many biological_interactions involved in cellular_signaling immunity cellular_transport etc it is important to identify the interacting pairs of proteins and their strength of interaction for understanding the functions in proteinprotein_interaction in the past several studies have been carried_out to understand the principle and recognition mechanism of proteinprotein_complexes and most of them suggested the importance of amino_acid located at the interface of the two interacting_proteins for the recognition process recently suggested that along with the interface residues non interface residues also play_a in protein_protein experimentally proteinprotein_interactions have been mainly studied with the yeast_two system f orster fluorescence_resonance surface_plasmon and isothermal_titration which provide the affinity of interacting_proteins in terms of dissociation_constant and binding_free change thereby adding a new dimension to the task of proteinprotein_interaction network_analysis these experimental_techniques for measuring the proteinprotein binding_affinity require expensive experimental_setup and heavy man power and are time consuming hence computational_methods have been developed for predicting the binding_affinity that has a strong potential to help experimental biologists for selecting proteinprotein_complexes of interest with respect to the binding_affinity the problem of binding_affinity prediction has been addressed for the past_two starting with a relatively small dataset of complexes consequently various structure based_methods have been proposed using empirical scoring_functions knowledge based_methods and quantitative structureactivity relationships the main_drawback of these methods is they either considered less number of data or used improper validation procedures set up a benchmark_dataset and discussed the performance of several available methods they reported that the performance of most of the methods was poor on the benchmark_dataset further refined the dataset which contains the experimental affinity data for a non redundant set of proteinprotein_complexes along with the information about their free proteins this led to the development of few structure based_methods for proteinprotein affinity prediction and most of them performed well only on the rigid complexes developed a method using features which caused the possibility of over fitting hence it is necessary to develop accurate and reliable_methods to address the task of predicting proteinprotein binding_affinity recently we have devised a model based on machine_learning for distinguishing low and highaffinity proteinprotein_complexes using sequence_based parameters in this work we have developed a novel approach for predicting the binding_affinity of a given proteinprotein_complex from its amino_acid we have classified the proteinprotein_complexes based on their function molecular_weight and percentage of binding_site residues and analyzed the relationship between sequence and structural_properties of interacting free proteins and binding_affinity this imparts biological_relevance to the prediction method as the function of the complex is also taken into consideration we have classified the complexes into nine groups based on their functions and set up multiple regression_equations for predicting the binding_affinity our method showed a correlation range of and using self consistency and jack knife test respectively we have developed the first sequence_based method for predicting the binding_affinity of proteinprotein_complexes using a robust methodology based on the functional_classification we obtained a mean correlation and mae of and respectively using jack knife test further we have systematically_analyzed the importance of selected_features in each class and related with experimental_observations it is evident that the percentage of binding_site residues plays an important role in governing proteinprotein binding_affinity we suggest that our method ppa pred could be used as an efficient tool for proteinprotein_interaction network_analysis for specific diseases visiting fellowship the authors acknowledge the reviewers for their constructive
