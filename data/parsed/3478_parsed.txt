pconsfold improved contact predictions improve protein models_motivation recently it has been shown that the quality of protein contact_prediction from evolutionary_information can be improved_significantly if direct and indirect information is separated given sufficiently_large protein_families the contact predictions contain sufficient information to predict the structure of many protein_families however since the first studies contact prediction_methods have improved here we ask how much the final models are improved if improved contact predictions are used results in a small benchmark of proteins we show that the tm scores of top_ranked models are improved by on average using pconsfold compared with the original_version of evfold in a larger benchmark we find that the quality is improved with when using pconsc in comparison with earlier contact prediction_methods further using rosetta instead of cns does not significantly improve global model accuracy but the chemistry of models generated with rosetta is improved availability pconsfold is a fully_automated pipeline for ab_initio protein_structure based on evolutionary_information pconsfold is based on pconsc contact_prediction and uses the rosetta folding protocol due to its modularity the contact prediction_tool can be easily exchanged the source_code of pconsfold is available on github at https www github comthe protein_folding problem is one of the longest standing problems in structural_biology although the problem of physically folding up a single protein chain in the computer remains largely unsolved there have been continuous effort and progress resulting in increased accuracy of predicted models the idea of using residueresidue contacts predicted from analysis of correlated_mutations observed in evolution for d protein_structure is not new however until recently contacts predicted from multiple_sequence were not sufficiently accurate to facilitate structure_prediction significantly this only became possible due to new statistical_approaches to separate direct from indirect contact_information as well as a greatly_increased corpus of sequence_information these efforts came to completion with the first demonstration of successful computation of correct folds with explicit atomic_coordinates using maximum_entropy derived contacts analysis of the relative_contribution of secondary_structure and co evolutionary_information pointed to potential_improvements in d accuracy since then there has also been continuous effort to improve the quality of predicted contacts in addition to the initial predictions of soluble_proteins and protein_complexes contacts predicted from evolutionary_information have also been applied in structure_prediction of membrane_proteins to optimize protein_structure from predicted contacts we developed pconsfold a pipeline for ab_initio protein_structure of single_domain see pconsfold is based on predicted amino_acid contacts from pconsc these contacts are used within rosetta to fold a given protein_sequence from scratch we benchmark our method on two datasets and compare it with the cns protocol used in evfold it was found that the improved quality of predicted contacts by pconsc increases quality and native likeliness of predicted structures by about over evfold and over evfoldplm that is using the improved contact predictions from plmdca here we show that improved contact predictions from pconsc actually lead to improvements in protein_structure further it is clear that for proteins with better predicted contacts the generated models are of higher quality i e future improvements in contact predictions will result in higher quality models according to there are protein_families without known structure that are suitable for co evolution based contact prediction_methods this number will surely increase due to improved contact prediction_methods and growing sequence_databases at increasing rates a comparison between using rosetta and cns indicates that using similar contact predictions generates models of similar quality however rosetta models are chemically more correct finally it is also clear that in many top_ranked models the contacts are less well satisfied than in the native structures i e an improved folding protocol would improve the models one option would be to use model ppv as a measure of model quality or as a stopping criterion for decoy generation another option is to use both cns and rosetta and then try to identify the optimal model our results on different fold classes show that model quality especially in beta_sheet containing proteins couldthis value was corrected as in the original publication it showed the value for the best possible model p value for a one sample t test of tm_score difference to evfold tm scores p value for a one sample t test of tm_score difference to evfold plm tmscores
