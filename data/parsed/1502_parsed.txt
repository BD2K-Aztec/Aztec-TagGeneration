systems_biology dualaligner a dual alignment based strategy to align protein_interaction motivation given the growth of large_scale proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks obtained across multiple species and conditions network_alignment is now an important research problem network_alignment performs comparative_analysis across multiple ppi_networks to understand their connections and relationships however ppi data in high_throughput experiments still suffer from significant false_positive and false_negatives rates consequently high_confidence network_alignment across entire ppi_networks is not possible at best local_network attempts to alleviate this problem by completely ignoring low_confidence mappings global_network on the other hand pairs all proteins regardless to this end we propose an alternative strategy instead of full alignment across the entire network or completely ignoring low_confidence regions we aim to perform highly_specific protein to protein_alignments where data confidence is high and fall back on broader functional region to region alignment where detailed pro teinprotein alignment cannot be ascertained the basic idea is to provide an alignment of multiple granularities to allow biological predictions at varying specificity results dualaligner performs dual network_alignment in which both region to region alignment where whole subgraph of one network is aligned to subgraph of another and protein to protein alignment where individual proteins in networks are aligned to one another are performed to achieve_higher network alignments dual network_alignment is achieved in dualaligner via background information provided by a combination of gene_ontology annotation_information and protein_interaction data we tested dualaligner on the global networks from intact and demonstrated the superiority of our approach compared with state of the art network alignment_methods we studied the effects of parameters in dualaligner in controlling the quality of the alignment we also performed a case study that illustrates the utility of our approach availability_and proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network models the cooperation between proteins to drive processes within a biological system advancement in high_throughput has led to rapid_growth of large_scale ppi_networks obtained across multiple species or conditions and therefore comparative_analysis to understand their connections and relationships is now an important research problem to this end the network_alignment aims to align a set of ppi_networks belonging to different species to find conserved subnetworks within them these conserved_regions could explain mechanisms of function conservation and evolution beyond what is available to individual gene studies the network_alignment consists of two key_steps a scoring framework that captures the knowledge about module evolution and identification of high_scoring alignments conserved subnetworks or modules from among exponentially large set of possible alignments unfortunately finding conserved subnetworks in a group of networks is np_hard consequently a range of heuristicbased network alignment_methods have been proposed that fall into two categories namely local and global_network the local_network approach identifies multiple unrelated conserved_regions between the input networks each region implying a mapping independent of others it is particularly useful in finding known functional components pathways complexes in a new species for instance pathblast aligns linear pathways based on homology and interaction confidence networkblast m finds highly_conserved local_regions greedily using inferred phylogeny another local alignment_method is mawish which is modeled on evolution of protein interactions on the other hand the global_network approach aligns every node in the smaller network to the larger network to find best overall alignment between the input networks particularly it enables species level comparisons and discovery of functional orthologs for instance isorank and isorankn identify a stationary random_walk distribution to perform global_network graemlin uses a training_set of alignments to learn phylogeny relationships before performing an to whom correspondence should be addressed alignment mi_graal is an alignment framework that could integrate_multiple similarity_measures to construct a global_alignment model global_network as a graph_matching problem with hard constraints given by a set of must link pairs of proteins these must link pairs are identified by sequence orthologs more recently the ilp based natalie proposes a lagrangian relaxation approach to solve the problem approximately pinalog combines both the similarities of protein_sequence and protein_function to compute an alignment between two ppi_networks to this end the gene_ontology go function similarity and sequence_similarity are obtained independently and then combined using a linear combination of the independent similarities weighted by a factor despite considerable progress made by the bioinformatics community in devising high_quality network_alignment strategies state of the art network alignment_techniques suffer from a key drawback specifically they depend on protein_sequence to facilitate network_alignment unfortunately sequence_similarity is only relevant to a subset of highly_conserved proteins leaving significant network regions poorly specified by sequence_homology furthermore it is well known that structural_information of ppi_networks suffers either from high falsepositive rate of current high_throughput experiments or from false_negatives because of incomplete_data consequently in significant regions of a network highconfidence alignment of proteins is not possible at best local_network attempts to alleviate this problem by completely ignoring low_confidence mappings global_network on the other hand pairs all proteins regardless in this article we address the aforementioned limitation by taking a go annotation driven dual alignment here dual refers to the two step alignment process and not duality in optimization strategy to align a pair of ppi_networks instead of only performing protein to protein_alignments we perform high granularity protein to protein alignment where confidence is high and more general functional region to region alignment where detailed proteinprotein alignment cannot be ascertained which may still yield biologically informative conclusions consequently our method not only aligns highly_conserved protein pairs but also aligns functional subgraphs of one network to functional subgraphs of another informally a functional subgraph is a connected component of the network whose nodes share a particular biological role or function annotated using go the region to region and protein to protein_alignments in our dual alignment strategy are not independent of each other but inextricably_linked specifically region to region alignment sets the foundation for broad associations between functional_regions on the other hand protein to protein alignment specifies detailed associations between nodes within each associated regions illustrates with an example on how functionally conserved subgraphs are first aligned followed by alignment of the underlying interaction structure first functional subgraphs of the networks are identified for instance a subgraph that shares the transport role is identified in the human network alignment between pairs of functional subgraphs is carried_out and high_confidence pairs are identified based on the structural and sequence_similarities of their underlying subgraphs for instance f in c depicts an alignment between the transport associated subgraph and microtubule_binding associated subgraph highlighting the connection between the regions using region to region alignments we model each region to region pair as soft constraints that probabilistically restrict protein to protein alignment within the regions following that protein to protein_alignments are computed using these soft constraints as priors we refer to the aforementioned network_alignment model as function constrained network_alignment the first step i e regionto region alignment represents function constraints that restricts the second step i e protein to protein alignment detailed in section it is worth mentioning the salient_feature of our model by integrating the rich set of functional information as soft constraints with the hard constraints e g known orthologs in the alignment framework our dual alignment strategy not only limits the search_space of unconstrained alignment to low knowledge regions but also guides alignment of functionally informative regions under a reduced search_space consequently our approach identifies a suitable alignment from a smaller search_space compared with stateof the art network alignment_techniques an important feature because of intractable nature of the network_alignment additionally by leveraging soft constraints we have much lesserfine grained protein to protein alignment using the aligned regions in c as background information protein to protein_alignments are soft constrained within subgraphsubgraph pairs that is any alignment between two proteins is probabilistically restricted within one or more subgraphsubgraph pairs in c likelihood of generating alignments that conflict with known biological_functions compared with network based_approach our approach considers both structural and functional information in defining subgraphs network based_methods rely purely on the assumption that densely_connected proteins are likely to share similar function and vice_versa however there are cases where this assumption does not hold in regulatory and signaling_pathways for example proteins share similar function without being densely_connected an example is the mapkkk cascade pathway such subgraphs can be uncovered via go annotations but not topology alone because it is sparsely connected compared with protein_complexes to realize the function constrained network_alignment we propose an algorithm called dualaligner that uses the aforementioned dual alignment strategy where region toregion alignments are first made followed by detailed proteinto protein alignment region to region alignment establishes high_level functional_connections between the networks while protein to protein alignment specifies the detailed connections within them we demonstrate the utility and superiority of dualaligner over the state of the art global_network techniques using real_world ppi_networks in section the dualaligner algorithm is implemented in scala we now present the experiments_conducted to study the performance of dualaligner and report some of the results here additional results are in supplementary_material s the experiments were conducted on a ghz intel core duo t machine with gb_memory we align the ppi_networks of the global human fly and yeast we use go annotations that are part of the intact species dataset no other annotations were used evaluation criteria we use several criteria to evaluate the performance of dualaligner we define the coverage of an alignment m between two networks g and g denoted as cov m as the fraction of protein pairs aligned by an alignment_method that is covm jmj minjv j jv j where jmj is the number of protein pairs aligned in m observe that cov m if the alignment m is a one to one mapping of v to v to measure the structural_similarity of an alignment m between two networks g and g with covm we propose a modified_version of the edge correctness ec measure given g g and alignment m the ec measure is defined as ec e sete set region to region alignment statistics in supplementary_material s each pair of subgraphs separated by the dashed lines represents a functional subgraph of the human network matched to its yeast network counterpart observe that while several regionto region alignments contain a high_confidence one to one protein_alignments such as the conserved nat ard nats acetyltransferase subgraph other region to region alignments do not admit a proper one to one protein alignment furthermore the cog complex which plays an important role in intra golgi trafficking is well conserved between yeast and human network however cog cog and cog are structurally unique to mammalian_cells and are not homologous to their yeast counterpart which imply that no individual pairing between cog cog and cog could exist this partially explains the minor differences between the subgraphs and also justifying the need for region to region alignment in addition to individual protein to protein alignment we also note that the proteosome core_complex is conserved this complex is known to be ubiquitous and highly_conserved in eukaryotes other relationships can be inferred from well aligned subgraphs for instance transport_mechanisms are found to be highly_conserved between human and yeast in summary well aligned regions show important conservation relationships between complexcomplex complexfunction and function process global protein to protein alignment next we compare the performance of dualaligner with the following state of the art global_network methods isorank isorankn mi_graal natalie pinalog shih and piswap we ran alignments between the global yeast and human networks as well as between the global fly and yeast networks we set min s and s we vary the parameter k to obtain alignments of varying coverage for isorank and isorankn we used the standard settings recommended by the tool with we use the default_parameters for pinalog and for natalie we chose the setting with highest ec value for mi_graal we enabled signatures sequences and degrees cost matrices to use piswap as an independent method we use the hungarian method to obtain a best matching based on sequence_homology as input for shih we set trade_off parameter to note that path suffers from scalability problem as highlighted in and as a result it failed to complete the alignment of the human and yeast global networks within h plots the results of the alignment between the global human and yeast networks comparing dualaligner to existing_methods in each figure the scores obtained using dualaligner are indicated by a line because we obtain multiple instances of network alignments with different coverage while no methods are superior on all measures dualaligner is among the best performer in each measure when compared with another method having the same coverage it achieves the best balance of edge correctness sequence_similarity and functional coherence by being the best or close to the best performer in each measure dualaligner outperforms all methods except mi_graal based on ec on the other hand dualaligner significantly_outperforms mi_graal based on average normalized bit score it also outperforms all methods in functional coherence notice that at lower coverage dualaligner even outperforms other methods in both measures finally dualaligner outperforms natalie pinalog isorank and piswap on all measures thus our approach can be used to obtain high_quality alignments if maximizing coverage is not a requirement plots the results of alignment between the global fly and yeast networks similar to the preceding comparison dualaligner is either the best performer or close to the bestselected region to region alignments showing highly_conserved subgraphs between human and yeast networks note that there may not necessarily be an optimal protein to protein alignment between the subgraphs on all measures it achieves the best score in fc except pinalog nevertheless we urge caution in interpreting the quality of the protein to protein_alignments the global fly network is highly incomplete and has large gaps in interaction data this could also explain the low coverage of pinalog which rely on topology based clustering to align the networks the rapid drop in ec and bit score similarities at higher_coverage is indicative of this issue in this case a broad region to region alignment would be more suitable than inferring detailed protein to protein alignment out of the incomplete interaction data finally compared with other methods dualaligner is able to assign confidence_scores to matched protein pairs that correlate with alignment_quality by ec bit score and functional coherence measures this is demonstrated by its ability to allow users to control the trade_off between alignment coverage and quality overall dualaligner is competitive with all proteinto protein methods while being able to perform region to region alignment that is consistent with existing knowledge note that the fly network is sparsely connected with few go annotations in comparison with the human network hence the sequence_homology of proteins may be crucial here for better alignment consequently piswap is advantageous here as it relies on sequence_based hungarian matching a unique advantage of dualaligner is its ability to have functionally interpretable subgraph to subgraph alignments methods that are based on clustering e g pinalog and shih may not yield functionally interpretable subgraphto subgraph alignment dualaligner is especially advantageous when there is no clear one to one protein alignment between the subgraphs in that case functional_interpretation of alignment between regions can be useful on both alignments dualaligner is able to achieve almost complete coverage thus despite not considering isolated proteins a significant portion of the networks can be aligned effect of s the parameter s controls the effect of sequence_similarity versus topology similarity in the scoring model we study the effect of s on the alignments by varying s from to depicts the results showing its effect on ec and anbs scores as s increases the ec value improves while anbs decreases thus s allows a trade_off between sequence_similarity and topology similarity at low values of s more emphasis in preserving high average bit score alignment is observed the greater the value s the greater is the effect of topology similarity this effect however converges to a steady_state at subsequently higher values running_times reports the running_times of dualaligner compared with other methods observe that dualaligner outperforms the tested approaches except piswap although isorankn is designed to scale to multiple_networks isorank significantly_outperforms isorankn in alignment of a pair of global ppi_networks however the running_times of isorank increase much more rapidly with the size of the networks in comparison dualaligner scales better with the size of the networks the natalie method is designed to terminate after s
