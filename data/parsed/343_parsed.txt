an exome_sequencing pipeline for identifying and genotyping common cnvs associated with disease with application to psoriasis motivation despite the prevalence of copy_number cnv in the human_genome only a handful of confirmed associations have been reported between common cnvs and complex disease this may be partially attributed to the difficulty in accurately genotyping cnvs in large cohorts using array based_technologies exome_sequencing is now widely being applied to casecontrol cohorts and presents an exciting opportunity to look for common cnvs associated with disease results we developed exocnvtest an exome_sequencing analysis_pipeline to identify disease associated cnvs and to generate absolute_copy genotypes at putatively associated loci our method rediscovered the lce b lce c cnv association with psoriasis p value e while controlling inflation of test_statistics exocnvtest derived absolute cnv genotypes were concordant with pcr derived genotypes at this locus common copy_number cnv in the human_genome has been extensively catalogued using both array comparative hybridization acgh as well as more recently with next generation whole_genome studies have demonstrated that common cnv is prevalent in genic as well as non genic regions of the genome and accounts for of detected genetic_variation in gene_expression while common copy_number associated with complex disease have been identified they are vastly fewer than reported single_nucleotide snp associations in a landmark study the wellcome_trust identified the majority of common cnv with allele_frequency and genotyped this variation in seven to whom correspondence should be addressed complex disease cohorts and two control cohorts using microarray_based comparative_genomic acgh however analysis of these data revealed only three previously_identified copy_number associations this study also comprehensively identified many sources of bias which continue to plague cnv association studies including batch_effects systematic_differences between dna extracted from cell_lines versus whole blood homology particularly to the mhc as well as difficulty in accurately determining cnv genotypes the authors of this study concluded that the subset of cnvs that are genotypeable on cgh arraysmostly simple non recurrent deletionsdo not explain a large proportion of phenotypic_variation however there remains the possibility of extensive_disease association with more complex cnv as well as common cnv with small to moderate effect_sizes in contrast to most complex disease the role of common cnv in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been robustly demonstrated and replicated across multiple_populations worldwide in particular association between psoriasis and a deletion spanning the late cornified envelope genes lce b and lce c was originally shown in european_populations and was subsequently replicated in a chinese cohort this cnv is a simple kb deletion with allele_frequency of for which both heterozygote and homozygote deletions are found in the population the lce b lce c deletion has an odds_ratio of for psoriasis exome_capture sequencing is now widely being applied to both mendelian and complex disease cohorts primarily to find rare associations with disease which have not been identified by extensive gwas o as well as to refine association_signals already reported exome_sequencing uses hybridization technology to first capture the majority of exons and then subsequently applies massively_parallel to these captured fragments as the sequencing step is a stochastic_process the number of times a sequence is read should be reflective of its relative copy_number in the original_sample however because of the hybridization step many of the biases present in array based studies such as batch_effects and effects from obtaining dna from different sources are still present in these data nevertheless the utility ofwe applied exocnvtest to exome_sequence collected on controls and psoriasis cases association of the uncorrected fpc was highly inflated with inflation_factor of and in this analysis the known association lce b lce c was ranked out of regions correction for and gpcs progressively_reduced inflation of test_statistics and also increased the rank of lce b lce c however correction for gpcs was required to entirely remove inflation of test_statistics and reduce in this analysis the lce b lce c cluster was ranked th with p value of e in order to investigate whether our approach was accurately capturing the underlying cnv present in lce b lce c we i investigated the correlation between the adjusted fpc in these capture regions and gold_standard copy_number genotypes obtained from pcr in these samples we observed increasing correlation between the adjusted fpc and the gold_standard pcr genotypes up to gpc but not beyond this demonstrates that adjusting for gpcs has two effectsthe first being to reduce spurious signals and the second being to increase the correlation between real and detected signals at genuine associated loci although the optimal number of gpc correction may be different for these two goals we also observed substantial gc biases in uncorrected association_statistics with an over representation of significantly associated signals at and gc_content correcting for gpcs removed this bias finally we attempted to obtain absolute_copy genotypes at the lce b lce c loci we did this by averaging the persample read_depth in bp windows divided by average genome_wide read_depth and then projecting out the first global pcs these normalized data were presented to cnvhap with initial copy_number cluster positions at normalized read_depth for copy_numbers respectively cnvhap updates the positions of these cluster positions within a generalized expectation_maximization framework and then reports the per sample copy_number genotypes the reported cnv genotypes were found to be concordant with gold_standard cnv genotypes with a missing rate of these cnv genotypes had stronger association with case control status p value of e than fpc demonstrating the value of using these genotypes to refine the association_signal while approaches for finding common snp association with disease have become routine finding common cnv associated with complex disease has proven more elusive accurately genotyping cnvs in large casecontrol cohorts using data from snp_genotyping remains very challenging and attempts to associate cnv genotypes defined in this way with disease have often led to highly inflated test_statistics as well as results that are difficult to independently replicate array_cgh was used to discover the lce b lce c association and studies using array_cgh tend to be more robust however acgh studies are still subject to substantial batch_effects and acgh has not been widely_applied to very large multi_centre casecontrol cohorts needed to detect small to modest effect_sizes now that exome_sequencing is being routinely applied to casecontrol cohorts there is a new opportunity to look for common cnv associations with disease this article provides the first proof_of that exome_sequencing can be used in this way by developing an algorithm which adequately controls for batch_effects and applying this algorithm to re discover one of the few confirmed common cnv associations with complex disease we have also shown that as well as detecting cnv association with disease it is possible to calculate highly_accurate absolute_copy genotypes at associated loci to do this we have applied cnvhap to perform joint cnv segmentation and genotyping cnvhap has been shown to be one of the most sensitive cnv discovery and genotyping algorithms due to its flexible modelling of intensity data in this case read_depth data across an entire population application of our method yielded an association p value between lce b lce c del and psoriasis of e using fpc corrected for gpcs and e using estimated absolute cnv genotypes while these p values are not as significant as the initial reported p value of e this initial study was based on samples while the data presented here are derived from samples a uk replicationcnv genotyping accuracy missing rates and association with psoriasis status after correction for gpcs study with samples obtained an association p value of while a larger german replication study with samples obtained an association p value of e principal_components are widely used to adjust for the inflation of test_statistics due to population_structure in genome_wide however these studies typically only adjust for up to pcs with a greater number of pcs required for highly_structured populations the fact that pcs were required to correct for readdepth biases likely reflects the fact that the batch size consisted of two samples per capture array we might speculate that cnv of genes and more specifically exons may generate substantial phenotypic_variation our ability to assess this effect to date has been limited by the technical challenge of array technologies exome_sequencing however as it is measuring precisely this type of variation in the genome provides an exciting opportunity to finally assess the association between gene_copy and phenotype
