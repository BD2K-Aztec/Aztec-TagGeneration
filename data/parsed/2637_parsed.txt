data_and kddn an open_source cytoscape app for constructing differential dependency networks with significant rewiring we have developed an integrated molecular_network learning method within a well grounded mathematical framework to construct differential dependency networks with significant rewiring this knowledge fused differential dependency networks kddn method implemented as a java cytoscape app can be used to optimally integrate prior_biological with measured data to simultaneously construct both common and differential_networks to quantitatively assign model_parameters and significant rewiring p values and to provide user_friendly graphical results the kddn algorithm is computationally_efficient and provides users with parallel_computing capability using ubiquitous multi core machines we demonstrate the performance of kddn on various simulations and real gene_expression and further compare the results with those obtained by the most relevant peer methods the acquired biologically_plausible results provide new insights into network rewiring as a mechanistic principle and illustrate kddns ability to detect them efficiently and correctly although the principal application here involves microarray gene_expressions our methodology can be readily applied to other types of quantitative molecular_profiling data availability source_code and compiled package are freely_available for download atthe kddn cytoscape app presents an integrated software_tool to construct biological_networks and detect significant rewiring across different conditions supported by a well grounded mathematical framework kddn integrates the abundant biological_knowledge and condition specific experimental_data to depict the overall dependency networks and their dynamics tested on both simulations and real_gene kddn outperforms peer methods supplementary_information and demonstrates its effectiveness in revealing significant topological changes we expect kddn to be a useful tool for performing differential_network in many biological_contexts
