genetics_and mgas a powerful_tool for multivariate gene based genome_wide downloaded from motivation standard genome_wide testing the association between one phenotype and a large number of single_nucleotide snps are limited in two ways i traits are often multivariate and analysis of composite_scores entails loss in statistical_power and ii gene based analyses may be preferred e g to decrease the multiple_testing results here we present a new method multivariate gene based association test by extended simes procedure mgas that allows gene based testing of multivariate phenotypes in unrelated_individuals through extensive simulation we show that under most trait generating genotype phenotype models mgas has superior statistical_power associated genes compared with gene based analyses of univariate phenotypic composite_scores i e gates multiple_regression and multivariate_analysis manova re analysis of metabolic data revealed false_discovery controlled genome_wide significant genes and regions harboring multiple genes of these regions were not reported in the original analysis conclusion mgas allows researchers to conduct their multivariate gene based analyses efficiently and without the loss of power that is often associated with an incorrectly specified geno typephenotype models availability_and mgas is freely_available in kgg v http statgenpro psych iatry hku hk limx kgg download php access to the metabolic dataset can be requested at dbgap https dbgap ncbi nlm nih gov the r simulation code is available from http ctglab nl people sophie van_der sluis standard genome_wide gwas involve the univariate regression of one trait on a large number of genetic_variants single_nucleotide i e snps while adapting the nominal a criterion level for the extensive multiple testing typically a this analysis is limited in two important_ways first genes not snps are the functional_unit in the genome although snps may have different allele_frequencies and linkage_disequilibrium ld_structure across human populations genic function is highly_consistent furthermore analysing genes rather than snps decreases the multiple_testing and relaxing the significance threshold in gene based analyses improves the statistical_power of gwas_studies second traits of interest are often multivariate in nature i e multiple_phenotypes are measured to cover the full extent of a trait for instance cognitive_ability is usually measured through test batteries covering various cognitive_abilities e g vocabulary memory similarly diagnostic_interviews and clinical questionnaires cover a collection of symptoms to deal with the symptomatic heterogeneity in the gwas context this multivariate information is generally reduced to a univariate score i e a univariate full_scale score or a binary casecontrol index reducing multivariate to univariate data nearly always results in loss of information specifically whether univariate composite_scores exhaustively summarize all information in the multivariate_data i e are sufficient statistics depends on the true trait generating genotypephenotype model i e the model that describes how the multiple_phenotypes and genes jointly generate the observed trait specifically in factor_analytic terms sum scores are only sufficient statistics if a all correlations between the phenotypes are explained by one latent_trait or factor b all phenotypes have identical factor_loadings c all phenotypes have identical residual variances i e the phenotypes adhere to a so_called and the genetic effect is on the latent_factor illustrated in in all other cases the sum score is not a sufficient statistic and conducting association analysis on the sum score will result in a considerable_loss in power to detect genetic effects noteworthy the variancecovariance structure of data generated through a network model may closely_mimic the variancecovariance structure of data generated through a factor model implicating that factor analytic_results are not sufficient to determine the true trait generating model various simulation_studies have shown that overreliance on the unidimensional trait generating model and the associated use of univariate composite_scores can result in considerable_loss of statistical_power genetic_variants gene based_methods for the univariate trait setting are available e g gates vegas jag as are multivariate_methods for the genome_wide snp based setting e g multiphen canonical_correlation cca i e multivariate_analysis manova with the snp effect treated as covariate tates and jamp http ctglab nl software however to date only two recently published_methods incorporates both in fact the rapid multivariate multiple_linear rmmlr method proposed byis essentially equivalent to the multivariate gene based cca manova proposed by tang and ferreira leaving only one manova based method manova and thus rmmlr however is known to be powerful specifically if the genetic_variant affects only one or a few of multiple correlated phenotypes but power decreases when the variant affects all or many of the phenotypes here we present a multivariate gene based genome_wide analysis tool that is based on an extended simes test mgas multivariate gene based association test by extended simes procedure mgas combines p value information obtained in standard univariate genome_wide snp based association software to arrive at a multivariate genebased p value p mgas the standard gwas can thus be considered an mgas preprocessing_step mgas is implemented in knowledgebased mining system for genome_wide genetic_studies kgg v is freely_available http statgenpro psychiatry hku hk limx kgg download php and has a user_friendly graphical_interface for loading p value files and genetic and phenotypic correlational information and for visualizing results and annotating sequence_variants and interesting genes we have shown that the new multivariate gene based method mgas has correct type_i and performs well under a variety of trait generating genotypephenotype models with respect to power mgas often outperforms other gene based_methods that do not require permutation like the univariate methods gates multiple_regression and the multivariate manova which with our simulation_settings is equivalent to cca and rmmlr mgas based on p value information obtained in standard_software like plink has several important_advantages first simultaneous analysis of phenotypes that have different measurement scales e g continuous ordered categorical dichotomous is unproblematic second standard gwas software deals with quality_control in a genome_wide setting covariates and population_structure or stratification mgas subsequently using the p values resulting from these specialized packages benefits from the strengths of such software third mgas is relatively fast as the method does not require permutation fourth for the simulated genotypephenotype models mgas often proved the most powerful gene based_methods especially for the detection of pleiotropic genes and c only when the gene affects that part of one specific phenotype that shows no relation to other phenotypes in the analysis i e geneeffect on the residual is mgas outperformed by gates manova as a powerful method mgas more easily detects genes that show relatively weak associations with one or multiple_traits this was nicely illustrated by our real_data example in which we identified regions that were not reported in the original analysis it is important to note that like all other multivariate gene based_methods included in our simulations mgas has difficulty detecting genes that harbor multiple dsl in high_ld with contrasting_effects scenarios and in supplementary tables s s although contrasting_effects of snps in high_ld located within one gene may indeed exist e g as a balancing mechanism the scope of this scenario and thus of this shortcoming is probably limited yet multivariate gene based_methods that can detect such contrasting_effects are currently lacking we close with some final remarks concerning the practical use of mgas first mgas like tates cannot be used to analyse data collected in multiple non overlapping samples e g trait a was measured in sample i and trait b in sample ii because the resulting p values will not show the expected correlations resulting from both the phenotypic correlations and the ld_structure in the genome also those p values might be based on samples of different size obtained using variable recruitment strategies and might originate study_design data_collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript conflict of interest none declared
