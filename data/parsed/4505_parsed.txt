genetics_and synbreed a framework for the analysis of genomic prediction data using r we present a novel r package named synbreed to derive genome based_predictions from high_throughput and large_scale phenotyping data the package contains a comprehensive collection of functions required to fit and cross validate genomic prediction_models all functions are embedded within the framework of a single unified data object thereby a versatile genomic prediction analysis_pipeline covering data_processing visualization and analysis is established within one software_package the implementation is flexible with respect to a wide_range of data_formats and models the package fills an existing gap in the availability of user_friendly software for next generation genetics research and education availability synbreed is open_source and available through cran http cran r project org_web synbreed the latest development version is available from r forge the package synbreed is released with a vignette a manual and three large_scale example datasets from package synbreeddata in the plant breeding community there is a strong demand for a standard_software covering a wide_range of analysis steps the package synbreed offers a comprehensive collection of methods required in the analysis of genomic prediction data this is a step towards automatized analysis_pipelines in the analysis of nextgeneration genotype and phenotype data which are required to bring genomic prediction from theory to practice moreover synbreed is a valuable_tool for the education of young scientists and breeders
