mgescan a galaxy based system for identifying retrotransposons in genomes mgescan long_terminal ltr and mgescan non ltr are successfully used programs for identifying ltrs and non ltr_retrotransposons in eukaryotic genome_sequences however these programs are not supported by easy to use interfaces nor well suited for data visu_alization in general data_formats here we present mgescan a user_friendly system that combines these two programs with a galaxy workflow system accelerated with mpi and python threading on compute clusters mgescan and galaxy empower researchers to identify transposable_elements in a graphical_user with ready to use workflows mgescan also visualizes the custom annotation tracks for mobile_genetic in public genome_browsers a maximum speed up of is attained for execution time using concurrent processing and mpi on four virtual cores mgescan provides four operational modes as a command_line as a galaxy toolshed on a galaxy based web_server and on a virtual cluster on the amazon cloud availability_and mgescan tutorials and source_code are available attransposable elements tes move within or between most eukaryotic_genomes and constitute a significant portion of these genomes it is known that nearly half of the human_genome is derived from tes the transposition of tes generates new mutations that can have different effect ranging from changes in genes expression to genomic instabilities therefore the identification and analysis of tes is important for understanding genome_evolution tes can be classified into retrotransposons and dna transposons according to their mechanism of transposition whereas dna transposons cut and insert themselves into new genomic_sites retrotransposons are copied and inserted at new genomic_locations using rna intermediates retrotransposons can be classified into two subgroups according to the existence of long_terminal ltrs at their and ends in addition both ltr_retrotransposons and non ltr_retrotransposons can be further classified into various orders super families and families based on their structure encoded_genes and phylogeny we previously_developed two separate computational_methods for the genome_wide identification of ltr and non ltr_retrotransposons called mgescan ltr and mgescan non ltr respectively mgescan ltr identifies all types of ltr_retrotransposons i e young intact old intact and solo ltr_retrotransposons using approximate string matching protein domain analysis and profile_hidden mgescannonltr identifies non ltr_retrotransposons based on gaussian bayes classifiers and generalized hidden_markov consisting of super states that correspond to different clades or closely_related clades mgescan ltr and mgescan non ltr have been successfully used for identifying retrotransposons however these programs were not designed to support either a web graphical_user or parallel execution on clusters their computational time for eukaryotic genome_analysis ranges from a few hours to several days in addition because they were developed as commandline tools that produce output_files regardless of post_processing it is not easy to visualize the results or perform further analysis in this article we introduce mgescan a galaxy based system for identifying retrotransposons in genomes mgescan provides an integrated interface to run both computational ltr and non ltr retrotransposon identification programs using the galaxy workflow this design facilitates input_data preparation and the further analysis of results execution time for retrotransposon identification in genomes is reduced by when mgescan runs with concurrent and mpi executions moreover because we provide mgescan in various forms users can use mgescan in their preferred way
