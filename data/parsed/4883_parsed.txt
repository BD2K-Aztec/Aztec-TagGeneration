genetics_and motivation genome_wide gwas have identified many loci implicated in disease_susceptibility integration of gwas summary_statistics p values and functional genomic_datasets should help to elucidate mechanisms results we extended a non parametric snp set enrichment method to test for enrichment of gwas signals in functionally defined loci to a situation where only gwas p values are available the approach is implemented in vseams a freely_available software pipeline we use vseams to identify enrichment of type_diabetes t d gwas associations near genes that are targets for the transcription_factors ikzf batf and esrra ikzf lies in a known t d susceptibility region while batf and esrra overlap other immune disease_susceptibility regions validating our approach and suggesting novel avenues of research for t d availability_and vseams is available for downloadgenome wide association studies gwas have been successful in identifying loci associated with many phenotypes and summary_statistics in the form of a list of single single_nucleotide snp p values for each marker tested are increasingly becoming available in the public_domain in tandem with this large_amounts of functional genomic_data across a wide_variety of tissues and conditions are increasingly available through public_repositories integrative methods that combine genome_wide genetic and genomic_data have the potential to highlight functional genomic categories suitable for further study in relation to a given phenotype this is particularly important in type_diabetes t d where of the susceptibility_loci currently described http immunobase org accessed only are consistent with a non synonymous coding snp as the causal_variant this is in accord with previous_research and indicates a central role for gene regulatory snps in the modulation of complex disease where integrative methods have utility one such integrative approach is to modify gene_set enrichment_analyses methods gsea developed for microarray pathway analysis for use with gwas study datasets these approaches partner snps to genes based on public annotations and then test for differences in evidence of association between snps assigned to two sets of genes there are several limitations with existing_approaches first most methods require access to raw genotype data to correct for inter snp correlation due to linkage_disequilibrium ld raw genotype data are typically not available in the public_domain and this problem is compounded for metaanalysisbased gwas which combines multiple datasets second the permutation based_approaches usually used to adjust for correlation are computationally_expensive finally classical gene_set is typically based on tests derived from the kolmogorovsmirnov which is under powered a need for simpler and more powerful_methods has been identified but the proposed alternative a ttest has been criticized because it cannot cope with strong correlation between genes we have previously used a wilcoxon based gsea method to demonstrate enrichment for t d association to a gene network driven by the transcription_factor irf the wilcoxon_test was used as a more powerful alternative to a kolmogorovsmirnov test but the approach still required permutation to correct for the effects of ld in this article we describe an approximate method that allows such tests to be performed with greater computational_efficiency and crucially without access to raw genotype data by extending an approach by we implement this extended approach in a freely_available software pipeline vseams although we have chosen the wilcoxon_test the pipeline would be easily_adaptable to any test of location such as a t test given previous evidence for the involvement of a network of genes linked to the transcription_factor irf in t d we hypothesized that networks of genes dependent on to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work other transcription_factors might also show enrichment for t d association we used vseams to test for enrichment of t d association among the targets of transcription_factors identified through knock_down experiments in lymphoblastoid_cell correlation is a problem for all enrichment_analyses because it results in inflated test_statistics compared with their theoretical this problem exists in gsea of gene_expression but is more pronounced for snp data in which historical recombination_events produce ld patterns that are both complex and strong the original gsea method accounts for this correlation by permuting phenotypes and repeating the entire gene_expression analysis multiple times an approach we also took in a previous variant set enrichment_analysis this computationally_intensive approach seems required because permuting snps or genes directly destroys the correlation_structure tests have been adapted for gene_set that deal theoretically with the inflation of variance by estimating an average variance inflation_factor but for snps we do not believe a single variance inflation_factor can capture the strength and highly_variable correlation observed instead in vseams we adapt a multivariate_normal sampling_approach which we show is not only faster than phenotype permutation but can be applied in the typical case where raw genotype data are not available our analyses indicate that the exact number of simulations required for a stable approximation of v is specific to a gene_set but suggest that permutations is sufficient for the gwas data we consider here vseams is designed not to require raw genotype data and alternative_methods to confirm sufficiency of simulation could be adopted from those developed in the markov_chain mcmc literature although this framework could equally be applied to parametric tests such as t tests we chose to concentrate on a non parametric wilcoxon_test because it is more robust to occasional genotyping_errors that may arise and that without access to genotyping_data are impossible to check although the selection of test_sets is often straightforward the selection of appropriate control sets tends not to be and requires careful understanding of the competitive hypothesis tested in enrichment studies and consideration of the appropriate control set here we restricted our set of control genes to genes that were perturbed by at least one transcription_factor in the lymphoblastoid_cell knock_down experiments we encourage users to think carefully about the construction of control gene_sets for example for microarray derived sets we advocate matching on mean gene_expression and coefficient of variation all three transcription_factors we identify fromhave been previously implicated in autoimmunity when cross_referenced with data from immunobase http immunobase org accessed april providing validation of the method ikzf is a transcription_factor located within a t d susceptibility locus at q and overlaps susceptibility_loci for ulcerative_colitis crohns_disease primary billiary cirrhosis and rheumatoid_arthritis ikzf is implicated in the regulation of b cell lymphocyte_proliferation and differentiation batf overlaps rheumatoid_arthritis and multiple_sclerosis susceptibility_loci at q mice over expressing batf show impaired t cell development in vitro and no induction of il esrra overlaps alopecia areate crohns_disease multiple_sclerosis and ulcerative_colitis loci at q and is a metabolic regulator of t cell activation and differentiation future work will determine_whether the enrichment pattern observed with t d is shared with or distinct from other autoimmune traits the set of genes perturbed when irf is knocked_down shows no evidence for enrichment in contrast to our previous work this likely reflects that the transcription_factor experiments were performed in a lymphoblastoid_cell the master_regulator of the irf network previously described is gpr and is known to be activated by exposure to epsteinbarr virus therefore irf responsiveness is likely to be altered in lcls which emphasizes a need for transcription_factor function to be studied in primary cells imprecise knowledge of regulatory variants for individual genes hampers any test of variant set enrichment as regulatory variation may lie kb from a gene we use a large window to assign snps to genes this increases the likelihood of overlapping regions occurring in test and control sets we have implemented a random_assignment strategy to mitigate this and although unbiased this approach can result in a loss of power in the test for enrichment combination of chromatin_state annotation with high_throughput chromatin_conformation hi c has the potential to allow better definition of genomic_regions involved in regulating specific genes this increased resolution will require a corresponding increase in gwas resolution through the use of imputation additionally as regulatory_function varies in a cell specific_manner annotation of multiple primary cell_types and careful_consideration of the biologically_relevant cell_types will berequired however we expect this more precise_definition of functional snp sets will allow a sharp_increase in the power of variant set enrichment_analyses and this will allow vseams analyses to interpret functionally defined genetic regions by linking them to end_point phenotypes
