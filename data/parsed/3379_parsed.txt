sequence_analysis optimizing multiple_sequence using a genetic_algorithm based on three objectives structural_information non gaps percentage and totally conserved columns motivation multiple_sequence msas are widely used approaches in bioinformatics to carry out other tasks such as structure predictions biological_function analyses or phylogenetic modeling however current_tools usually provide partially optimal alignments as each one is focused on specific biological_features thus the same set of sequences can produce different alignments above all when sequences are less similar consequently researchers and biologists do not agree about which is the most suitable way to evaluate msas recent evaluations tend to use more complex scores including further biological_features among them d structures are increasingly being used to evaluate alignments because structures are more conserved in proteins than sequences scores with structural_information are better suited to evaluate more distant relationships between sequences multiple_sequence msas are widely used strategies in current molecular_biology these approaches are often used for homology transfer where poorly_characterized sequences are compared with well studied homologs from typical model_organisms msa strategies have traditionally been applied to researches in phylogenetic_analyses structural_modeling functional_predictions or sequence database_searching msa tools have also been implemented in applications to predict protein_structures and interactions mutations or to reconstruct phylogenetic_trees the development of novel experimental_techniques such as next_generation and high_throughput experiments has prompted a great demand of msa tools because these techniques provide mainly new nucleotide_sequences and their subsequent products msa tools usually help to extract biological meanings from such information current msa tools are capable of dealing with and efficiently analyze the massive amount of information generated by these former techniques by using advanced computational_approaches based on well known artificial_intelligence and machine_learning hidden_markov hmms support_vector etc besides msa methodologies also take advantage of functional structural and genomic_information to obtain more accurate alignments in a reasonable time taking all these ideas into consideration msas are becoming one of the most powerful and essential procedures of analysis in bioinformatics traditionally several strategies have been applied to align multiple_sequences mainly classified as progressive algorithms or consistency based_methods both approaches were also combined with other relevant computational strategies to obtain more accurate alignments recently more sophisticated tools in msa have to whom correspondence should be addressed included additional data referring to proteins domains structures or homologies to align sequences o such additional features enrich the alignment information building more realistic solutions however the consumed time is excessive and improvements are just relevant in specific cases with less related sequences moreover these methods can be run when additional features are unavailable or unknown though they could provide inefficient alignments genetic_algorithms gas are also widely used to build msas gas are helpful in msa because they can be implemented independently of the objective_function thus ga algorithm can define multiple evaluations regardless of any modification in the optimization procedure gas can also be easily parallelized to significantly reduce the computational time consequently several methodologies such as saga msa ga rbt ga or vdga have already applied gas to build msas although there are many msa methodologies they usually achieve different solutions for the same set of sequences because each strategy is focused on specific biological_features consequently there is no consensus about which method builds more accurate alignments besides these msa tools could achieve suboptimal solutions where specific regions within the alignments are more accurate than others depending on the biological_features found at these particular regions these divergences have also a negative influence on subsequent phylogenetic_analyses as wrong phylogenetic_trees are obtained when alignments are inaccurate for this reason some other methods take advantage of jointly optimizing both phylogenetic_trees and alignments these methods aim to avoid the bias generated by guide trees in progressive methods though they do not still achieve good performances in terms of structure therefore the choice of the most suitable aligner is an essential problem which has not been completely solved yet another challenge in msa is to provide an efficient evaluation method to measure the alignment_accuracy msa strategies have usually applied well known matrices such as point accepted mutation pam or blosum which only consider nucleotide or amino_acid information to evaluate every aligned pair of residues however when the number of sequences increases or longer and more distant sequences are included alignments are more likely to be inaccurate using such scores in these cases additional information is necessary to complement alignment evaluations therefore current scores are increasingly using supplementary_information such as homologies or protein_structures thus some approaches can benefit from homology profiles provided e g by psi_blast to evaluate alignments additionally as structures are evolutionarily more conserved than sequences in proteins structural_information also provides more distant relationships between sequences for instance provided a novel scoring_scheme to evaluate msas from their predicted secondary_structures other scores such as contact accepted mutation and strike scores also estimated the molecular contacts from protein_structures to calculate alignment accuracies in this article a novel multiobjective genetic approach has been developed this method is named multiobjective optimizer for sequence_alignments based on structural evaluations mo sastre it takes_advantage of three objectives that are used to evaluate alignments generated by the ga strike score totally conserved tc columns and percentage of non gaps alignments are first coded in a novel representation which is useful for applying efficient mutation and crossover operators this algorithm is implemented through the well known multiobjective non dominated sorting genetic_algorithm nsga ii approach it is assessed by the balibase benchmark v alignments from mo sastre are finally compared with results shown by other known genetic and non genetic alignment_algorithms
