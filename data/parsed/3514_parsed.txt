pgat a multistrain analysis resource for microbial_genomes motivation the prokaryotic genome_analysis tool pgat is a web_based database application for comparing gene content and sequence across multiple microbial_genomes facilitating the discovery of genetic_differences that may explain observed phenotypes pgat supports database queries to identify genes that are present or absent in user selected genomes comparison of sequence_polymorphisms in sets of orthologous_genes multigenome display of regions_surrounding a query gene comparison of the distribution of genes in metabolic_pathways and manual community annotation availability_and the pgat website may be accessed at http nwrce org pgat whole genome_sequence comparison of related bacteria is increasing in scale owing to second_generation such as illumina http www illumina com and pyrosequencing http www com that can sequence more than a hundred bacterial_genomes in few months the main_challenge currently presented by those technologies is the ability to compare a large number of draft sequences efficiently in order to elucidate the biological_significance of the differences substantial progress has been made to accurately align whole genome_sequences to uncover genetic_polymorphisms however linking polymorphisms with functional differences still requires examination of their effect on proteins encoded by these regions e g non synonymous_substitutions gene_inactivation by frameshifts etc the motivation for the development of the prokaryoticgenome analysis tool pgat was the need for a data_mining tool by which draft_genome could be compared among themselves and with completed genomes to explore genetic_differences that result in functional differences the main features of pgat are as follows i implementation as a web_based database application to support data_mining ii ability to efficiently integrate large_numbers of genomes including draft genome_assemblies iii homogenization of genome_annotation across the genomes and iv support for manual community annotation pgat integrates many features of current online_resources such as the integrated microbial_genomes img the burkholderia to whom correspondence should be addressed genome_database and neisseria base its main difference is the homogenization of gene features across the genomes and the integrated functionality to compare gene content single_nucleotide snps in orthologous_genes and the resulting impact of snps and indels on the encoded_proteins currently pgat websites host burkholderia pseudomalleib mallei francisella_tularensis yersinia_pestis and salmonella_enterica
