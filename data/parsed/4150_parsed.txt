structural_bioinformatics sc pdb a database for identifying variations and multiplicity of 'druggable' binding_sites in proteins background the sc pdb database is an annotated archive of druggable binding_sites extracted from the protein_data it contains all atoms coordinates for proteinligand complexes chosen for their geometrical and physico_chemical the sc pdb provides a functional_annotation for proteins a chemical description for ligands and the detailed intermolecular_interactions for complexes the sc pdb now includes a hierarchical classification of all the binding_sites within a functional class method the sc pdb entries were first clustered according to the protein name indifferent of the species for each cluster we identified dissimilar sites e g catalytic and allosteric_sites of an enzyme scope and applications the classification of sc pdb targets by binding_site diversity was intended to facilitate chemogenomics approaches to drug_design in ligand based_approaches it avoids comparing ligands that do not share the same binding_site in structure based_approaches it permits to quantitatively evaluate the diversity of the binding_site definition variations in size sequence and or structure the protein_data pdb is the main public resource of biologically_active d structures available to study the interactions that govern ligand_binding to protein to assist structure based_approaches in drug_design we have parsed the pdb to identify binding_sites suitable for the docking of a drug like ligand and so have created a database named sc pdb the protein selection is based on the molecular_weight buried surface_area and chemical_structure of ligands as well as the volume of corresponding cavities since its creation in the database is updated annually with regular improvements notably the curation of ligand chemical_structures the optimization of ligand bound coordinates and the systematic description of the ligand binding_mode give significant added values to the structural_information contained in the database the sc pdb is annotated at a functional level and a sc pdb target name is assigned to each entry however two sc pdb entries to whom correspondence should be addressed with the same sc pdb target name do not necessarily describe an identical binding_site for example there are copies of the tyrosine_kinase scr in the sc pdb in entries the binding_site is the atp_binding of the kinase_domain site while in other entries the binding_site is located in the sh_domain and accommodates ligands of variable size sites and the present application aims at the distinction of the sc pdb binding_sites for a particular protein a hierarchical classification was established based on the geometrical and physico_chemical diversity of binding_sites all the binding_sites found similar for a given protein were structurally aligned to yield a new set of coordinates for the ligand site and protein files
