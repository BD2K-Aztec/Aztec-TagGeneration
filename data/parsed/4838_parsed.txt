gene_expression variable_selection for discriminant_analysis with markov_random priors for the analysis of microarray_data motivation discriminant_analysis is an effective tool for the classification of experimental units into groups here we consider the typical problem of classifying subjects according to phenotypes via gene_expression data and propose a method that incorporates variable_selection into the inferential procedure for the identification of the important biomarkers to achieve_this we build upon a conjugate normal discriminant model both linear and quadratic and include a stochastic_search variable_selection procedure via an mcmc_algorithm furthermore we incorporate into the model prior information on the relationships among the genes as described by a genegene network we use a markov_random mrf prior to map the network connections among genes our prior model assumes that neighboring genes in the network are more likely to have a joint_effect on the relevant biological_processes results we use simulated_data to assess performances of our method in particular we compare the mrf prior to a situation where independent bernoulli priors are chosen for the individual predictors we also illustrate the method on benchmark_datasets for gene_expression our simulation_studies show that employing the mrf prior improves on selection accuracy in real_data applications in addition to identifying markers and improving prediction_accuracy we show how the integration of existing biological_knowledge into the prior model results in an increased ability to identify genes with strong discriminatory_power and also aids the interpretation of the results contact discriminant_analysis sometimes called supervised pattern_recognition is a statistical technique used to classify observations into groups for each case in a given training_set a p vector of observations x i and a known assignment to one of g groups are available on the basis of these data we wish to derive a classification rule that assigns future cases to their correct groups if the distribution of the np matrix x of the data conditional on the group_membership is assumed to be a multivariate_normal then this statistical methodology is known as discriminant_analysis we consider the typical problem of classifying subjects according to phenotypes via gene_expressions and propose a method to to whom correspondence should be addressed include a variable_selection procedure into the inferential process for the identification of the important biomarkers we build upon a conjugate normal discriminant model linear or quadratic and include a stochastic_search variable_selection procedure via an mcmc_algorithm furthermore we use dependent priors that reflect known relationships among the genes recently there has been a rapid accumulation of biological_knowledge in the form of various genegene networks the importance of incorporating such biological_knowledge into the analysis of genomic_data has been increasingly_recognized here we view a genegene network as an undirected graph with nodes representing genes and edges representing interactions between genes we capture this information via a markov_random mrf prior that maps the connections among genes our prior model assumes that neighboring genes in the network are more likely to have a joint_effect on the relevant biological_processes similar priors have been used in linear_regression by wei and pan andand in gamma gamma models by we extend their use to the discriminant_analysis setting we illustrate our method for the case of quadratic_discriminant where different groups are allowed to have different covariance_matrices we show good performances on simulation_studies and illustrate the method on benchmark_datasets for gene_expression in particular we compare the mrf prior to a situation where independent bernoulli priors are chosen for the individual predictors and show that employing the mrf prior leads to more accurate selection other authors have reported similar results in particular comment on the effect of the mrf prior on the selection power in their linear_regression setting they also notice that adding the mrf prior implies a relatively small increase in computational_cost andreport that their methods are quite effective in identifying genes and modified subnetworks with higher sensitivity than commonly used procedures that do not use the network_structure and similar or in some cases lower false_discovery in real_data applications in addition to improving prediction_accuracy we show how the integration of biological_knowledge into the prior model results in an increased ability to identify genes with strong discriminatory_power and also aids the interpretation of the results the rest of the article is organized as follows in section we introduce discriminant_analysis under the bayesian paradigm and describe how to perform variable_selection we also propose a way to incorporate information about genegene networks into the prior model in section we present the mcmc_algorithm for posterior inference in section we investigate performances of thewe have illustrated how to perform variable_selection in discriminant_analysis following the bayesian paradigm in particular we have considered the typical problem of classifying subjects according to phenotypes via gene_expression data and have proposed prior models that incorporate information on the network_structure of genes our method allows the classification of future samples and the simultaneous identification of the important biomarkers our simulation_studies have shown that employing the mrf prior improves on selection accuracy in applications to benchmark gene_expression we have found that the integration of existing biological_knowledge into the prior model results in an increased ability to identify genes with strong discriminatory_power and aids the interpretation of the results in addition to improving prediction_accuracy
