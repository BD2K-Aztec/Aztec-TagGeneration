comparison of genetic_variants in matched_samples using thesaurus annotation motivation calling changes in dna e g as a result of somatic events in cancer requires analysis of multiple matched sequenced samples events in low mappability regions of the human_genome are difficult to encode in variant call files and have been under reported as a result however they can be described accurately through thesaurus annotationa technique that links multiple genomic_loci together to explicate a single_variant results we here describe software and benchmarks for using thesaurus annotation to detect point changes in dna from matched_samples in benchmarks on matched normal tumor_samples we show that the technique can recover between five and ten percent more true events than conventional approaches while strictly limiting false discovery and being fully consistent with popular variant analysis workflows we also demonstrate the utility of the approach for analysis of de_novo mutations in parents child families availability_and software performing thesaurus annotation is implemented_in available in source_code on github at geneticthesaurus https github com tkonopka geneticthesaurus

github com tkonopka rgeneticthesaurus variants and mutations in dna underlie several human_diseases studies of whole exome and whole_genome datasets based on shortread shotgun_sequencing have already uncovered much information about the mutational_landscape in disease this is exemplified by the growth of impressive catalogues of genetic_markers linked to mendelian inherited conditions and to cancer however considerable portions of the human_genome consist of non unique_sequences which have posed challenges for bioinformatic_analyses and for interpretations of findings thus the mutational_landscape in these regions still remains concealed to identify non germline genetic_features linked with a disease most mutation calling workflows process several matched_samples at the same time for example somatic_mutation callers for cancer_genomics consider a tumor sample together with a normal control from the same individual one sample the tumor is used to put forth a list of candidate sites that are different than in the reference_genome information from matched control samples normal_tissue is then used to eliminate features that also appear in cells unaffected by the disease the control sample is thus used for personalized filtering of the candidate list because common features in case and control samples may arise due to the germ_line or because of sequencing artifacts it is tempting to use models or databases of polymorphisms for this step however despite increasing detail in the databases and despite increasing understanding of sequencing chemistry the personalized filtering strategy remains the most effective means to identify disease associated variants in this work we extended the thesaurus variant annotation strategy to the context of multiple matched_samples this capability makes thesaurus filtering now available for problems such as detection of somatic_mutations in cancer_genomes and de_novo mutations in family trios we implemented software suitable for these applications proposed a package to handle thesaurus annotations within the r environment and performed a number of tests on synthetic and actual data all the tests indicated that thesaurus annotation provides a real_benefit for describing changes in dna in low mappability regions of the human_genome the improvements are observed relative to existing_methods that report mutations at individual genomic_loci through single entries in vcf files rather than clusters of loci the contribution of this work is twofold first the software proposes a particular implementation of mutation calling in matched_samples i e an extension of existing analysis_pipelines incorporating thesaurus annotation in this direction we showed that the software is compatible with existing workflows including different aligners and variant callers second our work provides tools and data_structures upon which specialized applications can draw on the formats are intentionally generic to enable extensions and adaptations of thesaurus annotations to particular needs in particular selection of mutation candidates can be adjusted in many ways beyond the filters described here a practical conclusion of the benchmarking studies is that thesaurus annotation opens the analysis window on between five and ten percent of the human_genome but the thesaurus technique also has some limitations the implementation used in this work is not adapted to the study of indels or variants immediately near structural_rearrangements also because a signal from one locus is often diluted over multiple genomic_sites because of alignment ambiguity the coverage required to detect and call a variant or mutation in low mappability regions is higher than in high mappability regions with decreasing sequencing_costs and gradually increasing standards of sample coverage and read_length however this factor should not be a serious obstacle to the study of mutations in these regions
