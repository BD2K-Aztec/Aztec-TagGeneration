gene_expression a hybrid_approach to protein differential_expression in mass_spectrometry motivation quantitative mass_spectrometry involves statistical_inference on protein_abundance based on the intensities of each proteins associated spectral peaks however typical ms based proteomics datasets have substantial proportions of missing observations due at least in part to censoring of low_intensities this complicates intensity based differential_expression results we outline a statistical_method for protein differential_expression based on a simple binomial likelihood by modeling peak_intensities as binary in terms of presence absence we enable the selection of proteins not typically amenable to quantitative analysis e g one state proteins that are present in one condition but absent in another in addition we present an analysis protocol that combines quantitative and presence absence analysis of a given dataset in a principled way resulting in a single list of selected proteins with a single associated false_discovery a key goal of quantitative mass_spectrometry is statistical_inference on differential_protein quantitative information is derived from spectral peak_intensities that are identified as having come from one of a proteins constituent peptides statistical_procedures for differential_protein are naturally constructed in the context of regression or anova or as a rollup problem however intensity based procedures are challenged by the presence of widespread missing intensities it is typical for of the total collection of attempted measurements to be missing that is in a matrix with all identified peptides in the rows samples in the columns of the matrix cell entries are empty with standard regression or anova procedures peptides with missing_values must either be removed from the analysis or their missing_values must be imputed there will typically be very few peptides with no missing_values so filtering peptides in this way results in a to whom correspondence should be addressed much less informative dataset furthermore previously published_reports indicate that the vast_majority of missing_values are the results of censoring of absent or low_abundance peptides this means that simple imputation routines are not appropriate parametric imputation and other specialized methodology can be employed to enable intensity based_inference with lessened information_loss however some information_loss is inevitable in particular one state or nearly so peptides those for which there are many observed intensities in one comparison group but few in another comparison group are not amenable to an intensity based analysis not limited to the twoclass problem as a result such peptides are typically filtered out of an intensity based analysis a protein that is always present in a diseased state say and never in the healthy state would be of great biological interest so it is unfortunate if our statistical methodology cannot identify such a protein an alternative to an intensity based analysis is a presence absence analysis in which peak_intensities are digitized into binary measurements depending on whether a peak was observed or not this is analogous to the spectral_counting approach in ms_ms studies where a peptide is quantified by the number of fragmentation spectra assigned to it data collected in our laboratory do not necessarily have ms_ms data associated with it instead being obtained according to the accurate_mass and time tag pipeline still we have information on whether or not a particular peptide was observed in each sample while presence absence analysis is better suited to finding one state proteins it necessarily has less statistical_power abundance differences in proteins with little to moderate missingness ideally protein differential_expression would simultaneously target_proteins of both types resulting in a single list of differentially_expressed with a single associated false_discovery fdr a hierarchical_bayesian would be well suited to this purpose but such techniques are complex computationally_intensive and less amenable to high_throughput pipelines we present a hybrid analysis protocol that consists of two stages i intensity based analysis and ii a presence absence analysis the results of each are merged to create a single collection of interesting proteins to which we use novel methodology to apply a single fdr this enables the researcher to extract more information from a quantitative_proteomic dataset than would be achievable by either approach alone while still maintaining an interpretable measurethe proposed presence absence based_methodology is designed to enable the detection of one state or similar proteins that are not amenable to traditional intensity based_methods furthermore we have proposed a hybrid_approach that combines both intensity and presence absence based analysis of a dataset together with fdr_estimation of the combined list of differentially_expressed the proposed hybrid_approach was demonstrated to outperform either of the intensity or presence absence based_methods alone an obvious limitation to our work is its applicability to only two comparison groups a regression_based implementation would be more generalizable and we intend to pursue this in our future work the choices of weights in the peptide level and hybrid methods could undoubtedly be improved upon as well all fdr estimates are quite conservative
