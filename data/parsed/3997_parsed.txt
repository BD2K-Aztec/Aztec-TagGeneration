sequence_analysis revisiting amino_acid matrices for identifying distantly_related proteins motivation although many amino_acid matrices have been developed it has not been well understood which is the best for similarity_searches especially for remote_homology therefore we collected information related to existing matrices condensed it and derived a novel matrix that can detect more remote homology than ever results using principal_component with existing matrices and benchmarks we developed a novel matrix which we designate as miqs the detection performance of miqs is validated and compared with that of existing general_purpose matrices using ssearch with optimized gap penalties for each matrix results show that miqs is able to detect more remote homology than the existing matrices on an independent dataset in addition the performance of our developed matrix was superior to that of cs blast which was a novel similarity_search method with no amino_acid matrix we also evaluated the alignment_quality of matrices and methods which revealed that miqs shows higher alignment sensitivity than that with the existing matrix series and cs blast fundamentally these results are expected to constitute good proof of the availability and or importance of amino_acid matrices in sequence_analysis moreover with our developed matrix sophisticated similarity search_methods such as sequenceprofile and profileprofile comparison methods can be improved further availability_and newly_developed matrices and datasets used for this study are available at http csas cbrc jp ssearch protein_sequence comparison methods are fundamental tools in contemporary biology currently they are used widely in various fields of bioinformatics such as computational genomics and proteomics and computational evolutionary_biology pairwise_alignment is the basis of protein_sequence comparison methods consequently improving pairwise amino_acid comparison methods can engender improved quality of studies in the field of computational_biology a few factors are necessary to improve pairwise amino_acid comparison methods minimum units that govern the methods consist of comparison algorithms and amino_acid matrices also called similarity mutation scoring_matrices development and improvement of a matrix are crucial for improvement of the methods many studies have been undertaken since the first compilation of such matrices and have been developed and improved along the following three lines i specific matrices are proteins with distinctive amino_acid consequently it is reasonable to construct matrices for distinctive protein classes or proteins encoded in the genome under directional mutation pressures for instance matrices specialized for transmembrane_regions and for barrel membrane_proteins jimenez have been developed matrices for particular proteins organisms have also been constructed aside from those matrices a general_scheme for the compositional adjustment of matrices has been proposed optimized matrices starting from the existing matrices some superior matrices have been derived by maximizing the ability to discriminate between homologs and non homologs and to obtain accurate alignments with optimization_methods iii contextdependent matrices from the pioneering work of constructing doublet type dipeptide substitution matrices several approaches along this line have been proposed more recently a novel similarity_search method called cs blast which uses information of neighboring residues extensively to improve similarity_search has been developed in this method the similarity_search is performed with no amino_acid matrix cs blast which is reportedly of high detection performance presents the possibility of displacement of a traditional amino_acid matrix although many matrices have been proposed we found previously that widely used matrices so_called general_purpose matrices such as pam and blosum have common characteristics in terms of the results of both hierarchical_cluster and reproduction from amino_acid indices despite the difference in to whom correspondence should be addressed this is an open_access the terms of the

permissions_oup com datasets methods and models used for obtaining them this fact might imply the existence of common_ground among general_purpose matrices it is worth investigating the potential for development to this end we explore effective matrices for identifying distantly_related proteins based on the prevailing matrices we explored and identified effective matrice s in the pca subspace through the intensive benchmark analyses and inferred the most sensitive matrix that matrix designated as miqs with ssearch outperforms the existing matrices and cs blast on an independent dataset in terms of sensitivity we argue that substitution matrices are useful for amino_acid similarity_search we demonstrated in this study that using the pca subspace based on typical existing matrices we were able to obtain a sensitive novel matrix miqs empirically therefore it is possible to use it to improve the homology detection of proteins especially in the scop and cath database compared with existing matrices and cs blast we argue that miqs can be useful for other database_searches and that this matrix can be influential for the improvement of sophisticated methods such as psiblast and profileprofile comparison methods in addition to any method using a substitution matrix in the field of bioinformatics
