genome_analysis noise_reduction in genome_wide perturbation screens using linear_mixed motivation high_throughput perturbation screens measure the phenotypes of thousands of biological_samples under various conditions the phenotypes measured in the screens are subject to substantial biological and technical variation at the same time in order to enable high_throughput it is often impossible to include a large number of replicates and to randomize their order throughout the screens distinguishing true changes in the phenotype from stochastic variation in such experimental_designs is extremely_challenging and requires adequate statistical methodology results we propose a statistical_modeling framework that is based on experimental_designs with at least two controls profiled throughout the experiment and a normalization and variance estimation procedure with linear_mixed we evaluate the framework using three comprehensive screens of saccharomyces_cerevisiae which involve single gene_knockout haploid mutants single gene_knockout diploid mutants and single gene overexpression haploid strains we show that the proposed approach i can be used in conjunction with practical experimental_designs ii allows extensions to alternative experimental workflows iii enables a sensitive discovery of biologically_meaningful changes and iv strongly outperforms the existing noise_reduction procedures availability all experimental_datasets are publicly_available at www ionomicshub org the r package htsmix is available atperturbation screens subject model_organisms to stresses that are external e g heat_shock or chemical_treatments or genetic e g disruption or deletion of to whom correspondence should be addressed genes a variety of phenotypes can be measured in association with the stresses these can be univariate phenotypes such as cell_growth or activity of a reporter_gene low_dimensional phenotypes such as cellular_morphology or high_dimensional phenotypes such as gene_expression or protein_abundance when conducted on a genome_wide scale perturbation screens provide invaluable insight into the function of living_organisms they are increasingly used in functional biology and in biomedical and biopharmaceutical research the throughput of genome_wide screens is a primary_concern in these investigations since it can take weeks and sometimes months to measure the phenotypes it is often impossible to fully implement the fundamental_principles of statistical experimental_design in particular the screens can incorporate little replication and a full randomization of the order of the replicates is often impractical at the same time the measured phenotypes are subject to large variation which is due to both natural between sample variation and technical variation in the sample handling and measurement procedures the problem is compounded by changes in experimental characteristics e g instruments labor reagents that are unavoidable in large_scale screens interpretation of the screens is therefore a key and non trivial step which must take the specifics of the experiments into account in this article we propose a statistical_modeling framework for accurate interpretation of high_throughput most specifically in cases of low_dimensional phenotypes we focus on screens which have a limited number of replicate samples and a sensitive_phenotype i e the phenotype that is affected in a non negligible proportion of the samples distinguishing the systematic signal from noise is particularly challenging in such situations the requirements of high_throughput impose constraints on the design and implementation of perturbation screens and introduce challenges in their interpretation work in this article was motivated by the insights that i control based normalization is most appropriate for the screens where a large proportion of samples show changes in the phenotypes and ii residual non additive_effects of batch and plate variation are important components of the stochastic variation in the screens and should be accounted for the optimal detection of hits we proposed an experimental_design that involves at least two control samples and a normalization and variance estimation procedure based on linear_mixed evaluations on three comprehensive ionomic screens showed that the proposed method bullet can be used in conjunction with a practical experimental_design bullet allows extensions to alternative structures of data bullet enables a specific discovery of biologically_meaningful hits and bullet strongly outperforms the existing_approaches we therefore recommend this approach as a useful tool in highthroughput functional investigations
