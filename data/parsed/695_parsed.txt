genetics_and bcftools roh a hidden_markov approach for detecting autozygosity from next_generation data runs of homozygosity rohs are genomic stretches of a diploid_genome that show identical alleles on both chromosomes longer rohs are unlikely to have arisen by chance but are likely to denote autozygosity whereby both copies of the genome descend from the same recent ancestor early tools to detect roh used genotype array data but substantially more information is available from sequencing_data here we present and evaluate bcftools roh an extension to the bcftools software_package that detects regions of autozygosity in sequencing_data in particular exome data using a hidden_markov by applying it to simulated_data from the genomes_project we estimate its accuracy and show that it has higher sensitivity and specifi city than existing_methods under a range of sequencing_error and levels of autozygosity availability_and bcftools roh and its associated binary source files are freely_available from https github com samtools bcftools contact the prevalence of runs of homozygosity rohs varies worldwide depending on past demography and recent mating patterns targeted studies in families from populations with high consanguinity have been successful in identifying genes underlying simple autosomal_recessive disorders using autozygosity mapping while several methods exist to detect these roh they were primarily designed for genotyping_data and do not exploit all the information available from population sequencing which includes fuller information about allele_frequencies and recombination_rates moreover they were not designed to be computationally_efficient to accommodate the higher complexity of sequence_data more recently introduce a new method h m developed for sequence_data but which requires bam_files which are not always available we present a software_package bcftools roh to allow geneticists carrying out genome_wide sequencing studies to infer autozygous sections from sequence derived variation data in a more accurate and more efficient way
