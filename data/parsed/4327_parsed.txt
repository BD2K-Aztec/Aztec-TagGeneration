solenoid and non solenoid protein recognition using stationary wavelet packet transform motivation solenoid_proteins are emerging as a protein class with properties intermediate between structured and intrinsically unstructured proteins containing repeating structural_units solenoid_proteins are expected to share sequence_similarities however in many cases the sequence_similarities are weak and non detectable moreover solenoids can be degenerated and widely vary in the number of units so that it is difficult to detect them recently several solenoid repeats detection methods have been proposed such as self alignment of the sequence spectral_analysis and discrete_fourier of sequence although these methods have shown good performance on certain data_sets they often fail to detect repeats with weak similarities in this article we propose a new approach to recognize solenoid repeats and non solenoid_proteins using stationary wavelet packet transform swpt our method associates with three advantages i naturally representing five main factors of protein_structure and properties by wavelet_analysis technique ii extracting novel wavelet features that can capture hidden components from solenoid sequence_similarities and distinguish them from global proteins iii obtaining statistics features that capture repeating motifs of solenoid_proteins results our method analyzes the characteristics of amino_acid in both spectral and temporal domains using swpt both global and local information of proteins are captured by swpt coefficients we obtain and integrate wavelet_based features and statistics based features of amino_acid to improve the classification task our proposed method is evaluated by comparing to state of the art methods such as hhrepid and repetita the experimental_results show that our algorithm consistently outperforms them in areas under roc_curve at the same false_positive the sensitivity of our wavelet method is higher than other methods with several interesting_features of repeating sequences significant progress has been made in the identification of the dna and protein repeats understanding the duplication mechanism and special_features of the repeat evolution repeats are usually found in non coding genomic_regions however repeating sequences are also found in about of all proteins coded by all known genes with about of all eukaryotic_proteins the known protein_structures can be classified by the length of their repeats which can provide information about a possible d structure of the repetitive protein there are four main structural_classes class i crystalline structures to residue repeats class_ii fibrous proteins to residue repeats class_iii solenoid_proteins to residue repeats and class_iv domain forming repeats or more residues solenoid_proteins contain a superhelical arrangement of repeating structure units this arrangement contrasts the structure of most class_iv proteins that fold into globular_domains in more complex manners repeats in class_i have only residues hence they have low sequence complexity and can be easily detected globular repeats in class_iv have their sufficient length to be detected by database_search like psi_blast solenoid_proteins are built of repeated structural_units the repeating_units of the solenoids consist of one to several segments of secondary_structure among which are helices strands and helices the solenoid_proteins have purely helices or strands or a mixture of the secondary_structures they are expected to share sequence_similarities however in some cases the sequence_similarities are weak such as protein farnesyltransferase ftase and insulin_like igf r so that they are non detectable therefore database_search like psi_blast relying on clear conservation pattern are not good tools to detect solenoid repeats in recent_years several methods have been proposed to identify solenoid repeats some of them are based on self alignment of the sequence such as repro radar trust hhrep and hhrepid hhrep and hhrepid utilized hidden_markov comparison hmmhmm while the others used sequencesequence comparison to find suboptimal self alignments repeating parts of the sequence appear as offdiagonal regions of similarity they allow the detection of basic repeating_units and locations of units along the sequence hhrepid has been reported to be the most sensitive self alignment approach to detect repeats however hhrepid often cannot detect repeats with weak similarities other approaches to recognize solenoid repeats use periodic patterns in proteins such as repper and repetita repeating protein motifs tim barrels propellor blades coiled_coils and leucine rich repeating structures have been analyzed and used to detect repeats in known protein_structure the data utilized inare relative accessible_surface and simple hydrophobicity that provide information of the protein_structure andpage i i i in this article we proposed a new wavelet method to recognize solenoid_proteins and global proteins using swpt and statistical_features of amino_acid in order to detect solenoid repeats with weak similarities we took advantages of the integration of wavelet statistics features and the swpt analysis of five factors representing protein_structure and properties our new features can capture structure properties of solenoid_proteins and hidden components from sequence_similarities to distinguish them from global proteins the proposed approach was validated by comparing to other state of the art methods in solenoid_proteins detection experiments in all results our new scheme improved the solenoid protein recognition in all statistical metrics including sensitivity specificity and accuracy the wavelet method is a promising approach for solenoid protein classification based on different types of training data the wavelet method can be applied to classify different kinds of solenoids or different kinds of protein_structures in future work
