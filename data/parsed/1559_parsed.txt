genetics_and efficient_simulation under a population_genetics model of carcinogenesis motivation cancer is well known to be the end result of somatic_mutations that disrupt normal cell_division the number of such mutations that have to be accumulated in a cell before cancer develops depends on the type of cancer the waiting_time t m until the appearance of m mutations in a cell is thus an important quantity in population_genetics models of carcinogenesis such models are often difficult to analyze theoretically because of the complex interactions of mutation drift and selection they are also computationally_expensive to simulate because of the large number of cells and the low mutation_rate results we develop an efficient algorithm for simulating the waiting_time t m until m mutations under a population_genetics model of cancer development we use an exact algorithm to simulate evolution of small cell_populations and coarse_grained leaping approximation to handle large populations we compared our hybrid simulation algorithm with the exact algorithm in small_populations and with available asymptotic results for large populations the comparison suggested that our algorithm is accurate and computationally_efficient we used the algorithm to study the waiting_time for up to mutations under a moran model with variable population_sizes our new algorithm may be useful for studying realistic models of carcinogenesis which incorporates variable mutation_rates and fitness_effects contactcancer is a genetic disease caused by mutations in cancer susceptibility_genes including oncogenes tumor_suppressor and genetic_instability genes see e g for a review mutations that activate oncogenes can confer a selective_advantage to the cell when one of the two alleles is mutated but typically involve specific amino_acid changes at specific_residues of the protein mutations that inactivate both alleles of a tumor_suppressor also lead to fitness benefits to the cell and such mutations do not have to be specific as many mutations in a gene can to whom correspondence should be addressed disrupt its normal function genetic_instability refers to a diversity of changes in the genome on the nucleotide or chromosomal levels the former is caused by mutations in the dna_repair and involves substitutions insertions_or of one or a few nucleotides the latter includes gains or losses of whole chromosomes as well as inversions deletions duplications and translocations of large chromosomal segments mutations in genetic_instability genes may cause increased mutation_rates in the cell leading to the so_called mutator phenotype for example p mutations may impair the detection of and response to dna_damage many cancers have a mutator phenotype that results from mutations in genes involved in dna_mismatch it is now generally_accepted that the rate_limiting in the process of carcinogenesis is the accumulation of new mutations both fitness advantages and increased mutation_rates can significantly_shorten the waiting_time until the required number of mutations the relative importance of selection followed by clonal_expansion versus raised mutation_rates is somewhat controversial argue based on a computer simulation that advantageous mutations and clonal_expansion were sufficient to initiate tumor without increased mutation_rates however if more than two mutations in tumor_suppressor are needed for carcinogenesis increased mutation_rates appear to be an important factor the number of mutations required for tumorigenesis depends on the type of cancer used age specific cancer_incidence data to estimate the number of mutations necessary to develop colon_cancer to be about inferred from an analysis of the incidence of retinoblastoma in children that the cancer is caused by mutations to the two alleles of a gene which was later identified to be rb the first tumor_suppressor one of which may be in the germline and inherited analyzed data from colorectal_cancers from nine hospitals in finland and estimated that about five to six oncogenic mutations are required for hereditary cancers or seven or eight mutations for sporadic cancers in contrast to those early studies which suggested that a handful of mutations were sufficient to cause cancer recent efforts using next_generation to identify mutations in protein_coding in common tumor_types have in general identified far more genes for example sjblompage analyzed protein_coding in breast and colorectal_tumors and found that individual tumors accumulate an average of mutations only a small subset of those mutations may be drivers which offer the cell a selective_advantage and are responsible for carcinogenesis while the others are passengers which provide no fitness benefits to the cell but hitchhike to fixation by chance estimated that as many as mutations may be required to initiate colon_cancer and as many as may be involved in breast_cancer seefor an updated analysis the early work of armitage and doll and knudson has prompted a large body of theoretical work which uses population_genetics models to describe mutation drift and selection and to study the waiting_time until the accumulation of m mutations studied a two stage model for a population of cells evolving according to the moran model by assuming that the first mutation is either neutral or deleterious while the second mutation is advantageous they studied an interesting scenario called stochastic tunneling in which a population fixed for cells of no mutation can reach fixation for the second mutation without ever reaching fixation for the first mutation schweinsberg andderived the asymptotic distributions of the waiting_time until m mutations due to the complexity of the problem they assumed selective neutrality and a constant mutation_rate numerical_simulations were conducted to confirm analytical results but only for small_populations studied the waiting_time until m mutations under the wrightfisher model with large population_sizes with numerical_simulation they were able to show how varying population_size mutation_rate and selection affect the waiting_time as pointed_out by the moran model is more natural than the wrightfisher model for describing the evolution of somatic_cells however simulation under the moran model is expensive even more expensive than under the wright fisher model the large population_sizes and small mutation_rates mean that one has to simulate many transitions which change the compositions of the population only slightly in this article we develop an approximate algorithm to simulate the waiting_time until m mutations under the moran model we explore the similarity of the model of cancer_initiation to a chemical_reaction system and develop simulation algorithms that have been studied in that context the evolutionary_process of mutation drift and selection under the moran model is described by a variable rate markov_chain as is a chemical_reaction system the process can be simulated using standard algorithms by generating exponential waiting_times until the next event and then deciding what event has happened this is the so_called gillespie algorithm however with a large population_size simulation using this exact algorithm is prohibitively slow the leaping algorithm was proposed to speed up the simulation by leaping over a time interval in which changes to the state and rates of the chain are expected to be small however this coarse_grained approximation does not work well for our problem because of the existence of cell_types whose population_sizes may be small here we develop a hybrid algorithm that can efficiently simulate the evolutionary_processes of large populations we use the exact algorithm to simulate transitions involving small_populations which may introduce substantial changes to the rates and coarsegrained leaping algorithm to simulate transitions within each large population where transitions are unlikely to cause large changes to the state and the event_rates we test our new hybrid algorithm against the exact simulation in small_populations and against asymptotic results in large populations the results suggest that the hybrid algorithm is reliable and computationally_efficient the fast simulation algorithm may be useful for studying realistic carcinogenesis models that allow different cell_types to have different finesses and different mutation_rates
