aligning short_reads to reference alignments and trees motivation likelihood based_methods for placing short_read from metagenomic_samples into reference phylogenies have been recently_introduced at present it is unclear how to align those reads with respect to the reference alignment that was deployed to infer the reference phylogeny moreover the adaptability of such alignment_methods with respect to the underlying reference alignment strategies philosophies has not been explored it has also not been assessed if the reference phylogeny can be deployed in conjunction with the reference alignment to improve alignment_accuracy in this context results we assess different strategies for short_read and propose a novel phylogeny aware alignment procedure our alignment_method can improve the accuracy of subsequent phylogenetic placement of the reads into a reference phylogeny by up to times compared with phylogeny agnostic methods it can be deployed to align_reads to alignments generated by using fundamentally different alignment strategies e g prank f versus muscle availability http www exelixiscurrently bioinformatics is facing two challenges the many core revolution and the biological data avalanche that is driven by novel wet_lab sequencing_techniques in a single run these new sequencing_techniques can generate between hundreds of thousands up to several millions of short dna_reads with a length ranging between and nt one important application of next_generation methods is in vivo sampling of microbial_communities e g in the human_gut or on human hands for phylogenetic_analysis of such metagenomic environmental_samples new likelihoodbased methods such as the evolutionary placement algorithm epa and pplacer have recently become available these new placement algorithms help to establish the provenance of the anonymous and diverse environmental sample of short_reads by means of assigning the reads to a givenfixedreference phylogeny the reference phylogeny is a fully resolved strictly bifurcating to whom correspondence should be addressed unrooted phylogenetic reference tree rt that is based on a fixed multiple reference alignment ra of the full_length sequences in the rt phylogenetic placement algorithms like the epa or pplacer work by inserting and removing again one short_read at a time into different edges branches of the rt thereby they strive to find the optimal score of the extended by one taxon trees in order to individually determine the best insertion edge for each short_read the likelihood based_scoring of alternative short_read insertion positions in epa and pplacer is conducted under standard models of nucleotide_substitution e g generalized time reversible model using the model of rate heterogeneity gtr the accuracy of such a likelihood_based placement of reads depend upon the multiple_sequence msa that entails the ra and the short_sequence henceforth denoted as query_sequences qs therefore a prerequisite for phylogenetic placement algorithms is that the qs need to be aligned to the ra before conducting a placement run we investigate the problem of aligning short_reads to a given reference alignment and compare alignment_quality of hmmalign to a new phylogeny aware short_read alignment_method by means of likelihood_based phylogenetic qs placement accuracy the most straightforward approach to align qs with the ra containing full_length reference_sequences is to simply compute a new msa from scratch comprising the sequences in the rt and the qs e g using muscle mafft or prank f because of the extremely_large and continuously growing number of qs this de_novo alignment approach can be computationally prohibitive alternatively one can keep the existing potentially manually_curated ra fixed and only align the qs with respect to this ra using dedicated qs alignment_methods one such method
