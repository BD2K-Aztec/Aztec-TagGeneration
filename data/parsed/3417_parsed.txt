genetics_and papa a flexible tool for identifying pleiotropic pathways using genome_wide summaries pleiotropy is common in the genetic architectures of complex_diseases to the best of our knowledge no analysis tool has been developed for identifying pleiotropic pathways using multiple genome_wide gwas summaries by now here we present papa a flexible tool for pleiotropic pathway analysis utilizing gwas summary results the performance of papa was validated using publicly_available gwas summaries of body_mass and waist_hip of the giant datasets papa identified a set of pleiotropic pathways which have been demonstrated to be involved in the development of obesity availability_and papa program document and illustrative example are available at http sourceforge net_projects papav files pleiotropy describes the genetic phenomenon of a single gene affecting multiple_phenotypes it can be explained by single gene_product having various biological_functions or acting as a signal factor implicated in the development of different phenotypes pleiotropy is common in the genetic architectures of complex_diseases a total of of genes recorded in the nhgri catalog of published genome_wide gwas have pleiotropic_effects clarifying the molecular_mechanism of pleiotropy is helpful for pathogenetic studies and drug_development of human complex_diseases recent_achievements in gwas provide a good opportunity for systematical pleiotropy studies of complex_diseases a simple approach is to analyse disease_phenotypes separately using univariate approaches the study results of different disease_phenotypes are compared which may result in low_statistical to address_this multiple pleiotropy analysis approaches and tools have been proposed a group of genes with pleiotropic_effects were identified for complex_diseases however current pleiotropic mechanism studies of complex_diseases mostly focus on individual pleiotropic genes which are sometimes functionally independent some individual pleiotropic genes participate in multiple_cellular the biological_functions of a part of genes remain_elusive now therefore identifying individual pleiotropic genes often provides limited information for genetic_studies of complex_diseases inspired by the gene_set gsea of microarray_data pathway based gwas were proposed and successfully_applied in the genetic_studies of complex_diseases however to the best of our knowledge no analysis tool has been developed for identifying pleiotropic pathways using gwas summary results by now in this study we extended the pathway analysis algorithm proposed by and developed a pleiotropic pathway analysis tool papa we applied papa to public available gwas summaries of v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com body_mass bmi and waist_hip whr of the genetic investigation of anthropometric traits datasets
