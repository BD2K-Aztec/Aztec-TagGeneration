structural_bioinformatics identification of protein binding surfaces using surface triplet propensities motivation the ability to reliably_predict proteinprotein and proteinligand_interactions is important for identifying druggable binding_sites and for understanding how proteins communicate most currently available algorithms identify cavities on the protein surface as potential ligand recognition_sites the method described here does not explicitly look for cavities but uses small surface patches consisting of triplets of adjacent surface atomic groups that can be touched simultaneously by a probe sphere representing a solvent molecule a total of different types of triplets can be identified a training_set of proteinligand protein x_ray structures has been used to generate interface propensities for the triplets which can be used to predict their involvement in ligandbinding interactions results the success_rate for locating proteinligand binding_sites on protein_surfaces using this new surface triplet propensities stp algorithm is which compares well with currently available grid based and energy based_approaches q sitefinders dataset laurie and jackson bioinformatics was used to show the favorable performance of stp an analysis of the different triplet types showed that higher ligand_binding propensity is related to more polarizable surfaces the interaction statistics between triplet atoms on the protein surface and ligand atoms have been used to estimate statistical free_energies of interaction the g stat for halogen atoms interacting with hydrophobic triplets is kcal_mol and an estimate of the maximal g stat for a ligand atom interacting with a triplet in a binding_pocket is kcal_mol availability freely_available online at http opus bch ed ac uk stp website implemented in php with all_major intermolecular_interactions drive and control most biological_functions including for example signal_transduction transcription and cell_cycle an understanding of small_molecule protein recognition is also key to more effective medicinal_chemistry and design of tight_binding drug like ligands to whom correspondence should be addressed the recent growth of information available in structural databases and also of protein ligand_binding data nih provides the required experimental_data for the development of a range of in silico algorithms for example predicting ligand_binding predicting absolute ligand_binding free_energies and predicting proteindna binding_sites proteins frequently play a role in multimer complexes and communicate with a number of different partners and there is a growing body of structural_information on such assemblies as the spliceosome the stressosome ribosome ubiquitination pathways chaperone complexes and transcription_machinery a picture is emerging in which even small proteins are likely to have multiple non overlapping docking or binding_sites which may be used in allosteric communication networks the possibility of being able to identify such allosteric docking sites also opens up new opportunities in the field of drug_discovery ligand specificity is a major_problem in many drug_discovery projects where an enzyme active_site is highly_conserved among a number of isoforms e g protein_kinases or phosphatases by blocking allosteric binding_pockets it may be possible to target specific isoforms or in the case of infection to target species specific ortholog proteins despite the expanding experimental structural database of proteinligand and protein_protein experimental_data are still insufficient to identify all potential_binding that may be of biological_relevance to a particular protein target reliable computational_prediction to identify potential protein binding_sites are therefore of significant current interest several approaches have been developed to search for protein binding surfaces geometry based_algorithms have been quite successful for example pocketdepth utilized the depth of pockets to predict the location of binding_sites and report to successfully predict of ligands as first rank predictions surfnet searches for cavities on the surface of the protein and fills them in a grid like method and then predicts the largest cavity to be the ligand_binding searching for pattern similarity sequence spatial or orientation patterns of pocket forming residues is an alternative approach which is generally faster since no energy calculations are required molecular_mechanics approaches or other energy based_algorithms are also used as exemplified by the program ef site a third class of algorithm analyses the chemical_composition of the protein assigning interface propensities to indicate how frequently particular residues appear in binding_sites b we present an algorithm surface triplet propensities stp which is based on a score table giving the propensities of atom types of surface_atoms that appear in ligand_binding we have compared the performance of stp with that of q sitefinder and the method proposed by and have shown that stp is able to predict the known binding_sites of of the proteins under study as one of the top three predictions
