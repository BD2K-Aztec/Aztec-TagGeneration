data_and cnamet an r package for integrating copy_number methylation and expression data gene_copy and dna_methylation alterations are key_regulators of gene_expression in cancer accordingly genes that show simultaneous methylation copy_number and expression alterations are likely to have a key role in tumor_progression we have implemented a novel software_package cnamet for integrative_analysis of high_throughput copy_number dna_methylation and gene_expression data to demonstrate the utility of cnamet we use copy_number dna_methylation and gene_expression data from glioblastoma_multiforme and ovarian_cancer primary tumor_samples our results reveal a synergistic_effect of dna_methylation and copy_number on gene_expression for several known oncogenes as well as novel candidate oncogenes genomic_instability is a hallmark of cancer and characterization of copy_number changes in tumors has lead to identification of a number of genes that contribute to tumor_progression and drug response in addition to copy_number dna_methylation of cpg islands regulates gene_expression in cancers copy_number methylation patterns and gene_expression can be measured genome_scale with microarrays which enables integration of these data and further identification of genes that are crucial to cancer_progression when integrating copy_number and expression data the major_goal is to identify genes that are both amplified and upregulated or deleted and downregulated gene upregulation can also be due to hypomethylation decrease in methylation of cytosine and adenosine residues in dna and downregulation due to hypermethylation as both copy_number and methylation changes may affect gene_regulation integration of these data should result in improved characterization of genes essential in cancer_progression to whom correspondence should be addressed we introduce an r package cnamet that integrates highthroughput copy_number methylation and expression data our primary goal is to identify genes that are amplified hypomethylated and upregulated or deleted hypermethylated and downregulated though all combinations between copy_number methylation and expression levels are calculated to our knowledge cnamet is the first software_package for copy_number methylation and expression integration to demonstrate the utility of cnamet we analyze copy_number methylation and expression data from patients with glioblastoma_multiforme gbm which is the most aggressive type of brain cancer as well as ovarian_cancer ov patients the cancer_genome research our analysis of the gbm data using cnamet resulted in four lists of genes supplementary_file in the hypomethylation and amplification analysis the top scoring six genes p included mdm egfr and pdgfra that are well known oncogenes we also compared cnamet to anova and our results indicate that cnamet identifies more oncogenes and prioritizes the resulting genes better supplementary_file based on these results we hypothesized that the effect of methylation and copy_number on expression for these genes is synergistic to test this hypothesis we grouped the samples based on their methylation and amplification status gene by gene supplementary_file of which egfr is shown in samples with hypomethylated and non amplified egfr show almost normal expression while samples with egfr amplification result in upregulated egfr strikingly samples with hypomethylated and amplified egfr exhibit a substantial upregulation of egfr expression when compared to solely amplified samples t test p this demonstrates a synergetic function of methylation and copy_number changes in egfr expression in gbm the results are similar for mdm and pdgfra supplementary_file the ability of cnamet to detect such synergetic effects is also demonstrated in an analysis of ov data supplementary files and amplification and overexpression of egfr are controversial prognostic_factors in gbm we compared the age independent survival of gbm patients with hypomethylated and amplified egfr to patients with only hypomethylated egfr patients with hypomethylated egfr had marginally better prognosis than the patients with hypomethylated and amplified egfr logrank test p supplementary_file this survival effect would have been undetected when using copy_number data only supplementary_file which illustrates the benefits of integrating methylation and copy_number data we have designed and implemented a novel and versatile method cnamet to facilitate the integration of copy_number methylation and expression data we applied cnamet to gbm and ovarian_cancer data and our results demonstrate the added value of integrating these three data_sources
