gene_expression nanostringnorm an extensible r package for the pre_processing of nanostring mrna and mirna data motivation the nanostring ncounter platform is a new and promising technology for measuring nucleic_acid abundances it has several advantages over pcr based techniques including avoidance of amplification direct sequence interrogation and digital detection for absolute_quantification these features minimize aspects of experimental_error and hold_promise for dealing with challenging experimental_conditions such as archival formalin_fixed samples however systematic inter sample technical_artifacts caused by variability in sample preservation bio molecular extraction and platform fluctuations must be removed to ensure robust data results to facilitate this process and to address_these for nanostring datasets we have written a pre_processing package called nanostringnorm in the r statistical language key features include an extensible environment for method comparison and new algorithm development integrated gene and sample diagnostics and facilitated downstream statistical_analysis the package is open_source is available through the cran package repository includes unit tests to ensure numerical accuracy and provides visual and numeric diagnostics availability http cran r project org_web nanostringnormthe nanostring ncounter platform is an emerging mediumthroughput technology for measuring mrna and mirna abundances and for assessing copy_number nanostring technology has several potential benefits relative to microarray and pcr based_technologies first its parallelized nature and small number of manual manipulations generate data faster than many pcr based_methods second the hybridization method used directly interrogates target_sequences avoiding the need for bias prone amplification steps even for low_abundance to whom correspondence should be addressed transcripts third measurement is achieved using digital detection of uniquely bar coded probes providing absolute_quantification this combination of advantages is thought to provide favorable_conditions for testing formalin_fixed ffpe_samples ffpe preparation is a standard protocol for the longterm storage of human clinical_specimens despite some positive reports the degradation of rna in ffpe_samples challenges existing mrna quantitation assays the ability to reliably process ffpe_samples would greatly_facilitate retrospective_studies accordingly there has been a dramatic_increase in the uptake of nanostring technology in our research facility in some cases it is used as a validation procedure in others as a discovery tool using candidate_genes a common rationale is the desire to exploit large clinically well annotated ffpe collections since nanostring is a new technology many details of its analysis remain_unexplored optimal methods of data pre_processing are unknown although this is well known to impact biological conclusions nanostring currently recommends pre_processing using microsoft_excel spreadsheet functions this has significant_limitations first manual_analysis is both hard to reproduce and prone to errors gene and sample name auto formatting are well known issues second macros and worksheets cannot easily be adapted to changing experimental_designs or pre_processing methods spreadsheet software lacks the sophisticated statistical_tools common in bioinformatics e g survival or mixed models third it is highly_desirable to integrate workflows in a single environment and downstream_analyses are typically performed in statistical environments fourth the quality of data pre_processing requires careful assessment with data visualizations that are difficult to automate using spreadsheets for these reasons we have developed an open_source r package called nanostringnorm to implement a reference_set of preprocessing techniques we chose the r statistical environment to allow integration with bioconductor libraries and to exploit its data visualization and statistical_tools nanostringnorm outlines a pipeline of pre_processing with multiple options at each stage and provides a framework for method development and comparison by standardizing code and automating error capture nanostringnorm will enable more reproducible and robust analysis of nanostring datasets
