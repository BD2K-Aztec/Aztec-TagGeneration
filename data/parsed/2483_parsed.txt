sequence_analysis insect a web_server for genome_wide cis_regulatory prediction insect is a user_friendly web_server to predict the occurrence of cis_regulatory crms which control gene_expression here we present a new release of insect which includes several new features such as whole genome_analysis nucleosome_occupancy predictions and which provides additional links to third_party functional tools that complement user capabilities crm analysis and hypothesis construction improvements in the core implementation have led to a faster and more efficient tool in addition this new release introduces a new interface designed for a more integrative and dynamic user experience availability_and http bioinformatics ibioba mpsp conicet gov ar insect the complexity of multicellular_organisms is principally a product of the intricate regulatory_networks through which they control cell expression in a range of spatiotemporal conditions the high_specificity required for gene_expression regulation is acquired mainly through the physical_interaction of many transcription_factors tfs that bind to groups of cis dna elements transcription_factor tfbss in a coordinated manner these elements are often located close to each other and follow specific and highly_conserved patterns generally known as cis_regulatory crms mathematical_models of many tfbss have been obtained and incorporated into publicly_available databases these models usually represented as position_weight pwms can be used to predict new instances of regulatory_sites over specific sets of sequences however the major_obstacle for prediction of tfbss when aligning pwms to gene regulatory_sequences is the vast amount of artifactual findings due to random and non functional sites with high pwm scores i e false_positives insect first version was presented as a crm detector that outperforms most of the available tools with similar characteristics in terms of sensitivity_and by the implementation of several strategies to lower the rate of false_positives the main advantage of our method is a more realistic semantic representation of crms structures insect offers several features that allow users to easily extract information related to the genes of interest from the ensembl annotations and other third_party tools such as the ucsc_genome the tool interface minimizes usage complexity allowing a highly integrative_analysis to be performed insect is significantly_faster than its previous version allowing for genome_wide analysis new third_party tools have been included to help in the processes of further analysis and finding of crms which can maximize the likelihood of representing true regulatory_elements insect is a new online tool of great value to every researcher interested to predict the occurrence of crms at genome level and over long lists of genes with no requirement to install prior infrastructure v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup cominsect is a powerful_tool for researchers requiring search and analysis capabilities for potential crms presence at a genomic_scale this new release has added several features to help users further explore predicted crms based on the biological aspects of genome_structure the implementation of search filters reduces the search_space to specific sets of genes of interest minimizing the rate of false_positives new visualizations and statistical histograms of the global results have also been included by linking the genes with predicted crms to additional third_party resources such as the ucsc_genome genemania or ensembl regulation the powerful functionalities of its interface make insect a unique integrative platform for crms prediction the combined feature_set allows users to exploit crms information that otherwise may remain hidden in huge tables or that would require programming data_gathering or computational skills which would be barriers for non specialized users
