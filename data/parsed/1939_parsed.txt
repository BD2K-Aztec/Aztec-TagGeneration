gboost a gpu based tool for detecting gene_gene in genome_wide case_control motivation collecting millions of genetic_variations is feasible with the advanced genotyping technology with a huge amount of genetic_variations data in hand developing_efficient algorithms to carry out the genegene_interaction analysis in a timely_manner has become one of the key_problems in genome_wide gwas boolean operation based screening and testing boost a recent work in gwas completes genegene_interaction analysis in days on a desktop computer compared with central_processing units cpus graphic processing units gpus are highly_parallel hardware and provide massive computing_resources we are therefore motivated to use gpus to further speed up the analysis of genegene_interactions results we implement the boost method based on a gpu framework and name it gboost gboost achieves a fold speedup compared with boost it completes the analysis of wellcome_trust type_diabetes wtccc t d genome data within h on a desktop computer equipped with nvidia geforce gtx display card availability gboost code is available at http bioinformatics ust hk boost htmlgboost interaction_patterns of single_nucleotide snp can be used to interpret genetic disease risks in individuals with the advances of technologies the burden of collecting genome_wide dna sequence_variations has been lifted the burst of genotype data leads to an urge of efficient algorithms to analyze many genome_wide gwas data in a reasonable period of time a comprehensive_review summarized some popular_methods in detecting genegene_interactions plink was recommended as the most computationally feasible_method for detecting genegene_interactions in genome_wide data it was reported that plink finished the pairwise interaction examination of snps selected from the wtccc crohn_disease dataset with samples in days to whom correspondence should be addressed recently proposed a fast method named boost to examine all pairwise interactions in genome_wide casecontrol_studies boost completed the pairwise interaction analysis of human_genome data with snps and samples on a computer with ghz central_processing cpu and gb_memory in h however we can foresee that the growth of data will overwhelm boost in the near future suggested that the analysis time in gwas can be largely reduced by parallel_computing the development of graphical processing units gpus enables modern display cards to have hundreds of cores providing a high memory bandwidth at a low price a recent gpu_implementation of the multifactor_dimensionality mdr method has significantly_reduced the time required for detecting genegene_interactions the demand of massive memory operations in collecting contingency_tables and independence of analyzing different snp_pairs in boost make it suitable to implement boost in gpu here we propose gboost a gpu_implementation of boost gboost is able to finish the genome_wide interaction analysis of a typical dataset on a single workstation within a few hours
