structural_bioinformatics pconsd ultra_rapid accurate model_quality for protein_structure clustering_methods are often needed for accurately assessing the quality of modeled protein_structures recent blind evaluation of quality_assessment methods in casp showed that there is little difference between many different methods as far as ranking models and selecting best model are concerned when comparing many models the computational_cost of the model comparison can become significant here we present pconsd a fast stream computing method for distance driven model_quality that runs on consumer hardware pconsd is at least one order of magnitude faster than other methods of comparable accuracy availability the source_code for pconsd is freely_available atpredicting the d structure of protein from its sequence remains one of the yet unsolved_problems of molecular_biology recent improvements in the field allow for constructing more accurate_models of protein_structures be it through relying on homologous structures folding proteins ab_initio or by combining multiple approaches regardless of the approach chosen there is a need for a method of discriminating good native like models from the mispredicted ones this is the role of model_quality programs mqaps the most successful_approaches to mqap problem is the use of clustering_methods as introduced by the pcons method in casp they are based on the premise that among different models of the same protein the one that is most similar to the others is most likely to be correct it is widely assumed that if a sufficiently accurate model generation method is used most of the predictions will tend to cluster near the correct fold consequently the largest cluster of protein models is most likely to contain models of native like fold and cluster centroid is the most likely candidate for the most accurate structure in the ensemble most of clustering based mqaps rely on repeated pairwise structural superposition to find a largest subset of residues superimposable between models in question within a certain threshold this approach is a computationally relatively expensive process which renders clustering_approaches unfeasible for model ensembles larger than some thousand proteins an alternative to rigid superposition is comparing the inter residue distance_matrices of the models this approach has been successfully used for quality_assessment both in terms of similarity of predictions to the native_structure and predicting the quality of models authors postulate that this approach is capable of capturing the interactions relevant for protein_structure better than rigid c superposition as it accounts both for the local proximity of relevant residues distances close to each other in the sequence_space and the general fold of the protein long_range distances although avoiding the computational expense of repeated superposition distance_matrix comparison still requires m n operations for computing the distances and m n operations for their comparison when given m models of n residues each in this work we introduce pconsd a new model_quality program which uses a massively_parallel openclbased streaming approach which attempts to alleviate the scaling issues and provide an efficient platform for future development in distance driven quality_assessment pconsd has been blindly benchmarked in model_quality category of casp experiment according to casp assessors pconsd is at least as good a model classifier as other clustering mqap methods and comparable with compound methods methods combining multiple approaches to quality_assessment such as pcomb modfoldclust mufold qa both as far as distinguishing good models from bad ones and as far as selecting best model in the ensemble are concerned see pconsd selected more good models with less than two gdt ts points loss to the best model in the ensemble than pcons one of state of art clustering_methods or pcomb the best mqap in casp in terms of picking best models it also picked fewer poor models than pcons gdtts points loss to the best model in ensemble the slightly worse performance in terms of average gdt ts is due to prediction targets on which clustering did not work sufficiently well i e difficult free modeling targets pconsd seemed to be slightly less suitable for ranking models when considering the pearson_correlation with superposition based metrics such as gdt ts but it still performs better in this category than mufold qa the main strength of pconsd lies in its outstandingly short prediction time the prediction_performance and scaling have been assessed on a set of up to models gb of pdb files of pts eiia type domain from escherichia_coli pdbid a a a produced by ab_initio protocol implemented by rosetta the benchmark results show that pconsd for non trivial task sizes is at least an order of magnitude faster than pcons which is already almost two orders_of than the navenave clustering using tm_score thanks to aggressive optimization pconsd scales linearly with the amount of models until it needs to perform problem domain partitioning on which moment it starts scaling quadratically on the nvidia gtx used for testing pconsd the running time with contacts models of residues each of residues and so forth is min
