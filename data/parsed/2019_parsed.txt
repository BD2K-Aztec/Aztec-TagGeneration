genome_scale strain designs based on regulatory minimal_cut motivation stoichiometric and constraint based_methods of computational strain design have become an important tool for rational metabolic_engineering one of those relies on the concept of constrained minimal_cut cmcss however as most other techniques cmcss may consider only reaction or gene_knockouts to achieve a desired phenotype results we generalize the cmcss approach to constrained regulatory mcss cregmcss where up downregulation of reaction_rates can be combined along with reaction deletions we show that flux up downregulations can virtually be treated as cuts allowing their direct integration into the algorithmic framework of cmcss because of vastly enlarged search spaces in genome_scale networks we developed strategies to optionally preselect suitable candidates for flux regulation and novel algorithmic techniques to further enhance efficiency and speed of cmcss calculation we illustrate the cregmcss approach by a simple example network and apply it then by identifying strain designs for ethanol_production in a genome_scale model of escherichia_coli the results clearly show that cregmcss combining reaction deletions and flux regulations provide a much larger number of suitable strain designs many of which are significantly_smaller relative to cmcss involving only knockouts furthermore with cregmcss one may also enable the fine_tuning of desired behaviours in a narrower range the new cregmcss approach may thus accelerate the implementation of model based strain designs for the bio_based production of fuels and chemicals availability_and matlab_code and the examples can be downloaded atrecent advances in genome_wide characterization of cellular_systems have allowed the opportunity to catalogue a significant fraction of the metabolic_reactions in the cell these advances coupled with the development of metabolic modelling_methods have enabled the construction of detailed models for many industrially relevant microbial hosts including escherichia_coli and saccharomyces_cerevisiae in parallel the increasing price and volatility associated with petroleum based feedstocks have stimulated the use of biological_processes for renewable chemical_synthesis together these two factors further have motivated the development of computational_methods to guide the engineering of metabolism for renewable chemicals synthesis in the past several algorithms have been developed for computational strain design most of them relying on stoichiometric and constraint_based the latter includes the series of bilevel optimization algorithms such as optknock optstrain optgene optreg cosmos and optorf which have been recently reviewed in all of these methods the inner optimization_problem involves the formulation of a genome_scale model with growth_rate maximization as the objective whereas the outer optimization involves the identification of the specific deletions additions represented as binary variables that lead to the maximization of the flux to the target chemical typically duality theory is used to convert the bilevel optimization_problem into a single level mixed integer linear optimization_problem with both the primal and dual version of growth maximization linear programs another method based on mixed integer linear optimization is optforce which does not rely on a cellular objective_function and uses instead a reference flux distribution typically obtained from c labelling experiments by solving a series of mixed_integer milps optforce first identifies all reaction pairs triples quadruples etc that must be upregulated or downregulated or deleted to achieve a desired production threshold in the second stage these must sets are used to identify a minimal intervention_strategy that can lead to desired production levels hence optforce has been used to identify lower order combinations of flux changes required to obtain a desired phenotype and was recently extended to k optforce to include kinetics of a subset of metabolic_reactions finally we have previously_developed an integer free optimization approach that considers up downregulation based on successive linear_programming and was shown to be highly_efficient emilio however identifying strategies with minimal number of interventions is still a challenge model based strain designs based on optimization approaches have been experimentally_validated for lactate butanediol malonylcoa and fatty_acid production in e coli and vanillin production in s cerevisiae highlighting the value of in silico strain designs for metabolic_engineering however solutions of bilevel optimization_problems for genome_scale models for cases with more than four or so modifications are usually computationally prohibitive even more if one wants to enumerate alternate intervention_strategies other methods for computational strain design are based on pathway centric approaches which also do not involve a cellular objective_function these methods analyze and design the space of metabolic behaviours by means of elementary modes ems examples are minimal metabolic functionality smet fluxdesign and casop h dicke and however these methods cannot be applied to genome_scale networks due to the combinatorial explosion of ems in large_networks an alternative approach which in contrast to the aforementioned methods seeks to enumerate all relevant intervention_strategies is based on minimal_cut mcss mcss represent reaction gene_knockout sets eliminating all ems with undesired phenotypes e g low product yield as an extension constrained mcss cmcss were introduced to allow also the consideration of desired phenotypes to be maintained in the network h dicke and previously calculation of constrained mcss required the calculation of the ems of the metabolic_network in a pre_processing they are used to specify desired and undesired metabolic behaviours from which the resulting c mcss can then be determined h dicke and however a recent study showed the equivalence between the mcss of the primal and ems of a dual problem in principle this advance enables the direct identification of mcss using the network stoichiometry and flux capacity constraints without requiring the enumeration of all ems of the network in a pre_processing however enumeration of all mcss in large_scale networks was still infeasible due to the large number of cut sets or equivalently of ems in the dual more recently the duality approach was used to identify the smallest mcss in genome_scale as shortest ems in the dual von once the smallest mcss deleting all undesired phenotypes the latter represented by linear inequalities are identified additional inequality constraints describing the desired metabolic behaviour e g high product yield with some minimal biomass synthesis can be used to filter the valid cmcss from the calculated mcss the findings in von kamp and klamt highlighted the ability of these cmcss to identify a large number of partially novel deletion strategies that are not typically found by growth coupled bilevel optimization_problems however one of the limitations of cmcss is that they are limited to identifying only deletion modifications given the recent_advances in synthetic_biology that provide an unparalleled opportunity to manipulate and finetune expression of metabolic_enzymes in cells there is a need to consider graded regulation of metabolic reaction_rates in strain design methods consequently herein we present an extended cut set approach allowing the calculation of constrained regulatory mcss where up downregulation of metabolic reaction_rates can be combined along with reaction or gene_deletions we present a modification by which up downregulations can be treated as virtual cuts allowing their direct integration in the existing algorithmic framework of mcss as the generalized intervention_strategies may lead to vastly enlarged search spaces in genome_scale networks we developed strategies to optionally preselect suitable candidates of reactions to be considered for regulation we illustrate this approach by a small example and then by identifying strain designs that lead to ethanol_production in a genome_scale model of e coli the results clearly show that using the combined regulation and deletions allowed in constrained regulatory mcs one can find strategies that are significantly_smaller relative to the conventional cmcss involving only knockouts we also present new algorithmic techniques to enhance efficiency and speed of cut set calculations for example the currently employed two step approach in which first all mcss are enumerated in the dual before the admissible cmcss that keep desired behaviours feasible are filtered in the primal system can be integrated in one step bringing several advantages we applied the cregmcss approach i to a small illustrative network used previously in h dicke and klamt and ii to a genome_scale model of e coli iaf where we calculate intervention_strategies based on regulatory mcss for ethanol overproduction as a realistic application in this study we have generalized the mcs based framework to regulatory mcss allowing the consideration of reaction gene_knockouts and up and downregulation of reaction fluxes using a small example and a realistic strain design problem in a genome_scale network we have shown that cregmcss in comparison to cmcss involving only reaction deletions can lead to i a lower number of required modifications and ii an increased number of possible intervention_strategies for example in the case of genome_scale network of e coli using cregmcss we were able to identify several strategies with only two or three modifications and strategies that have fewer than or equal to five modifications compared with the case where the cmcss requires at least seven deletions thus our cregmcss approach increases the choices available to metabolic engineers for experimental implementation and may thus accelerate the implementation of model based strain designs for the biobased production of fuels and chemicals another advantage of cregmcss is that they enable the fine_tuning of desired behaviours in a narrower range which could not be attained by cmcss alone for example in the toy network in the cmcss involving exclusively knockouts can only redirect the complete flux to p the yield y p a is always an intermediate level of y p a cannot be attained but is possible with some suitable cregmcss although there are previously_developed methods that focus on the identification of reactions for regulation such as optreg optforce and the more recently_developed k optforce all of them involve a bilevel optimization_problem although the optforce approach shares similarities with the cregmcss approach leading to partially_overlapping results the nature of the algorithm and of the solutions produced are significantly different in contrast to optforce requiring two optimization steps cregmcss are calculated in a single stage milp algorithm and all intervention sets up to a given size can be directly enumerated in addition although optforce indicates the direction of flux change relative to the reference flux distribution it does not specify an optimal level for up downregulation furthermore cregmcss guarantee a high_level of product synthesis irrespective of the optimality of growth in the mutant_strain on the other hand optforce allows direct consideration of phenotype metabolic_flux data for the wild_type this narrower specification may help to obtain smaller because more directed intervention_strategies although gene or reaction knockouts can normally easily be implemented it will be less straightforward to achieve e g elevation of a metabolic_flux as suggested by cregmcss analysis at least for irreversible reactions overexpression or and control of the activity of associated metabolic_enzymes will be the first approach and novel tools of molecular and synthetic_biology enabling the facile regulation of metabolic_enzymes e g ribosome_binding variants for fine_tuning expression and rna devices for programming expression and other tools could provide key technologies in this context another more indirect possibility could be to enhance availability of metabolites consumed in a reaction to be upregulated nevertheless the ability to precisely upregulate a flux as predicted in the cregmcss is still challenging therefore one may select cregmcss that are not sensitive to the level of regulation additionally cregmcss could also be used as a tool for preselecting promising intervention_strategies which are then analyzed in more detail in combination with kinetic modelling frameworks such as ensemble modelling or oracle framework to eventually identify the most robust strategies in any case cregmcss analysis reveals combinations of flux constraints that will lead to fulfilment of a given intervention goal and multiple experimental solutions may exist to implement these flux constraints a potential limitation of the new method is the largely enhanced solution_space which forces cregmcss approach to focus on a subset of reactions considered for regulation in this work we used an fva based method to identify most promising candidates other methods such as emilio could be applied to identify these reactions as well in the future it would be desirable to develop algorithms that can calculate cregmcss without explicit specification of the flux levels of the regulated reactions i e the relevant flux boundaries are determined directly by the algorithm which would also help to avoid calculation of redundant cregmcs ideally the algorithm would also select the relevant reactions for regulation automatically and then determine the respective flux boundaries to obtain smallest intervention_strategies another possible extension to cregmcss would be the incorporation of kinetics in a similar manner as the recently_developed k optforce algorithm the combinatorial complexity of cregmcss calculation also guided us to further improve the cut set enumeration algorithm specifically the new approach for calculating smallest cmcss in large_scale networks directly integrates constraints of the desired phenotypes thereby avoiding preliminary mcss that will later be discarded in the e coli genome_scale network we observed that the integrated algorithm is more efficient than the standard algorithm proposed by von kamp and klamt however relative performance of the algorithms will also depend on structure and properties of the given intervention problem the sheer number of strain designs identified by cregmcss points to another important requirement namely methods for the prioritization of these strains for experimental implementation some of the results obtained in this study suggest that upregulation of certain reaction fluxes or enzyme_activities such as pdh which occur more often at multiple levels might be a more robust strategy in comparison to other designs in the future it will be valuable to screen cregmcss to prioritize strategies that guarantee robust performance however the detailed_evaluation of the impact of regulation of these reaction fluxes or strain designs in general require additional systematic evaluation for measuring the ability
