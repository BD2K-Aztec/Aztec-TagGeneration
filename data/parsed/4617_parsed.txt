gene_expression the most informative spacing test effectively discovers biologically_relevant outliers or multiple_modes in expression several outlier and subgroup identification statistics oasis have been proposed to discover transcriptomic features with outliers or multiple_modes in expression that are indicative of distinct biological_processes or subgroups here we borrow ideas from the oasis methods in the bioinformatics and statistics literature to develop the most informative spacing test mist for unsupervised detection of such transcriptomic features in an example application involving cases of pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia mist more robustly identified features that perfectly discriminate subjects according to gender or the presence of a prognostically_relevant fusion_gene than did seven other oasis methods in the analysis of rna_seq exon expression rna_seq exon junction expression and micorarray exon expression data mist was also effective at identifying features related to gender or molecular_subtype in an example application involving adult cases of acute_myeloid availability mist will be freely_available in the oasis r package atmicroarrays and next_generation can comprehensively profile the transcriptomes and or genomes of multiple tissue_samples in timely and affordable manner these technologies allow researchers to identify genomic or transcriptomic features that correlate with biologically or clinically_important traits in this way these technologies have greatly accelerated the discovery of biologically and clinically_important genes it is also possible to discover new biological_processes by identifying transcriptomic features that have outliers or multiple_modes in their expression distributions outliers or multiple_modes in the data may indicate the presence of distinct biological_processes that define clinically_meaningful subgroups thus several methods that compute outlier and subgroup identification statistics oasis have been proposed and used for this purpose the statistics and bioinformatics literature proposes several oasis methods for example nord et_al use a leaveone out loo procedure to detect rare copy_number given a set of data values for one variable loo procedures leave out one data value compute the mean and standard_deviation of the remaining data values and then compare the left out data value to those summary_statistics notes that loo is an effective method not only for detection of single outliers but also shows that loo is not an effective method for detection of multiple outliers proposes least median squares lms as a robust method to detect multiple outliers lms first identifies the narrowest interval that includes at least of the data values and then uses the center and width of this interval that captures the bulk of the data to determine_whether other data values are outliers shows that lms effectively identifies outliers even when up to of the observations are outliers unfortunately lms is not widely used as an oasis method in the genomics and bioinformatics literature thus given the success of lms in other settings there is a strong motivation to develop lms as an oasis method for analysis of transcriptomic expression data the dip test dt developed byis another potentially robust oasis method that is not widely used in the bioinformatics and genomics literature the dt evaluates the null_hypothesis that a set of data values is unimodal the dip statistic is the largest difference between the empirical distribution function edf and the unimodal distribution function udf that minimizes the maximum_difference from the edf thus a significant dip statistic indicates compelling_evidence that a particular set of data values has multiple_modes furthermore hartigan and hartigan mathematically proved that the dt has several desirable statistical_properties therefore there is a compelling reason to consider using the dt as an oasis method for the analysis of transcriptomic expression data used model_based to develop the systematic identification of bimodally expressed regions siber method that identifies bimodally expressed features in rnaseq_data siber finds maximum_likelihood mles for a two component mixture_model and then computes a bimodality index bi from those mles the bi increases with the difference between the two mles for subgroup center increases with the product of the mles for subgroup size and decreases with the sum of the two mles for variance showed that siber identified bimodally expressed features equally or more effectively than several other methods proposed in the bioinformatics literature intuitively the differences between consecutive ordered data values are very informative regarding the existence of outliers or multiple_modes pyke called these differences spacings and derived their theoretical_properties under many statistical_models pounds successfully used pykes work to accurately estimate the fraction of clonable dna therefore we use pykes theory to develop two novel oasis methods for analysis of transcriptomic expression data we evaluate the methods described above by their performance on the rna_seq and exon microarray_data for pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia amkl ofand on the rna_seq for acute_myeloid aml in the cancer_genome https tcga data nci nih gov expression features with multimodal distributions or outliers may indicate modification of biological_processes that impact disease_pathogenesis or prognosis oasis can be useful tools to discover these expression features here we adapted rousseeuws lms outlier_detection algorithm the dt of hartigan and hartigan and pykes theory of spacings into oasis analysis methods we also compared the performance of these methods to that of the widely used loo procedure and the recently_proposed siber method in two example applications in our first example involving a cohort of cases of pediatric amkl six of the eight oasis methods successfully identified glis as statistically_significant at the p level in at least one of the four datasets lms dip and siber successfully identified glis as significant at the p level in all four datasets furthermore several of the methods placed hundreds of features that perfectly discriminated subjects according to glis status or gender among their most significant findings included in the glis discriminatory features is a novel putative non coding rna_molecule that was not picked up by standard gene_expression analysis data not shown this molecule has been validated in the laboratory and the functional consequences of the transcript are being interrogated this indicates that these oasis methods can successfully discover features with expression values that are indicative of important biological_processes the results from the pediatric amkl cohort also illustrate the strengths and limitations of the oasis methods described in section mist and mast failed to identify glis as significant in the analysis of the microarray_gene because they do not attempt to compute and use estimates of intra group variability by computing and using scale estimates siber lms and dt successfully identified glis as significant at the p level however for features with adjacent point masses siber obtained very small_scale estimates and assigned a very high_level of significance these features typically have no mapped_reads in most subjects and a very small number of mapped_reads or in a few subjects intuitively such data are not compelling_evidence of potent biological differences our dataset included many features with adjacent point masses of low expression that were among sibers most significant results loo assigns the greatest significance to features with one very extreme outlier all of the most significant features by loo showed the same pattern as one extreme outlier may indicate a biologically_relevant feature such as a rare fusion_gene however an isolated event is not as interesting as a highly_prevalent and potent aberration from a population perspective thus in practice the choice of oasis method should be guided by the objective of the investigation the properties of the dataset and the strengths and limitations of the various oasis methods we also evaluated the methods in a cohort of adult cases of aml in this cohort mist most effectively identified genderrelated features and lmssst most effectively identified tsg features the term ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ini n q enables mist to most effectively_identify features with large spacings that divide the cohort into subgroups of roughly_equal size such as gender related features however the term is not as beneficial in identifying features that define subgroups that are less equally balanced in terms of their size thus lmssst more effectively identified features that define the multiple subgroups each comprising a relatively small proportion of the entire cohort of aml this suggests that future_research the use of other functions to incorporate information about subgroup size into spacingsbased analysis our results suggest that genomic_research may benefit from more rapidly considering and adopting statistical theory and methods that were developed and established before the advent of microarray and next_generation show that the performance of siber is comparable to or superior to that of many methods proposed after the advent of modern high_throughput interestingly siber is a straightforward extension of modelbased clustering which was developed by in our example the performance of other statistical_methods was comparable or superior to that of siber thus it appears that several of the oasis methods proposed in recent_years have only produced a mirage of innovation this observation supports the recommendation that research in computational_biology should shift some emphasis from development of methods to evaluation of existing_methods existing statistical theory and methods are a valuable and a largely underappreciated resource for computational_biology and genomics research oasis methods may prove useful for other applications in computational_biology and genomics research reference alignment profoundly improves the accuracy of genomic copynumber analysis of tumors however reference alignment has not yet been used in the analysis of gene_expression data because there is not a method to reliably identify reference genes also oasis methods may be used to select features for class_discovery analysis future_research the utility of oasis methods for these purposes
