systems_biology elecans an integrated model development environment for multiscale cancer systems_biology motivation computational multiscale models help cancer biologists to study the spatiotemporal_dynamics of complex_biological and to reveal the underlying mechanism of emergent properties results to facilitate the construction of such models we have developed a next generation modelling platform for cancer systems_biology termed elecans electronic cancer system it is equipped with a graphical_user based development environment for multi_scale modelling along with a software_development kit such that hierarchically complex_biological can be conveniently modelled and simulated by using the graphical_user software_development kit combination associated software accessories can also help users to perform post_processing of the simulation_data for visualiza tion and further analysis in summary elecans is a new modelling platform for cancer systems_biology and provides a convenient and flexible modelling and simulation environment that is particularly useful for those without an intensive programming background availability_and elecans its associated software accessories demo examples documentation and issues database are freely_available the development and integration of complex multiscale biological_models have been a great challenge in the area of cancer systems_biology however the lack of a user_friendly and integrative software environment has made it difficult to develop such multiscale models and derive biological_insights from them this has been a problem particularly for experimental scientists and modellers who have a limited software_development capability therefore we have developed elecans electronic cancer system a next generation modelling and simulation platform for cancer systems_biology to overcome such hurdles in multiscale modelling and simulation elecans is equipped with a rich graphical_user gui studio coupled with a powerful software_development kit sdk this gui sdk combination allows users to conveniently design the extra cellular_environment cellular_phenotypes and tissue models cell_cycle and sub cellular_components can be modelled executed and hot switched during simulations the d and d discrete or hybrid simulation environments can also be constructed in elecans lattice types can be selected from predefined ones or customized via sdk simulation_data can be exported to text or xml files which can be visualized with elecans software accessories taken together elecans helps advanced_cancer research by providing a powerful and user_friendly modelling and simulation platform for cancer systems_biology
