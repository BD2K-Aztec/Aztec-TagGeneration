gene_expression a novel significance score for gene_selection and ranking motivation when identifying differentially_expressed de genes from high_throughput gene_expression we would like to take both statistical_significance such as p value and biological_relevance such as fold_change into consideration in gene_set gsea a score that can combine fold_change and p value together is needed for better gene ranking results we defined a gene significance score value by combining expression fold_change and statistical_significance p value and explored its statistical_properties when compared to various existing_methods value based_approach is more robust in selecting de genes with the largest area_under in its receiver_operating we applied value to gsea and found it comparable to p value and t statistic based_methods with added protection against false discovery in certain situations finally in a gene functional study of breast_cancer profiles we showed that using value helps elucidating otherwise overlooked important_biological in this article we introduce a gene significance score value for robust selection of differentially_expressed de genes and demonstrate its application in gene_set gsea in developing the concept we are inspired by two facts first there is discrepancy between the statistical and biological meanings of differential_expression second a proper score is required to evaluate and rank genes in gsea it was pointed_out in mccarthy and smyth that statistically speaking genes showing systematic difference between two conditions are considered de whereas in biological term de means the difference in gene_expression is sufficiently_large in some biological_applications de genes were selected by gene expression_level change such as using fold_change as to whom correspondence should be addressed cutoff and the variability of gene_expression was not taken into account meanwhile some statistical_methods consisted of finding informative genes whose expression levels correlate with or are predictive of class_labels such as in ambroise and these approaches usually found not all de genes but a subset of de genes that distinguished sample classes to detect all de genes we usually conduct hypothesis_testing of against or the like such as methods based on expression ratio statistic distinctness by kolmogorovsmirnov distance and similarity of expression_profiles by pearsons_correlation t statistic and its variants in hypothesis_test based statistical_methods p value of the test_statistic is the basis of gene_selection as a result of which we face the following two issues bullet the small fold_change small variance sfsv issue when a genes variance is small a slight expression_level change may result in significant p value and conclusion of statistical_significance however a small expression change has questionable biological justification which frequently leads to false discovery bullet the large fold_change large variance lflv issue a gene with considerable fold_change fc may possess a large variance such as dysregulated genes in a disease condition in such a situation a large expression change may be accompanied by a non significant p value making it possible for us to miss biologically_meaningful but highly volatile changes since variance estimation is part of the issues which is often worsened by small_sample improvements were proposed to adjust estimated variance such as meanwhile methods that incorporate or improve the original fc criterion were proposed such as a better defined fc limit orpage we defined value as a gene significance score combining fc and p value and derived its distribution to identify de genes by value we can specify a significance_level and use the corresponding critical value as threshold under certain assumptions critical_values can be obtained theoretically otherwise they can be estimated from simulation as shown in the supplementary_materials one may choose ad_hoc threshold of or noting that at fold_change p translate to and the thresholds are also close to the dependent cvs at moreover the definition of value in equation implies that fold_change is a neutral position a smaller fc will penalize p value and a larger fc will boost p value as an extension to this concept if we consider n fc as a reasonable decision boundary for de genes we can adopt an alternative definition of log n log p and choose decision threshold accordingly further comparison of value p value and fc to serve as de gene selection_criteria is discussed in the supplementary_materials among various selection_criteria for identifying de genes value is the most robust we have found that bullet value performs well at the high_specificity region and its roc_curve stays above all other criteria in the region value also has the lowest fdr when the number of selected genes increases bullet overall outperforms other criteria by having the largest auc area_under of roc in the simulations value was computed based on regular t test therefore its computational_complexity is less than moderated t test treat or some other improvements to the regular t test in generalized gsea based enrichment score is also more robust than t statistic and p value based scores in the experiments we designed half of the genes in a gene_set to be de to mimic the real_world scenario we have found that bullet es has comparable detection rate of enriched_gene as es t and es p when differential_gene although it is less sensitive when bullet es has a robust high_detection when de genes in an enriched gene_set have increased variance bullet es protects against false discovery when is close to zero especially when part of the genes have low variance
