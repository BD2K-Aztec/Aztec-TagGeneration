normalization and noise_reduction for single_cell experiments a major roadblock towards accurate interpretation of single_cell is large technical noise resulted from small amount of input materials the existing_methods mainly aim to find differentially_expressed rather than directly de noise the single_cell data we present here a powerful but simple method to remove technical noise and explicitly compute the true gene_expression levels based on spike in ercc molecules single_cell is a promising technology with broad applications and discerning biological noise from technical noise is critical for correctly interpreting the data recently statistical_methods are developed to model the technical noise from spike in ercc molecules whose concentrations are presumably same across the samples and then identify differentially_expressed whose variations across samples are significantly_larger than technical noise a limit for such an approach is that the true gene expression_level is not explicitly calculated which is needed for many analyses based on quantification of transcriptions here we propose a novel strategy to normalize and de noise single_cell this method calculates rna concentrations from the sequencing_reads which is opposite to the other published_methods that model sequencing_reads from rna concentrations it is much simpler than the existing_methods but importantly it allows to remove technical noise and explicitly compute gene_expression specifically we fit a gamma regression_model grm between the sequencing_reads rpkm fpkm or tpm and the concentration of spike in ercc molecules the trained model is then used to estimate the de noised molecular concentration of the genes from the reads grm shows great power of reducing technical noise and superior_performance compared to several popular normalization_methods such as fpkm tmm and fq in analyzing single_cell we present here a simple but powerful method for removing technical noise of single_cell this method is distinct from the existing_approaches as it derives the relationship between rna concentrations and sequencing read_counts from ercc molecules and then applies this relationship to calculate gene_expression from read_counts we demonstrated the success of normalization and noise_reduction of single_cell by showing significantly_improved clustering of single cells after denoise furthermore this method is general and also applicable to bulk rna_seq with spike in erccs
