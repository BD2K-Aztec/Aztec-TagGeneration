gene_expression go bayes gene ontology_based overrepresentation analysis using a bayesian approach_motivation a typical approach for the interpretation of high_throughput experiments such as gene_expression is to produce groups of genes based on certain criteria e g genes that are differentially_expressed to gain more mechanistic_insights into the underlying biology overrepresentation analysis ora is often conducted to investigate whether gene_sets associated with particular biological_functions for example as represented by gene_ontology go annotations are statistically overrepresented in the identified gene groups however the standard ora which is based on the hypergeometric_test analyzes each go term in isolation and does not take into account the dependence_structure of the go term hierarchy results we have developed a bayesian_approach go bayes to measure overrepresentation of go terms that incorporates the go dependence_structure by taking_into evidence not only from individual go terms but also from their related terms i e parents children siblings etc the bayesian_framework borrows information across related go terms to strengthen the detection of overrepresentation signals as a result this method tends to identify sets of closely_related go terms rather than individual isolated go terms the advantage of the go bayes approach is demonstrated with a simulation_study and an application example contact in typical high_throughput experiments such as gene_expression the first step in the analysis of the results is often to produce groups of genes based on certain criteria e g genes that are differentially_expressed to gain more mechanistic_insights into the underlying biology overrepresentation analysis ora is conducted to use the knowledge of the functional characteristics of the genes to investigate whether gene_sets associated with particular biological_functions are overrepresented in the identified gene groups draghiciis the first paper to discuss the overrepresentation to whom correspondence should be addressed problem and propose different statistical_methods that can be used in this area ora is based on the postulate that if a biological_process has more identified genes than expected by chance alone that biological_process is probably linked to the experiment one of the most popular gene description databases used in ora was developed by the gene_ontology go consortium each go term annotates a set of genes indicating their known molecular_functions involvement in biological_processes and cellular_component locations go terms are structured in a directed_acyclic dag of parentchild relationship where a child indicates a more specific biological classification than its parent s based on the true path rule the annotation of a gene to a go term implies automatic_annotation to all the ancestors of that term another feature is that a go term is allowed to have more than one parent nodes a feature known as multiple inheritance for example immune_response is not only a specific form of organismal movement but also a part of defense_response furthermore some genes might be annotated by a parent go node but not by any of its children because less is known about that genes specific function for a rigorous_analysis these dependency characteristics of the go dag need to be considered when developing statistical_methods to detect overrepresentation of go annotations in ora the most commonly used statistical_test is based on the hypergeometric_distribution or its binomial approximation among others let a denote a go term or the set of genes_annotated to a with cardinality i a and let s denote the set of genes with cardinality i s based on a certain criterion i e differential_expression from a full gene_list g with cardinality i in an experiment the number of genes belonging to both s and a s a denoted by n a indicates the representation of a in s under the null_hypothesis that s and a are independent i e the go term is irrelevant to the gene_cluster n a follows a hypergeometric_distribution the p value measuring the significance of association is the tail probability of observing n a or more genes_annotated by a in s genemerge funcassociate gotree machine etc have been developed based on the hypergeometric p value detailed_review can be found in khatri and draghicidraghici the hypergeometric p value provides a straightforward measure of overrepresentation for each individual go term however the major_drawback of this approach is that it ignores the hierarchical_structure in the go dag which contains a substantial amount of information regarding the interactions among the go terms we use an artificial dag to illustrate this issue it consists of nodes a j j each denoted by a circle let g a b z denote the full list of genes and genes in s are marked in red the rectangles contain the subset of genes_annotated by each node where i a n a are listed under each rectangle includes some important features of the go dag such as multiple inheritance e g a and a have two parent nodes and that a gene might be annotated at different specific level eg gene k is annotated by a but not by any of its children a a and a note that in this example s is overrepresented in the regions under a while underrepresented in the regions under a and a we report the hypergeometric p values estimated by in blue first given i and i s go terms with the same i a n a have exactly the same hypergeometric p values for example with i a n a the p values for a and a are both based on a is more likely to be linked with s because of the stronger evidence of overrepresentation in its neighboring nodes related biological_functions using evidence only from individual terms the hypergeometric p value does not differentiate between a and a second given i and i s the hypergeometric p value has a lower limit determined by i a which is denoted as l i a specifically l i a is achieved when n a i a i e the p value reaches its lower limit when all the genes_annotated by a are in s the smaller the i a the larger the l i a for example we have l as in a and l as in a this observation suggests that if we set the threshold for the p value at l k then the hypergeometric_test could not identify any go terms with i a k in ora detecting more specific go terms which usually have a relatively smaller i a might be more desirable because they provide more detailed biological_information however the hypergeometric_test tends to identify less specific go terms because of the constraint of l i a in the most significant term selected by the p value is a a term next to the root the more specific terms that are associated with s i e a and a are considered less significant compared with a all of these issues essentially stem from the limitation of the hypergeometric_test in treating the go terms as independent entities and ignoring their interrelated structure recently some new methods have been proposed in ora lewin andpropose to group closely_related go nodes together and then compute a hypergeometric p value for each group in their approach the graphical distance between nodes in the go dag is assumed to have some quantitative biological meaning calculate the overrepresentation of a go term from leaf to root by downweighting the contribution of genes which are annotated by a child term that has been found to be significantly_enriched measure the overrepresentation of each go term relative to its parent s from root to leaf their method computes the significance of overrepresentation for a go term conditional on the representation at the parent term s the last page in this article we proposed go bayes a bayesian_approach for go based or the model has a relatively simple format with the first level as a logistic regression_model and straightforward prior specification the key innovation is that it can incorporate the dependence_structure of the go dag on a global scale the resulting measure on the association between go terms and selected genes borrows information across related go terms to strengthen the detection of overrepresentation signals we have given detailed comparison between the go bayes approach and the hypergeometric_test which is widely used in ora our analysis using an artificial dataset and a real microarray_dataset suggests that the go bayes approach can produce more biologically_meaningful than the hypergeometric_test relying on individual go terms the hypergeometric p value has a closed form which only requires the information on i i s and i a n a for each go term go bayes on the other hand does not have a closed form and it needs the information on the structure of the go dag we have developed a program in c to implement the go bayes approach for the b_cell cell_line example in the application section the b score calculations were completed in min on a mac os x ghz intel core duo processor computer the program is available upon request from s z the go bayes measure r j p j y is the posterior_probability of a go term being positively associated with s as a reviewer pointed_out r j behaves like a frequentist p value under the null_hypothesis and a frequentisttype estimator of false_discovery can be employed to assess_the currently the proposed method is based on binary outcomes membership of genes in s we are working on generalizing the go bayes approach to cases with ordinal or continuous outcomes although we have focused on the use of this approach
