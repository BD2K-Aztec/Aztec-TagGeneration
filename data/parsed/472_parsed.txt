structural_bioinformatics a reference dataset for the analyses of membrane_protein secondary_structures and transmembrane residues using circular_dichroism motivation empirical analyses of protein secondary_structures based on circular_dichroism cd and synchrotron_radiation circular_dichroism srcd spectroscopic data rely on the availability of reference datasets comprised of spectra of relevant proteins whose crystal_structures have been determined datasets comprised of only soluble_proteins have not proven suitable for analysing the spectra of membrane_proteins results a new reference dataset mp has been created containing the spectra of membrane_proteins encompassing the secondary_structure and fold space covered by all known membrane protein_structures in addition a mixed soluble and membrane_protein dataset smp has been created which includes soluble_protein spectra sp plus the mp spectra calculations of both membrane and soluble_protein secondary_structures using smp are significantly_improved with respect to those produced using soluble_protein only datasets the smp dataset also enables determination of the percentage of transmembrane residues thus enhancing the information previously obtainable from cd_spectroscopy availability_and reference dataset online at the dichroweb analysis server http dichroweb cryst bbk ac uk individual protein spectra in the protein circular_dichroism data bankcircular dichroism cd_spectroscopy is an important method in structural_biology with applications that include determination of protein secondary_structure content detection of protein_folding and unfolding protein_stability formation of macromolecular_complexes and characterisation of ligandprotein interactions synchrotron_radiation circular_dichroism srcd instruments have enhanced the technique by producing data to lower wavelengths with higher information contents and improved signal to noise levels relative to those obtained using conventional bench top instruments the use of cd as an analytical tool for protein secondary_structure analyses relies on empirical algorithms and associated spectral reference datasets derived from proteins with known structures the accuracies of such analyses are dependant upon the range of structural and spectral_characteristics of the constituent proteins in the reference dataset and how representative those proteins are of the types of structures present in the proteins being analysed most reference_databases were developed sometime ago for the analysis of soluble_proteins more recently a large reference dataset of soluble_proteins designated sp consisting of soluble_protein spectra sp with a low wavelength limit of nm achieved using an srcd instrument was created based on bioinformatics considerations it produces enhanced predictive accuracies for cd data in comparison with the previous reference datasets as a result of its extensive coverage of secondary_structure and fold space membrane_proteins make up approximately_one to onethird of the proteins encoded by the currently sequenced_genomes and they carry out important_cellular making them major targets for pharmaceutical drug_development however compared to soluble_proteins membrane_proteins are under represented in the protein_data pdb because they are difficult to crystallise and they tend to be too large for nmr_studies therefore developing other methods for their structural characterisation is important analyses of membrane_protein cd and srcd spectra using reference datasets based solely on soluble_proteins generally do not yield predictions as reliable as those for soluble_proteins it is likely that this is because membrane_proteins are embedded in environments of low dielectric_constant either detergent_micelles or lipid_vesicles which can influence the relative ground_and of the electronic_transitions of the peptide backbones relative to those in aqueous_solutions it has been suggested that the inclusion of membrane_proteins in a soluble_protein datasetpage
