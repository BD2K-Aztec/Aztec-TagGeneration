sequence_analysis fast construction of fm_index for long sequence_reads we present a new method to incrementally construct the fm_index for both short and long sequence_reads up to the size of a genome it is the first algorithm that can build the index while implicitly sorting the sequences in the reverse complement lexicographical order without a separate sorting step the implementation is among the fastest for indexing short_reads and the only one that practically works for reads of averaged kilobases in length availability_and https github com fm_index plays an important role in dna sequence_alignment de_novo and compression fast and lightweight construction of fmindex for a large dataset is the key to these applications in this context a few algorithms have been developed that substantially outperform earlier algorithms however they are only efficient for short_reads a fast and practical algorithm for long sequence_reads is still lacking this work aims to fill this gap
