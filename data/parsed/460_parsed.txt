a qualitative continuous model of cellular auxin and brassinosteroid signaling and their crosstalk motivation hormone pathway interactions are crucial in shaping plant development such as synergism between the auxin and brassinosteroid pathways in cell_elongation both hormone pathways have been characterized in detail revealing several feedback_loops the complexity of this network combined with a shortage of kinetic_data renders its quantitative analysis virtually_impossible at present results as a first step towards overcoming these obstacles we analyzed the network using a boolean logic approach to build models of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling and their interaction to compare these discrete dynamic_models across conditions we transformed them into qualitative continuous systems which predict network component states more accurately and can accommodate kinetic_data as they become available to this end we developed an extension for the squad software allowing semi_quantitative analysis of network states contrasting the developmental output depending on cell_type modulators enabled us to identify a most parsimonious model which explains initially paradoxical mutant phenotypes and revealed a novel physiological feature availability the package squadd is freely_available via the bioconductor repository atthe ontogenesis of plants is characterized by an intrinsic developmental_plasticity which reflects their capacity to adapt to environmental_conditions and is frequently conveyed by modulation of plant_hormone pathways thus plant_hormones are not only essential for various endogenous developmental programs but also for the perception of and adaptation to environmental_change several plant_hormone pathways are known and their often context specific overlapping activities suggest that they influence each other sometimes to whom correspondence should be addressed in a hierarchical sometimes in a synergistic manner auxin and brassinosteroids are among the best characterized hormones with well defined signaling_pathways and cellular effects both hormones are limiting for cell_elongation a process in which they act_synergistically because of crosstalk between their pathways a distinct feature that sets auxin apart from other plant_hormones is the fact that it can be moved through the plant body by specialized molecular_machinery this regulated and directional transport called polar_auxin pat contributes significantly to the local control of auxin action although other hormones including brassinosteroids might well be mobile within a certain range from their site of production specialized transport_systems apart from pat have not been found so_far together with auxin biosynthesis pat determines cellular auxin concentration which is translated into a transcriptional_response via the canonical auxin signaling_pathway this involves nuclear auxin receptors transport inhibitor response tir and homologs a class of scf type e ubiquitin_ligase f box proteins that are activated by binding auxin hence targeting transcriptional corepressors of the auxin indole_acetic aux_iaa family for proteasome_mediated since aux iaas inhibit the activation potential of auxin response factors arfs this releases arfs to activate transcriptional_targets of auxin_signaling through auxinresponsive promoter elements auxres importantly auxin_signaling involves a negative_feedback as aux_iaa genes are among the most prominent early auxin_signaling targets moreover auxin_signaling also affects pat because it controls the expression of several of the integral plasma_membrane auxin efflux carriers the pin formed pin proteins therefore auxin_transport and signaling are intimately_linked and local auxin activity is conveyed by their interplay the brassinosteroid pathway represents a more classic signaling paradigm where perception of the hormone at the plasma_membrane modulates the activity of nuclear targets to eventually trigger gene_expression changes brassinosteroids are perceived by integralpage
