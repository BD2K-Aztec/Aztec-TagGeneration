data_and sapfinder an r bioconductor_package for detection of variant peptides in shotgun_proteomics experiments single_nucleotide snvs located within a reading_frame can result in single amino_acid polymorphisms saps leading to alteration of the corresponding amino_acid as well as function of a protein accurate detection of saps is an important issue in proteomic_analysis at the experimental and bioinformatic level herein we present sapfinder an r software_package for detection of the variant peptides based on tandem_mass ms_ms based proteomics_data this package automates the construction of variation associated databases from public snv repositories or sample specific next_generation ngs_data and the identification of saps through database_searching post_processing and generation of html based report with visualized interface availability_and sapfinder is implemented as a bioconductor_package in r the package and the vignette can be downloaded at http bioconductor org_packages devel bioc html sapfinder html and are provided under a gpl license recent_advances ngs_technologies such as whole_genome and total rna_sequencing rna_seq have yielded large volumes of genetic_variation data genomes among these variations single_nucleotide snvs are recognized as one of the most common type of genetic_variants in human_genome the snvs that are located within protein_coding can cause the changes in the corresponding amino_acids which could result in change of protein functions and further influence particular physiological or pathological traits in individuals detection of the proteins containing and its web_based nature prevents analysis of large files and scale up herein we describe sapfinder a program that can use data from public_repositories of genetic_variants or sample specific ngs_data to automate the generation of variant containing databases and thereby enable detection of sap containing peptides the program also allows for efficient ms_ms data searching post_processing and report generation from htmlbased format to evaluate the utility of sapfinder a published dataset was processed using our pipeline ms_ms files and snvs listed in the vcf file in the dataset the mrna database and the gene_annotation file downloaded from ucsc table browser were treated as the input for sapfinder we used similar ms database_search parameters as in the original paper the canonical and variant peptides were filtered with a threshold of fdr as shown in variant peptides were identified and of them were also identified in the original study and a density_distribution plot of their e value distributions was compared in as also found in the sheynkman et_al paper the distributions reveal that there is a slight shift to higher score distributions for the variant peptides as compared with that for canonical peptides suggesting that the variant peptide_identifications as a group have a similar or lower fdr as compared with the canonical peptide_identifications the html based report can be found in supplementary data these results demonstrate the utility of sapfinder in detecting genetic_variations at the protein level
