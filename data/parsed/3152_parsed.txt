data_and multi netclust an efficient tool for finding connected clusters in multi_parametric networks multi netclust is a simple tool that allows users to extract connected clusters of data represented by different networks given in the form of matrices the tool uses user_defined threshold_values to combine the matrices and uses a straightforward memory_efficient graph algorithm to find clusters that are connected in all or in either of the networks the tool is written in c c and is available either as a form based or as a command_line based program running on linux platforms the algorithm is fast processing a network of nodes and edges takes only a few minutes on an ordinary computer finding tightly connected clusters in large_datasets is a frequent task in many areas of bioinformatics such as the analysis of protein similarity networks microarray or proteinprotein_interaction data classical clustering_algorithms have difficulties in handling large_datasets used in bioinformatics owing to high_demands on computer resources fast heuristic_algorithms have been developed for specific tasks e g blastclust ftp ftp ncbi nih gov blast documents blastclust html from the ncbiblast package tribe mcl or the cd_hit can delineate protein or gene_families in a large network of sequence_similarities e g blast e values however there are no apparent tools that could efficiently handle large multiple_networks such as those necessary to group proteins using more than one similarity criterion e g based on sequence structure or function we developed an efficient semi_supervised tool that takes the users empirical knowledge of cutoff_values into account below which interactions or similarities can be neglected to combine multiple data networks using an averaging or kernel fusion method to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as thick and thin edges correspond to distinct similarity data a dotted lines denote edges that are below the respective threshold and hence can be omitted from the networks two different aggregation rules are implemented the weighted arithmetic averaging sum rule gives clusters that are connected within either of the two networks b the weighted geometric averaging product rule gives clusters that are connected within both networks c m ij denotes the value assigned to the edges w is the weighting factor alpha of the two matrices hence n and m mix refers to the aggregated matrix the resulting combined network can then be queried for connected components clusters using an efficient implementation of the union find algorithm the clusters correspond to groups of nodes that are connected either by any or by all of the constituent networks depending on the aggregation rule used and c respectively to adapt this method to large heterogeneous datasets we combined the thresholding aggregation as well as the connected component search into a single memory and time efficient tool multi netclust multi netclust is not a new clustering method but an optimized implementation of existing graph algorithms suitable for handling large_networks of nodes and edges
