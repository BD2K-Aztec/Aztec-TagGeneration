systems_biology srv an open_source toolbox to accelerate the recovery of metabolic biomarkers and correlations from metabolic phenotyping datasets motivation supervised multivariate statistical_analyses are often required to analyze the high_density spectral_information in metabolic datasets acquired from complex_mixtures in metabolic phenotyping studies here we present an implementation of the srvstatistical recoupling of variablesalgorithm as an open_source matlab and gnu octave toolbox srv allows the identification of similarity between consecutive variables resulting from the high_resolution buck eting similar variables are gathered to restore the spectral dependency within the datasets and identify metabolic nmr signals the correlation and significance of these new nmr variables for a given effect under study can then be measured and represented on a loading plot to allow a visual and efficient identification of candidate_biomarkers further on correlations between these candidate bio markers can be visualized on a two_dimensional pseudospectrum representing a correlation map helping to understand the modifications of the underlying metabolic_network availability srv toolbox is encoded in matlab r a mathworks natick ma and in gnu octave it is available free of charge at http www prabi fr redmine projects srv repository with a tutorial given the complexity of metabolic samples used in metabonomics to understand the metabolic_response of an organism to pathophysiological stimuli the development of efficient approaches to fully analyze datasets is a growing field an nmr spectrum typically contains a few hundreds of resonances over a ppm wide chemical_shift range a high_resolution bucketing using ppm wide buckets leads to an efficient sampling of the signal matching the high_resolution of the nmr_spectra and results in a few thousands of variables to handle for further statistical_analyses multivariate statistical_analyses such as orthogonal partial_least o pls regressions are thus efficient tools to explore these high_density information datasets and combine collective modifications of metabolite_concentrations to allow a discrimination of the samples with respect to the effect under study however the interpretation of the latent_variables which are the results of multivariate statistical_analyses is far from trivial the mainly used approach is to combine the representation of the latent_variable with the pearson_correlation of each variable with the information matrix encoding the different classes the difficulty with this approach is that multiple buckets represent a single nmr peak it thus shows different levels of correlation despite the fact that it represents a single metabolic signal a second difficulty is the definition of a correlation threshold above which a signal can be considered as valuable to designate a candidate biomarker statistical recoupling of variables srv is an algorithm designed to overthrow these main difficulties the conducting idea is to restore the spectral dependency that was lost by high_resolution bucketing the statistical relationships between consecutive variables allow aggregating them into clusters following the highest direction of covariance correlation ratio thus defining nmr peaks neighbouring clusters can then be merged into superclusters to recover nmr multiplets these superclusters correspond to nmr variables of interest srv thus acts as an automated variable size bucketing procedure coupled with an efficient noise removing filter we then use a significance testing filter using multiple_hypothesis corrections the benjaminiyekutieli measurement of the false_discovery seems adapted to nmr based metabonomics but other less strict corrections could be considered a typical threshold of can then be defined and a simple identification of statistically_significant signals allows the recovery of candidate_biomarkers based on the statistical total correlation_spectroscopy it is possible to establish a two_dimensional d pseudospectrum defined as a correlation map between the superclusters these correlations can eventually be interpreted on the global metabolic_network to extract the perturbed metabolic_network associated with a major or minor perturbation here we present an open_source implementation of the srv algorithm as matlab gnu octave functions leading to the visualization of the latent_variables after o pls analysis for the discrimination between two groups with the correlation and significance testing representation and the d pseudospectrum allowing the identification of coordinated metabolic variations
