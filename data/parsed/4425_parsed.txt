gene_expression statistical_significance of variables driving systematic_variation in high_dimensional motivation there are a number of well established methods such as principal_component pca for automatically capturing systematic_variation due to latent_variables in large_scale genomic_data pca and related methods may directly provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable that is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model an unsolved_problem in this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are drivers of systematic_variation captured by pca principal_components pcs and other estimates of systematic_variation are directly constructed from the genomic variables themselves making measures of statistical_significance artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over fitting results we introduce a new approach_called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically_significantly associated with any subset or linear combination of pcs the proposed method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems_encountered in genomics and can be used to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with latent_variables using simulation we demonstrate that our method attains accurate measures of statistical_significance over a range of relevant scenarios we consider yeast_cell gene_expression data and show that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell_cycle regulated with an accurate measure of statistical_significance we also analyze gene_expression data from post trauma patients allowing the gene_expression data to provide a molecularly driven phenotype using our method we find a greater enrichment for inflammatory related gene_sets compared to the original analysis that uses a clinically defined although likely imprecise phenotype the proposed method provides a useful bridge between large_scale quan tifications of systematic_variation and gene level significance analyses availability_and an r software_package calledlatent variable models play_an in understanding variation in genomic_data they are particularly useful for characterizing systematic_variation in genomic_data whose variable representation is unobserved or imprecisely known principal_component pca has proven to be an especially informative method for capturing quantitative signatures of latent_variables in genomic_data and it is in widespread use across a range of applications for example pca has been successfully_applied to uncover the systematic_variation in gene_expression estimate structure in population_genetics and account for dependence in multiple_hypothesis generally principal_components pcs can be thought of as estimates of unobserved manifestation of latent_variables they are constructed by aggregating variation across thousands or more genomic variables what is missing from this highly_successful system is a method to precisely identify which genomic variables are the statistically_significant drivers of the pcs in genomic_data which in turn identifies the genomic variables associated with the unobserved latent_variables in a typical application of pca to genomic_data all variables will have non zero loadings meaning that they all make some contribution to the construction of pcs we refer to genomic variables as the high_dimensional variables considered in a genomics study such as genes array probe_sets or genetic_loci in some cases when many or most of these contributions are forcibly set to zero similar pcs nevertheless emerge methods have been proposed to induce sparsity in the loadings for example with a lasso penalized pca or a bayesian prior methods have also been developed to consider uncertainty in pca expansions various formulations of statistical_significance have been considered previously in the context of pca these have usually been focused on scenarios where the number of observations is substantially larger than the number of variables significance is measured in terms of a completely unstructured data matrix where all variables are mutually independent or the goal is to only determine the number of significant pcs the problem we consider here differs from those scenarios our goal is not a minimal representation of a pca we would like instead to develop a strategy that accurately identifies which genomic variables are truly associated with systematic_variation of interest this can be phrased in statistical terminology as developing a significance_test for associations between genomic to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work variables and a given set subset or linear combination of pcs estimated from genomic_data we introduce a new resampling approach which we call the jackstraw to rigorously identify the genomic variables associated with pcs of interest as well as subsets and rotations of pcs of interest our approach is capable of obtaining the empirical null_distribution of association_statistics e g f statistics and applying these to the observed association_statistics between genomic_features and pcs to obtain valid statistical_significance measures succinctly new pcs are computed from a dataset with a few independently permuted variables which become tractable synthetic null variables the association_statistics between newly computed pcs and synthetic null variables serve as empirical null statistics accounting for the measurement_error and over fitting of pca as an application we consider the problem of identifying genes whose expression is cell_cycle regulated in this case there are infinitely many theoretical curves that would represent cell_cycle to the point where a standard statistical_analysis involves an unwieldy composite null_hypothesis we identify the few realized patterns of cellcycle regulated_gene through pca and we are able to directly test whether each gene is associated with these using the proposed approach as another application we analyzed observational gene_expression of blunt force trauma patients whose post trauma inflammatory_responses are difficult to be quantified using conventional_means when the clinical phenotype of interest cannot be precisely measured and modeled we may estimate it directly from genomic_data itself we identify genes driving systematic_variation in gene_expression of post trauma patients and demonstrate that our analysis is biologically richer than the original analysis pca has direct connections to independent_component ica and k_means therefore the methods we propose are likely applicable to those models as well furthermore this approach has potential generalizations to a much broader class of clustering and latent_variable methods that all seek to capture systematic_variation we evaluated the proposed method on simulated_data so that we could directly_assess its accuracy and we also applied the method to two genomic_datasets to demonstrate its utility in practice we have developed a method to accurately carry out statistical significance_tests of associations between high_dimensional variables and latent_variables which have been estimated through systematic_variation present in the observed high_dimensional variables themselves our approach is to maintain the overall systematic_variation in the high_dimensional dataset while replacing a small number of observed variables with independently permuted synthetic null variables these synthetic null variables allow us to estimate the null_distribution of the association_statistics calculated on the original data that takes_into the inherent over fitting that occurs when estimating latent_variables through methods such as pca we call this approach the jackstraw because it draws on the idea of the game of jackstraws where a player must remove a stick i e a variable from a pile of tangled sticks without disturbing the overall structure through extensive simulations we demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of accounting for over fitting and producing accurate statistical_significance measures we also demonstrated that applying conventional association testing methods to this problem artificially inflates the statistical_significance of associations an input required for the proposed method is the number of pcs r that capture systematic_variation from latent_variables determining the number of statistically_significant pcs is an active area of research and defining a number of significantpcs depends on the data_structure and the context note that setting r to be too small leads to dependence in the residuals of model this leads to the problems of dependence discussed in subsets of pcs can be considered while conditioning on other pcs in the jackstraw framework supplementary_material so it is possible to avoid setting r to be too small for example if one would like to identify variables associated with the top three pcs but is unsure whether the given data has three or four significant pcs we have found it more robust to input r which will adjust for potential systematic residual variation captured by the fourth pc we demonstrated our approach using pca it is well known that individual pcs may not be directly interpretable or may contain multiple signals of interest that the user wishes to distinguish the jackstraw method allows one to pinpoint a set of genomic variables associated with any given pc a subset of pcs a linear combination of two or more pcs the projection of a subset of pcs onto an external variable rotations of subsets of pcs and low_dimensional latent_variable estimates from other methods see_supplementary therefore this approach can be used to investigate and identify biological_signals that may manifest in a particular subspace spanned by the estimated latent_variables we do not advocate blindly applying our method to the top r pcs without considering these issues since the proposed method allows one to rigorously identify subsets of genomic variables associated with pcs it allows one to also investigate whether these subsets have any biological coherence this may be useful in investigating whether a space spanned by a subset of pcs captures relevant_biological signal or is merely reflecting technical_artifacts e g batch_effects in gene_expression data the method also improves the surrogate_variable algorithm of in that it allows a more precise determination of the control variables that are used to estimate the surrogate variables thus we have found the jackstraw to also be useful in the context of dealing with latent_variables that reflect technical effects of no biological_relevance the proposed method represents a novel resampling approach operating on variables whereas established resampling approaches such as the jackknife and the bootstrap tend to operate on observations when applying these methods systematic_variation due to latent_variables is intentionally perturbed since their purpose is typically to assess the sampling_variation of a single variable in high_dimensional we may need to preserve systematic_variation due to latent_variables which is the problem that the jackstraw addresses by accurately testing for associations between observed highdimensional variables and the systematic manifestation of latent_variables in the observed variables our proposed method allows for the automatic discovery of complex sources of variation and the genomic variables that drive them the proposed method extends pca and related methods beyond their popular applications in exploring visualizing and characterizing the systematic_variation to genomic variable level e g gene level significance analyses given the increasingly important role that nonparametric estimation of systematic_variation plays in the analysis of genomic_data the proposed method may be useful in many areas of quantitative biology using high_throughput as well as other areas of high_dimensional analysis
