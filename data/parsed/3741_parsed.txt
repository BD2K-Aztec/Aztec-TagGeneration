protein domain recurrence and order can enhance prediction of protein functions motivation burgeoning sequencing_technologies have generated massive_amounts of genomic and proteomic_data annotating the functions of proteins identified in this data has become a big and crucial problem various computational_methods have been developed to infer the protein functions based on either the sequences or domains of proteins the existing_methods however ignore the recurrence and the order of the protein_domains in this function inference results we developed two new methods to infer protein functions based on protein domain recurrence and domain order our first method drdo calculates the posterior_probability of the gene_ontology based on domain recurrence and domain order information whereas our second method drdo nb relies on the nave_bayes methodology using the same domain_architecture information our large_scale benchmark comparisons show strong improvements in the accuracy of the protein_function inference achieved by our new methods demonstrating that domain recurrence and order can provide_important for inference of protein functions availability the new models are provided as open_source programs atproteins play vital roles in biological_systems understanding their functions is one of the most important problems in biology today due to rapid advances in genomic sequencing_techniques and computational gene identification the number of explored protein_sequences has increased dramatically a number of experimental methods has been developed to predict the functions of proteins these experimental methods however cover only a limited number of experimental_conditions and have limited protein coverage in addition these methods cannot follow the exponential_increase in the number of newly_discovered protein_sequences or their variants caused by improved sequencing_technologies to whom correspondence should be addressed a number of protein databases has been compiled such as uniprot pdb and cath these databases along with controlled function vocabularies like gene_ontology go have made computational annotation of protein functions easier various computational_techniques have been applied to predict protein functions based on different features of protein_sequences such as protein functional sites and domains sequence_similarity and gene_expression a comprehensive summary of the existing techniques can be found in a number of reviews the classical_approach to the annotation of protein functions is based on sequence_similarity using blast or similar programs other variants of this classical_approach include building phylogenetic_trees to infer protein functions based on proteins from the same subfamily on the other hand machine_learning have been extensively applied to protein_function including support_vector nave_bayes nb and decision_trees to represent the go annotation hierarchy there are also significant efforts in developing protein tertiary_structure based function prediction_methods that either consider global or local structural_similarity generally it is believed that functions of a protein are carried_out via protein_domains which are proteins functional or structural_units hence it is intuitive that protein functions can be inferred from the architecture of the domains this logic has led to development of models to predict protein functions from domain information without regard to the protein amino_acid domain context information has been applied to automatic protein_function either implicitly or explicitly proposed several nave_bayes models for protein_function instead of using domains as the units in their models they selected k consecutive amino_acids i e kgrams as the units the dependency between the kgrams was modeled by the navehere we compare the drdo and drdo nb models with the fs model and several other state of the art protein_function predictors the nave_bayes model proposed inis not compared here because it is not publicly_available the results from the tests with the two datasets are discussed in this section the evaluation measurements are described in supplementary_materials the main_problem with sequence_based function predictors is that the number_of is high domain based predictors on the other hand can achieve much higher_precision therefore an ideal protein_function predictor should be able to encode both the amino_acid information and the domain information we are currently exploring how to use this sequence_information in combination with our proposed models another possible improvement to our models can be achieved by using the spatial positions of the domains with predicted or native tertiary structural_information in addition we are also trying to consider the hierarchical nature of go terms as a directed_acyclic de lima and checking the effects of considering the go terms from the mf and biological_process bp separately since they are quite different in describing functional signals inherited in domains furthermore the overlap between the predictions made by drdo and drdo nb is about as shown in supplementary it is thus possible to combine the prediction results from drdo and drdo nb to further enhance the accuracy as shown in most of the existing proteins have fewer than domains whereas the largest number of domains found so_far for a protein is less than this property enables efficient enumeration as used in our methods and other domain based predictors the main focus of this article is to demonstrate that domain recurrence and order is important for predicting protein functions previous methods showed that considering domain_architecture improves prediction over conventional sequence_similarity based_methods here we show that domain recurrence and order further enhance protein_function inference
