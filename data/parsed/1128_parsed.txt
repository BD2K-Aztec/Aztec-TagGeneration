computing graphlet signatures of network nodes and motifs in cytoscape with graphletcounter biological network_analysis can be enhanced by examining the connections between nodes and the rest of the network for this purpose we have developed graphletcounter an open_source for computing graphlet_degree signatures that can operate on its own or as a plug in to the network_analysis environment cytoscape a unique characteristic of graphletcounter is its ability to compute the graphlet signatures of network_motifs which can be specified by files generated by the motif_finding tool mfinder graphletcounter displays graphlet signatures for visual_inspection within cytoscape and can output graphlet data for integration with larger workflows availability_and graphletcounter is implemented_in it can be downloaded from the cytoscape_plugin repository and is also available at http sonmezsysbio org software advances in systems_biology and in particular the identification and analysis of network_motifs have provided many insights into the structure and function of complex biological_networks motif analysis has allowed researchers to identify common recurring groupings of nodes and connections and study of the motifs identified has explained the function of motifs as components of a network for example a feed_forward loop ffl acts as a sign sensitive delay element however it would also be helpful to be able to see how the motif components are connected to the rest of the network if an ffl has a different pattern of connections to the rest of the network than would be expected by chance study of these connections might provide further insight into the functional role of the motif and how it is integrated into the architecture of the network further different types of biological_networks may have different motif connection patterns yielding information about their higher_level architectures prulj recently_introduced graphlets as a tool for examining local structures within large_networks graphlets are small induced subgraphs of a network graph by counting the number of times that a node in a network participates in each possible type of graphlet composed of up to some fixed number of nodes one can create a vector for that node describing its local connections to whom correspondence should be addressed to the rest of the network called a graphlet signature in addition to computing the number of graphlets that a node belongs to one can count the number of times it appears in a topologically distinct position in each graphlet known as an automorphism orbit these counts can be combined across nodes into a measure that describes the entire network so that it can be compared to other networks or to null_models graphlet signatures can be used to predict characteristics of the biological entity represented by the node via clustering or statistical_inference algorithms for example milenkovicmilenkovic and prulj used them to predict the function of uncharacterized nodes in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks they have also been used to identify cancer_genes graphcrunch is a software_package that uses graphlets to compare networks to random networks from various null_models and is very useful for network comparison we believe that graphlets have great_potential as a tool for analyzing biological_networks and could be used to provide insight into the ways in which motifs are integrated into the higher_level structures of networks in addition we think graphlet data could be useful in the context of exploratory network_visualization environments to this end we have developed graphletcounter a tool for collecting graphlet signatures of nodes and motifs in biological_networks in addition to running as a stand alone utility graphletcounter runs as a plugin for the cytoscape network_visualization system allowing the exploration of graphlet signature data in a visual_environment the software is open_source and freely_available
