database and ontologies brain biomedical knowledge manipulation brain is a java software library facilitating the manipulation and creation of ontologies and knowledge bases represented with the web_ontology owl availability_and the java source_code and the library are freely_available at https github com loopasam brain and on the maven central repository groupid uk ac ebi brain the documentation is available at https github com loopasam brain wiki knowledge bases a concept from computer science krotzschkrotzsch et_al for an introduction could be a solution to improve the interoperability and the value of the large amount of biomedical information available online at the time of writing a few options are available to handle such knowledge bases complex libraries as the web_ontology owl api or didactic graphical_user such as protege http protege stanford edu or topbraid composer http www topbraidcomposer com an intermediary framework owltools http code google com p owltools provides some methods to query biomedical_ontologies but the interaction with the library is mostly done via command lines which limits the scale of projects that can be built with it brainthe java software library presented in this manuscript addresses these issues and provides a comprehensive and simplified interface dedicated to the programmatic creation and query of biomedical knowledge bases the library aims at bridging the gap between graphical_user and the owl api and is particularly useful to develop web_applications brain has a particular focus on the el profile of owl as it covers the majority of biomedical use cases and unlocks good reasoning performance and scalability brain is an open_source java_library designed to build and query biomedical knowledge bases or owl ontologies the library is centered on the el profile and designed to be suitable and scalable for biomedical knowledge representation the convenience methods provided by brain should simplify the development of biomedical knowledge bases and allow developers to increase their productivity while effectively dealing with data_integration challenges
