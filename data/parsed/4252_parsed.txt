simple neurite tracer open_source for reconstruction visualization and analysis of neuronal_processes motivation advances in techniques to sparsely label neurons unlock the potential to reconstruct connectivity from d image_stacks acquired by light_microscopy we present an application for semi_automated tracing of neurons to quickly annotate noisy datasets and construct complex neuronal topologies which we call the simple neurite tracer availability simple neurite tracer is open_source licensed under the gnu general public licence gpl and based on the public_domain image_processing software imagej the software and further documentation are available via http fiji sc simple neurite tracer as part of the package fiji and can be used on windows mac os and linux documentation and introductory screencasts are available at the same url contact as genetic techniques for imaging neurons have improved and become more widespread there has been an increasing demand for software to extract accurate and quantitative data on morphology topology and connectivity patterns from these images this process which typically involves generating a graph of points through the midlines of neurons is often known as tracing extracting path data from d image_stacks enables researchers to publish detailed information about putative connectivity to reduce image complexity and to produce summary_statistics for different neuron types when combined with image_registration neuronal paths can be analysed for variation or used to construct connectivity maps in this note we introduce the simple neurite tracer an application for precise annotation of paths from tube like structures such as neurons or blood_vessels in large image_stacks unlike many packages that analyse whole images with a single set of parameters the simple neurite tracer is an exploratory tracing system the semi_automatic approach can efficiently find the best path between points in neurons and build up complex topology the package also provides methods for measuring neuron length and volume an interface for sholl analysis and interactive d visualization in addition as part of the fiji framework the simple neurite tracer interacts with other imagej plugins for further
