ppo predictor for prokaryotic operons we present an operon predictor for prokaryotic operons ppo which can predict operons in the entire prokaryotic_genome the prediction algorithm used in ppo allows the user to select binary particle_swarm bpso a genetic_algorithm ga or some other methods introduced in the literature to predict operons the operon predictor on our web_server and the provided database are easy to access and use the main features offered are i selection of the prediction algorithm ii adjustable parameter_settings of the prediction algorithm iii graphic visualization of results iv integrated database queries v listing of experimentally_verified operons and vi related tools availability_and ppo is freely_available atan operon consists of one or more consecutive genes on the same dna_strand that share a common promoter and terminator and are therefore co transcribed into a single_strand mrna sequence genes belonging to the same operon tend to work together operon prediction can be used to infer the functions of putative proteins and also provides valuable information for drug_design and determining a proteins functions however the number of operons known to date is relatively small and experimental methods to verify operons cannot keep up with genome_sequencing in price and speed improving the operon prediction process has thus become a very important issue many operon databases have been constructed and made available regulondb and dbtbs collect experimentally_validated operons on the escherichia_coli and bacillus_subtilis genome respectively door database of prokaryotic operons and microbesonline collect and sort the predicted operons based on the method that was used to identify them odb operon database collects the operons of genomes and contains both predicted and experimentally_verified operons to whom correspondence should be addressed in this study we present a web_server called ppo predictor for prokaryotic operons which integrates a database with a predictor the ppo database collects the predicted operons of genomes and provides a search function for operons and genes furthermore ppo contains references to some literature methods and improves on their optimization algorithms thus resulting in better prediction_performance users can freely select the necessary parameters the ease of use and the data provided make it a very useful operon platform for bioinformatics_research a novel platform for operon prediction called ppo is proposed which provides a highly_reliable predictor and a database for bioinformatics_research in this platform the superior bpso and the ga method are applied to predict operons but two other methods from the literature can also be selected the used prediction algorithm biological_properties and related parameters can be freely selected the database collects information related to highly likely putative operons on prokaryotic_genomes and provides search functions for users ongoing efforts are made to enhance the algorithms properties and literature based operon data for ppo thus providing a perfect operon prediction platform for researchers
