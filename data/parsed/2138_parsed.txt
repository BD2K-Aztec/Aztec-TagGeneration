structural_bioinformatics gsatools analysis of allosteric communication and functional local motions using a structural alphabet motivation gsatools is a free software_package to analyze conform ational ensembles and to detect functional motions in proteins by means of a structural alphabet the software integrates with the widely used gromacs simulation package and can generate a range of graphical outputs three applications can be supported i investigation of the conformational variability of local structures ii detection of allosteric communication and iii identification of local_regions that are critical for global functional motions these analyses provide insights into the dynamics of proteins and allow for targeted design of functional mutants in theoretical and experimental_studies availability the c source_code of the gsatools along with a set of pre compiled binaries is freely_available under gnu_general frombiomolecular motions play_a in several biological_functions enzymatic_activity proteinprotein_interactions ligand_binding and allosteric_regulation computational_approaches such as molecular_dynamics md are now routinely used to reproduce the intrinsic dynamics of proteins but effective tools are still required to gain functional insight from the simulated_data global collective motions are often associated with biological_functions and it was demonstrated that these motions can be extracted from conformational_ensembles in a previous study we suggested a method aimed at recovering the role of local conformational changes in functional motions to this purpose we developed a structural alphabet sa a set of canonical states of fourresidue protein_fragments c atoms only describing the most probable local conformations in high_resolution protein_structures therefore the sa provides a means for the coarse_grained annotation and processing of local conformations in a string format which lends itself to a range of efficient sequence_analysis algorithms the sa has been used successfully in analyzing local changes in implicit_solvent simulations allosteric signal_transmission and conformational changes on effector binding here we present gsatools a set of sa related tools interfacing with gromacs for the analysis of conformational_ensembles gsatools is a software_package designed for the investigation of the conformational_dynamics of local structures the functional correlations between local and global motions and the mechanisms of allosteric communication
