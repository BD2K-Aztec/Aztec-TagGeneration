genome_analysis detecting two locus associations allowing for interactions in genome_wide genome_wide gwass aim to identify genetic_susceptibility to complex_diseases by assaying and analyzing hundreds of thousands of single_nucleotide snps although traditional single locus statistical_tests have identified many genetic_determinants of susceptibility those findings cannot completely explain genetic_contributions to complex_diseases marchini and coauthors demonstrated the importance of testing two locus associations allowing for interactions through a wide_range of simulation_studies however such a test is computationally_demanding as we need to test hundreds of billions of snp_pairs in gwas here we provide a method to address this computational_burden for dichotomous phenotypes results we have applied our method on nine datasets from gwas including the aged related macular_degeneration amd dataset the parkinsons disease dataset and seven datasets from the wellcome_trust wtccc our method has discovered many associations that were not identified before the running time for the amd dataset the parkinsons disease dataset and each of seven wtccc datasets are and h on a standard ghz desktop with g memory running windows xp system our experiment results demonstrate that our method is feasible for the full scale analyses of both single and two locus associations allowing for interactions in gwas in genetics it has been well established that single_nucleotide snps are associated with a variety of diseases in the emerging genome_wide gwas the goal is to identify genetic_susceptibility through assaying and analyzing snps at the genome_wide scale while the analysis of susceptibility of individual snps has been standardized and led toin the two locus association study class i snps with a significant main effect and a significant interaction with a second snp class_ii snps with a significant main effect but without a significant interaction with any other snp class_iii snps without a significant main effect but with a significant interaction with some other snp class_iv snps with neither a significant main effect nor a significant interaction with any other snp class v a subclass of class_iv in which pairs of snps display significant associations via the combination of their main effects and their interaction effects please note that the first snp and the second snp in the definitions need not be in the same class many interesting_findings these findings cannot completely explain the genetic causes of complex_diseases consequently identifying two locus association patterns of complex_diseases has attracted more attentions in general snp association patterns in the two locus association study can be partitioned into four classes based on the different combinations of main effects and interaction effects as illustrated in current works focus on finding snps in classes i ii and iii as a result many genetic_determinants of susceptibility have been mapped two recent_reviews presented the detailed_analyses on many popular_methods including traditional single locus based statistical_tests and multi_locus analysis methods such as the ones implemented in plink multifactor_dimensionality mdr tuning relieff random jungle and beam in this section we evaluate our proposed method using both simulation_data and real_data it is also instructive to compare the empirical power of our method with some recent_approaches in beam was recommended as a very powerful one which could handle large_scale data and finish in a reasonable period of time in addition beam has been compared with mdr the stepwise_logistic and the logic regression beam outperforms all of them therefore we focus on the comparison between our method and beam using simulated_data generated from four popular epistatic models and nine real_datasets one from the amd study one from the parkinsons disease study and the other seven datasets from wtccc we also conduct the typical single locus analysis the details of our single locus analysis are provided in supplementary section and use its performance as the reference to display the improvement that the two locus association analysis can achieve to check the type_i of our method we further design a null simulation_study
