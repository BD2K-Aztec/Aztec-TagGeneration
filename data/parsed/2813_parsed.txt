sequence_analysis mate clever mendelian_inheritance aware discovery and genotyping of midsize and long indels motivation accurately predicting and genotyping indels longer than bp has remained a central challenge in next_generation ngs studies while indels of up to bp are reliably processed by standard read_aligners and the genome_analysis gatk longer indels have still resisted proper treatment also discovering and genotyping longer indels has become particularly relevant owing to the increasing attention in globally concerted projects results we present mate clever mendelian_inheritance attentive clique enumerating variant finder as an approach that accurately discovers and genotypes indels longer than bp from contemporary ngs_reads with a special focus on family data for enhanced quality of indel calls in family trios or quartets mate clever integrates statistics that reflect the laws of mendelian_inheritance mate clevers performance rates for indels longer than bp are on a par with those of the gatk for indels shorter than bp achieving up to precision overall with of calls correctly typed in predicting de_novo indels longer than bp in family contexts mate clever even raises the standards of the gatk mate clever achieves precision and recall of on indels of bp and longer versus in both categories for the gatk on indels of bp a special version of mate clever has contributed to indel discovery in particular for indels of bp the ngs twilight zone of indels in the genome of the netherlands project availability_and more than years after its introduction next_generation ngs has become standard technology read_length is steadily_increasing and so is sequencing speed at an overall still decreasing sequencing cost one of the most evident advantages of ngs over array based_approaches is that it has enabled studying genetic_variation beyond single_nucleotide snps at both a larger scale and finer resolution several large_scale projects addressing this are under way e g the the genome of the netherlands gonl which have accumulated tera scale amounts of ngs_data the goal is to discover and genotype variants in thousands of individuals at single basepair resolution and in a second step to classify them according to population_structure and phenotype such as susceptibilities for diseases for simplicity we will refer to all insertion and deletion variants as indel variants or simply indelswe are aware of the occasional clash with nomenclature for structural_variants we will refer to indel discovery as prediction of indels without predicting the zygosity status of indel alleles and to genotyping indels as determining e g computationally predicting this zygosity status motivation as one particular example of a nationwide directed effort the gonl project puts particular emphasis on drawing links between population_structure and inheritability in the frame of this project dutch individuals consisting of motherfatherchild trios monozygotic_and twin quartets have been sequenced in the analysis indels play a major rolethe obvious reason is that only ngs has made large_scale discovery of indels truly possible also for other large_scale projects the genomes_project mapping and categorizing indels is of utmost relevance however both indel discovery and genotyping technology still lag considerably behind the advances made in sequencing_technology itself existing indel discovery tools still leave much room for improvement on top of that with only very few exceptions they do not offer genotyping as an option an analysis of existing state of the art trio variant callsets e g that of the platinum genome trio issued by illumina see appendix a in the supplementary_material for more details points out that a surprisingly large fraction of indel calls violate the mendelian laws this decisively differs from snps which have been genotyped soundly and reliably in fact genotyping snps has been standard for many years since smaller indels can also be reliably handled the unified genotyper ug a tool from the genome_analysis gatk has been providing the corresponding technology we will demonstrate the gatk ug genotypes between and of indels correctly in the results section however its performance sharply drops for indels of bp and longer the reason is that one commonly runs the gatk

comfor indels longer than bp principled statistically and algorithmically sound approaches have not been described our contribution we present a novel approach mate clever mendelian_inheritance attentive cliqueenumerating variant finder for sound discovery and genotyping of indels longer than bp from ngs_reads that were generated through contemporary library protocols for old or non standard protocols we claim that we can discover and genotype indels longer than two times the standard_deviation stddev of the fragment length_distribution which amounts to on current protocols mate clever provides a novel bayesian probabilistic_framework to compute the probabilities that an indel allele is homozygous heterozygous or not present in case of a family it integrates prior probabilities that reflect the laws of mendelian_inheritance which yields enhanced_performance rates when combinedly genotyping family_members overall mate clever achieves performance rates on longer indels that are as favorable as those of the gatk ug on small_indels thus our approach considerably raises the limits of sound indel genotyping for accomplishing this we have combined the two most recent_approaches of ours clever and laser marschall and schonhuthschonhuth into a hybrid_approach that specifically targets indels longer than bp while clever has proven to be able to discover indels of bpsometimes referred to as the ngs twilight zone of indelsat highly favorable recall and precision rates laser allows us to re evaluate calls and adds split read_alignment information which leads to enhanced genotyping and high breakpoint resolution related work structural variant sv discovery tools can be divided_into four large classes of approaches for each of which we restrict ourselves to naming a few state of the art tools internal segment size also insert_size based_approaches identify groups of paired_end whose alignments exhibit abnormal internal segment lengths with respect to a background distribution that is they consider the distance between the two alignments of a read_pair called internal segment size or insert_size groups of alignment pairs with deviating distance suggest the presence of indel breakpoints in the internal segment we will refer to such alignment pairs as spanning alignments see top examples of methods using this type of signal are breakdancer variationhunter hydra pemer modil as well as our tool clever it is characteristic for these approaches to successfully predict indels longer than bp however methods that impose a hard threshold and only work on discordant reads like breakdancermax variationhunter hydra and pemer cannot detect smaller indels note that the initial breakdancer release consisted of breakdancermini and breakdancermax maintenance development of breakdancermini has been stopped and current releases only containmodil and breakdancermini can in principle detect shorter indels but the former is prohibitively slow see discussion in and the implementation of the latter is no longer maintained clever was designed to process all alignments in a short time and thus achieves good performance also for indels in the twilight zone bp for insert sizebased approaches placement of breakpoints is commonly rather little accurate split read_aligners aim at aligning_reads across the breakpoints of insertions_and when the alignment of a read end contains an indel breakpoint we refer to it as breakpointcovering alignment see bottom examples for split_read methods are pindel splazers as well as our tool laser marschall and schonhuthschonhuth split read_aligners predict breakpoints at single_base however most of them apply predominantly for indels up to bp longer indels can be challenging for split read_aligners if the alignment of split parts of reads is not properly guided coverage based_approaches aim at detecting deletions and duplications by measuring amounts of reads_mapped to locations examples are cnver and cnvnator although coverage based_approaches are the only reliable technique to predict large duplications they only work for very large_deletions and duplications de_novo methods focus on reconstructing sequences without using a reference_genome a few more wellknown examples are allpaths soapdenovo and velvet an approach that focuses exclusively on novel sequence insertions is novelseq our method mate clever falls among the so_called hybrid methods as it makes use of both insert_size signal and split_read information such hybrid methods have established a new class of approaches and have arisen in the literature only from onward examples are delly svseq and prism the only discovery method for larger indels currently available that addresses family settings is commonlaw which draws from variationhunter as a core approach commonlaw collects information on frequencies of variants that are supported by combinations of family_members in a preprocessing_step it uses this information in the form of prior weights in a combinatorial algorithm to predict variants parsimoniously although approaches that aim at genotyping indels have rarely been described there have been reliable techniques for shorter indels since examples for processing indels of length up to bp are the above_mentioned ug from the gatk and the earlier approach dindel whose core ideas initially inspired the gatk ug an option for indels from bp or longer is gasv pro which reportedly achieves sufficiently reliable classification rates on very long indels reliable pipelines for genotyping indels that are bp_long in particular in the context of family settings have not been described in the literature so_far we have described a novel combinedly insert_size and split readalignment based hybrid_approach by which to discover and genotype indels longer than bp although the gatk has set the standards for indels of size up to bp approaches for indels larger than bp had not been available here we close this gap our tool mate clever discovers and genotypes deletions larger than bp at performance rates that are on apar with those of the gatk for deletions smaller than bp in doing this mate clever also integrates statistics reflecting the laws of mendelian_inheritance for enhanced_performance rates when dealing with ancestry related contexts we focus exclusively on results for deletions here with some minor modifications however mate clever also applies for insertionsboth its core engines clever marschall and schonhuthschonhuth laser have been designed for also reliably handling insertions note that the usual limitations owing to read and fragment length do not allow to discover insertions larger than bp extrapolating clevers and lasers performance rates for insertions which largely agree with those for deletions may yield reasonable guesses on mate clevers performance on insertions still challenges remain neither the gatk nor mateclever achieves recall of future work will be concerned with raising sensitivity even further by using improved alignment scores and also by integrating elements that allow for further improved recalibration of read_alignments such as constructing local haplotypes for further results on real_data we refer the interested reader to the gonl project http www nlgenome nl where mateclever contributed to predicting indels in all trios and quartets
