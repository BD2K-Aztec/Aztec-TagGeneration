genetics_and virapops a forward simulator dedicated to rapidly evolved viral_populations daily mutability and recombination of rna_viruses result in the production of million variants all these rapid genomic changes directly_influence the functional sites of the protein its d structure or its drug resistances therefore it is important to simulate these drastic switches to determine their effects on virus populations many computer programs are able to simulate specific variations in dna genomes but are generally non adapted to rna_viruses they simulate site_specific selection_pressures but rarely pressures on covariant or on higher_order correlated sites and no at all on synthetic_lethal groups that is why we felt it important to create virapops a forward simulator that models specific rna_virus functions it was designed for computational_biologists biologists and virologists availability_and free binaries are available through a software repository at http petitjeanmichel free fr itoweb petitjean rna_viruses have different characteristics from other populations their high mutability rate times_higher than those of bacteria or eukaryotes allows the production of daily million mutations these multiple mutants under selective_pressure permit the emergence of new viral_variants several population simulators called forward are able to impose a selective_pressure on mutations cdpop nemo simupop sfs code and vortex these software solutions associate fitness to an allele and can combine several allele fitnesses unfortunately this is done by adding or multiplying individual fitness that does not fit all situations the covariation of two sites can define compensatory mutations cm the first mutation decreases the fitness of the organism and the second compensates the fitness lack of the first or synthetic_lethal sl mutations that are nonlethal when they are alone but become lethal when they are combined into a single_genome if pair of cms are treated by existing simulator sls are not in the sl case both mutations taken separately does not change the fitness of the virus it is only when they appear together that the fitness is changed then we cannot add or multiply fitness associated with each mutation or used the calculation done for cm however the synthetic lethals are used for therapy developments and viral vaccines therefore it becomes crucial to be able to simulate them in addition the higher_order correlated mutations_involving covariation of cm or sl type but with a number sites are not covered by conventional simulators software programs dedicated to viral studies are able to predict drug resistances as hivdb human_immunodeficiency database program from stanford university to store clinical data related to human_immunodeficiency hiv and hepatitis_c treatment and subtyping tools as rega to calculate their pharmacokinetics_and as simcyp or to make epidemic_model as flute but do not allow large group of mutations simulation as described earlier in the text on one hand vortex simupop sfs code and cdpop softwares dedicated to population_genetics do not take into account the essential tools to treat high mutability of rna_viruses on the other hand software more directly dedicated to virus handle databases related to drugs geographic spread or drug resistances simcyp rega hivdb but none of these two types of family simulator is able to handle viral_populations at high rates mutability yet it is now essential to use such tools to meet the ever greater emergence of new mutations including those related to drug resistances however under selection_pressure new genomes appear quickly and increase the difficulty of treatment developments and stable vaccine_design in addition due to high genome plasticity the protein d structure becomes plural making difficult docking work and study of the active_sites thus it is necessary to simulate an rna_virus sequence population we present in this manuscript an understandable useful and easy to use rna_virus population simulator designed to model a real situation such as virus population in a navenave or infected patient
