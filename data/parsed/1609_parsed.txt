genome_analysis erc analysis web based_inference of gene function via evolutionary_rate covariation the recent explosion of comparative_genomics data presents an unprecedented opportunity to construct gene_networks via the evolutionary_rate covariation erc signature erc is used to identify genes that experienced similar evolutionary_histories and thereby draws functional_associations between them the erc analysis website allows researchers to exploit genome_wide datasets to infer novel genes in any biological_function and to explore deep evolutionary connections between distinct_pathways and complexes the website provides five analytical_methods graphical output statistical support and access to an increasing number of taxonomic_groups genes carry out their functions in a complex network of interactions both physical and genetic these interactions have effects on gene evolution for multiple reasons first genes performing a common function will experience shared adaptive and conservative evolutionary pressures so that fluctuations in these pressures affect genes throughout the network second changes in one gene_product can affect the function of physically interacting gene_products and thereby encourage compensatory changes both effects are hypothesized to cause genes participating in a common function to experience evolutionary_rates that covary over time this signature of co functionality is quantified by the evolutionary_rate covariation erc statistic erc measures the gene by gene correlation of evolutionary_rates over a phylogeny of species allowing the extraction of genes that have experienced parallel evolutionary_histories generally erc values are significantly_elevated between genes that encode_proteins in a common complex metabolic cascade or genetic pathway and this observation extends across divergent taxonomic_groups including prokaryotes fungi insects and mammals in practical_application erc can be used to discover new functionalities via a sort of guilt by association recently erc signatures were used to expand the gene network controlling mating response in drosophila in this study erc signatures between known pathway genes and an initial pool of candidates were used to identify six new genes in the pathway a similar study used erc in yeast and drosophila to discern the functional_roles of homologous_recombination genes for human genes erc has been shown to efficiently identify causal disease genes out of chromosomal_regions or other large sets of candidate_genes these successful applications make a compelling case for public access to erc datasets so that geneticists and evolutionary_biologists may similarly infer functional_relationships between genes we have generated genome_wide erc datasets focused on three taxonomic_groups including humans and popular genetic_models the size of these datasets prohibits casual browsing and analysis and requires custom computational_tools and statistical_tests in order to be used effectively the aim of the erc analysis website is to allow users to quickly perform custom erc based inferences for specific gene_sets of interest
