characterizing molecular adaptation a hierarchical_approach to assess the selective influence of amino_acid motivation a number of methods for detecting positive_selection in protein_coding dna_sequences are based on whether each site region has a non synonymous to synonymous_substitution ratio greater than one however a site region may show a relatively large number of non synonymous mutations that conserve a particular property recent methods have proposed to consider as evidence for molecular adaptations how conserving or radically different non synonymous mutations are with respect to some key amino_acid while such methods have been useful in providing a qualitative_assessment of molecular adaptation they rely on independent statistical_analyses for each amino_acid property and typically do not properly adjust for multiple_comparisons when selection needs to be assessed at several sites results we consider a bayesian_hierarchical that allows us to jointly determine if a set of amino_acid are being conserved or radically changed while simultaneously adjusting for multiple_comparisons at the codon level we illustrate how this model can be used to characterize molecular adaptation in two datasets an alignment from six class i alleles of the human major_histocompatibility and a sperm lysin alignment from abalone species we compare the results obtained with the proposed hierarchical_models to those obtained with alternative_methods our analyses indicate that a more complete quantitative and qualitative characterization of molecular adaptation is achieved by taking_into changes in amino_acid there are a variety of tests for detecting departures from neutrality such tests could be classified into two groups those based on the distribution of allele_frequencies and or segregating sites e g and those that explicitly study patterns of polymorphisms divergence in genes_encoding proteins in this second category most methods compare non synonymous to whom correspondence should be addressed with synonymous_substitution at some level such methods usually estimate non synonymous to synonymous rates ratios to study intra_specific variation e g provide a formal comparison between intra_and specific genetic_variation e g or investigate character evolution in a phylogeny by using codon based models e g in all cases an excess of non synonymous over synonymous mutations is considered as indicative that some form of positive_selection may be taking_place if a set of assumptions is met see e g several investigators have tried to enrich the approaches listed above by considering methods that take into account changes in the physicochemical_properties of the amino_acids the rationale behind this is that a replacement between two amino_acids with similar physicochemical_characteristics may not change the phenotype in the same way that a replacement between two amino_acids that are radically different does while the value of comparing radical versus non radical changes as a formal test for positive_selection is still under discussion having a flexible framework that allows us to explore changes in amino_acid can provide useful insight in comparative_studies that aim to assess the effect of positive_selection among the methods that take into account amino_acid are those inthat use calculations of expected random distributions of possible amino_acid changes based on fixed differences between residues given a particular property a related approach is that of which tests significant_deviations of the mean physicochemical distance from the random expectation along a lineage or across a subtree the idea is to detect significant_deviations from a process consistent with neutrality for instance a trend toward radical changes in a particular property is in principle inconsistent with neutrality more recent methods also include those inwhich consider codon_substitution that incorporate changes in physicochemical_properties these methods proceed by partitioning the codons on the basis of a specific property and then categorize substitutions as property conserving or property altering depending on whether there is a change in the partition the methods listed above have been very useful in providing a qualitative_assessment of changes in amino_acid that may be indicative of selection acting on the divergencepage we present a bayesian_hierarchical regression_model that allows us to detect radical amino_acid changes that could facilitate the identification of adaptations by quantifying the magnitude of changes in amino_acid the model is flexible with the following main features i it provides global results i e point_estimates and associated uncertainties of the posterior_probabilities of the proportions of sites that are neutral highly_conserved page
