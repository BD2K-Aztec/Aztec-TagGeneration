structural_bioinformatics kotai antibody builder automated high_resolution structural_modeling of antibodies motivation kotai antibody builder is a web_service for tertiary structural_modeling of antibody variable_regions it consists of three main steps hybrid template selection by sequence_alignment and canonical rules d rendering of alignments and cdr h loop modeling for the last step in addition to rule_based heuristics used to build the initial model a refinement option is available that uses fragment assembly followed by knowledge based_scoring using targets from the second antibody modeling assessment we demonstrate that kotai antibody builder generates models with an overall accuracy equal to that of the best performing semi_automated predictors using expert_knowledge availability_and kotai antibody builder is available atantibody variable_regions constitute a unique protein module that has evolved to recognize virtually any biomolecular structure with high_specificity and affinity these properties have enabled the design of antibodies for use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers and autoimmune and infectious_diseases in addition to their clinical value antibodies are extremely_important for routine assays used in basic_research computational_modeling of antibody structure is a crucial step in engineering new antibody_molecules but there are few tools available to the general public and accurately modeling loops in complementary determining regions cdrs remains_an the pigs server was validated in the first blind antibody modeling assessment however prediction of the third heavy_chain cdr cdr h remains difficult because of its structural_diversity recently the second antibody modeling assessment amaii was held ama ii was divided_into two stages in stage sequences were provided and teams were assessed on the overall accuracy of their models in stage the crystal_structures of the variable region lacking only cdr h were provided and groups were assessed on the accuracy of cdr h loop prediction in stage the joint osaka university astellas joa team achieved the lowest average root_mean rmsd for cdr h a and generated the most accurate_models for of targets in stage the joa team generated the most accurate_models with rmsds of a or less for of targets however the method used by the joa team required much manual intervention and expert_knowledge kotai antibody builder represents a fully_automated but simplified implementation of the pipeline used by the joa team to assess the accuracy of kotai antibody builder we used targets from ama ii in we show the resulting c rmsds of rank models submitted by the joa team alongside rank initial and refined models from the web_server the overall rmsd was a the refinement option was much more successful in modeling cdr h loops than the protocol used to generate initial models or by the pigs server surprisingly the cdr h accuracy for the refined loops a was equal to that of the stage joa submitted models the generation of which required careful manual_inspection there was a slight_increase a in the rmsd of the nonh cdr loops when the refinement option was used because of the fact that the other loops were not held rigid during the minimizations however we found that this slight flexibility in the non h cdrs was necessary for proper modeling of the h loops
