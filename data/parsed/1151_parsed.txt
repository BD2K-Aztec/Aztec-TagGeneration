context similarity scoring improves protein sequence_alignments in the midnight zone motivation high_quality protein sequence_alignments are essential for a number of downstream applications such as template based protein_structure in addition to the similarity_score between sequence_profile columns many current profileprofile alignment tools use extra terms that compare d structural_properties such as secondary_structure and solvent_accessibility which are predicted from short profile windows around each sequence position such scores add non redundant information by evaluating the conservation of local patterns of hydrophobicity and other amino_acid and thus exploiting correlations between profile columns results here instead of predicting and comparing known d properties we follow an agnostic approach we learn in an unsupervised fashion a set of maximally conserved patterns represented by residue sequence_profiles without the need to know the cause of the conservation of these patterns we use a maximum_likelihood approach to train a set of such profiles that can best represent patterns conserved within pairs of remotely homologs structurally aligned training profiles we include the new context score into our hmm hmm alignment_tool hhsearch and improve especially the quality of difficult alignments significantly conclusion the context similarity_score improves the quality of homology_models and other methods that depend on accurate pairwise_alignments most methods for fold_recognition and protein_structure are based on the pairwise_alignment of query and template sequence_profiles top performing structure prediction_tools add to the profile column similarity_score a secondary_structure score which improves the sensitivity for detecting remote_homologs and the quality of the resulting alignments in order to maximize the information_gain and therefore the improvements in alignment_quality various finer grained alphabets of backbone_structure states have been developedtogether with tools to predict these states in addition to secondary_structure other d structural_properties are employed to improve sequence_alignments in the so_called twilight and midnight zone such as solvent_accessibility residue coordination_numbers backbone dihedral torsion_angles d environmental fitness scores or a combination of these in allcases the discretized d structural property is predicted from a local sequence_profile window of to positions and the similarity between predicted and actual d properties of the aligned query and template positions is scored one can get independent of structural_information by comparing d predictions with d predictions surprisingly this works almost as well we believe the reason is that the conservation of a d structural property is tied to the conservation of characteristic local patterns of amino_acid and the conservation of these patterns is scored indirectly by comparing the predicted d property because the relationship of patterns to properties is many to few for example many quite different patterns are all characteristic of alpha_helix states more information might be extracted by learning and comparing conserved patterns directly independent of what actual structural_properties they are associated with two studies learned local sequence_context patterns to improve alignments train a self organizing map som to cluster local profile windows they then trained a neural_network to compute an optimum similarity_score for aligned pairs of som states improvements were small however and reported substantial improvements in alignment_quality using a non linear extension of conditional_random which include as features the local sequence_profile neighborhood here we devised a method to explicitly learn strongly conserved local patterns for training we cut out pairs of sequence_profile windows from structurally aligned homologous_proteins and learn the set of the best conserved patterns using the expectation_maximization em_algorithm with these patterns which we call context states we define a score that helps to discriminate homologous from nonhomologous positions by analyzing the conservation of patterns between the aligned positions we show that the new context similarity_score improves the quality of global and local_alignments of our pairwise_alignment tools hhsearch and hhalign and that this in turn results in better d homology_models the new context score helps most in the difficult cases i when little evolutionary_information is contained in the hmms to be aligned and ii when proteins are remotely related in the first case integrating the sparse evolutionary_information vertically within an msa leads to only little noise suppression i e the distinction of correct from incorrect alignments therefore we profit most from pulling together information horizontally along the msas in the second case it makes sense to focus on the features that are best conserved among remote_homologs which is what our context score was trained to do the new score slows down hhsearch by a factor of this precludes its use in hhblits whereas it will be unproblematic for homology_modeling and other applications where a relatively small set of proteins needs to be aligned with the best possible quality profile only ss ss str ss ctxplot fraction of
