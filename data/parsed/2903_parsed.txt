genome_analysis metainter meta_analysis of multiple_regression in genome_wide meta_analysis of summary_statistics is an essential approach to guarantee the success of genome_wide gwas application of the fixed or random_effects to single marker association tests is a standard practice more complex methods of meta_analysis involving multiple parameters have not been used frequently a gap that could be explained by the lack of a respective meta analysis_pipeline meta_analysis based on combining p values can be applied to any association test however to be powerful meta_analysis methods for high_dimensional models should incorporate additional information such as study specific properties of parameter_estimates their effect directions standard_errors and covariance_structure results we modified method for the synthesis of linear_regression slopes recently_proposed in the educational sciences to the case of multiple logistic_regression and implemented it in a meta_analysis tool called metainter the software handles models with an arbitrary number of parameters and can directly be applied to analyze the results of single snp tests global haplotype tests tests for and under gene gene or geneenvironment interaction via simulations for two single_nucleotide snp models we have shown that the proposed meta_analysis method has correct type_i moreover power estimates come close to that of the joint analysis of the entire_sample we conducted a real_data analysis of six gwas of type_diabetes available from dbgap http www ncbi nlm nih gov gap for each study a genome_wide interaction analysis of all snp_pairs was performed by logistic_regression tests the results were then meta_analyzed with metainter availability the software is freely_available and distributed under the conditions specified on http metainter the need to summarize the results of related genome_wide gwas has encouraged the rapid development of new meta analytic_methods and tools see e g meta_analysis of summary_statistics is expected to deliver new susceptibility_loci without additional genotype and phenotype data being required application of the general fixed_effects to single marker degree of freedom df association tests has become a standard practice more complex models involving multiple parameters have been used much less frequently presumably in view of power issues but also because of the absence of a respective meta analysis_pipeline the need for meta_analysis multiple parameter methods has been recognized in the field and new approaches for performing meta_analysis of rare_variant tests have recently been described in fishers combination test stouffers method or inverse normal method and stouffers method with weights are common approaches for combining p values however by design they do not take advantage of additional information available in high_dimensional models results of multiple_regression such as parameter_estimates their standard_error and covariance have rarely been used in meta_analysis owing to the complexities underlying the process of their synthesis in this context a method for the synthesis of linear_regression slopes has been proposed in the educational sciences the method has been recognized to be useful in genetic_epidemiology and has been adapted for linear_regression df geneenvironment tests in the method by involves model parameter_estimates and their correlation and provides the overall meta_analytic estimates of regression slopes together with meta_analysis p values here we elaborate the method by for multiple_logistic we introduce the analysis tool metainter which besides fishers and stouffers methods implements the method by for an arbitrary number of model_parameters thereby metainter enables meta_analysis for instance of the single marker df association test global haplotype tests and tests for and under genegene or geneenvironment interaction the synthesis of regression slopes relies on the availability of the covariance_matrix of the model_parameters because the covariance_matrix is not always provided by genetic_analysis tools we support the analysis framework presented here with an update of our own genetic_interaction to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com analysis tool intersnp to avoid the potential unavailability of the covariance_matrix we conducted a simulation_study for two single_nucleotide snp models and evaluated the data with df logistic_regression test under interaction and df logistic_regression test for interaction we show that the method for the synthesis of regression slopes msrs has correct type_i moreover its power is nearly equal to that of the analysis of the joint sample with covariate parameters indicating sub study membership furthermore we performed a real_data analysis of six gwas of type_diabetes t d available from dbgap http www ncbi nlm nih gov gap at first we conducted a genome_wide interaction analysis gwia with and df logistic_regression tests in each study and then meta_analyzed the results with metainter new methods to meta analyze genetic data are obviously of growing demand meta_analysis of summary_statistics of single marker tests applied in gwas is an established standard which however needs to be extended to more complex multiple parameter testing_strategies in context of rare_variant which typically addresses multiple parameters from a genomic_region an important improvement of p values combination methods has recently been made by the method presented there is based on the correlation_structure of single_variant test_statistics and in terms of power comes close to power of the rare_variant of the combined sample the method for the synthesis of linear_regression slopes has been applied to meta analyze the results of a linear_regression geneenvironment interaction test here we presented a general framework that enables application of msrs to meta_analysis of both linear and logistic multiple_regression in addition a test that assesses across study heterogeneity can easily be formulated within msrs framework and is a part of our implementation the method can be used to filter out signals that are driven byp fisher is p value of the fishers method p stouf is p value of the stouffers method with weights p stoufdir is p value of the stouffers method with weights and effect directions p msrs is p value of the msrs p i is p value of the sub study i in the primary analysis i p joints is p value of the regression test in the joint sample analysis p h is p value of a test of homogeneity of model_parameters across sub studies p fisher is p value of the fishers method p stouf is p value of the stouffers method with weights p stoufdir is p value of the stouffers method with weights and effect directions p msrs is p value of the msrs p i is p value of the sub study i in the primary analysis i p joints is p value of the regression test in the joint sample analysis p h is p value of a test of homogeneity of model_parameters across sub studies just a few studies alone thereby it captures the main advantage of random_effects via application to six t d gwas we could demonstrate that the implementation of msrs in metainter allows efficient computation meta_analysis of million snp_pairs analyzed in six studies took metainter min we supported the analysis by updating our intersnp tool intersnp provides now the necessary covariance_matrix of parameter_estimates in multiple_regression the implementation of msrs in metainter allows efficient meta_analysis for multiple linear_and models however the method should be used with caution if the evidence of strong dependence between predictor_variables exists the phenomenon of multicollinearity can manifest itself for example when the inverse covariance_matrix has to be computed if the model is well specified in each sub study there should be no strong multicollinearity otherwise model reduction can be useful to get around this problem for gwas with small samples and for snps with low allele_frequencies e g both or for one snp a test with fewer parameters for instance df allelic test under interaction might be a reasonable choice msrs assumes that the multicollinearity issue was checked in sub studies and that any of them is relatively free from this problem if the covariance_matrix is non invertible for a particular snp pair or snp or snp set in a sub study metainter will exclude the sub study from the meta_analysis for the respective pair msrs is an appropriate generalization of the existing techniques in the following sense in case of one parameter models the method is equivalent to the fixed_effect and in the multiple parameter case its power comes close to that of the analysis of the joint sample as we have shown in our simulation_study moreover power comparison of msrs with the fishers and the stouffers methods re emphasizes the importance of going beyond p valuebased meta_analysis for higher dimensional models
