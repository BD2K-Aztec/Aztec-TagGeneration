uncovering multiloci ordering by algebraic property of laplacian matrix and its fiedler vector motivation the loci ordering based on two point recombination fractions for a pair of loci is the most important step in constructing a reliable and fine genetic_map results using the concept from complex graph_theory here we propose a laplacian ordering approach which uncovers the loci ordering of multiloci simultaneously the algebraic property for a fiedler vector of a laplacian matrix constructed from the recombination fraction of the loci ordering for loci of barley chromosome iv loci of arabidopsis_thaliana and loci of malus domes tica together with the variable threshold uncovers their loci orders it offers an alternative yet robust approach for ordering multiloci availability_and source_code program with data_set is available as supplementary data and also in a software category of the website_http biophysics a locus is the chromosome location of a gene a genetic_marker or any specific dna_sequence and can be regarded as a point on a line the loci ordering is a linear arrangement of genes or genetic_markers in a linkage_group which is a group of genes with their loci located on the same chromosome for these genes the segregation ratio for the genotypes and phenotypes departs from the mendelian law therefore the loci ordering is the most important step in constructing a reliable and fine genetic_map the loci ordering also includes localizing a new locus a disease or a marker locus on an existing map however computational estimation of loci ordering for dense genes is rate_limiting in genetic_mapping procedures including linkage grouping or distance spacing between genes genetic_recombination is estimated by the recombination fraction which is the ratio of recombinant gametes to total gametes for homologous_recombination we expect that the greater the physical distance between two loci on a chromosome the greater the chance they will recombine let l l l n denote n loci in a linkage_group then our interest is ordering n loci to construct genomic map based on two point recombination fractions r ij i j n for a pair of loci i and j which usually ranges from to if two loci i and j are closely located i e tightly_linked then r ij is close to and if not it is away from with n loci there are n possible orderings if the orientation of the orders is ignored locus ordering searches for the best locus order among the possible orders and it amounts to evaluating the maximum_likelihood for each order with only loci for example there are possible orders and therefore the loci ordering entails a formidable computational_problem and is practically unfeasible in overcoming such difficulties the loci ordering minimizing the number of crossovers was regarded as the best ordering and thismethod has been shown to be the maximum_likelihood ordering under the full penetrance assumption i e lack of interference also several other approaches closely_related with this idea have been suggested examples for objective score functions used in other approaches are the minimum of adjacent recombination fractions criterion the maximum sum of adjacent lod_scores criterion minimum sum of the probability of double recombinants maximum_likelihood and minimum obligatory crossovers most searching procedures for optimizing those objective score functions are exhaustive and the efficient techniques for searching strategies are necessary to reduce the exhaustive searching procedures seriation and branch andbound softwares for computing genetic_maps by using various objective score functions and optimizing techniques have been developed and distributed such as mapmaker joinmap carthagene neighbour mapping mapmanger qtx record antmap mstmap madmapper here we suggest a conceptually different yet a simple laplacian ordering method for the loci ordering via the fiedler vector taking the close analogy with the recent development for characterizing complex network phenomenon in broad_areas which circumvents most of the difficulties in the previous_approaches we view that the elements of a correlation_matrix constructed from twopoint recombination fractions r ij i j n for a pair of loci i and j share a complex correlation for n loci in a linkage_group the fiedler vector from the graph_theory has been used for several graph manipulations such as partitioning linear labelling and envelope minimization recently the fiedler vector was successfully employed in clustering and classification_problem of complex networking phenomena
