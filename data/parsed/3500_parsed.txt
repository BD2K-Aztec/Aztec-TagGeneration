genetics_and performance of computational_tools in evaluating the functional impact of laboratory induced amino_acid site_directed is frequently used by scientists to investigate the functional impact of amino_acid in the laboratory over such laboratory induced mutations have been reported in the uniprot database along with the outcomes of functional_assays here we explore the performance of state of the art computational_tools condel polyphen and sift in correctly annotating the function altering potential of laboratory induced mutations from proteins we find that computational_tools are very successful in diagnosing laboratory induced mutations that elicit significant functional change in the laboratory up to accuracy but these tools consistently fail in correctly annotating laboratory induced mutations that show no functional impact in the laboratory_assays therefore the overall accuracy of computational_tools for laboratory induced mutations is much lower than that observed for the naturally_occurring human variants we tested and rejected the possibilities that the preponderance of changes to alanine and the presence of multiple base_pair mutations in the laboratory were the reasons for the observed discordance between the performance of computational_tools for natural and laboratory mutations instead we discover that the laboratory induced mutations occur predominately at the highly_conserved positions in proteins where the computational_tools have the lowest accuracy of correct prediction for variants that do not impact function neutral therefore the comparisons of experimental profiling results with those from computational predictions need to be sensitive to the evolutionary_conservation of the positions harboring the amino_acid change site_directed followed by functional_assays has enabled scientists to directly profile the functional differences among proteins that only differ by a single amino_acid through such experiments one can identify sequence domains critical for specific functions and evaluate the degree of functional change induced the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be addressed by a mutation frequently the functional_outcomes of laboratory experiments have also been compared with predictions yielded by computational_tools that annotate whether or not a single amino_acid mutation will impact protein_function if they are successful computational_tools would offer a costefficient way to prioritize variants to explore in the laboratory however investigators have reported a wide_range of success of computational_tools from perfect accuracy e g to rather poor results e g accuracy these differences might occur due to limited sample_sizes number of mutations investigated in individual studies that are focused on one protein or members of a protein_family e g the availability of information on over laboratory induced mutations provides an opportunity to measure the performance of computational_tools for accuracy in diagnosing laboratory mutations and compare them with the performance observed for a large collection of naturally_occurring human variants with and without disease implications here we report a computational_analysis of protein point_mutations from proteins investigated in a variety of functional_assays in the laboratory which are available online in the uniprot resource although a large number of computational_tools are available we focused our investigation on three tools condel which is reported to have the highest_accuracy polyphen which has widespread and long_term usage in the field and sift which is intended to guide laboratory experiments and has also been used for diagnosing protein variation for many years
