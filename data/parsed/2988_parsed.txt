sequence_analysis mircode a map of putative microrna target_sites in the long non coding transcriptome although small_non such as micrornas have well established functions in the cell long_non lncrnas have only recently started to emerge as abundant regulators of cell_physiology and their functions may be diverse a small number of studies describe interactions between small and lncrnas with lncrnas acting either as inhibitory decoys or as regulatory_targets of micrornas but such interactions are still poorly explored to facilitate the study of micrornalncrna interactions we implemented mircode a comprehensive searchable map of putative microrna target_sites across the complete gencode annotated transcriptome including lncrna genes in the current version large_scale studies in recent_years have revealed that mammalian_genomes encode thousands of long nt transcripts that lack coding capacity but are otherwise messenger_rna like these are collectively referred to as long_non lncrnas although their overall biological_importance has been debated early functional examples were discovered more than years_ago notably h and xist novel lncrnas are now being uncovered at an increasing rate with molecular_functions that include recruitment of histone modifying complexes to chromatin e g hotair and hottip and modulation of transcription and splicing by molecular_interaction with relevant_factors e g gas and malat a small number of studies describe interactions between small and lncrnas with lncrnas acting either as inhibitory decoys of micrornas or as regulatory_targets in humans mir targets an antisense transcript of the human cdr gene and mir can regulate the lncrna meg in hepatocellular_cancer although only indirectly long non coding transcripts that derive to whom correspondence should be addressed from ultra conserved_regions t ucrs have also been suggested to be microrna targets in plants the ips lncrna inhibits mir through a sponge decoy effect herpesvirus encoded rnas can bind and inhibit human_host mir and the hulc lncrna can bind and sequester mir in liver_cancer a pseudogene of the pten tumor_suppressor can compete for microrna binding with its coding counterpart and microrna inhibition by lncrnas is important during muscle_differentiation the decoy hypothesis is further supported by the observation that micrornas with many targets in the cell tend to have a diluted effect on each individual target a recent study used lentiviral small hairpin rnas to silence lncrnas at an average efficacy of demonstrating that lncrnas in general are susceptible to regulation by argonautesmall rna complexes despite frequent nuclear_localization however existing web accessible microrna target prediction databases such as pictar miranda or targetscan are focused on untranslated_region utr of coding_genes and fail to provide predictions for the long non coding transcriptome to simplify the study of micrornalncrna interactions we here describe mircode a comprehensive map of putative microrna target_sites across the gencode long non coding transcriptome lncrnas genes transcripts in the current version based on gencode v mircode is designed to be an easy to use web_based with search functionalities to aid hypothesis_generation starting from a lncrna or microrna of interest custom genome_browser views and downloadable tab_delimited files are also accessible through the mircode web_interface mircode additionally covers other gencode gene classes including pseudogenes and coding_genes both in typical utr and atypical utr and cds positions
