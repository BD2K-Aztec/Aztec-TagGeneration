pease predicting b cell epitopes utilizing antibody sequence antibody epitope_mapping is a key_step in understanding antibodyantigen recognition and is of particular interest for drug_development diagnostics and vaccine_design most computational_methods for epitope_prediction are based on properties of the antigen sequence and or structure not taking_into the antibody for which the epitope is predicted here we introduce pease a web_server predicting antibody specific epitopes utilizing the sequence of the antibody the predictions are provided both at the residue_level and as patches on the antigen structure the tradeoff between recall and precision can be tuned by the user by changing the default_parameters the results are provided as text and html files as well as a graph and can be viewed on the antigen d structure antibody ab epitopes or b cell epitopes are used in many applications such as diagnostics therapy vaccine_design and biological_research correct identification of ab epitopes is crucial for all these applications and is also required for the understanding of ab ag recognition and specificity experimental methods for mapping ab epitopes are expensive laborious and time consuming and many of them also fail to identify some of the epitopes developing an accurate computational_method for epitope_prediction has been proven to be a difficult_task most methods attempt to differentiate between epitopic and non epitopic surface_residues of the ag based on properties associated with ag sequence and or structure however it appears that almost any residue on the ag surface may become an epitope under some circumstances inspired by the success of t cell epitope prediction_methods where predictions depend on the specific major_histocompatibility molecule presenting the epitope we hypothesized that a b cell epitope should be predicted for a certain ab rather than for any ab and that the information from the ab should be utilized to enable such ab specific predictions we have shown that this approach can achieve substantially improved predictions when compared with predictions based on the ags features only several strategies that take into account the ab sequence or structure were proposed and introduced in the last few years antibody specific epitope_prediction asep is an index computed based on ab ag residue preferences used to narrow down candidate residues predicted by conventional methods bepar and abepar are sequence_based predicting ab specific epitopes based on association patterns of ab ag residues bepar and on abag preferences of individual_residues and residue pairs abepar epipred is a fully structure based method_combining geometric matching with ab ag residue preferences here we present predicting epitopes using antibody sequence pease a web_server that predicts epitopes provided an ab sequence and its cognate ag structure for a detailed_description of the pease algorithm see sela briefly for a given pair of ab sequence and ag structure all combinations of one residue from the ab complementarity_determining cdrs and one residue from the ag surface are evaluated by a machinelearning model trained on properties from ab ag complexes each such pair of residues is assigned a pair score representing the prediction that these ag and ab residues contact each other in reality a residue score for an ag surface residue is its highest pairscore where a higher score means that the residue is predicted more strongly to be in that abs epitope an optional additional step identifies surface patches on the ag which contain multiple residues with high residue scores each patch is assigned a patch score which is the average residue score of all residues in the patch that are above the cutoff score see later higher patch scores represent stronger predictions pease was successfully_applied for blindly predicting the epitopes of abs of the vaccinia_virus later confirmed experimentally by several methods including x_ray
