systems_biology biocellion accelerating computer simulation of multicellular biological system models_motivation biological system behaviors are often the outcome of complex interactions among a large number of cells and their biotic_and environment computational_biologists attempt to understand predict and manipulate biological system behavior through mathematical_modeling and computer simulation discrete agent_based in combination with high_resolution grids to model the extracellular_environment is a popular_approach for building biological system models however the computational_complexity of this approach forces computational_biologists to resort to coarser resolution approaches to simulate large biological_systems high performance parallel computers have the potential to address the computing challenge but writing efficient software for parallel computers is difficult and time consuming results we have developed biocellion a high performance software framework to solve this computing challenge using parallel computers to support a wide_range of multicellular biological system models biocellion asks users to provide their model specifics by filling the function body of pre defined model routines using biocellion modelers without parallel_computing expertise can efficiently exploit parallel computers with less effort than writing sequential programs from scratch we simulate cell_sorting microbial patterning and a bacterial system in soil aggregate as case studies availability_and biocellion runs on x compatible systems with the bit linux operating system and is freely_available for academic use visit http biocellion com for additional information cells interact with other cells by moving adhering dividing and secreting and receiving diffusible molecules as a result unicellular organisms are able to form communities with complex macroscopic structure and behavior e g biofilm while multicellular_organisms where cells can differentiate to perform different functions form tissues multicellular biological_systems respond to external_stimuli and reshape the surrounding environment complex interactions among cells and their biotic_and environment drive multicellular system behavior understanding the impact of such interactions is a critical step in our ability to predict and manipulate important biological system behaviors in the areas of energy environment and health_care computational_biologists have started to investigate multicellular biological_systems via modeling and simulation cells and their biotic_and environment constitute a biological system computational_biologists commonly model the environment by imposing a grid on the extracellular_space there are two principal approaches in modeling cells population_based modeling and discrete agent_based population_based modeling approximates the cells within any grid box by a set of variables associated with the grid box discrete agent_based maps each cell or subcellular element to a discrete simulation entity biologists have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge about cell and subcellular organelle behaviors discrete agent_based naturally translates the accumulated knowledge to a mathematical_model however the computational_complexity of discrete agent_based increases proportional to the number of discrete agents many biological_systems contain million to billion cells researchers have acknowledged the necessity of supercomputers and a proper parallel implementation to simulate millions to billions of cells within a reasonable time the lack of a proper parallel implementation forces computational_biologists to simply use a small number of cells which does not reflect the reality resort to populationbased modeling or develop a hybrid_approach that uses discrete agent_based for a fraction of the cells e g invading cancer_cells and adopts populationbased modeling for the remaining cells the most practical approach to build a high_fidelity model of important biological_systems is starting from a relatively simple model and incrementally improving the model fidelity which typically results in increases in the complexity and scale of the model for this approach to be successful we believe that an incremental increase in model_complexity and scale should require only an incremental amount of additional programming effort

limited in this regard averaging a heterogeneous_population of cells to a few variables associated with a grid box cannot model cell granularity events in the required level of detail adopting the hybrid_approach fewer and fewer cells can be modeled using the population based_approach as modelers adopt more complex mathematics to describe individual cell behaviors we designed biocellion to allow computational_biologists to use discrete agent based modelingin combination with highresolution grids to model the extracellular environmentfrom simple small_scale models to highly complex large_scale models with millions to billions of cells we aim to address the increase in computational_complexity exploiting high_performance hpc adoption of efficient algorithms careful performance tuning and exploitation of parallel computers ranging from multicore pcs to cloud computers and supercomputers parallel computers are abundant but developing_efficient software for large parallel computers is a highly demanding task and becoming even more so with new multicore processors and manycore accelerators such as intel_xeon phi and nvidia graphics_processing biological system models are diverse and even a model from a single research group changes significantly over a relatively short period this imposes a challenge in software reusability which is problematic considering the high development cost of parallel software biocellion asks users to express their model specifics by filling the function body of pre defined model routines biocellion executes and evaluates the user provided model routines in parallel using efficient solvers this approach provides biocellion users having no hpc expertise with the flexibility needed to support a variety of models and the performance required to simulate large systems we implement three different models using biocellion as case studies the following presents cell_sorting microbial patterning in communities of different yeast_strains engaging in metabolic interactions and a bacterial system in complex soil structures full source_code for the presented model implementations is included in the biocellion release and steps to port the microbial patterning model to biocellion are described in
