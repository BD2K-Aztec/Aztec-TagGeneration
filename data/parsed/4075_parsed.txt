genetics_and r qtl high_throughput multiple qtl_mapping motivation r qtl is free and powerful software for mapping and exploring quantitative_trait qtl r qtl provides a fully comprehensive range of methods for a wide_range of experimental cross types we recently added multiple qtl_mapping mqm to r qtl mqm adds higher statistical_power and disentangle the effects of multiple linked and unlinked qtl compared with many other methods mqm for r qtl adds many new features including improved handling of missing_data analysis of s of molecular traits permutation for determining significance thresholds for qtl and qtl hot_spots and visualizations for cistrans and qtl interaction effects mqm for r qtl is the first free_and implementation of mqm that is multi_platform scalable and suitable for automated procedures and large genetical genomics datasets availability r qtl is free_and multi_platform software for the statistical language r and is made available under the gplv_license r qtl can be installed from http www rqtl org r qtl queries should be directed at the mailing list see http www rqtl org list r qtl is an extensible interactive environment for the mapping of quantitative_trait qtl in experimental crosses it is implemented as an add on package for the freely_available and widely used statistical language software r r development core since its introduction r qtl has become a reference implementation with an extensive guide on qtl_mapping r qtl development is continuous with input from multiple collaborators and users we have introduced a full testing environment with regression testing updated the license to the gpl version and hosted the source_code repository on github which gives r qtl software_development high visibility and transparency the development of r qtl reflects trends in quantitative genetics in particular the use of larger datasets larger calculations and requirements for controlling the false_discovery fdr these developments are partly driven by high_throughput genetical genomicsthe name coined for the study of gene_expression qtl eqtl metabolite qtl mqtl and protein qtl pqtl mqm for r qtl is a significant addition to the qtl mappers toolbox r qtl provides the user with the most frequently used statistical_analysis methods single marker analysis interval mapping haley knott regression cim and mqm mqm has improved handling of missing_data and allows more powerful and precise detection of qtl compared with many other methods not only is this new implementation of mqm available in the statistical r environment which allows scripting for pipe lined setups but it is also highly scalable through parallelization and paves the way for high_throughput qtl_analysis with mqm r qtl is a free and high performance comprehensive qtl_mapping toolbox for the analysis of experimental_populations r qtl now includes permutation strategies for determining thresholds page
