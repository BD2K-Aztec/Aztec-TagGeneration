on the calculation of signal_transduction ability of signaling transduction pathways in intracellular communication systematic approach_motivation the major function of signal_transduction in cells is to sense signals from the environment and process the information through signaling_molecules in order to regulate the activity of transcription_factors on the molecular level the information transmitted by a small number of signal_molecules is amplified in the internal signaling_pathway through enzyme catalysis molecular modification and via the activation or inhibition of interactions however the dynamic system behavior of a signaling_pathway can be complex and despite knowledge of the pathway_components and interactions it is still a challenge to interpret the pathways behavior therefore a systematic method is proposed in this study to quantify the signal_transduction ability results based on the non linear signal_transduction system signal_transduction ability can be investigated by solving a hamilton jacobi inequality hji constrained_optimization to avoid difficulties associated with solving a complex hji constrained_optimization for signal_transduction ability the takagi sugeno fuzzy model is introduced to approximate the non linear signal_transduction system by interpolating several local linear systems so that the hji constrained_optimization can be replaced by a linear matrix inequality lmi constrained_optimization the lmi problem can then be efficiently solved for measuring signal_transduction ability finally the signal_transduction ability of two important signal_transduction was measured by the proposed method and confirmed using experimental_data which is useful for biotechnological and therapeutic_application and drug_design contact signal_transduction are one of the fastest information_processing networks they enable cells to sense and transduce extracellular signals through inter_and cellular_communication signal_transduction consist of interactions between signaling proteins where different external changes to whom correspondence should be addressed or events stimulate specific signaling_pathways typical external signal stimuli are hormones pheromones heat cold light osmotic_pressure and concentration change of substances such as k ca or camp metabolic_processes such as homeostasis the growth and differentiation of tissues through endocrine signaling the synthesis and secretion of proteins such as in blood_clotting and immune_responses and the composition of intracellular and extracellular fluids such as in the processes of photoreception and olfaction are all closely regulated by specific signaling_pathways hence the proper_function of cellular_signaling is essential for life on the molecular level signal_transduction involves the production or degradation of substances molecular modification and the activation or inhibition of chemical_reactions many previous_studies have focused on signaling_molecules cell_surface and the second messengers of the signaling_pathway aside from molecular transfer signaling_pathways can also be viewed as the information_processing and transferring systems of cells many studies have investigated the properties of signaling_pathways such as amplification specificity adaption ultrasensitivity oscillation and synchronization however due to the complex behavior of signaling_pathways knowledge of the components of a pathway and their interactions is often not enough to interpret the dynamic system behavior of the pathway to the best of our knowledge the intension to express the signal_transduction ability into mathematical formula appeared in it focused on the sensitivity amplification which is defined as the ratio of the percent change in the output response to the percent change in the input stimulus i e the relative change of the system output respect to a specific input then the mitogen_activated mapk_signaling in linear form is studied and signal amplitude is defined as the ratio of the total response to the signal duration which depends on the input next a stochastic differential model of mapk_signaling is considered and the signal_amplification is defined as signal gain which exists at least one maximum with respect to the ratio of inputs to outputs compared the signaling_pathways in biological_systems with the cascade mechanisms in electrical engineering systems and then also defined the maximal amplificationto demonstrate the procedure of our proposed measurement of the signal_transduction ability two signaling_pathway examples are described using the simulation method in order to measure the signal_transduction ability in biological_experiments it is necessary to test a multitude of input signals and then compute the ratio of the output to the input signals this process_requires numerous experiments and is not a realistic method of obtaining data therefore a method that is independent of the measurement of output and input signals which can be used to quantify the signal_transduction ability based on the system dynamic_model is required according to the concept of a system gain we proposed a new method to measure the signal_transduction ability of a signaling_pathway which is dependent only on the structure of the signaling_pathway and the kinetic_parameters of the components involved thus the signal_transduction ability can be viewed as a quantity to characterize a signaling_pathway considering the important role of the mapk and the nf b signaling_pathways in a cell an immediate and strong enough response to environmental changes or stresses is necessary the simulation_results describing a large system gain in concentration are unsurprising here we extend the concept of signal amplitude to the non linear signaling_pathway through a fuzzy modeling method compared with the linear case moreover the most of previous_studies considered the relationship between the output and the inputs on case by case basis but from the system point_of the transduction ability is a systematic characteristic of a signaling_pathway which should be invariant unless the system has been changed the value can be referred to as the best ability of the signaling_pathway to transduce input signals that is to amplify input signals however the simulated signal_transduction ability might be not achieved easily without testing all possible inputs for the least upper_bound ratio a in see supplementary that is infinite l bounded inputsignals are required to measure the transduction ability of a signaling_pathway which could be an open question the simulation_results also show that the proposed measurement method can be applied in two different ways a signaling_pathway can be viewed as a composition of several sub signaling_pathways the total signal_transduction ability of a signaling_pathway is equal to the product of the signal_transduction abilities of each of the sub signaling_pathways each sub signaling_pathway can be referred to as a basic element of the general signaling_pathway hence if the signal_transduction abilities of sub signaling_pathway are known we can design a signaling_pathway with the desired signal_transduction ability a similar concept is utilized in synthetic_biology which designate dna_sequences as the bricks to construct an artificial function in a cell it is possible through the analysis of signal_transduction ability to analyze and calculate each subsignaling pathway so that a synthetic signal_pathway can be engineered with the desired signal_transduction ability in this situation greater biological transduction insights can be obtained from the linear system viewpoint in the future characterization of signal_transduction by the proposed transduction ability measurement may be useful for biotechnological and therapeutic_applications as well as the development of drug_design
