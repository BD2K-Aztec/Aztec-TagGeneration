nonlinear dimension_reduction and clustering by minimum curvilinearity unfold neuropathic_pain and tissue embryological classes motivation nonlinear small_datasets which are characterized by low numbers of samples and very high numbers of measures occur frequently in computational_biology and pose problems in their investigation unsupervised hybrid two phase h p procedures specifically dimension_reduction dr coupled with clustering provide valuable assistance not only for unsupervised data classification but also for visualization of the patterns hidden in high_dimensional feature_space methods minimum curvilinearity mc is a principle thatfor small datasetssuggests the approximation of curvilinear sample distances in the feature_space by pair_wise distances over their minimum_spanning mst and thus avoids the introduction of any tuning parameter mc is used to design two novel forms of nonlinear machine_learning nml minimum curvilinear embedding mce for dr and minimum curvilinear affinity propagation mcap for clustering results compared with several other unsupervised and supervised algorithms mce and mcap whether individually or combined in h p overcome the limits of classical approaches high performance was attained in the visualization and classification of i pain patients proteomic measurements in peripheral_neuropathy ii human organ tissues genomic transcription_factor measurements on the basis of their embryological origin conclusion mc provides a valuable framework to estimate nonlinear distances in small_datasets its extension to large_datasets is prefigured for novel nmls classification of neuropathic_pain by proteomic profiles offers new insights for future molecular and systems_biology characterization of pain improvements in tissue embryological classification refine results obtained in an earlier study and suggest a possible reinterpretation of skin attribution as mesodermal
