j circos an interactive circos plotter circos plots are graphical outputs that display three_dimensional chromosomal interactions and fusion_transcripts however the circos plot tool is not an interactive visualization_tool but rather a figure generator for example it does not enable data to be added dynamically nor does it provide information for specific data_points interactively recently an r based circos tool rcircos has been developed to integrate circos to r but similarly rcircos can only be used to generate plots thus we have developed a circos plot tool j circos that is an interactive visualiza tion tool that can plot circos figures as well as being able to dynamically add data to the figure and providing information for specific data_points using mouse hover display and zoom in out functions j circos uses the java computer language to enable it to be used on most operating_systems windows macos linux users can input_data into j circos using flat data_formats as well as from the graphical_user gui j circos will enable biologists to better study more complex chromosomal interactions and fusion_transcripts that are otherwise difficult to visualize from next_generation data availability_and j circos and its manual are freely_available www austral ianprostatecentre org research software jcircoscircos plot has been widely used in genomics research especially in conjunction with next_generation to detect genomic_rearrangements and gene_fusions circos is a plotting tool that was developed in the perl language however there are limitations to circos some of which are inherent in perl computer language such as the complexity of installation i e many perl packages have to be installed furthermore some packages are version sensitive making_it even for bioinformaticians to install because circos plot has the difficult_task of representing the whole_genome length as a circular diagram e g billion nucleotides in the human_genome there is no way to accurately determine the genes and or loci that each line represents in the circos plot thus it is advantageous to have a circos plot with mouse hover function that provides information for specific data_points the recently_developed circlize omiccircos ggbio and rcircos are r language versions of circos they are much easier to import r generated data into circos but it has the same limitations such as lack of interactive functionality in this article we provide an interactive_visualization circos plot tool that only requires java installation which is typically installed on most computers the input_data are in tab_delimited format users can either import data through text_files or copy paste in the interface from ms excel sheets
