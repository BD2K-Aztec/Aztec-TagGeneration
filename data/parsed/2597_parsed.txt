genetics_and jawamix an out of core hdf based java implementation of whole_genome association studies using mixed models we present jawamix an out of core open_source toolkit for association_mapping using high_throughput sequence_data taking_advantage of its hdf based implementation jawamix stores genotype data on disk and accesses them as though stored in main_memory therefore it offers a scalable and fast analysis without concerns about memory_usage whatever the size of the dataset we have implemented eight functions for association studies including standard methods linear_models linear_mixed rare_variants test analysis in nested association_mapping design and local variance_component analysis as well as a novel bayesian local variance_component analysis application to real_data demonstrates that jawamix is reasonably fast compared with traditional solutions that load the complete dataset into memory and that the memory_usage is efficient regardless of the dataset size availability the source_code a batteries included executable and user_manual can be freely downloaded fromnext generation sequencing ngs enables investigators to use whole genome_sequences for genotypephenotype association_mapping but it brings with it the challenge of developing scalable tools to handle very large_datasets to do association studies it is usually preferable to put data into random_access ram however the sequence_data generated by ngs are usually too large to be loaded into ram therefore analysts may have to use ad_hoc methods to manipulate file reading as the magnitude of sequencing_projects goes up this problem will become more and more pronounced to solve this problem of scalability it would be ideal to have data stored on disk but also provide a handy read write protocol that users can use as if the data were stored in the main_memory an approach referred to as out of core in computer science this toolkit should offer transparency i e hide the tedious implementation details and high performance hierarchical data format hdf www hdfgroup org hdf is a set of libraries designed to store and organize large_datasets that was originally developed by the national center for supercomputing applications because of its excellent_performance and convenience it has been widely used in many scientific computing communities including storing ngs sequences we developed jawamix a toolkit that uses hdf for storing and analyzing whole_genome genotypes for association_mapping with various statistical_models the linear_mixed has been considered an important framework in gwas for controlling population_structure and estimating genetic_architecture and it has recently been significantly_improved we implemented most functions in jawamix based on the mixed model in addition we provide standard functions without the mixed model as an alternative for users e g stepwise_regression and nested association_mapping given that current implementations of mixed model are based on c c r or python jawamix provides another alternative for researchers to use java programmers can contribute based on the specifications described in our user_manual
