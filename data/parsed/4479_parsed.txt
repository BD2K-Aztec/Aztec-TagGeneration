gene_expression survcomp an r bioconductor_package for performance assessment and comparison of survival models the survcomp package provides functions to assess and statistically compare the performance of survival risk_prediction it implements state of the art statistics to i measure the performance of risk_prediction ii combine these statistical estimates from multiple datasets using a meta_analytical framework and iii statistically compare the performance of competitive models availability the r bioconductor_package survcomp is provided open_source under the artistic license with a user_manual containing installation operating instructions and use case_scenarios on real_datasets survcomp requires r version or higher building risk prediction or survival models is an important area of research especially in cancer where gene_expression are used to predict risk of metastasis response to therapy and overall survival however assessing the relative performance of such models is complex due to the lack of standards regarding the best criterion to use in survival analysis although a number of model performance estimators have been described they are not widely used this is partly because these are implemented in many different r packages that use heterogeneous interfaces which makes_it for the non specialist to easily use or compare the performance of these models another challenge in assessing performance of expression based prediction_models is a lack of power due to small_sample meta analytical_methods could leverage power from the numerous microarray_datasets that are now publicly_available by summarizing model performance estimated in multiple independent studies moreover because they enable efficient joint analysis of multiple datasets such an analytical framework reduces the risk of artifactual discoveries that are due to bias or confounding_factors that may be present in one dataset this is particularly important when comparing competitive risk_prediction often authors to whom correspondence should be addressed claim better performance of a new model without properly assessing whether a model significantly_outperforms its competitors to the best of our knowledge there is no commercial or open_source tool to enable statistical_comparison of risk_prediction in a meta_analytical framework to address_these we developed a new bioconductor_package survcomp which implements several performance_criteria for risk_prediction together with metaanalytical methods that enable combination of performance estimations from multiple independent datasets fixed_and combine est and statistical_comparison of predictions between competitive models cindex comp for the concordance_index the concordance_index as described byand implemented in survcomp may be sensitive to the study specific censoring distribution therefore we are working to implement a modified concordance_index bythat avoids this problem and which should be available in the next release of survcomp although the performance_criteria that are implemented in survcomp are mostly available in other r packages except the d index which to the best of our knowledge is only in survcomp our package provides a common interface to facilitate easy use of all these estimators moreover with the exception of ipdmeta byand survjamda by few r packages perform meta_analysis of survival data survcomp provides a uniform interface to simplify the use of performance assessment and statistical_comparison of risk_prediction and provides new r functions to statistically compare these in the blue square and horizontal line represent the concordance_index and its confidence_interval which is clipped at and represented by an arrow the black rhombus is the overall meta estimate from the combined five datasets the greater the concordance_index the more prognostic the risk_prediction the vertical red bar represents the concordance_index of random risk predictions a meta_analytical framework it is worth noting that the aim of survcomp is to provide efficient computation of several performance_estimates and not to implement a full validation framework proper validation using a fully independent test_dataset is of utmost_importance to avoid overoptimistic results and frameworks for cross_validation multiple random splits or a single split into training validation datasets are implemented in several existing r packages including peperr we illustrate the functionality of survcomp in a case study that investigates prognosis in breast_cancer in most studies this is a difficult_task due to the generally small_sample yet despite a large number of published_studies data heterogeneity both in terms of data_sources and microarray_technologies have limited the effectiveness of their joint analysis here we apply survcomp functions to statistically compare the prognostic value of a widely used clinical model a single proliferation gene and two published gene_signatures the results suggest that the multi gene_signatures are not always superior to standard clinical models or to a simple single gene model the r bioconductor_package survcomp provides a uniform interface to an extensive set of performance assessment and statistical_comparison methods for survival risk prediction
