gene_expression co regulation in embryonic_stem via context dependent binding of transcription_factors motivation with the accumulation of genome_wide binding data for many transcription_factors tfs in the same cell_type or cellular condition it is of great current interest to systematically infer the complex regulatory logic among multiple_tfs in particular chip_seq have been generated for core tfs critical to the maintenance and reprogramming of mouse_embryonic escs this provides a great opportunity to study the regulatory collaboration and interaction among these tfs and with other unknown co regulators results in combination with liquid association among gene_expression we develop a computational_method to predict context dependent cd co egulators of these core tfs in escs from pairwise binding datasets that is co occupancy between a core tf and a predicted co regulator depends on the presence_or of binding_sites of another core tf which is regarded as a binding context unbiased external_validation confirms that the predicted cd binding of a co regulator is reliable our results reveal a detailed cd co regulation_network among the core tfs and provide many other potential co regulators showing strong_agreement with the literature many efforts have been made recently to identify the core regulatory_network in mouse_embryonic escs the network is anchored on three master_regulators namely oct pou f sox and nanog on the other hand four transcription_factors tfs oct sox cmyc and klf can reprogram somatic_cells back to esc like cells having the characteristics of self_renewal and pluripotency genome_wide chip_seq provide the binding regions of tfs that play key regulatory_roles in mouse_escs computational_analyses have been performed to identify the sequence_motifs of these core tfs and to detect other co regulators that may regulate genes by working with these tfs a common observation on these binding data is the partial and significant overlapping between the binding regions of almost any pair of the tfs suggesting extensive co regulatory_interactions among all of them in general one may define three sets of binding regions given two tfs x and y that is the co bound regions s xy and the regions bound only by x or y denoted by s xny and s ynx respectively from the perspective of tf x the regions s xy and s xny can be regarded as two different binding contexts defined by whether binding is accompanied by tf y in our previous work we developed a specific motif_discovery method the contrast motif finder cmf which finds de_novo motifs by contrasting two sets of sequences say s xy and s x ny motifs found by cmf are differentially enriched between the two sequence_sets applying cmf to contrast co bound sequences of oct and sox against sequences bound only by oct we discovered novel context dependent cd motifs for oct that is the motif pattern recognized by oct depends on the nearby sox binding in this work we generalize this idea to the prediction of cd co regulators of a tf for a tf x with binding context defined by another tf y we aim at finding motifs that show differential enrichment between s xy and s xny these motifs may be bound by co regulators of tf x dependent on the binding of y if a co regulator z only works with x when y is present one may expect to find the motif of z in s xy but not in s xny on the contrary if z collaborates with x when y is absent then the motif of z will be enriched in s xny but not in s xy seefor an illustration the motif of such a cd co regulator can be reliably found by cmf when contrasting the two sets of sequences on the other hand gene_expression of the three tfs x y and z may provide independent evidence for the potential cd co regulation if z is a co regulator of x when y is present or absent one expects to observe strong_positive between the expression_profiles of x and z when the expression_level of y is high or low such a three way correlation pattern can be measured by liquid association la developed by by combining cd binding and la among three tfs we restrict our analysis to some specific cd co regulation patterns we assume that binding_site patterns are identical across all samples from which gene_expression data are collected use the right panels inand b to demonstrate our model the binding pattern that x co binds respectively with z and y for different target_genes is assumed to be true across all samples together with the three way expression pattern among the three tfs we are considering the following co regulatory relationship when to whom correspondence should be addressed the expression of y is low but that between x and z is highly_correlated the co occurrence between the sites of x and y is not functional because of a lack of y expression while the co binding between x and z regulates their target_genes when high expression of y with low correlation between the expression of x and z is observed the opposite scenario is considered this is of course a simplified model which does not include other types of more general conditional co regulation but for the data we analyzed in this work a substantial fraction of tf triplets with cd binding in their chip_seq indeed show significant la among their expression_profiles see section for details we performed a systematic study on tfs with available chip_seq to find cd co regulators in mouse_escs all of the tfs play critical or relevant regulatory_roles in escs for instance oct sox nanog esrrb and zfx are known regulators of pluripotency and or self_renewal lif signal_pathway can sustain self_renewal of cells by activating stat together with oct and sox cmyc and klf can reprogram somatic_cells to pluripotent_cells we call them core tfs hereafter expression data ofwere integrated for la analysis reported expression data on samples in response to rnai of a few key tfs and during retinoic_acid induction of mouse_escs generated expression_profiles including profiles of undifferentiated mouse_escs profiles from early embryoid_body eb with high oct expression and profiles from eb with low oct expression to unify description and simplify notations we present our results on the ordered pairs among the core tfs for an ordered pair x y our goal is to predict co regulators z of x with context defined by the presence_or of y binding_sites two sets of sequences s xy and s xny were extracted from the chip_seq of x and y for each ordered pair more details in methods section seefor a flowchart including the key_steps of our analysis we used a computational_method to predict cd co regulators based on chip_seq of two tfs and gene_expression data this method can be applied to many available chip_seq and gene_expression data and is able to decode complex combinatorial regulation among multiple regulators our application to mouse esc data demonstrated the novel biological_insights that can be generated by this method in particular we constructed a reliable cd co regulation_network among core tfs in mouse_escs and identified a list of novel co regulators for future investigation a few lines of future work may further widen the application of our approach it is tempting to detect co regulators under more complex binding context say defined by the combinatorial binding of three or more tfs however an efficient way to identify a small set of most relevant binding contexts is crucial as a naive comparison among all combinatorial binding regions will be prohibitive computationally therefore a principled statistical_method to detect combinatorial binding regions from chip_seq of multiple potentially a large collection of tfs is highly desired generalization of cmf to an efficient tool that finds differentially enriched motifs by comparing multiple sets of sequences is another necessary step it is also interesting to study the relation between epigenetic_factors and cd binding of tfs
