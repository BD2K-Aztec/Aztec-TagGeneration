systems_biology a novel missense_mutation related feature_extraction scheme for 'driver' mutation identification motivation it becomes widely_accepted that human cancer is a disease involving dynamic changes in the genome and that the missense_mutations constitute the bulk of human genetic_variations a multitude of computational algorithms especially the machine_learning ones has consequently been proposed to distinguish missense changes that contribute to the cancer_progression driver_mutation from those that do not passenger mutation however the existing_methods have multifaceted shortcomings in the sense that they either adopt incomplete feature_space or depend on protein structural databases which are usually far from integrated results in this article we investigated multiple aspects of a missense_mutation and identified a novel feature_space that well distinguishes cancer associated driver_mutations from passenger ones an index dx score was proposed to evaluate the discriminating capability of each feature and a subset of these features which ranks top was selected to build the svm classifier cross_validation showed that the classifier trained on our selected_features significantly_outperforms the existing ones both in precision and robustness we applied our method to several datasets of missense_mutations culled from published database and literature and obtained more reasonable_results than previous_studies availability the software is available online at http www methodis thealth com software and https sites google com site driver mutationidentification human_malignancies are believed to arise as a result of somatic alterations within the cancer genome that leads to activation of oncogenes or inactivation_of with the recent considerable improvement in genome_analysis technologies diverse alterations including point_mutations copy_number increases and decreases loss of allelic heterozygosity and chromosome translocations in the genome of a particular cancer type have gradually been specified among these the missense_mutations a point_mutation that results in a codon coding for a different amino_acid attract increasing attentions in that they are recurrently identified within the cancer_genomes although up to hundreds of missense_mutations were characterized in the genome of some cancer type e g brain breast colorectal and pancreatic_cancers see http www sanger ac uk genetics cgp cosmic and also only a small fraction of these mutations are suggested to directly contribute to the neoplastic_process driver_mutation whereas the remaining bulk consists of neutral polymorphisms which are believed to have no direct effect on the tumorigenesis passenger mutation differentiating driver_mutation and passenger_mutations is critical for understanding_the responsible for cancer_progression and also provides prognostic and diagnostic_markers as well as targets for therapeutic_interventions however the ability to distinguish these drivers is seriously limited by in vivo functional_analyses alone therefore this situation has provoked a bunch of mathematical_methods that assist in prioritizing potential drivers for further analysis during the past_years these methods can be mainly categorized into two classes the statistical_method and the machine_learning method the former is largely based on the assumption that mutations that occur more frequently are more likely to be a driver_mutation e g which turned out to be somehow unreasonable according to recent_reports for example pointed that it is the hills infrequently mutant genes not the mountains frequently mutant genes that dominate the cancer genome landscape for the machine_learning method on the other hand researchers typically extract features related to the missense_mutations train a classifier using label clear mutations and perform classifications for the unknowns on the trained classifier through this routine several groups have reported their results so_far and claimed their performance is better than others based on different classifier tools training data and particularly on different feature spaces the existing machine_learning based_methods have shortcomings on several aspects especially on the feature_space they employ to construct the classifier for example in and krishnan and westhead features relating to physicochemical_properties of amino_acids and structural traits of proteins are predicted using computational software the reliability as well as significance of such kind of features are dubious others may avoid the predicted attributes by relying on the published databases that contain structural traits or annotations they need the applicability of these models is limited because of the probable incompleteness of their cited databases the remaining work avoids the above flaws at the price of missing some important properties of the mutation under investigationthey set up too simple rules for discrimination the shortcomings mentioned here make questionable the reliability and or robustness of prediction of the existing_methods in this article we comprehensively investigated the properties relating to a particular missense_mutation besides the previously used features such as physicochemical changes upon the amino_acid and binary categorical features extracted from public annotated databases we for the first time systematically studied all kinds of substitution scoring_matrix ssm features and protein_sequence specific pss features to evaluate their potential power of discrimination see section a ssm or mutation matrix is typically a numerical matrix with each element representing the similarity and distance of a particular pair of amino_acids with respect to a particular physicochemical or biochemical property making it potentially a candidate feature for discrimination some researchers e g have incorporated several well known substitution matrices such as pam blosum and grantham score as predictive features but is much incomplete we explored many such substitution scoring_matrices as candidate features and assessed their distinguishing capability the pss features were widely overlooked in the previous related studies instead they use structural or functional properties of proteins predicted by computational_tools this scheme is of weak reliability since it easily loses some essential information to compensate this potential information_loss we parse the protein_sequences directly by which we obtained the sequence specific features k gram features see section to summarize we proposed a set of candidate predictive descriptors for training a mutation classifier most of which have not been used previously these features describe a missense_mutation from multiple angles including amino_acid protein sequence_profiles and functional_annotations culled from open databases details in section a novel scoring system dx score was employed to evaluate the performance of each feature in distinguishing the positive from the negative numerical_experiments showed that support_vector svm classifier trained by the top_ranked features got highest cross_validation cv accuracy and outperformed the previous methods both in precision and robustness among the top_ranked features our proposed ssm and pss features which were largely neglected or simply overlooked in the previous_studies take an overwhelming part see section this clearly demonstrates the significance of them as predictive features of a mutation classifier we tested the classifier on several distinct datasets collected from published databases along with literature and got more sensible predictions than before particularly these novel predictive features are expected to significantly improve the current in silico studies of driver_mutation identification in this work we dramatically enlarged the existing features used for missense_mutation classification and consequently improved the prediction_performance of previous classifiers that discriminate between driver and passenger_mutations besides incorporating and extending existing features in relation to amino_acid and binary categorical features extracted from published databases we for the first time to our best knowledge systematically studied all kinds of ssm and investigated their potential power in distinguishing missense_mutations in addition we are the first to extensively explore the protein sequence_patterns instead of structural profiles predicted computationally this is justified in that protein_structure is largely based on sequence_alignment with proteins whose structures are already known hence we rationally expect less information_loss by parsing the sequences directly indeed our feature_selection scheme confirms the high performance of the ssm and pss features in separating driver_mutations from passenger ones the fold cv experiments performed on a large set of training data consistently_showed strong prediction capability of our method both in accuracy and robustness by applying the trained classifier to several datasets of missense_mutations culled from published databases and literature we obtained more reasonable prediction results than previous_studies by roc and pr curves as well as functional_relevance analysis hence our proposed novel feature_extraction scheme is hoped to significantly improve the current work of driver_mutation identification another highlight of our work is that the feature_extraction scheme depends little on other computational software or databases which extended the applicability substantially in principle given the mutation with associated protein_sequence our system could automatically extract all the features except for the additional ones as mentioned while if the referred mutation happens to be annotated in the uniprotkb database then all the features can be extracted without depending on any other software or databases although our tool only chooses the top_ranked ones for default the reason that some data in the classifying part cannot be covered lies in the fact that the original paper did not provide the corresponding protein_sequences but only a gene name id instead in this case we have to map it to related databases to extract its protein_sequence first at this step if one data use a very uncommon gene name id then we cannot map it to the records in uniprotkb even under the help of genecards another reason of miss covering is we discarded the mutations at the beginning and end of a sequence in that windows based amino_acid sequence_composition features could not handle them in practice such kind of mutations with missing_values can be treated as in of note only one of the aarc features ranked within the top namely the number of hydrogen_atoms of one amino_acid this is probably because most information of the amino_acid has been already contained in the ssm features for example the nd feature incorporates biochemical and biophysical_properties of amino_acids to construct the wac matrix a large part of ssm and pss features were selected by the dx scoring_scheme namely out of and out of for the former and latter respectively what is attractive is one of the sequence specific features lcc ranks very topit gets the fourth highest dx score this again confirms that pss features play a very significant role on discrimination our proposed_method previous ones whether or not including the additional features however both methods got higher cv accuracy when including the additional categorical features features through supplementary this clearly demonstrates their superior distinguishing capability and the superiority was further boosted by the facts that half of this part was selected out of by dx score and two features of them ranked the top this is not surprising by
