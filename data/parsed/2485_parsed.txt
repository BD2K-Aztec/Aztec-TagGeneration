bioinformatics_discovery systems_biology insights into polypharmacology from drug domain associations motivation polypharmacology the ability of a single drug to affect multiple_targets is a key feature that may explain part of the decreasing success of conventional drug_discovery strategies driven by the quest for drugs to act selectively on a single target most drug_targets are proteins that are composed of domains their structural and functional building_blocks results in this work we model drugdomain networks to explore the role of protein_domains as drug_targets and to explain drug polyphar macology in terms of the interactions between drugs and protein_domains we find that drugs are organized around a privileged set of druggable domains conclusions protein_domains are a good proxy for drug_targets and drug polypharmacology emerges as a consequence of the multi domain_composition of proteins the decrease in the translation of drug_candidates into effective therapies during the past_two has occurred concurrently with the goal of rational_drug of developing selective ligands that act on a single target this classical perspective is an oversimplification challenged by a growing_body showing that there are many drugs for each target and that a single drug can affect multiple_targets the emergent concept of polypharmacology bears this out both from a target and a drug perspective on one hand we can obtain the correct combination of targets from analyses of the biological_networks associated with a given disease and on the other hand we can select or design magic shotguns i e drugs that are able to bind multiple_targets with low_specificity the network perspective from the study byillustrates this situation well they organized all approved drugs reported by drugbank into a drug_target network in which the drugs are depicted as nodes that are connected if the drugs share a protein target and they also generated a targetprotein network in which the proteins are nodes that are connected if the proteins are targeted by the same drug more than half of the drugs in the drugtarget network_formed a giant interconnected cluster and in both networks the majority of the nodes were connected to at least one other drug_target that is drugs share protein targets and proteins are targeted by more than one drug although yildirim et_al bring up polypharmacology as a general attribute of drugs their results also illustrate an important bias of drug_design which is that many approved drugs are based on the same therapeutic_targets mestres et_al pursue this topic further and show that because of limited time and resources small_molecules are not screened systematically through a large and complete panel of proteins thus drugtarget networks derived on the basis of public bibliographic sources may be more representative of the target space explored by the pharmaceutical_industry rather than being a true reflection of drug polypharmacology when they take into account drug affinity data by including targets with no particular therapeutic interest they find that drugs target even more proteins illustrating that drug polypharmacology is the rule rather than the exception polypharmacology has recently been explained in terms of protein modularity within protein_interaction within any protein_interaction a module represents a densely_connected group of nodes and these may be either proteins or functional_motifs domains that are weakly connected to the remaining network a rich variety of global measures based on reverse_engineering of network_topologies have been suggested to uncover the organizing principles behind complex_networks such reverse_engineering of network_topologies based measures reveal that networked structures can emerge at different levels from single_node characteristics and the tendency of pairs of nodes to connect to each other to the patterns exhibited by associations of three or more nodes known as motifs here we aim to re orientate the field to the fundamental principle of protein science the premise that the functional_units of proteins are domains to explain polypharmacology protein_domains are compact and functional structures that can be considered the building_blocks of proteins the definition of protein_domains overlaps the structural and functional views of proteins because domains are units of structure and there is a limited repertoire of domain types protein_domains are combined to form different proteins with different functions furthermore proteinprotein_interactions are dominated by domaindomain interactions therefore we think that drugtarget_interactions may be mediated by drugdomain interactions hence we argue that protein_domains can be major contributors to polypharmacology in other words because proteins have a modular_structure and the same domains can be repeatedly found in different proteins the reason why a drug binds multiple protein targets to whom correspondence should be addressed may be related to the proteins_sharing a common domain that the drug may be targeting in this work we attempt to unravel the association between drugs and protein_domains to address the hypothesis that protein_domains are the areas on which drugs_act and are an important factor in the polypharmacological behaviour of most drugs our work is not the first to attempt to associate drugs with protein_domains developed a statistical_approach to predict potential targets for new drugs based on interactions between drugs and protein_domains interestingly they assumed that drugs_act by binding to specific proteins contrary to the idea proposed by drug polypharmacology moreover they relied on the idea that drugs interacting with the same domain tend to share therapeutic_effects hence they associate domains with therapeutic categories using the anatomical_therapeutic atc_codes that is a domain is associated with a group of drugs sharing the same atc_code as far as we know the work described in this report is the first attempt to identify direct drugdomain associations in a systematic and comprehensive manner other previous_research has focused on drugdomain relationships as well and russ and lampel relied on manual annotations of drug binding_domain to explore the druggable genome we obtained roughly the same setof druggable domains with our automatic method we found that drugs tend to revolve around a privileged set of domains as can be observed in the drugdomain bipartite networks and can be deduced from the monopartite projections of the drug domain and drugprotein networks network heterogeneity reflects the tendency of a network to contain hub nodes a drug drug projection of a bipartite network with a low heterogeneity reflects a trend in which drugs are organized around a privileged set of targets this is the case for the drugdrug projections of both drugdomain networks when compared with their corresponding drugprotein subnetworks as shown in drug degree distributions particularly in drugdomain networks after we corrected for the co occurrence of domains in the same proteins clearly show that drugs target domains in a more specific way than they target_proteins different domain targets for a polypharmacological drug tend to cluster in the same modules within domain interaction networks such as domine these domains and in particular co occurring domains can be interpreted as a single module or as a single pharmacological_target in the same sense that protein_complexes are considered as drug_targets in the work of nacher and schwartz to get a hint of the evolutionary perspective of druggable domains we selected polypharmacological drugs that target the two main families of druggable proteins as described byin the druggable genome i e gpcrs and kinases although both doxepin and staurosporine can be associated with protein_domains that are archetypical for each protein class the targets of doxepin are closely_related in the gpcrs phylogenetic_tree whereas the targets of staurosporine are widespread in the human kinome these two examples illustrate a difference in the subfamily targeting specificity of the selected drugs and suggest further studies such as the implications in drug polypharmacology of the evolutionary_conservation of structural_domains with particular focus on binding_site conservation and the structural_similarity of domains for distinct targets our results support the idea that protein_domains are a good proxy for drug_targets when considering the structural and functional perspectives of their definition hence drug polypharmacology understood as the ability of a single drug to bind several proteins emerges as a consequence of the multidomain composition of proteins
