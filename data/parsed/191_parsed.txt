a java api for working with pubchem datasets pubchem is a public repository of chemical_structures and associated biological_activities the pubchem bioassay database contains assay descriptions conditions and readouts and biological screening results that have been submitted by the biomedical research_community the pubchem web_site and power user gateway pug web_service allow users to interact with the data and raw files are available via ftp these resources are helpful to many but there can also be great benefit by using a software api to manipulate the data here we describe a java api with entity objects mapped to the pubchem schema and with wrapper functions for calling the ncbi eutilities and pubchem pug web_services pubchem bioassays and associated chemical_compounds can then be queried and manipulated in a local relational_database features include chemical_structure searching and generation and display of curve fits from stored doseresponse experiments something that is not yet available within pubchem itself the aim is to provide researchers with a fast consistent queryable local resource from which to manipulate pubchem bioassays in a database agnostic manner it is not intended as an end_user tool but to provide a platform for further automation and tools development pubchem http pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov is a public repository of chemical_structures and associated biological_activities it was launched as part of the molecular libraries roadmap from the national_institutes nih which aims to increase the discovery and use of chemical probes through high_throughput of small_molecules it is composed of three interconnected databases the compound database contains unique chemical_structures the substance database contains batch sample level descriptions of these chemical_structures the bioassay database is the repository of biological screening results as of september over million chemical_structures have been deposited by distinct organizations and bioassays with over million data_points have been deposited by organizations these include governmental academic and private entities http pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov sources sources cgi to whom correspondence should be addressed we present a java api for working with pubchem datasets it assembles data from several sources ncbi web_services and flat files and is backed by the hibernate persistence framework it utilizes a relational_database for storage and has built in querying search capabilities it integrates chemical functionality such as structure processing and search via jchem from chemaxon and can also handle doseresponse curves via code derived from ncgc curvefit we enable programmatic_access to pubchem features such as bioassay panels columns and results providing data types units of measure and associating dose responses to specific curve plots the pubchem power user gateway pug web_services do not describe the pubchem schema as completely and such detail is also not available in pubchems csv downloads but only on the bioassay web_pages additionally a local relational mirror of the pubchem bioassay database provides the data in a way that was previously not available this can be of great benefit to researchers and software_developers as relational databases are a widespread familiar technology and can open up the dataset to many other tools and technologies than can interact via web_browser or web_based protocols with inherent latency and statelessness it can also serve as an integration platform as annotations and other information can be added to the database schema by adding additional tables and fields as necessary in summary this is a toolkit for software_developers to work with pubchem bioassay datasets in a consistent_manner
