a tool for rna_sequencing sample identity check rna sequencing_data are becoming a major method of choice to study transcriptomes including the mapping of gene_expression quantitative_trait eqtls rna sample contamination or swapping is a serious problem for downstream_analysis and may result in false discovery and lose power to detect the true biological_relationships when genetic data are available for example in eqtl studies or samples have been previously genotyped or dna sequenced it is possible to combine genetic data and rna_seq to detect sample contamination and resolve sample swapping problems in this article we introduce a tool idcheck that allows easy assessment of concordance between genotype from snp_arrays or dna_sequencing and gene_expression rna_seq samples idcheck compares the identity of rna_seq and snp genotypes using a likelihood_based method based on maximum_likelihood of relevant_parameters we can detect sample contamination and identify correct sample_pairs when swapping occurs our tool provides an efficient and convenient way to evaluate and resolve these problems comparing with array based technology rna_seq experiments allow us to more accurately measure gene expression_level and provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms_underlying expression_quantitative eqtls eqtl_mapping studies integrate genetic and gene_expression data to identify genetic_variants associated with expression of genes and have helped interpret findings from genome_wide for many complex_diseases as the scale of the study becomes larger and larger sample contamination or label swapping is more likely to occur sample mislabeling during the manual preparation of dna samples and rna samples is more prone to occur because of many steps involved in collecting the data for example if some sample labels are mixed and tagged to the wrong sequencing lane or dna_sample the genotype data and gene_expression data are not correctly paired the mislabeled or contaminated samples could add bias and or noise to the datasets resulting in false discovery and loss of statistical_power true associations therefore it is necessary to check the sample identity and potential contamination before any downstream data analysis a fast and efficient tool to identify these potential problems and offer possible solutions is needed here we present a tool idcheck to do sample identity checking and detect potential sample contamination it is particularly useful for eqtl_mapping studies using rna_seq but also applicable to any rna_seq studies with genotype data available it will output a text format file to report for how each sample is paired idcheck also provides a quick overview of rna_seq data_quality using summary graphs these results are exported to pdf files
