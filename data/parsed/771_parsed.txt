biopax support in celldesigner motivation biopax is a standard language for representing and exchanging models of biological_processes at the molecular and cellular levels it is widely used by different pathway_databases and genomics data analysis software currently the primary source of biopax data is direct exports from the curated pathway_databases it is still uncommon for wet_lab biologists to share and exchange pathway_knowledge using biopax instead pathways are usually represented as informal diagrams in the literature in order to encourage formal representation of pathways we describe a software_package that allows users to create pathway diagrams using celldesigner a user_friendly graphical pathway editing tool and save the pathway data in biopax level format recent efforts to standardize pathway data have greatly_facilitated the interpretation exchange and integration of pathway_knowledge in a rigorous and unambiguous way the efforts have led to the creation of several widely_accepted complementary community standardssystems biology markup_language sbml biological_pathway exchange biopax and systems_biology sbgn both sbml and biopax are machinereadable formats for representing cellular_processes the former is concentrated on mathematical_modeling while the latter is focused on qualitative pathway_knowledge sbgn is a standard for graphical_representation of pathways and can be used for visualizing both sbml and biopax models biopax level covers a large spectrum of qualitative information in the literature including metabolic and signaling_pathways as well as molecular and genetic_interactions as a result biopax is currently supported by different pathway database resources http www pathguide org including metacyc panther to whom correspondence should be addressed pid and reactome most of these resources generate biopax compliant exchange files from the pathway data that are curated by highly_trained curators using specialized curation software it is still rare for wet_lab biologists to create and exchange pathway data using such standards this creates a bottleneck for pathway_knowledge accumulation as the database groups can only curate a fraction of the enormous amount of knowledge that is being generated extending the usage of formal machine_readable models such as biopax to the wider biological community would significantly alleviate this problem and help pathway_databases to cope up with the load furthermore wet_lab biologists are the end_users of the pathway_databases and thus the enrichment of pathway database content will ultimately benefit their research the major_obstacle so_far is the lack of software_tools that can allow biologists to easily transcribe the pathway_knowledge to biopax format cytoscape biopax plug in allows users to load and graphically render biopax files for visualization it has been used by a number of software to import or export biopax files the plug in does not support biopax level yet celldesigner is a graphical intuitive pathway editing software which uses controlled graphical notations for visual representation of the pathway and supports both sbml and sbgn standard it is used in the research_community for generating pathway diagrams with controlled graphical notations for both wet_lab and systems biologists both celldesigner and biopax describes pathway in terms of biochemical_reaction and process which is equivalent to sbgn process description sbgnpd standard the data_structures in celldesigner and biopax are similar but not identical and we have developed a mapping between the two here we describe a software_package that allows users to draw or open a pathway diagram in celldesigner and save the data accurately in biopax format thus the software provides the connection between sbml sbgn pd and biopax
