disopred precise disordered region predictions with annotated protein binding activity motivation a sizeable fraction of eukaryotic_proteins contain intrinsically_disordered idrs which act in unfolded_states or by undergoing transitions between structured and unstruc tured conformations over time sequence based_classifiers of idrs have become fairly accurate and currently a major_challenge is linking idrs to their biological_roles from the molecular to the systems level results we describe disopred which extends its predecessor with new modules to predict idrs and protein binding_sites within them based on recent casp evaluation results disopred can be regarded as state of the art in the identification of idrs and our self assessment shows that it significantly_improves over disopred because its predictions are more specific across the whole board and more sensitive to idrs longer than amino_acids predicted idrs are annotated as protein binding through a novel svm based_classifier which uses profile data and additional sequence derived features based on benchmarking experiments with full cross_validation we show that this predictor generates precise assignments of disordered protein binding regions and that it compares well with other publicly_available tools availability_and proteins experience more or less pronounced structural changes while performing their functions in particular completely unfolded_states or transitions between structured and unstructured conformations are distinguishing_features which enable the physiological_activities of intrinsically_disordered idps and intrinsically_disordered idrs our understanding of the biological_importance and of the widespread occurrence of this phenomenon is gradually expanding thanks to the fine_tuning of experimental_techniques and to computational genome_wide surveys the disprot database stores manually curated_data for idrs but annotations are accumulating at a very slow_rate disprot v reports idrs and of them still have unknown function therefore bioinformatics plays_a in researching the occurrence the biological_function and the involvement of intrinsic_disorder in phenotype and disease many computational_methods can predict idrs within protein_sequences propensitybased approaches were inspired by the observed enrichment of polar and charged amino_acids and by the under representation of hydrophobic and aromatic_residues in idrs further comparative v c the author published_by we have documented the disopred program for protein disorder prediction and for protein binding_site annotation within disordered_regions the tool first identifies disordered residues through a consensus of the output generated by disopred and two additional machine_learning modules trained on large idrs and then annotates them as protein binding through an additional svm classifier the intrinsic_disorder predictor attains fairly_high levels of prediction_accuracy across different test conditions and can be regarded as state of the artas independently reported by the casp and casp assessment teamsthus confirming the usefulness of integrating_multiple complementary approaches compared with its predecessor disopred shows improved_sensitivity for idrs with twenty or more amino_acids as well as increased overall specificity such predictions form a useful basis for the identification of proteinbinding regions mediating key transient interactions through a novel svm which compares well with existing_tools for the same task on these grounds disopred is expected to represent a useful addition to the toolbox for the functional_annotation of proteins and proteomes notwithstanding further advances are needed to enhance the sensitivity of idr detection and of the protein binding_sites therein of course the accumulation of additional experimental information and its availability in a structured easy to parse manner will be beneficialas already witnessed in other areas of computational_biology however new ideas will be crucial to make major progress especially in the attempt to link the binary classifications of ordered and disordered residues to biological_functions at different scales of complexity in particular initial system level investigations of the role of protein disorder in cellular development and differentiation have already begun thanks to the increasing availability of genome_wide heterogeneous datasets in this context the design and implementation of reliable and more scalable tools will be of special relevance disopred no dpb svm is a baseline method that considers all disordered residues identified by disopred as involved in protein binding
