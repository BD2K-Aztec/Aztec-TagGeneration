sequence_analysis java bioinformatics_analysis web_services for multiple_sequence jabaws msa jabaws is a web_services framework that simplifies the deployment of web_services for bioinformatics jabaws msa provides services for five multiple_sequence msa methods probcons t coffee muscle mafft and clustalw and is the system employed by the jalview multiple sequence_analysis workbench since version a fully_functional easy to set up server is provided as a virtual appliance va which can be run on most operating_systems that support a virtualization environment such as vmware or oracle virtualbox jabaws is also distributed as a web_application archive war and can be configured to run on a single computer and or a cluster managed by grid engine lsf or other queuing systems that support drmaa jabaws msa provides clients full access to each applications parameters allows administrators to specify named parameter preset combinations and execution limits for each application through simple configuration files the jabaws command_line client allows integration of jabaws services into conventional scripts availability_and jabaws is made freely_available under the apache license and can be obtained from the explosion in biological data volume diversity and complexity has been paralleled by the development of computational_methods to aid data analysis locally installed copies of programs give full access to their capabilities and the ability to run long cpu or memory intensive jobs however configuring software to install easily on a range of operating_systems is challenging instead many developers make their techniques available through a custom web_page or increasingly as a web_service which provides a flexible programmable and scriptable middle ground between installing software locally and accessing via a web_browser there is now a rich ecosystem of public web_services but they do not always meet the needs of users their interfaces may have limited functionality and even the biggest service_providers such as ebi and ncbi limit the computational_resources memory cpu available to an individual so that total demand can be met web_services at the university of dundee were created in as part of the jalview project to provide its users access to clustalw a collection of portable web_services initially for multiple_sequence has been developed it is designed to interact with other software or services and be deployed easily on a variety of computing infrastructures either directly or through the use of virtualization jabaws msa provides an in house web_services solution that is limited only by locally available computing_resources furthermore its client provides fault tolerance by allowing access to multiple server instances while the service interface gives a high_level of control over individual tasks comprehensive metadata provided by each service enables their integration with jalview to allow novices and experts alike to utilize their local compute resources efficiently finally although jabaws msa is focused on multiple_alignment the jabaws framework is flexible and will soon be extended to include analytical_methods such as secondary_structure and disorder prediction
