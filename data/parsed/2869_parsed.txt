systems_biology menu driven cloud_computing and resource sharing for r and bioconductor we report crdata org a cloud_based free open_source web_server for running analyses and sharing data and r scripts with others in addition to using the free public_service crdata users can launch their own private amazon elastic computing cloud ec nodes and store private data and scripts on amazons simple storage service s with user controlled access rights all crdata services are provided via point and click menus availability_and crdata is open_source and free under the permissive mit_license opensource org licenses mit_license php the source_code is in ruby ruby lang org en andhigh throughput technologies and integrative systems_biology have led to an increasing need for high_performance cloud_computing has emerged as an attractive solution to issues of maintenance administration and obsolescence the bioconductor bioconductor org and r cran r project org projects offer a rich open_source computational environment with over packages high_level libraries covering data analysis e g sequencing chip rna_seq simulation modeling e g stochastic modeling odes and pdes and network integration analysis and visualization compatibility with other resources is provided via bridging packages such as rsbml and rgraphviz here we report the development of a web_based resource crdata org that addresses three current_challenges first crdata provides a means with which people inexpert in r syntax can execute r scripts using a simple web_based graphical_user secondly to facilitate sharing datasets and scripts crdata automatically generates a graphical_user for submitted to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address d div human_biology fred hutchinson cancer_research fairview avenue north seattle wa usa present_address wisewindow corporation skypark circle suite irvine ca usa scripts moreover users can make data and scripts available to selected collaborators or the world using simple menus thirdly to avoid processing bottlenecks we provide menu driven access to amazons elastic computing cloud ec aws amazon com ec and its simple storage service s aws amazon com s crdata users can launch any number of private ec processor nodes and or store their private and shared data and scripts in s in addition to individual use crdata users can create groups and share data scripts and cloud computing_resources within groups this functionality enables computational_biologists to provide targeted private resources e g customized scripts and analysis results to collaborators and subscribers it also enables script users to run multiple analyses using different algorithms and or parameters similarly authors of systems_biology models can provide online versions of their models for interactive_exploration crdata users can also send feedback to the owner of a shared file and rate review the resource to help others moreover the usage history of any file can be explored by users with access rights shows example views of crdata in use shows the directory listing for an example crdata group each group has an administrator who can accept reject user applications to join arrow this example group has four members as shown shows the user_interface for a script shared within the above group the dialog boxes and their default values are automatically generated by crdata based on specifications by the script author as shown the user is prompted to choose the processing queue public or a users private queue specify the input_file name and provide algorithmic parameter_values including the choice of output data to help users understand the algorithm and choose parameter_values each script is accompanied by an html help page supplied by the script author via crdatas html help file editor shows a portion of the help file for the script in users can also view the script code through a read only viewer a portion is shown in output of analyses are provided in two forms data_files that can be downloaded or used as inputs to other crdata scripts and html pages containing text figures tables etc a portion of the html output of the example script is shown in to enable crdata to process output statements scripts must be annotated with html like tags that declare output statements and their type the tags are treated as comments by r for example a command to output some text is tagged as crdata text output text crdata text crdata replaces the output declaration tags with html commands using r html tinyurl com r html see urls and in supplementary_material for details over example scripts and associated data_files are provided in the crdata public space see_supplementary crdata architecture is modular and extensible a ruby on rails http rubyonrails org server node handles all user processing node jobs queue data and script management leaving crdata processing nodes free for data_processing all processing nodes are copies of a master node which is preloaded with r and bioconductor libraries and stored as an ec processor instance in this way nodes can be launched dynamically on demand typically initialization of a new ec node takes a few minutes a staging node provides a means to update crdata nodes without interrupting the operation of the server and its active processing nodes apart from packages requiring third_party software or interactive graphics all packages from r and bioconductor are preinstalled on crdata nodes unpublished packages can be submitted to crdata using a simple r script crdata supports all amazon processing node sizes and configurations see aws amazon com ec instance types to minimize running costs we currently offer two processing node types small and medium three free processing nodes are offered by crdata to allow users to test scripts and perform small analysis tasks for jobs likely to take more than a few minutes we request that users launch private ec nodes a menu driven interface in crdata makes this task straightforward extra nodes can be launched automatically when there are jobs waiting in a users queue and idle nodes terminated
