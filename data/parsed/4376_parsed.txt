gene_expression splicingcompass differential splicing detection using rna_seq motivation alternative_splicing is central for cellular_processes and substantially increases transcriptome and proteome diversity aberrant splicing_events often have pathological consequences and are associated with various diseases and cancer_types the emergence of next_generation rna_seq provides an exciting new technology to analyse alternative_splicing on a large_scale however algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative_splicing from short_read are not fully established yet and there are still no standard_solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks results we present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using rna_seq our method uses geometric angles between the high_dimensional vectors of exon read_counts with this differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing_events are composed of higher complexity and involve previously_unknown splicing patterns we applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical_courses we show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering we verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementary in silico analyses we found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing_factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative_splicing furthermore we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients finally we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized read_coverage plots and in reads that span exonexon junctions availability splicingcompass is licensed under the gnu gpl and freely_available as a package in the statistical language r atalternative splicing is a central cellular_process that produces different mrna isoforms from a single gene the qualitative_and identification of such isoforms is essential for understanding the different roles of alternatively_spliced genes in a cell in addition the detection of disease specific isoforms is an important task because aberrant_splicing is known to be responsible for various diseases reviewed in and associated with different cancer_types e g isoform structures and abundances can be inferred from short_sequence generated by rna_sequencing rna_seq in contrast to hybridization based_approaches using for example microarrays such sequencing based_approaches better allow for the detection of previously_unknown splicing_events and can avoid cross_hybridization and limited dynamic range reviewed in computational_methods for analysing differential_expression and differential splicing from rna_seq are only beginning to emerge reviewed in existing_methods detect alternative_splicing mainly by considering sequencing_reads that map uniquely to single isoforms or by assembling transcripts and estimating the most likely isoform abundance levels according to the given sequencing_reads an overview and discussion of limitations is given in martin and wang and short_read assemblers have been developed for genome and transcriptome_assembly e g velvet scripture cufflinks and others reviewed in martin and despite the success of such approaches assembly artifacts remain a common phenomenon and in the context of transcriptome_assembly many reads cannot be assigned to single isoforms unambiguously when trying to interpret these reads different sets of to whom correspondence should be addressed possible assemblies are theoretically compatible with the sequencing_data and this leads to the misassembly of false transcripts and a wrong estimation of specific isoform_expression levels this problem becomes more severe in the presence of complex alternative_splicing patterns and depends on factors like the sequencing_depth and the length of generated_reads these considerations are also the basis for recent_developments that aim at identifying alternative_splicing patterns from de_bruijn without actually assembling complete isoforms or methods that integrate rna_seq with existing gene_annotations and ests to predict more reliable splice_graphs and annotate ambiguous events as unresolved a systematic_assessment of transcriptome_assemblies is difficult because appropriate quality_metrics have not been established yet and require a well defined gold_standard that is difficult to find during the revision of this article published a tool called dexseq for the detection of differential exon usage from rna_seq rather than using an assembly approach and comparing abundance levels of predicted transcripts dexseq avoids the assembly step and calculates p values for every annotated exon or parts of exons if an exon modification event can be derived from the provided annotation similarly our method directly identifies genes with significantly altered ratios of potentially unknown isoforms the power to detect significant expression differences depends on the number of available reads and therefore on the sequencing_depth and length of the region of interest regions that are specific to a single isoform like cassette exons are often much shorter compared to full transcripts and the detection of significant differences may be severely hampered by their low number of reads besides this the number of statistical_tests that are required to detect previously known and unknown events for all expressed genes in the observed cells raises to such an extent that makes it challenging to avoid high false_positive levels or to reach statistical_significance after using multiple_testing a critical aspect for all methods is the potentially complex composition of isoforms some genes generate many different transcripts in varying abundances that comprise a large variety of different combinations of exons rna_seq gives the opportunity at hand to yield a global insight into this situation consequently we developed a new method and implemented it into the software_tool splicingcompass to predict genes that show differential splicing taking all of their exons into account to our knowledge our method is the first approach that detects differential splicing on a gene level by taking_into all exons of a gene at once instead of considering single exons independently this reduces the number of statistical_tests considerably and better accounts for combined effects we applied our method to high_throughput sequences of the transcriptomes from human_brain and liver_samples as well as from neuroblastoma patients with low_risk and high_risk tumours and to simulated_data in addition we present results that show the validity of our method as well as its applicability in the context of clustering tissues and cancer patients
