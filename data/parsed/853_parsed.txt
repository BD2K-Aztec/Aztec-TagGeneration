genetics_and candisnper a web_tool for the identification of candidate snps for causal_variants human single_nucleotide snp_chips which are used in genome_wide gwas permit the genotyping of up to million snps simultaneously to date about human snps have been identified as statistically_significantly associated with a disease or another trait of interest the identified snp is not necessarily the causal_variant but it is rather in linkage_disequilibrium ld with it candisnper is a software_tool that determines the ld region around a significant snp from a gwas it provides a list with functional_annotation and ld values for the snps found in the ld region this list contains not only the snps for which genotyping_data are available but all snps with rs ids thus increasing the likelihood to include the causal_variant furthermore plots showing the ld values are generated candisnper facilitates the preselection of candidate snps for causal_variants availability_and the candisnper server is freely_available www hu berlin de wikizbnutztier software candisnper the source_code is available to academic users as is upon request the web_site is implemented in perl and r and runs on an apache server the ensembl_database is queried for snp data via perl apis whole_genome genotyping has become established in medical biological and agricultural_research to elucidate the genetic_basis of phenotypic_traits such as disease or economically_important features typically the result of a genome_wide gwas consists of a list of single_nucleotide snps with p values that characterize the strength of association with the phenotype under investigation further analysis is necessary to associate a significant snp with a gene or to decide if a significant snp is a candidate for a causal_variant for a disease or just in linkage_disequilibrium ld with it a causal_variant is a genomic locus that has a direct qualitative or quantitative effect on the phenotype snps can alter a protein directly non synonymous snps stop gained or stop lost snps frameshift snps or snps in splice_sites or they can influence gene_expression if they are located in regulatory_regions snap proved to be a valuable_tool for the analysis of snps that are in ld with a significant snp but has the to whom correspondence should be addressed shortcoming that only snps that are present on snp_chips of the major genotyping_platforms are considered the main motivation to develop candisnper was that much more human snps are known than systematically genotyped within the hapmap project or included on the major genotyping_platforms these snps represent potential candidate snps for causal_variants although they will not be observed directly as significant snp in a gwas the number of reference snps rs snps is currently dbsnp build genome build of which are validated in the caucasian_population snps were genotyped by the hapmap project release february and million snps can be typed for example with illuminas humanomni quad beadchip thus restricting the search for the causal_variant of a phenotype to snps present on a genotyping chip or to hapmap snps would mean to neglect three quarters of all known snps to simplify the maintenance of candisnper and to guarantee upto dateness genotype and snp data are retrieved from the ensembl_database during runtime this is at the cost of a response time that is higher than if primary data were stored locally and ld was precomputed
