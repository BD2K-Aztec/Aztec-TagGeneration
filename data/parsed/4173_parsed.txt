genetics_and selam simulation of epistasis and local adaptation during admixture with mate_choice selam is a forward time population_genetic simulation program that provides a flexible framework for simulating admixture between any number of ancestral_populations the program can be used to simulate complex demographic and selection models including dioecious or mon oecious populations autosomal or sex_chromosomes local adaptation dominance epistasis and mate_choice availability_and the selam package c source_code examples and manuals is available via github at https github com russcd selam this package is distributed under version of the gnu_general there is a growing appreciation for the importance of admixture in a variety of evolutionary_processes admixture has played a critical role in the evolutionary_histories of non african modern humans drosophila_melanogaster and numerous other species admixture has the potential to influence a wide_variety of evolutionary_processes including shaping patterns of neutral genetic_variation introducing adaptive and deleterious alleles and producing novel ecologically and reproductively isolated lineages in order to study patterns of local_ancestry across the genome and to develop novel theoretical_predictions an efficient and a flexible simulation framework that can track complete ancestry information and incorporate an array of selective and demographic functions is essential previous_studies have used coalescent approaches to study the distributions of haplotype_structure resulting from relatively ancient admixture events though efficient the coalescent has limited utility for studies that focus on natural_selection which is of central interest for many admixed_populations although see e g ewing and hermisson for this reason forward in time simulations are appealing and recently a number of efficient forward time simulation programs have been released the majority of these software_packages are designed to simulate the evolution and inheritance of mutations distributed along a chromosome although this approach is capable of simulating admixture seefor one implementation by design these programs do not retain full ancestral information and many require substantive burn in periods to achieve genetic equilibrium if the process and consequences of admixture are the primary interest and not the evolutionary factors that generate the genetic_diversity present in ancestral_populations an efficient_simulation framework can be achieved by tracking local_ancestry rather than specific mutations along chromosomes similar methods have been used previously in the context of studying relatively short evolutionary_processes such as artificial selection and more generally for long_term population_genetic inference as the number of generations increases this approach often performs poorly due to the rapid accumulation of recombination_events that must be tracked in all descendent individuals here we propose mitigating these issues by tracking local_ancestry in genomic_segments that can be accessed and inherited as a group we implement this solution in selam a forward time population_genetic simulator that is designed to efficiently handle both short_and admixture simulations while retaining complete local_ancestry information furthermore this program incorporates a broad_spectrum of
