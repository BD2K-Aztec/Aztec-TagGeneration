subclonal variant_calling with multiple samples and prior_knowledge motivation targeted_resequencing of cancer_genes in large cohorts of patients is important to understand the biological and clinical_consequences of mutations cancers are often clonally heterogeneous and the detection of subclonal mutations is important from a diagnostic point_of but presents strong_statistical challenges results here we present a novel statistical_approach for calling mutations from large cohorts of deeply resequenced cancer_genes these data allow for precisely estimating local error profiles and enable detecting mutations with high_sensitivity our probabilistic_method incorporates knowledge about the distribution of variants in terms of a prior probability we show that our algorithm has a high_accuracy of calling cancer mutations and demonstrate that the detected clonal and subclonal variants have important prognostic consequences availability code is available as part of the bioconductor packagein recent_years genome_sequencing has greatly_enhanced our understanding of cancer_biology tumors are evolving entities and display complex clonal architectures with many mutations present in only a subset of cells subclonal mutations provide insights into disease_evolution and influence prognosis subclonal variants can be detected using the deep coverage of next_generation but their distinction from sequencing_errors library_preparation and alignment artifacts suffers from an unfavorable signal to noise_level a series of powerful variant callers has been developed in recent_years for calling variants from genome or exome_sequencing of tumornormal pairs for detecting subclonal variants or mutations in samples with a low purity which are both reported by small fractions of reads only it is mandatory to accurately quantify the abundance of sequencing artifacts which may otherwise lead to large_numbers of false_positives with increasing numbers of genomic_datasets being generated it becomes apparent that sequencing artifacts tend to occur in a systematic way and on specific sites targeted_resequencing experiments in which a selected set of candidate_genes is resequenced across hundreds_or of samples are increasingly prepared to evaluate findings from large_scale sequencing studies such datasets present an opportunity to precisely estimate the distribution of sequencing artifacts by aggregating information across samples rather than across sites as is commonly done in tumornormal variant_calling this will help avoid artifacts and likewise enable calling more variants on sites with lower error_rates the growing catalogs of somatic_mutations in cancer also make it possible to define genomic_loci more likely to be mutated therefore one may attempt to incorporate this prior_knowledge to facilitate variant_calling on mutational hotspots while remaining conservative on the remaining sites hence a well chosen prior will increase sensitivity at a given level of specificity here we present a novel approach for detecting clonal and subclonal variants that exploits the power of a large sample set for precisely defining the local error_rates and which uses prior information to call variants with high_specificity we benchmark our algorithm against data from two large gene screens in hematological cancers a subset of patients with myelodysplastic_syndromes mds we have published_recently in these screens cancer_genes were sequenced using barcoded libraries prepared from whole_genome amplified dna samples were sequenced in batches of per lane on a hiseq and reads were aligned with bwa r rugo to the grch human_reference technical_replicates existed for samples with acute_myeloid aml assayed by the same gene_panel moreover we included normal samples to quantify specificity here we focus on a subset of genes with good coverage and in which we had previously found oncogenic mutations the availability of survival data in the mds cohort allows for evaluating the quality of variant_calls by their prognostic potential which is an orthogonal measure to technical replication in this article we presented a statistical_approach for detecting clonal and subclonal single_nucleotide in targeted gene screens the availability of large_numbers of samples allows for precisely estimating the rate of artifacts which is important for reliably detecting subclonal mutations that can have a disadvantageous signal to noise_level our model incorporates prior information on mutational hotspots which selectively increases the sensitivity for known mutations shearwater automatically determines the noise levels from the data and we therefore expect it to deal well with sequencing_data from other sequencing_platforms and aligners shearwater has both a high_specificity and good power to detect_variants the genotypes obtained by shearwater have a higher prognostic value than those from established variant callers and are likely to contain fewer artifacts to an extent this behavior is expected because of our algorithms ability to exploit the power of a large cohort of samples and to incorporate_prior about which mutations are more likely than others as our algorithm uses unmatched samples it relies on the quality of polymorphism databases such as single_nucleotide database or ensembl variation which can generally be expected to become better in the future the same holds true for the quality of databases of somatic_mutations that will get richer over time and contain more precise information about the mutational patterns in each cancer type here we used the same probability for each gene to be mutated but once unbiased_estimates for the mutation frequencies in each cancer type exist from systematic gene screens one will be able to further improve the accuracy of our algorithm the idea of using a prior for recurrent mutations may also be incorporated easily into other variant callers finally our core algorithm may also be improved in many ways for example one could account for base qualities by a weighted counting scheme instead of a simple phred quality threshold one limitation of our approach is its reliance on a variant to be present on reads from both directions due to the specifics of the null_model m this was introduced as it greatly_increases the specificity of calls but leads to a decrease in power in regions with low coverage and also at the flanks of the target_regions where often reads in only one direction are available our implementation allows the user to choose an essentially strand agnostic null_model m but this may be less specific to analyze matched_samples one could derive the joint probability of a variant being present in only the tumor but not the normal or simply remove the intersection of variants in tumor and matched normal in summary we have presented a coherent statistical methodology and robust algorithm for calling subclonal variants in cancer samples with great specificity as genomic_sequencing is about to enter clinical_diagnostics we believe that our method will have broad_applicability
