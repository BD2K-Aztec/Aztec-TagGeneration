gene_expression meta_analysis for pathway_enrichment when combining multiple genomic studies motivation many pathway analysis or gene_set methods have been developed to identify enriched pathways under different biological_states within a genomic study as more and more microarray_datasets accumulate meta_analysis methods have also been developed to integrate_information among multiple studies currently most meta_analysis methods for combining genomic studies focus on biomarker_detection and meta_analysis for pathway analysis has not been systematically pursued results we investigated two approaches of meta_analysis for pathway enrichment mape by combining statistical_significance across studies at the gene level mape g or at the pathway level mape p simulation_results showed increased statistical_power of meta_analysis approaches compared to a single study analysis and showed complementary advantages of mape g and mape p under different scenarios we also developed an integrated method mape i that incorporates advantages of both approaches comprehensive simulations and applications to real_data on drug response of breast_cancer and lung_cancer tissues were evaluated to compare the performance of three mape variations mape p has the advantage of not requiring gene matching across studies when mape g and mape p show complementary advantages the hybrid version of mape i is generally recommended microarray_technology provides the ability to detect genome_wide gene_expression activities with thousands of probes printed on each high_density chip it has evolved rapidly in the past_decade and has gradually become a standard tool for many biomedical_studies the high_throughput nature of the technology requires development of suitable statistical and bioinformatic_methods to analyze the data pathway analysis a k a gene_set was developed to correlate the identified gene_list from microarray_data with a priori defined to whom correspondence should be addressed gene_sets usually from biological pathway_databases as shown in pathway analysis usually has three main steps the first step is to calculate the association of each genes expression pattern with phenotype which is often evaluated by t statistics or correlations the second step is to map the genes into a predefined pathway database and compute the enrichment evidence score of a pathway which summarizes association scores of genes in the pathway finally the p value and q value of each pathway are calculated based on an appropriate permutation_test the first nave way for pathway analysis is to compare the number of differentially_expressed de genes in and outside a pathway using fishers_exact this method was improved by gene_set gsea an innovative method that consider the gene_order and is based on association strength with phenotype instead of indicator of being a de gene or not despite the popularity of gsea later studies have reported its low_statistical tian and geoman discussed the statistical_framework of pathway analysis and tian proposed two powerful procedures one permuting genes and the other permuting samples introduced a random set approach efron and tibshirani further improved gsea by introducing a maxmean procedure and a re standardization procedure the wide_applications of microarray_technology have led to an explosion of gene_expression studies publicly_available however the noisy nature of microarray_data together with the relatively small_sample in each study often results in inconsistent biological conclusions therefore methods for synthesizing multiple microarray_studies are in tremendous need meta_analysis a set of statistical_techniques to combine results from several studies has been recently applied to microarray_analysis to increase the reliability and robustness of results from individual studies in traditional statistics literature fishers statistic sum of log_transformed p values minimum p value statistic and maximum p value statistic have been proposed and compared for combining microarray_studies current meta_analysis in the biological_literature contains a widespread use of naive intersection union operations or simple counting of appearances in the de gene_lists obtained from individual studies under certain criteria e g false_discovery and many more one can quickly note that intersections arepage mapeoften too conservative and unions are anticonservative especially when the number of studies increases was the first to apply fishers method to microarray_data for a real sense of meta_analysis many other approaches have been proposed since then including random_effects latent_variable approach and bayesian approaches currently meta_analysis methods for microarray_studies are mostly aimed at combining different studies to identify de genes an analysis at the gene level however de gene analysis has two main shortcomings first the identified de genes often do not directly relate to the phenotype of interest second a gene_set from an important pathway may act in concert with moderate activities which cannot be detected by de gene analysis while the pathway may have important biological_effects on the phenotype of concern pathway analysis has an inherent advantage for work with meta_analysis it is well known that the lists of de genes from independent studies associated with the same phenotype often have little overlap while pathway analysis often generates improved consistency this situation motivates us to develop systematic approaches of meta_analysis for pathway enrichment mape which provides a more robust and powerful_tool than standard gene_set in this article we investigate two natural approaches of mape by combining statistical_significance across studies at the gene level mape g before pathway analysis or at the pathway level mape p after pathway analysis and c simulation_results and applications to real_datasets show their complementary advantages under different scenarios we thus introduce an integrated method mape i that incorporates the advantages of both mape g and mape p mape g and mape p have been implicitly or explicitly used in a few publications while a systematic methodology and a rigorous evaluation have not been investigated to our knowledge this is the first article to systematically develop and evaluate meta_analysis for pathway analysis in microarray_studies presents the general framework of pathway_enrichment for single study and three variations of mape methods proposed in this article d mape g combines p value information from multiple studies at the gene level in step ii of in contrast mape p integrates p values at the pathway level in step iii of since mape g and mape p have complementary advantages under different scenarios that will be demonstrated by extensive simulations in a later section a hybrid form of mape i is proposed into incorporate merits of both methods mathematical notations and data_structure ofare described below describes framework for pathway analysis in a single study suppose a data matrix x gs g g s s represents the gene_expression intensity of gene g and sample s a binary phenotype label is available for each sample y s s s and y s e g represents normal patients and represents tumor patients a pathway database matrix z gp g g p p represents the pathway_information of p pathways where z gp when gene g belongs to pathway p and z gp otherwise in step i of the association score with phenotype in each gene g is first calculated as t g usually by t statistics or a correlation measure in step ii a pathway enrichment evidence score v p is calculated for each pathway pand c denote by x kgs k k g g s s k the expression intensity of gene g and sample s in study k y ks k k s s k and y ks represents the phenotype label for sample s in study k shows the procedure for the mape g method in step i the association scores with phenotype are calculated in each study i e t gk g g k k in step ii meta_analysis is performed for biomarker_detection and produces a new association score after meta_analysis at the gene level i e u g g g in step iii the pathway_enrichment is performed as in step ii in the evidence scores v p corresponding q values q v p and a list of enriched pathways are then generated this method can be viewed as a natural combination of meta_analysis for biomarker_detection steps i and ii and pathway_enrichment step iii in a sequential manner rhodes has implicitly performed similar analysis by first querying de genes from meta_analysis and then assess pathway enrichment using the kegg_database for mape g proposed in this article we replace the ad_hoc two stage procedure with a unified evaluation by permutation_test in the framework for mape p is shown the step i of association scores for each study is identical to that in mape g in step ii instead of performing meta_analysis at the gene level we performed pathway_enrichment in each individual study to obtain the studywise pathway enrichment evidence scores v pk k k p p the meta_analysis on the pathway level was then performed in step iii to derive the combined evidence score w p finally the corresponding q values q w p are assessed by permutation_test
