gene_expression r ebcoexpress an empirical bayesian_framework for discovering differential co expression r ebcoexpress implements the approach of dawson and kendziorski using r a freely_available open_source statistical programming_language the approach identifies differential co expression dc by examining the correlations among gene_pairs using an empirical bayesian_approach producing a false_discovery controlled list of dc pairs this interrogation of dc gene_pairs complements but is distinct from differential_expression under the general goal of understanding differential regulation across biological conditions availability_and r ebcoexpress is freely_available and hosted on bioconductor a source file and vignette may be found atthe freely_available r r development core package r ebcoexpress implements the algorithm of an empirical bayesian_approach for identifying differentially co expressed dc gene_pairs microarray and related high_throughput genomic experiments seek to identify genes that vary across biological conditions this is often accomplished by identifying genes with changes in mean expression_level so_called differentially_expressed de genes for a review see although useful major biological_insights have resulted far less frequently than originally expected this is in part because diseases can manifest due to a de or re regulation of genes that does not significantly affect each genes average expression thus identifying other types of differential regulation may increase our ability to distinguish between groups and provide insight into their distinct etiologies for a discussion see de la fuente we focus on dc gene_pairs where co expression refers to some measure of correlation early methods for identifying dc gene_pairs conduct pair specific tests for selected pairs within a condition identify those pairs that are strongly or significantly co expressed and declare pairs to be dc if they are co expressed in one condition but not another unfortunately these approaches sacrifice considerable power by conducting analyses separately to whom correspondence should be addressed within condition and they do not provide probabilistic statements regarding the likelihood that a particular pair is dc these issues are largely addressed bytheir extension of the traditional f test to accommodate changes in means and correlations has been shown to be overly conservative also since their test_statistic simultaneously quantifies de and dc selection of a pair provides no information about whether the pair is de dc or both the approach implemented in ebcoexpress provides a false_discovery fdr controlled list of significant dc gene_pairs without sacrificing power it is applicable within a single study as well as across multiple studies for more information on the underlying theory simulations and an application please see our original paper in biometrics for a fully worked example with details at each step of the analysis please see the vignette that accompanies the r ebcoexpress package
