clustering s rrna for otu prediction a method of unsupervised bayesian clustering motivation with the advancements of next_generation it is now possible to study samples directly obtained from the environment particularly s_rrna have been frequently used to profile the diversity of organisms in a sample however such studies are still taxed to determine both the number of operational_taxonomic otus and their relative_abundance in a sample results to address these challenges we propose an unsupervised bayesian clustering method termed clustering s rrna for otu prediction crop crop can find clusters based on the natural organization of data without setting a hard cutoff threshold as required by hierarchical clustering_methods by applying our method to several datasets we demonstrate that crop is robust against sequencing_errors and that it produces more accurate results than conventional hierarchical clustering_methods availability_and source_code freely_available at the followingin recent_years the development of next_generation has made it possible to directly sequence a huge amount of high_quality dna rna_fragments extracted from environmental_samples in an acceptable time period meanwhile analytical_tools have been developed including multiple_sequence pairwise_alignments global local and clustering by which we are able to address the fundamental problems in metagenomics in particular the distribution abundance and co occurrence of microorganisms in given environmental_samples recent_studies that such information may indicate environmental changes or disease conditions to whom correspondence should be addressed s_rrna are widely used to infer the phylogenetic_relationship between organisms that is by comparing two s_rrna biologists can determine_whether they belong to the same genus using a conventional threshold of dissimilarity or the same species using a conventional threshold of dissimilarity although the validity of using these thresholds has not been proven by combining sequence comparison with hierarchical clustering_methods programs such as dotur and its current version mothur and esprit can partition s rrna sequence_data into clusters then by using a predefined dissimilarity threshold these methods can in turn report sequence clusters satisfying certain criteria complete average single_linkage in hierarchical_clustering the complete linkage and the average linkage methods are more widely used than the single_linkage method however a common problem with these clustering_methods is the sensitivity of the results to the dissimilarity threshold such that even a slight_change can result in very different clusters furthermore the inevitable sequencing_errors as well as the unknown structure of microorganisms underlying an environmental sample make it very difficult to find the optimal threshold for hierarchical_clustering for these reasons the otherwise simple choice of and thresholds becomes problematic and may result in the overestimation of operational_taxonomic otus showed that hierarchical clustering_methods overestimated the number of otus in a given sample when sequencing_errors occurred potentially leading to faulty conclusions also explained that distance calculated from multiple_alignment was in general larger than those calculated from pairwise_alignments and thus might also result in overestimation of the number of otus in addition to the aforementioned reasons schloss listed and analyzed many other factors that may result in overestimation of hierarchical_clustering many groups have taken steps to address these problems for example mothur included a single_linkage preclustering module to merge similar sequences before clustering and pyronoise was developed to remove sequencing_errors to alleviate the overestimation of the number of otus the large size of datasets currently being produced by the nextgeneration sequencing_machines accounts for still another challenge in clustering s rrna sequences in the process of hierarchical_clustering it is necessary to calculate a distance_matrix by comparingpage
