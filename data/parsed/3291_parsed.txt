systems_biology novel human lncrna disease association inference based on lncrna expression_profiles motivation more and more evidences have indicated that longnon coding rnas lncrnas play_critical many important biological_processes therefore mutations and dysregulations of these lncrnas would contribute to the development of various complex_diseases developing powerful computational_models for potential disease related lncrnas identification would benefit biomarker identification and drug_discovery for human disease diagnosis treatment prognosis and prevention results in this article we proposed the assumption that similar diseases tend to be associated with functionally_similar lncrnas then we further developed the method of laplacian regularized least_squares for lncrnadisease association lrlslda in the semisupervised learning framework although known disease lncrna associations in the database are rare lrlslda still obtained an auc of in the leave_one significantly improving the performance of previous methods we also illustrated the performance of lrlslda is not sensitive even robust to the parameters selection and it can obtain a reliable performance in all the test classes plenty of potential diseaselncrna associations were publicly released and some of them have been confirmed by recent results in biological_experiments it is anticipated that lrlslda could be an effective and important biological tool for biomedical_research availability the code of lrlslda is freely_available asdcd amss ac cn software details it is well known that genetic_information is stored in proteincoding_genes which are referred to as the central dogma of molecular_biology therefore rna is only considered to be an intermediary between a dna_sequence and its encoded_protein during a considerable long period recent_studies that protein_coding account for only a small fraction of the human_genome in other words of the human_genome does not encode protein_sequences especially it has been observed that the proportion of nonprotein coding_sequence increases with the complexity of organisms these facts challenge forementioned traditional view of rna furthermore accumulating_evidences have shown that non_coding ncrnas normally play_a in various biological_processes specially longnon coding rnas lncrnas are a class of important ncrnas with the length nt in the past_few increasing number of lncrnas have been discovered in eukaryotic_organisms ranging from nematodes to humans with the rapid development of both experimental technology and computational_methods it has also been shown that the expression levels of lncrnas appear to be lower than proteincoding_genes and some lncrnas have high tissue_specificity accumulating_evidences have indicated that plenty of lncrnas play_critical many important biological_processes including transcription translation splicing differentiation epigenetic_regulation immune_responses cell_cycle control and so on therefore mutations and dysregulations of lncrnas are associated with a broad range of human_diseases such as cancers cardiovascular_diseases and neurodegeneration diseases for example lncrna hotair pca and uca have been treated as potential biomarker of hepatocellular_carcinoma recurrence prostate_cancer aggressiveness van and bladder_cancer diagnosis respectively therefore identifying potential human disease related lncrnas can facilitate not only the understanding of molecular_mechanisms of human disease at lncrna level but also biomarker identification for human disease diagnosis treatment prognosis and prevention so_far plenty of studies have generated a large amount of lncrna related biological data about sequence expression function and so on these datasets to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com have been stored in some publicly_available databases such as nred lncrnadb noncode however only relatively few lncrnadisease associations have been reported developing powerful computational_models based on these datasets to predict potential diseaselncrna associations on a large_scale has been treated as one of the most important topics of lncrnas and diseases computational_model can provide most promising lncrnadisease associations for further experimental_validation hence decrease the time and cost of biological_experiments in the previous work we have manually collected experimentally reported diseaselncrna associations and constructed the first lncrnadisease association database lncrnadisease http cmbi bjmu edu cn lncrnadisease this database has included lncrnadisease associations lncrnas and diseases and laid the solid data fundament for lncrna related predictive research furthermore we obtained an important conclusion that lncrnas tend to be related to the same disease as their genomic neighbor genes and developed a simple lncrnadisease association prediction method based on the genomic_context of a given lncrna the conclusion obtained in this study laid the solid theoretical fundament for diseaselncrna association prediction research based on this conclusion various disease related lncrna prediction_methods can be developed in this article we logically extended the basic assumption in the previous disease microrna mirna association prediction research and proposed the following assumption for disease related lncrna prediction similar diseases tend to be associated with functionally_similar lncrnas based on this assumption and the fact that selecting lncrnas that are not related to the given disease is currently difficult or even impossible we developed a computational_model of laplacian regularized least_squares for lncrnadisease association lrlslda in the semisupervised learning framework this method prioritizes the entire lncrnaome for disease of interest by integrating known phenome lncrnaome network obtained from the database of lncrnadisease disease similarity network and lncrna similarity network lrlslda is a global approach that can rank candidate diseaselncrna pairs for all the diseases simultaneously in the leave_one loocv lrlslda obtained the reliable auc of demonstrating superiority performance of lrlslda to previous methods and potential value for disease related lncrna prediction and biomarker_detection in the diagnosis treatment prognosis and prevention of human disease we also classified test_samples of lncrnadisease associations into distinct classes and lrlslda obtained reliable performance in different test classes plenty of potential diseaselncrna associations were publicly released for experimental_verification some of the associations have been confirmed by recent results in biological_experiments
