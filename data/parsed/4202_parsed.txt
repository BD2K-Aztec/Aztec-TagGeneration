sequence_analysis sequence_alignment visualization in html without java motivation java has been extensively used for the visualization of biological data in the web however the java runtime environment is an additional layer of software with an own set of technical_problems and security risks html in its new version provides features that for some tasks may render java unnecessary results alignment to html is the first html based_interactive visu_alization for annotated multiple_sequence the server side script interpreter can perform all tasks like i sequence retrieval ii alignment computation iii rendering iv identification of a homolo gous structural_models and v communication with biodas servers the rendered alignment can be included in web_pages and is displayed in all browsers on all platforms including touch screen tablets the functionality of the user_interface is similar to legacy java applets and includes color schemes highlighting of conserved and variable alignment positions row reordering by drag and drop interlinked d visualization and sequence groups novel features are i support for multiple_overlapping residue annotations such as chemical_modifications single_nucleotide and mutations ii mechanisms to quickly hide residue annotations iii export to ms word and iv sequence icons conclusion alignment to html the first interactive alignment visualization that runs in web_browsers without additional software confirms that to some extend html is already sufficient to display complex biological data the low_speed at which programs are executed in browsers is still the main obstacle nevertheless we envision an increased use of html and javascript for interactive biological software availability_and under gpl at http www bioinfor_matics org strap tohtml the amount of experimental sequence related data such as posttranslational_modifications ligand_binding and genetic_variants is rapidly_growing efficient web_based visualization facilitates understanding of the biological meaning of comprehensive data_sets advanced visualization of multiple_sequence msa includes sequence related information such as residue annotation color coding of physical_properties of residues secondary_structure and conservation variation a number of programs have been developed for non interactive rendering of msas alscript boxshade espript and texshade these programs generate an alignment figure according to a script file the script can be prepared manually in a text editor or dynamically by another program therefore these programs are suited to display computational results of web_services the generated alignment figures use vector_graphics formats for quality reasons but most browsers do not support vector image formats e g svg and external document viewers are required a further disadvantage is that these figures are static and lack interactivity interactive capabilities hyperlinks baloon messages and the option to shield information become increasingly important in the omics era java brought interactive functionality to web_pages and allows alignment manipulation in real_time owing to its cross_platform compatibility integrated graphics and high execution speed java is widely used but there are also five potential problems i failure to start java applications ii security violations iii browser crashes iv incompatibility on some platforms such as android os and v slowing of the computer today the web standard html is being increasingly used for interactive web_applications such as genome_browsers the main advantage is that html code is executed directly in the browsers without additional client side software a potential challenge with html code is that its execution is slow and we were wondering whether it would be sufficient for full featured msa visualization alignment to html is the first alignment visualization program for decorated msas using html featuring wrapped and one line sequence view rendering styles secondary_structure drag and drop pattern highlighting and several export options visualization is independent on plugins and therefore robust while providing a rich user_interface compared with existing software for alignment visualization alignmentto html provides novel functionality it has the ability to display multiple_overlapping residue annotations and the option to export the alignment directly to ms word and full featured alignment workbenches icons may symbolize species or biological_tissues underlining all biodas sequence_features for a uniprot entry may result in an overcrowded confusing alignmenttherefore check boxes and the trash bin enable reversible hiding of sequence_features although existing alignment rendering software like alscript espript boxshade texshade do not take care of alignment computation themselves alignment to html includes the entire logic for alignment generation rendering and annotation this involves data loading alignment computation d superposition identification of homologous d structures and loading of annotations from das servers currently the scripting language comprises commands and numerous sequence and d rendering styles html is sufficient for interactive alignment visualization it is robust because it runs directly in standard web_browsers without plugins java is still required for d visualization alignment to html can be used for bioinformatics web_services or for locally installed programs to generate html files it takes care of all computations toward a full rendered interactive msa conflict of interest none declared example of an interactive alignment view only a section of the scrollable alignment is visible the script consists of only three commands to load the pfam entry to associate d structures and to load annotations from das services an asparagine residue that has been clicked in the alignment is selected in the d view some sequence annotations are deactivated with check boxes or with the trash bin such as mature_protein region mpr
