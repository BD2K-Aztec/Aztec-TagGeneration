sequence_analysis pfp esg automated protein_function servers enhanced with gene_ontology visualization_tool protein_function pfp is an automated function prediction method that predicts gene_ontology go annotations for a protein_sequence using distantly_related sequences and contextual associations of go terms extended similarity group esg is another go prediction algorithm that makes predictions based on iterative sequence database_searches here we provide interactive web_servers for the pfp and esg algorithms that are equipped with an effective visualization of the go predictions in a hierarchical topology availability pfp esg servers are freely_available atthe rapid_growth of genomics and proteomics technologies has posed a major_challenge of large_scale automatic annotations of newly_sequenced data that awaits functional_interpretation advanced algorithms can often provide more accurate annotations with a larger coverage than conventional function prediction_methods that use homology as the source of information here we developed web_servers for our two sequence_based function prediction_algorithms protein_function pfp and extended similarity group esg pfp extends traditional psi blast_search by extracting and scoring gene_ontology go annotations from distantly similar sequences and by applying contextual associations of go terms observed in the annotation database to the scoring_scheme pfp was ranked the best in the function prediction category in the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure l esg performs an iterative sequence database_search and assigns a probability score to go terms based on its relative similarity_scores to the multiple level neighbors in a protein similarity graph esg was shown to outperform conventional methods in a thorough benchmark study in the large_scale community_based critical assessment of protein_function experiment esg was ranked fourth in predicting molecular_function go terms among participating groups thus both pfp and esg have been rigorously benchmarked both in the original papers and in objective assessments by the community predictive_performance of the two methods is discussed in supplementary data
