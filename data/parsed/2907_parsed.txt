metalpredator a web_server to predict iron_sulfur binding proteomes motivation the prediction of the ironsulfur proteome is highly_desirable for biomedical and biological_research but a freely_available tool to predict ironsulfur proteins has not been developed yet results we developed a web_server to predict ironsulfur proteins from protein_sequence s this tool called metalpredator is able to process complete proteomes rapidly with high recall and precision availability_and the web_server is freely_available at http metalweb cerm unifi it tools metalpredator metalloproteins are widespread in living_organisms and essential for many biological_processes misregulation of levels and usage of metal_ions in cells is associated with major diseases thus identifying potential metalloproteins is a crucial task not only for the functional characterization of proteins but also for applications in biomedical_research and drug_design furthermore knowledge on the complete ensemble of proteins that bind a specific metal i e each specific metalloproteome permits the study of how organisms evolved to adapt to different metal availability in their environments the experimental identification of metal_binding can be quite difficult and costly especially when attempted at the whole proteome scale consequently various bioinformatics approaches have been developed to predict the metal_binding in a single_sequence but they do not allow metalloproteomics data analyses some of the authors of the present article developed an initial prototype of a tool to predict metalloproteomes which however lacked a user_friendly interface we propose a novel computational_tool called metalpredator to predict metal_binding in protein_sequence s at the whole proteome scale the tool integrates an existing domain based_approach with a new one designed to search for metal binding_motifs found in proteins with known structure metalpredator uniquely combines global and local searches to define whether a protein is a potential metalloprotein to validate our general_methodology here we focused on the prediction of the ironsulfur fes proteome which has recently been the subject of an extensive body of experimental work worldwide fes clusters are among the most ancient biological metal cofactors and proteins that bind them ironsulfur proteins isp hereafter play crucial roles in many cellular_processes metalpredator is to our knowledge the only available tool that performs fes protein proteome prediction via a web_interface it featured a very good performance in terms of precision and recall metalpredator is available at http metalweb cerm unifi it tools metalpredator functional sites mfss stored in metalpdb into fragments each fragment is a continuous stretch of protein_sequence containing at least one metal ligand the library was built as described in it contains the profiles of both pfam domains for which the fes cluster ligands are known and domains annotated as fes cluster binding but lacking information on the ligands to build the library each isp in metalpdb was compared to uniref representative sequences using psi_blast all the hits with conserved ligands were used to build a sequence_profile from this profile we extracted the profiles of the distinct fragments corresponding to the mfs s in the initial input_sequence metalpredator uses the hmmscan tool to match every input_sequence to the profiles contained in the libraries an input_sequence is identified as a potential isp if at least one of these conditions applies a the profile of a domain with associated ligands library matches the sequence with an e value lower than and ligands are conserved in the sequence domain search with pattern filter b the profile of a domain with no information on ligands available library matches the sequence with an e value lower than domain search without pattern filter c all fragment profiles of a given mfs library match the sequence with an e value lower than and the corresponding ligands are conserved in the sequence mfs search d at least one fragment profile of a given mfs library matches the sequence with an e value lower than and the corresponding fragment ligands are conserved in the sequence fragment search we adjusted the above e value thresholds to have the best f measure for each criterion see supplementary this measure weighs precision more than recall thus reducing the number_of in the output as well as the experimental effort needed to validate the predictions for the calibration we used two datasets of sequences positives_and taken from a subset of the protein_data filtered at a sequence_identity level of pdb the positive dataset included all isps in pdb the negative dataset included pdb sequences that are not homologous to isps and either bind a metal_ion different from iron in metalpdb or are not metalloproteins but contain at least four cys
