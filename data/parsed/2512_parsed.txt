data_and integration and visualization of host pathogen data related to infectious_diseases motivation infectious_disease research is generating an increasing amount of disparate data on pathogenic systems there is a growing need for resources that effectively integrate analyze deliver and visualize these data both to improve our understanding of infectious_diseases and to facilitate the development of strategies for disease control and prevention results we have developed disease view an online hostpathogen resource that enables infectious_disease centric access analysis and visualization of hostpathogen interactions in this resource we associate infectious_diseases with corresponding pathogens provide information on pathogens pathogen virulence_genes and the genetic and chemical evidences for the human genes that are associated with the diseases we also deliver the relationships between pathogens genes and diseases in an interactive graph and provide the geolocation reports of associated diseases around the globe in real_time unlike many other resources we have applied an iterative user_centered process to the entire resource development including data_acquisition analysis and visualization availability_and freely_available www patricbrc org all major web_browsers supported infectious_diseases are complex systems involving multiple_organisms e g pathogens and hosts interacting across different environments and time scales much of the data that we have related to infectious_disease is multidimensional incomplete and likely to be biased in ways we do not fully understand in addition these data are often not integrated nor interoperable making_it for researchers from different disciplines to communicate and relate their work to others integrating these data remains a formidable challenge and although a handful of individual parts of the system an iterative process of gathering data interviewing representative users and evolving user_interface designs to develop and publically release patric disease view user_interfaces uis specifically we apply usability engineering a cost_effective user centered iterative process that ensures a high_level of effectiveness and efficiency in complex interactive user_interfaces our ultimate_goal is to use informatics frameworks to help reduce barriers in infectious_disease research and development by providing a broader_spectrum of infectious_disease pathogen host and outbreak data to enable infectious_disease centric access and analysis of hostpathogen interactions toward this end we have developed disease view a hostpathogen data and visualization resource that integrates diverse data_sources including host pathogen hostpathogen interactions and disease outbreak and provides a mechanism for infectious_disease centric data analysis and visualization we instantiate disease view as a component of patric a national_institutes nih national_institute of allergy and infectious_diseases niaid bioinformatics resource center containing a wealth of resources related to bacterial_pathogens
