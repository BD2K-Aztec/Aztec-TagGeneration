lca an entropy based measure for taxonomic_assignment within assembled metagenomes motivation a perennial problem in the analysis of environmental sequence_information is the assignment of reads or assembled sequences e g contigs or scaffolds to discrete taxonomic bins in the absence of reference_genomes for most environmental microorganisms the use of intrinsic nucleotide patterns and phylogenetic anchors can improve assembly dependent binning needed for more accurate taxonomic and functional_annotation in communities of microorganisms and assist in identifying mobile_genetic or lateral_gene events results here we present a statistic called lca inspired by information and voting theories that uses the ncbi taxonomic database hierarchy to assign taxonomy to contigs assembled from environmental sequence_information the lca algorithm identifies a sufficiently strong majority on the hierarchy while minimizing entropy changes to the observed taxonomic distribution resulting in improved statistical_properties moreover we apply results from the order statistic literature to formulate a likelihood_ratio hypothesis_test and p value for testing the supremacy of the assigned lca taxonomy using simulated and real_world datasets we empirically demonstrate that voting based_methods majority vote and lca in the presence of known reference annotations are consistently more accurate in identifying contig taxonomy than the lowest_common algorithm popularized by megan and that lca taxonomy strikes a balance between specificity and confidence to provide an estimate appropriate to the available information in the data availability the lca has been implemented as a stand alone python_library compatible with the metapathways pipeline both of which are available on github with installation_instructions and use casesthe rise of next_generation has generated a tidal wave of sequencing_projects in natural and engineered ecosystems resulting in a plethora of environmental sequence_information several software pipelines including mg rast meyer to whom correspondence should be humann and metapathways have been developed to process environmental sequence_information provide taxonomic and functional_annotations and assist in metabolic_pathway despite the availability of these pipelines accurately assigning taxonomy to environmental sequence_information remains a challenging enterprise given a general lack of reference_genomes for most uncultivated microorganisms from a bioinformatics perspective current software_tools lack statistical frameworks and hypotheses tests for the assignment of reads or assembled_contigs to discrete taxonomic bins leaving developers and investigators with limited theoretical direction due to the popularity of the megan software the lowestcommon ancestor lca method is routinely applied to individual open_reading orf annotations with a correction based on homology_search quality statistics while using lca to assign individual orf taxonomy seems straightforward it is unclear how to effectively apply this rule to contigs or scaffolds containing multiple orfs consider an alternative perspective of electing a representative taxonomy where each qualifying orf annotation votes for overall contig assignment in this election individual orfs may have differing taxonomic opinions projecting their vote differently onto the tree of life two popular voting theory results provide justification in choosing a majority as the correct response condorcets jury theorem considers an election of two opinions one correct and one incorrect and voters each independently choose one of these two opinions with the assumption that they choose the correct response with probability p the observed majority converges in probability to the correct decision as the election size grows to infinity alternatively feige and colleagues studied the depth of noisy decision_trees where each query at a node produces the correct_answer with some probability p they derived tight bounds on the number of queries required to compute threshold and parity functions and analyze a noisy comparison model with tight bounds on comparison sorting selection and merging however applying these voting theory methods to taxonomic count_data is complicated by the hierarchical definitions for instance individual orfs predicted on the same contig may be assigned to differentlets work lca through an illustrative example where taxonomic annotations are quite variable and dispersed a simple majority method choosing the taxonomy with the most annotations may be intuitive but a majority of out of taxa is not very convincing alternatively to combat this dispersion it might be a good idea to elect the lca as the majority but this very conservative estimate manifests limited resolving_power e g root prokaryotes etc in the case of individual orf annotations lca estimates would be made less extreme by discarding annotations that do not meet certain quality thresholds on the evolutionary assumption that hits to taxa phylogenetically further away from the origin will be less similar however in the case of assembled environmental sequence_information e g contigs or scaffolds this is often not an option because common practice summarizes annotations via some taxonomic estimation method e g best blast lca lca takes a bottom up approach by expanding the specific simple majority estimate upwards in the taxonomic hierarchy progressively collapsing annotations until a satisfying majority an majority is obtained here we can leverage relevant voting theory results like condorcets jury theorem and the work of feige on noisy decision_trees to justify a proportion however there remains the issue of how to collapse the tree automatically as collapsing arbitrarily can introduce significant bias here we will use the information_theoretic interpretation of entropy to motivate an algorithm of collapsing annotations in a principled way since the application of information_entropy is relatively rare in microbial_ecology outside of diversity estimation we will provide a brief introduction that will help in the understanding and motivation of lca entropy shannons entropy is the fundamental unit of information defined as the average amount of information needed to specify the state of a random variable intuitively it can be described as a measure of uncertainty the uniform random variable a situation where all outcomes are equally likely has the highest possible uncertainty and therefore the highest entropy while a more spiked random variable has less uncertainly and therefore less entropy entropy is an extremely useful concept and has been central to the development of coding theory e g file compression cryptography and signal_processing moreover differences in entropy also known as relative entropy or the kullback_leibler divergence are used as a measure for the divergence between two probability_distributions for example in machine_learning random_forest classifiers use entropy as a measure of separation quality and it is used to identify the most discriminating separations in a hierarchy of classifier models the lca algorithm uses the concept of entropy to measure the amount of change that collapsing annotations up the tree to a particular node will cause calculating an majority while minimizing the change in entropy of the taxonomic distribution as much as possible the performance of lca was compared against two other taxonomic estimation methods lca and majority lca is the application of the lca algorithm to the taxonomic annotations of a contig while majority is a simple majority method where taxonomy is ascribed to the most number of annotations supplementary_file section s we evaluated the relative prediction_performance of the three methods against two sets of simulated metagenomic contigs with and without target_genes in the annotation database and one set of contigs from microbial dark_matter mdm single_cell amplified genomes sags obtained from the genomic encyclopedia of bacteria and archaea geba mdm project a united_states department of energy joint genome institute jgi initiative for sequencing thousands of bacterial and archaeal genomes from diverse branches of the tree of life section in general the voting based measures majority and lca outperformed lca using both the simple walk and weighted taxonomic distance wtd distances see methods in both the small randomly_sampled contigs from taxa and large randomly_sampled contigs from taxa simulations as well as the geba mdm contigs lca and majority had simple walk distances closer to zero when compared with lca with reference annotations removed from the target_database distances of all three measures were significantly_increased in magnitude and variability with voting based measures offering only a marginal improvement a similar pattern was observed with the wtd but here lca is more penalized for predictions widely outside their original taxonomic lineage here lca predictions near the root caused a cluster of negative wtd values in the geba mdm contigs again the removal of reference annotations increased wtd distances in terms of magnitude and variability with the voting based measures offering relatively minor improvement from a regression_analysis perspective it is also possible to express these distances as error measurements and calculate the root_mean rmse as a measure of accuracy here the voting based_methods exhibited smaller rmse values in all cases but were only significantly different at the confidence_level in the large simulation and geba mdm contigs when measured by the wtd without reference annotations there was a trend to smaller rmse values in the voting based_methods but there was no significant has numerous impossibility results that challenge all three of the common_sense principles of voting preserving majority rule requiring a minimum_level of core support and rewarding sincere voters taxonomic reconciliation between ncbi tree entries and ribosomal_rna gene or cog
