prediction of microrna targets in caenorhabditis_elegans using a self organizing map motivation micrornas mirnas are small_non that regulate transcriptional processes via binding to the target_gene mrna in animals this binding is imperfect which makes the computational_prediction of animal mirna_targets a challenging_task the accuracy of mirna_target can be improved with the use of machine_learning previous work has described methods using supervised_learning but they suffer from the lack of adequate training examples a common problem in mirna target_identification which often leads to deficient generalization ability results in this work we introduce mirsom a mirna_target prediction_tool based on clustering of short untranslated_region utr substrings with self organizing map som as our method uses unsupervised_learning and a large set of verified caenorhabditis_elegans utrs we did not need to resort to training using a known set of targets our method outperforms seven other methods in predicting the experimentally_verified c elegans true and false mirna_targets availability mirsom mirna_target predictions are available atmicrornas mirnas are an abundant class of small noncoding_rnas found in diverse organisms mirnas direct the post transcriptional_repression and degradation of mrnas by binding to their sequence with partially complementary sites and thus impact a variety of biological_functions including cell_differentiation organism growth development and tumor_suppression while the amount of published mirnas is increasing and a large_number is predicted to be regulated by mirnas only a small fraction of mirnatarget genes are experimentally_verified for example there are now caenorhabditis_elegans mirnas annotated in mirbase database but only entries for six of these mirnas in the latest release of tarbase as experimental identification to whom correspondence should be addressed of mirna_targets is difficult the computational_prediction of the target_genes is a valuable_tool to investigate mirna functions and in guiding related wetlab experiments occurrence of perfect seed matches seed the nucleotides of the mirna end from the untranslated_region utr of the mrna evolutionary_conservation of the mirnatarget relationship and the free_energy g of the mirna mrna duplex are the most often used determinants in mirna target_recognition however in animals mirna binding to the mrna is imperfect and a perfect seed matching site is neither necessary nor sufficient for downregulation thus the importance of mirna base_pairing to compensate for weak seed pairing has become another factor in identifying potential mirna_targets also the sequence_context of the mirna target_site and the amount of sites in a utr are suggested to have effect on the mirna binding efficacy in all the predictions given by different tools are diverse and the amount of overlapping mirna target_gene predictions is small the use of machine_learning can improve the accuracy of mirna_target however the performance of these methods is dependent on the quantity and quality of the dataset used in the training the number of experimentally_validated mirna true and false targets is small and while we have some knowledge about mirna binding to the target_site our knowledge regarding false target_sites is limited this problem can be avoided by using unsupervised_learning in this work we show how the selforganizing map som can be used to identify potential mirna_target from c elegans utr sequences the som is a neural_network algorithm widely used to categorize large high_dimensional by mapping the data into a smaller dimension typically into a d lattice of interconnected neurons each neuron of the som contains a reference model which represents a local domain in the input space in bioinformatics som is applied to problems like gene_expression study of codon_usage clustering of protein_sequences gene_finding and identification of transcription_factor we trained the som using short substrings of c elegans utr sequences so that the putative target_sites for each mirna were clustered in one or in two adjacent neurons in the lattice as the clustering is based on theoverall similarity of the training strings the som captures not only those verified mirna_target with perfect mer and mer seed matches but also those sites with more imperfect matches the som contains the whole repertoire of putative mirna_target ordered according to similar seed complementarity so it likely includes also the target predictions for currently unknown mirnas we have here introduced a new machine_learning method mirsom for mirna_target finding our method is founded on the basic_knowledge about mirna_target these sites have imperfect complementarity with the mirna sequence where the most crucial part is the mirna_seed these sites are preferentially located in the utr of the transcript and they are accessible to mirna binding this means that a chunk of short substrings of the utrs are mirna_target we sought these sites by clustering short utr substrings with the som the training data consisted of all possible nt_long substrings extracted from verified c elegans utrs and the trained som contains besides the information about the target_sites of mirnas known today also a view of the mutual similarity of mirna sequences the fact that of the mirna clusters reside in a single_neuron of the lattice implies that the som is well organized and it is quite probable that also the clusters for mirnas yet to be found from c elegans are located in one or two nearby neurons of the map once trained the som can be applied not only to find putative targets for new c elegans mirnas but also to find the targets for the orthologous mirnas in other worms thus enabling the study of target conservation as mirsom uses only the filtering by site accessibility to post process the initial target_sites obtained from the som it opens up a simplification to the mirna_target but still works well in finding the verified mirna_target while keeping the number of predictions moderate a common problem in mirna_target finding is the small number of experimentally_verified mirnatarget genes which has hindered efforts to develop machine_learning for target prediction tasks in particular this makes it hard to build a supervised model whose performance is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the positive_and training_datasets used the unsupervised_learning algorithm used by mirsom clusters the putative target_sites for each mirna objectively using no knowledge about the verified true and false targets until the optimal total free_energy threshold for the site accessibility is defined when compared with nbmirtar a method using supervised machine_learning mirsom finds of the experimentally_verified targets while nbmirtar predicts of these are the two best results in the comparison tables and since both of these tools are also very specific in their predictions it suggests that mirna_target truly can be improved by the use of machine_learning the standard som algorithm has some limitations like the non adaptable fixed architecture which is relative to the expected number and structure of the clusters instead of using an algorithm that would adaptively determine the number of clusters we searched experimentally for such size and weighting schema for the standard som that would work best in this particular problem as the solution does not necessarily need a more sophisticated architecture we decided to keep the original som algorithm which is well known and easy to understand mirsom finds well those verified mirna_targets which include a perfect mer or mer seed match and also most of those target_genes with a shorter or otherwise imperfect mirna_seed match it also successfully rejects the sites from known false target_genes with a perfect seed match by using the total_energy filter to the initial prediction set the energy threshold used which relies on just a few verified mirnatarget gene interactions presently available should be adjusted as more mirnatarget genes in c elegans are verified also the som used in the initial target_site finding step is trained with verified utr data so it may be not suitable for finding mirna_target from other sequence_data for example from utrs and the coding_region this is because the sequence characteristics like nucleotide_composition and functional_elements of these regions of mrna differ from the utrs and the clustering result using these sequences would likely be different we demonstrate here that mirsom can identify targets in nematodes and it should be possible to construct soms for other species future_studies will be aimed at verifying targets in more complex organisms such as human and mice
