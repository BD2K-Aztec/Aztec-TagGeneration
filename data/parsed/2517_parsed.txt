integration of somatic_mutation expression and functional data reveals potential driver_genes predictive of breast_cancer survival downloaded from motivation genome and transcriptome analyses can be used to explore cancers comprehensively and it is increasingly common to have multiple omics_data measured from each individual furthermore there are rich functional data such as predicted impact of mutations on protein_coding and gene protein networks however integration of the complex information across the different omics and functional data is still challenging clinical validation particularly based on patient_outcomes such as survival is important for assessing the relevance of the integrated information and for comparing different procedures results an analysis_pipeline is built for integrating genomic and transcriptomic alterations from whole exome and rna sequence_data and functional data from protein_function and gene_interaction the method accumulates evidence for the functional_implications of mutated potential driver_genes found within and across patients a driver gene score dgscore is developed to capture the cumulative_effect of such genes to contribute to the score a gene has to be frequently mutated with high or moderate mutational impact at protein level exhibiting an extreme expression and functionally linked to many differentially_expressed neighbors in the functional gene network the pipeline is applied to matched tumor and normal samples of the same patient from the cancer_genome breast_cancer project in clinical validation patients with high dgscores have worse_survival than those with low scores p furthermore the dgscore outperforms the established expression based signatures mammaprint and pam in predicting patient_survival in conclusion integration of mutation expression and functional data allows identification of clinically_relevant potential driver_genes in cancer availability_and the documented pipeline including annotated sample scripts can be found inanalysis of genome and transcriptome sequencing_experiments provides a comprehensive tool for molecular studies of cancers the cancer_genome tcga breast_cancer project presents a rich dataset of wholeexome and rna sequence_data of matched tumor and normal samples of the same patient these allow us to accurately infer tumorspecific alterations including somatic_mutations and isoform level differential_expression however it is still a challenge how to subsequently integrate the complex information across the different omics_data while also exploiting the rich functional data such as protein prediction and gene protein_interaction most carcinomas are driven to develop by a few genetic_alterations whereas the majority of the remaining genetic changes have neutral or less deleterious_effect in cancer development to date potential driver_genes are identified largely based on finding recurrent copy_number or mutations in a specific region across multiple samples but not on patient specific genomic_alterations in this article we develop a full analysis_pipeline to combine dna and rna sequencing_data together with functional data starting from the preprocessing of raw aligned sequencing_reads to search for potential driver_genes and eventually to summarize the effects of these genes into a single driver gene score dgscore in addition to using existing bioinformatics_tools including gatk snpeff and sequgio we suggest a novel method based on the network enrichment_analysis nea to integrate the genomic and transcriptomic profiles there is a growing_literature on searching for driver_genes based on data_integration we can state at least two novel aspects in this study i isoform level analysis because exon lengths are not multiples of three the potential protein_coding impact of one mutation is different for different isoforms hence isoform level assessment is necessary ii clinical validation we assess the clinical_relevance of the potential drivers in terms of correlation with patient_outcomes such as survival most current integrative methods in identifying cancer_driver are based on whole genes and are primarily validated based on previously_reported drivers and pathway analysis but not clinically identified some known drivers of melanoma and two of the predicted drivers were demonstrated to be critical for tumor_growth with knockdown experiments youn andproposed a method that accounts for the functional impact of mutations on protein_coding a sample variation in background_mutation and the redundancy of the genetic_code they analyzed a dataset of non small cell lung_tumors to show that the identified driver_genes were also deemed important previously developed the so_called memo algorithm and showed that it was able to recapitulate previously_identified pathways in glioblastoma and ovarian_cancer potential driver_genes were used for histological subtyping in lung_cancer or to reveal intrinsic subtype specific mutations in breast_cancer caerus focuses on investigation of biological_network disruptions linked to cancer outcomes at the protein domain level but it does not take into account the impact of mutations on rna expression and protein_coding dawnrank a recently_published algorithm directly prioritizes altered genes on a single patient scope regardless of mutation_frequency dawnrank requires information of a gene interaction_network somatic genomic_alterations and the differential gene_expression but it does not consider the predicted biological impact of a mutation on protein helios incorporates somatic copy_number point_mutations gene_expression and rnai screens to pinpoint driver_genes with large recurrently amplified regions of dna in summary these methods do not utilize isoform level information and the potential drivers are generally not validated in terms of patients clinical_outcomes such as survival as genetic_instability caused by mutations in multiple critical genes may be central to tumor_progression we summarize the effects of potential driver_genes into a single value dgscore and assess its clinical value as prognostic_biomarker in our analysis of the tcga breast_cancer data there is a strong evidence that patients carrying more mutated genes with functional_implications and extreme expression pattern have worse survival_rates than those with less mutated potential driver_genes over the last decade a number of studies have developed gene_signatures for prognostic classification of breast_cancer among the most well known mammaprint van t captures the expression_profile of gene associated with prognosis and has been shown to be a better predictor for distant_metastasis than the clinical parameters the so_called pam signature classifies breast_cancer into intrinsic molecular_subtypes and has been shown to add significant prognostic value for the tcga breast_cancer data as predictor of patient_survival the dgscore based on the potential driver_genes outperforms the gene mammaprint and the gene pam signatures in summary integration of omics and functional data have the potential to produce clinically valuable information we develop a practical analysis_pipeline to perform somatic variant_calling gene and isoform_expression quantification and the integration of genomic and transcriptomic profiles based on known biological_network and the functional impact on protein_coding using this methodology we show that breast_cancer patients who carry more mutated genes with functional_implications and extreme expression pattern have worse_survival than those with less potential driver_genes
