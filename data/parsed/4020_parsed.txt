r jive for exploration of multi source molecular data the integrative_analysis of multiple high_throughput data_sources that are available for a common sample set is an increasingly common_goal in biomedical_research joint and individual variation explained jive is a tool for exploratory dimension_reduction that decomposes a multi source dataset into three terms a low_rank approximation capturing joint variation across sources low_rank approximations for structured variation individual to each source and residual noise jive has been used to explore multi source data for a variety of application areas but its accessibility was previously limited we introduce r jive an intuitive r package to perform jive and visualize the results we discuss several improvements and extensions of the jive methodology that are included we illustrate the package with an application to multi source breast_tumor data fromin biomedical_research a growing number of platforms and technologies are used to assess diverse but related information this has motivated a number of methods for the integrative_analysis of multisource data wherein multiple different sources of omics_data are available for a common sample set a good guiding principle for analyzing multi source data is to simultaneously model features that are shared across multiple sources and features that are specific to a particular source a number of recent methods have adopted this strategy extending wellestablished techniques such as partial_least l fstedt and canonical_correlation non parametric bayesian modeling non negative factorization and simultaneous components analysis the joint and individual variation explained jive method was developed as a multi source extension of principal_components pca jive quantifies the amount of joint shared variation between data_sources reduces dimensionality and allows for visual_exploration of joint and individual source specific structure jive can also be used as a processing step prior to the application of other methods such as clustering techniques jive was designed for the analysis of biomedical data from multiple technologies but has been used for other diverse applications such as the analysis of data that were processed using different computational_pipelines and the analysis of rail commute patterns at different times of day previously only spartan matlab_code was available to perform jive in this note we introduce the r jive package for which our intentions are fold i to improve the accessibility of this method among the bioinformatics community ii to implement important extensions and improvements of the jive method and iii to allow for quick and flexible visualization of jive results
