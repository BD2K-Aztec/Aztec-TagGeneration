ms data core api an open_source metadata oriented library for computational proteomics the ms data core api is a free open_source library for developing computational prote omics tools and pipelines the application_programming written in java enables rapid tool creation by providing a robust pluggable programming interface and common data model the data model is based on controlled_vocabularies ontologies and captures the whole range of data types included in common proteomics experimental workflows going from spectra to pep tide protein_identifications to quantitative results the library contains readers for three of the most used proteomics standards initiative standard file_formats mzml mzidentml and mztab in addition to mzml it also supports other common mass_spectra data_formats dta ms mgf pkl apl text_based mzxml and mzdata xml_based also it can be used to read pride xml the original format used by the pride database one of the world leading proteomics resources finally we present a set of algorithms and tools whose implementation illustrates the simplicity of developing applications using the library the proteomics standards initiative psi has developed and actively promotes the use of open standard data_formats to represent the data produced in mass_spectrometry ms based proteomics experiments including technical and biological metadata three of the most broadly used formats are mzml to capture the primary data the spectra and chromatograms mzidentml to report peptide_identifications as well as the inferred protein_identifications and the tab_delimited mztab format that can represent both identification and quantification results there is increasing interest in new software_tools and libraries that can work with these standards as a result a set of software libraries in different programming_languages has been created however having these independent libraries for different formats can complicate the development of new software developers typically have to invest v c the author published_by
