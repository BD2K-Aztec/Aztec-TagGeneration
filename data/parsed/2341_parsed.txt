ienhancer l a two layer predictor for identifying enhancers and their strength by pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition motivation enhancers are of short regulatory_dna they can be bound with proteins activators to activate_transcription of a gene and hence play_a in promoting gene_transcription in eukaryotes with the avalanche of dna_sequences generated in the post genomic age it is a challenging_task to develop computational_methods for timely identifying enhancers from extremely complicated dna_sequences although some efforts have been made in this regard they were limited at only identifying whether a query dna_element being of an enhancer or not according to the distinct levels of biological_activities and regulatory_effects on target_genes however enhancers should be further classified into strong and weak ones in strength results in view of this a two layer predictor called ienhancer l was proposed by formulating dna elements with the pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition into which the six dna local parameters were incorporated to the best of our knowledge it is the first computational predictor ever established for identifying not only enhancers but also their strength rigorous cross_validation tests have indicated that ienhancer l holds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome_analysis availability_and for the convenience of most experimental scientists a web_server for the two layer predictor was established at http bioinformatics hitsz edu cn ienhancer l by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details enhancers are distinct genomic_regions that can upregulate transcription of target_genes through interaction with transcription_factors tfs in contrast to gene proximal elements such as promoters enhancers are distal elements that can be kb or further away from a gene or even located on a different chromosome this feature makes the prediction of enhancer a challenging_task experimental methods such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by deep_sequencing can successfully detect many regulatory enhancers by targeting enhancer binding tf such as p but tf only binds to enhancers in a cell specific_manner not all of the functional enhancers are occupied by a certain tf besides active enhancers are nucleosome depleted open regions which display deoxyribonuclease or dnase_i but many other dna elements such as promoters are also accessible by dnase_i the histones in the flanking nucleosomes of enhancer often carry characteristic post_translational accordingly genome_wide mapping of histone_modifications allows accurate determination and classification of enhancers and promoters for instance the open_chromatin flanked by histone_modifications such as h_k and h k ac have been classified as strong enhancers while the regions flanked by h_k classified as weak enhancers these kinds of techniques have now been widely used and the results thus obtained are quite consistent with the enhancer_activity assays unfortunately the experimental methods by the aforementioned authors are expensive_and therefore several computational_methods were developed in an attempt to timely predict enhancers in genomes these methods differ in operation algorithms and input_features for instance developed a predictor called csi ann by using an artificial_neural ann approach combined with efficient data transformation and feature_extraction fernandez and miranda saavedra proposed a support_vector svm classifier called chromegensvm by employing a genetic_algorithm to optimize specific histone epigenetic_marks in feature_selection process using the random_forest algorithm proposed a predictor called rfecs to identify enhancers by combining a multiple_kernel method and evolutionary_conservation developed a different enhancer predictor called enhancerfinder considering the inherent limitation of the conventional k_mers approach due to the high_dimension and overfitting problems utilized the gapped k_mers to develop a classifier named gkmsvm for identifying enhancers very recently using an ensemble prediction framework developed a novel predictor called deep and they claimed that it performed better than the four state of theart methods in identifying enhancers although the aforementioned computational_methods can yield quite encouraging_results and each of them has its own advantage further work is needed due to the following reasons most of those studies were focused on discriminating enhancers from other regulatory_elements but it was shown that enhancers are a large group of functional_elements with many different subgroups such as strong enhancers weak enhancers and poised or inactive enhancers implying that enhancers of distinct subgroups will have different biological_activities and regulatory_effects on target_genes therefore in order to really understand the mechanism underlying the gene_regulation through enhancers it is indispensable to classify them according to their attributes to these subgroups this study was initiated in an attempt to address this problem according to the chous step rule and performed in a series of recent_publications to establish a really useful sequence_based statistical predictor for a biological system we should consider the following five procedures construct or select a valid benchmark_dataset to train and test the predictor formulate the biological sequence samples with an effective mathematical expression that can truly reflect their intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted introduce or develop a powerful algorithm or engine to operate the prediction properly perform cross_validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy of the predictor and establish a user_friendly web_server for the predictor that is accessible to the public below we are to describe how to deal with these steps one by one it is a big_challenge to identify the enhancers from enormous amount of dna_sequences generated in the postgenomic era one of the keys to develop a sequence_based predictor is how to effectively formulate the sequence samples concerned inspired by the successes of introducing the pseudo amino_acid or pseaac to formulate protein peptide samples in the currently proposed ienhancer l predictor we have used the pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition or pseknc to formulate dna samples in which the local sequence_patterns of dna samples are reflected by the k_mer composition while their global sequence_patterns reflected by the pseudo components ienhancer l is a two layer predictor its first layer is to identify whether a query dna_element is of enhancer or not if the outcome is yes then the second layer will automatically continue to identify its strength strong or weak to the best of our knowledge it is the first predictor ever developed that can be also used to classify enhancers according to their strength a user_friendly web_server for ienhancer l has been established at http bioinformatics hitsz edu cn ienhancer l by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematics involved which were presented here just for its integrity it is also the first web_server ever established for identification classification of enhancers it is anticipated that ienhancer l may become a very useful high_throughput tool for studying enhancers or at the very least play an important complementary_role to the existing_methods in this area ienhancer l a two layer predictor
