gene_expression annotation concept synthesis and enrichment_analysis a logic based_approach to the interpretation of high_throughput experiments motivation annotation enrichment_analysis aea is a widely used analytical_approach to process data generated by high_throughput genomic and proteomic experiments such as gene_expression the analysis uncovers and summarizes discriminating background information e g go annotations for sets of genes identified by experiments e g a set_of a cluster the discovered information is utilized by human_experts to find biological interpretations of the experiments however aea isolates and tests for overrepresentation only individual annotation terms or groups of similar terms and is limited in its ability to uncover complex phenomena involving relationship between multiple annotation terms from various knowledge bases also aea assumes that annotations describe the whole object of interest which makes_it to apply it to sets of compound objects e g sets of proteinprotein_interactions and to sets of objects having an internal_structure e g protein_complexes results we propose a novel logic_based annotation concept synthesis and enrichment_analysis acsea approach acsea fuses inductive logic reasoning with statistical_inference to uncover more complex phenomena captured by the experiments we evaluate our approach on large_scale datasets from several microarray_experiments and on a clustered genome_wide genetic interaction_network using different biological_knowledge bases the discovered interpretations have lower p values than the interpretations found by aea are highly integrative in nature and include analysis of quantitative and structured information present in the knowledge bases the results suggest that acsea can boost effectiveness of the processing of high_throughput experiments high_throughput methods such as expression microarrays promoter microarrays genome_wide physical and genomic interaction screens while allowing to monitor the behavior of the cell as a whole are generating wealth of information that needs to be studied and interpreted one of the main challenges of modernis a set of genes identified by an experiment such as differentially_expressed or one of the clusters universe set is the set of all the genes that participated in the experiment or some other reference_set of genes that the study set will be compared against annotation database is a source of annotations attached to genes result of the analysis is a set of annotations that are over or underrepresented in the study set comparing to the universe set bioinformatics is to develop methods and techniques that can help inferring knowledge from accumulated datasets and large_scale experimental_data high_throughput typically generate sets of genes that require further investigation for example such sets may be produced by clustering microarray_data or by extracting differentially_expressed the sets usually contain dozens or hundreds of genes and their biological_interpretation poses_significant challenge to biology experts recently a number of algorithms have been developed to help experts interpreting experimental_data one of the most popular approaches is annotation enrichment_analysis aea aea uses the biological_knowledge already accumulated in public_databases to systematically examine large lists of genes trying to suggest biological interpretations of the experimental_data aea algorithms extract descriptive information called gene_annotations characterizing each gene and compare the statistical distributions of gene_annotations between the gene_set of interest known as study set and the rest of the genome or the rest of the microarray known as universe set illustrates the approach aea is agnostic to the way universe and study sets are constructed it contrasts it with other approaches such as reconstruction of formal temporal logic models which implicitly includes temportal annotations into analysis a variety of algorithms and tools are based on the aea framework they differ by the knowledge bases used as source for annotations gene_ontology a controlled_vocabulary of genes attributes kegg pathway_information bind proteinprotein_interactions etc statistical_hypothesis models fishers_exact binomial_distribution hypergeometric_distribution etc types and organization of annotation terms and sets of reference genes the data representation model used in aea is bag of annotations by analogy with a bag of words representation used in text_mining bag of annotations associates a set of annotation terms with each gene while bag of annotations is a very popular and efficient model allowing natural application of statistical_inference methods it has a number of disadvantages the main weakness of the model is the limitation in the types of annotation terms and relations that may be used as well as the types and the complexity of enriched phenomena that can be discovered and described several research_projects have proposed improvements to aea algorithms and statistical_models to address the issues partially rooted in the bag of annotation model for example graph decorrelation methods modify statistical_tests to consider the go graph profcom method finds enriched combinations of annotation terms using and or not operators gsea method compares the study set to curated sets david tool partitions a set of genes based on the annotations clean tool uses cluster_analysis of annotations however these are solutions targeting specific databases or output structure to overcome the analytical challenges posed by the bag ofannotations model we propose a new paradigm annotation concept synthesis and enrichment_analysis acsea acsea utilizes a logic_based data representation model and a fusion of inductive logic reasoning and statistical_inference in the general framework of aea the results of acseas evaluation suggest that it is a very potent technique capable of increasing the efficiency i e the ease of data analysis by a human expert and effectiveness i e the quality and quantity of the obtained knowledge of the processing of high_throughput experiments we evaluated the performance of acsea applied to two widely used experimental_techniques expression microarrays and genetic_interaction screens this section contains summary of the performed experiments more detailed_experimental logs and raw results are available at acsea home page http www epiphan com zhilin acsea aea is becoming the dominant technique for the secondary processing of data generated by high_throughput significant progress in aea algorithms has been obtained by improving the statistical_models and by incorporating a variety of annotation databases into the analysis in this article we present a novel paradigm acsea which relies on a logic_based representation of annotations and employs a fusion of inductive logic inference and statistical_inference the methodological advantage of acsea is fold first it is easier to represent complex structural annotation_information lesser is better better values are highlighted the differences in performance are statistically_significant with n confidence_level of the internal_structure of object genetic_interaction allows reasoning on and inferring statements dealing with the substructure of the object under analysis particularly in this experiment we were able to utilize quantifiers such as both any one to better understand relationship between go categories and the set of interacting genes page
