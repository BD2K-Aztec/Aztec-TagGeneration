agin measuring the landscape of cpg_methylation of individual repetitive_elements motivation determining the methylation_state of regions with high copy_numbers is challenging for second generation sequencing because the read_length is insufficient to map reads uniquely especially when repetitive_regions are long and nearly identical to each other single_molecule real_time smrt_sequencing is a promising method for observing such regions because it is not vulnerable to gc bias it produces long read_lengths and its kinetic_information is sensitive to dna_modifications results we propose a novel linear time algorithm that combines the kinetic_information for neighboring cpg_sites and increases the confidence in identifying the methylation states of those sites using a practical read_coverage of fold from an inbred_strain medaka oryzias latipes we observed that both the sensitivity and precision of our method on individual cpg_sites were we also observed a high correlation_coefficient r between our method and bisul fite sequencing and for of cpg_sites methylation_levels ranging over were in concordance within an acceptable difference using this method we characterized the landscape of the methylation status of repetitive_elements such as lines in the human_genome thereby revealing the strong correlation between cpg density and hypomethylation and detecting hypomethyla tion hot_spots of ltrs and lines we uncovered the methylation states for nearly identical active transposons two novel line insertions of identity and length base_pairs bp in the human_genome and tol elements of identity and length_bp in the medaka genome there has been a great_deal of interest in identification of genomewide epigenetic dna_modifications in recent_years because dna_modifications play_an in cellular and developmental_processes some of human transposable_elements tes such as long_interspersed nuclear elements line transpose actively within somatic_cells along differentiation of neural_tissues and are partly regulated by dna_methylation each family of human tes exhibits a variety of methylation statuses in different tissue_types which was found by looking at the mixture of methylation information on the consensus_sequence of tes in the same family many human_diseases are also associated with dna methylation_state of tes in particular unmethylation of repetitive_elements res such as line l elements has been related to some cancers although only a few l elements exhibit activity in the human_genome it has been reported in various cancer_genomes and importantly transposition is correlated with unmethylation in the promoter_region of l elements therefore it is essential to develop an experimental framework that can characterize the methylation_state of res in a genome_wide the advent of second generation sequencing_technology has increased the efficiency of the generation of precise genome_wide maps at a single_base using bisulfite_treatment however these sequencing based_technologies have difficulty in characterizing the methylation status of cpgs in regions that are highly_similar to other regions bisulfitetreated short_reads from these regions often fail to map uniquely to their original positions instead they are likely to be aligned ambiguously to multiple genomic positions especially the younger and more active transposons retain higher fidelity and are therefore difficult to address using short_reads the pacbio rs ii sequencing system uses dna_polymerases to perform single_molecule real_time smrt_sequencing and is able to sequence_reads of an average length of kb it is also able to sequence genomic_regions with extremely_high gc_content a striking example is the sequencing of a kb_region with gc_content of indicating that smrt_sequencing is less vulnerable to sequence_composition bias than first second generation sequencing is smrt_sequencing of bisulfite treated dna_fragments may allow identification of dna_methylation however this approach is unlikely to process long highly identical repeats because bisulfite_treatment breaks dna into fragments of bp instead we explored another advantage of smrt_sequencing to detect dna_modifications directly in this study we addressed the problem of uncovering the landscape of dna_methylation of repetitive_elements res to this end we developed a unique application of smrt_sequencing to epigenetics this direction had been already explored in the research_community for bacterial and viral species however this application in large vertebrate_genomes has been largely_unexplored because of the subtle cytosine_methylation signals in the kinetic_information therefore we proposed a new method to utilize relatively small amounts of kinetic_information by incorporating a model reflecting our prior_knowledge on the regional patterns of cpg_methylation of vertebrate_genomes we confirmed the validity of our strategy by comparing the prediction to bisulfite sequencing_data on medaka and to beadchip analysis on human samples these two datasets had very different characteristics which seemed to be partly because of the methods used i e beadchip was designed to observe mainly cpg islands that are often hypomethylated while bisulfite_sequencing is used for genome_wide analysis and partly because of the nature of the samples used i e the medaka samples were derived from an inbred_strain while the human samples were from diploid cells despite such differences in characteristics our method using the same parameters performed almost equally well for both datasets these observations suggested that the choice of parameters is robust for a wide_variety of samples which is a desirable feature for any method we also presented an extension of our method to accommodate intermediate methylation states the discrete methylation_level dml and confirmed a high correlation r between dml and bisulfite methylation_level we explored the epigenetic landscape of res within the human_genome using the hg reference_genome is an apparent limitation by assembling individual personal genomes instead of the reference_genome new insertions of these res are expected to be found and such active occurrences should be of interest indeed we detected two novel line insertions that were estimated to be methylated importantly the more recent the insertion event the less divergent it would be from the original copy and therefore there would be less likelihood of it being anchored by short_reads in such cases long smrt_reads shed new light on the ecosystem of active res in personal human_genomes we demonstrated the use of long smrt_reads can increase the potential comprehensiveness of the epigenetics study in addition our method can substantially reduce laboratory work for example in the projects of resequencing or de_novo using smrt_sequencing you can call the methylation statuses of the sample as well completely in silico without any additional experiment this is another important strength compared to conventional bisulfite_sequencing or affinity based assays
