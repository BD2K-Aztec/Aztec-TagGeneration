structural_bioinformatics improving the prediction of disulfide_bonds in eukaryotes with machine_learning and protein subcellular_localization motivation disulfide_bonds stabilize protein_structures and play relevant roles in their functions their formation requires an oxidizing environment and their stability is consequently depending on the redox ambient potential which may differ according to the subcellular compartment several methods are available to predict cysteine bonding state and connectivity patterns however none of them takes into consideration the relevance of protein subcellular_localization results here we develop dislocate a two step method based on machine_learning for predicting both the bonding state and the connectivity patterns of cysteine_residues in a protein chain we find that the inclusion of protein subcellular_localization improves the performance of these predictive steps by and percentage_points respectively when compared with previously_developed methods for predicting disulfide_bonds from sequence dislocate improves the overall performance by more than percentage_points availability the method and the dataset are available at the web pagethe formation of disulfide_bonds between cysteine_residues is essential for folding stability and maturation of many proteins predicting which cysteines in a protein_sequence form disulfide_bonds plays a relevant role in protein structural and functional_annotation several computational_methods are available which can be grouped as i methods that predict the disulfide_bonding state ii methods that predict the connectivity patterns assuming that the cysteine bonding state is known iii methods that compute both features to whom correspondence should be addressed proteins that contain disulfide_bonds are rarely found in the cytoplasm and are routinely secreted disulfide_bond in eukaryotes happens in the lumen of the endoplasmic_reticulum these experimental_studies show that the localization in the different cell_compartments plays a relevant role in disulfide_bond generation and stabilization however to the best of our knowledge none of the methods developed so_far has actually exploited information on the subcellular_localization of proteins protein datasets with experimentally known subcellular_localization are available as well several efficient prediction_methods were developed to predict subcellular_localization here we propose dislocate a novel twostage method for disulfide_bond prediction in eukaryotes based on machine_learning we show that the inclusion of protein subcellular_localization improves the performance of disulfide_bond prediction_methods this improvement is noticeable also when the subcellular_localization is predicted with bacello
