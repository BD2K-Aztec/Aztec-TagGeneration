top_down analysis of protein samples by de_novo sequencing_techniques motivation recent_technological have made high_resolution mass_spectrometers affordable to many laboratories thus boosting rapid development of top_down mass_spectrometry and implying a need in efficient methods for analyzing this kind of data results we describe a method for analysis of protein samples from top_down tandem mass spec trometry data which capitalizes on de_novo sequencing of fragments of the proteins present in the sample our algorithm takes as input a set of de_novo amino_acid strings derived from the given mass_spectra using the recently_proposed twister approach and combines them into aggregated strings endowed with offsets the former typically constitute accurate sequence_fragments of sufficiently well represented proteins from the sample being analyzed while the latter indicate their location in the protein_sequence and also bear information on post_translational and fragmentation_patterns availability_and freely_available on the web at http bioinf spbau ru en twister top_down mass_spectrometry is a recently_emerged technology for analyzing intact proteins which is particularly suitable for detecting post_translational ptms among its most important_applications is characterization of therapeutic_antibodies as part of the process of drug_development nowadays modern instruments allow to rapidly acquire vast amount of high_quality top_down data but efficient algorithms for its processing are still in high_demand one of the key tasks of mass_spectrometry is de_novo sequencing of peptides and proteins from tandem ms_ms mass_spectrometry data in the last two decades several algorithms have been proposed for de_novo peptide_sequencing from bottom up data and a few powerful_tools appeared including peaks pepnovo pnovo lutefisk sherenga novor and the program uvnovo recently_introduced for the case of nm ultraviolet photodissociation uvpd mass_spectra other achievements comprise methods for complete protein sequencing using multiple enzyme digest and assembly by sequence overlap possibly referring to a homologous protein_sequence and a number of alternative_approaches benefit from complementarity of mass_spectra acquired using different fragmentation techniques from either peptides or intact proteins yet to the best of our knowledge only three published algorithms make any use of top_down data to achieve the abovementioned goal and namely the one from which however did not result in a publicly_available tool tbnovo that processes combined ms_ms datasets and utilizes top_down spectra as a scaffold for assembling bottom up spectra and our recently_developed approach_called twister at the same time primarily due to increasing accessibility of hybrid orbitrap fourier_transform mass_spectrometers the top_down technology is nowadays rapidly gaining_popularity thus enforcing the need in efficient approaches to de_novo peptide and protein sequencing from top_down spectra alone this work represents a continuation of our research summarized in where we introduced a method that extracts from deconvoluted ms_ms a number of accurate sequence_fragments of the proteins contained in a sample here we describe an algorithm that takes as input the fragments obtained this way and combines them to produce a set of so_called aggregated strings each endowed with direct and reversed offsets intended to match the masses of the two terminal fragments preceding and following it in the underlying protein_sequence thereby we obtain longer sequence_fragments of sufficiently well represented proteins among which should be the target ones but can be also abundant enough contaminants the number of aggregated strings is substantially smaller than that of the original fragments thus allowing to see at a glance distinct_components of the sample moreover their associated offsets can provide extra insight into what was the composition of the sample at the level of proteoforms which posttranslational_modifications ptms occurred in the sequence or which fragment_ions were measured in the experiment this immediately turns the suggested approach into a handy stand alone method for analyzing protein samples in what follows we outline the procedure for computing aggregated strings illustrate the potential of the method by experimental_results obtained for top_down ms_ms datasets for the standard protein carbonic_anhydrase cah and the fab region of alemtuzumab and indicate directions for further research the proposed approach is implemented in a software_tool twister available at http bioinf spbau ru en twister which also incorporates the method introduced in and thus takes as input a set of deconvoluted ms_ms we implemented our method in java and benchmarked it on the top_down datasets for the light_chain of alemtuzumab and cah published in in either case the input spectra were deconvoluted using ms deconv and a list n of de_novo amino_acid strings was generated with the twister algorithm from using the default_parameters tag length mass tolerance mda peak reflection applied to individual deconvoluted spectra and water loss ions eliminated prior to tag generation the resulting aggregated strings for the cah and alemuzumab datasets are listed in the supplementary_file aggregatedstrings xls we have introduced a method for combining de_novo sequence_fragments retrieved from deconvoluted top_down ms_ms using our approach described in into the aggregated strings endowed with direct and reversed offsets this gives us longer parts of sequences of proteins sufficiently well represented in the sample and helps to promptly focus our attention primarily on those the main offsets of the aggregated strings often appropriately reflect their location in the sequence of the respective protein and can serve to obtain an accurate intact mass estimate of a target protein decide on which out of a few candidate proteoforms is contained in the sample or facilitate characterization of the ptms present in the protein being analyzed we emphasize that the second and third tasks can be accomplished even without explicit evidence in the input spectra of the amino_acids that differ between distinct proteoforms or of the respective ptms importantly thereby an aggregated string with a very short and not informative on its own amino_acid can also be of true value on the other hand the input ms_ms data may sometimes allow to quickly and unambiguously locate a ptm detected in this way the proposed method can be further adjusted so as to solve this problem as well a careful analysis of the entire sets of direct and reversed offsets associated with the obtained aggregated strings can potentially provide further insight into the composition of the sample we consider development of algorithms for this purpose as one of the subsequent tasks to be addressed alternatively one can manually browse through the input de_novo stringseach with a single associated offsetthat correlate well with the aggregated strings of interest to gain additional information about the respective proteins our present work constitutes a next step towards complete de_novo sequencing of proteins from top_down spectra alone for which purpose to the best of our knowledge no methods exist so_far while the current_limitations of the top_down technology in general would prevent the proposed approach from retrieving the entire protein_sequence since the latter is typically not fully covered even with short tags the aggregated strings can undoubtedly serve as an excellent base for the full reconstruction however achieving this goal will require more algorithmic developments thus providing yet another promising direction for future_research
