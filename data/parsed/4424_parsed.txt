statistical_models for rna_seq derived from a two condition replicate experiment motivation high_throughput rna_seq is now the standard method to determine differential_gene identifying_differentially crucially depends on estimates of read_count variability these estimates are typically based on statistical_models such as the negative_binomial which is employed by the tools edger deseq and cuffdiff until now the validity of these models has usually been tested on either low replicate rna_seq or simulations results a replicate rna_seq experiment in yeast was performed and data tested against theoretical_models the observed gene read_counts were consistent with both log normal and negative_binomial distributions while the mean variance relation followed the line of constant dispersion parameter of the high replicate data also allowed for strict quality_control and screening of bad replicates which can drastically affect the gene read_count distribution availability_and rna_seq have been submitted to ena archive with project id prjeb high_throughput of rna rna_seq estimates gene_expression by counting the number of sequenced rna_fragments that map back to a given gene within a reference_genome or transcriptome differential_gene dge experiments compare this relative measure of transcriptional_activity across several biologically_interesting conditions to attempt to identify those genes that are fundamental to the difference between the conditions this task is complicated by expression noise resulting from biological and technical variability which introduces a level of uncertainty that has to be taken into account when the expression values from two or more conditions are compared there are two major_obstacles to identifying whether the observed difference in the expression of a gene between the two conditions is statistically_significant or whether it is consistent with arising through chance first the observed read_counts are a product of both the library size total number of reads and the fractional expression of the gene the gene_expression values thus need to be appropriately normalized before they can be meaningfully compared across conditions second due to cost time and v c the author published_by
