large_scale motif_discovery using dna gray code and equiprobable oligomers motivation how to find motifs from genome_scale functional sequences such as all the promoters in a genome is a challenging_problem word based_methods count the occurrences of oligomers to detect excessively represented ones this approach is known to be fast and accurate compared with other methods however two problems have hampered the application of such methods to large_scale data one is the computational_cost necessary for clustering similar oligomers and the other is the bias in the frequency of fixed_length oligomers which complicates the detection of significant words results we introduce a method that uses a dna gray code and equiprobable oligomers which solve the clustering problem and the oligomer bias respectively our method can analyze sequences of kbp long in s we also show that the accuracy of our method is superior to that of a leading method especially for large_scale data and small fractions of motif containing sequences availability the online and stand alone versions of the application named hegma are available at our website the technological_development of next_generation has enabled us to obtain genome_scale promoter_sequences the first step toward unraveling the regulatory_mechanisms from such large_scale data is to identify cis_regulatory existing computational algorithms used for motif_finding may be categorized into three classes motif_discovery from promoter_sequences in a single_genome phylogenetic_footprinting that uses promoter_sequences from multiple species and motif search relying on known motif models such as jaspar and transfac to predict the locations of motifs each class adopts a distinct strategy class tries to find particular words or sets of similar words significantly_enriched in promoters class aligns orthologous genomic_sequences and extracts the sites that are well conserved among species and class finds the sites that match a list of known motifs cataloged to whom correspondence should be addressed in a library although the latter two classes are applicable to genomescale promoter_sequences in principle the high_computational prohibits application of the first class to large_scale data despite the fact that motif_discovery is the only way if we have no prior_knowledge of other species or known motifs of the several different approaches adopted in motif_discovery word based_methods are much more scalable than other approaches such as expectation_maximization or gibbs_sampling in principle a word based method exhaustively counts all the oligomers in a given set of sequences and detects the ones that are represented more abundantly than the background frequencies however there are two problems hindering the application of this method to largescale data first it is not trivial to cluster similar oligomers into fewer groups fundamentally a word based method initially detects interesting oligomers without allowing any substitutions whereas a motif is typically a set of similar oligomers that contain some variations among them hence we need to apply a clustering method to gather similar oligomers however the computational_cost rapidly increases with the number of initial oligomers or the degree of allowed variations second the detection of significantly abundant oligomers is complicated by the variable background frequencies of different oligomers with a fixed_length for example the background frequencies of at rich and gc_rich oligomers can differ extensively in human promoter_sequences moreover the difference becomes more remarkable for longer oligomers thus we have to carefully evaluate the statistical_significance of over representation of particular oligomers in large_scale data here we report a new motif_discovery method that can analyze tens_of of dna_sequences each kbp long we solve the first problem by using a dna gray code originally proposed by see also the dna gray code is an ordering of oligomers in which adjacent oligomers differ from each other by only one nucleotide since neighboring oligomers in the dna gray code are similar to one another we can solve the first problem by searching only neighborhoods within the dna gray code to solve the second problem we use equiprobable oligomers the lengths of which are variably adjusted so that every oligomer should have an approximately_equal background probability it is easily shown that the equiprobable oligomers can be naturally combined with the dna gray code we implement our motif_discovery method in c to produce the computer program named hegma and evaluate the performance of hegma by using a known database cisred the benchmark test indicates that in most situations hegmawe have developed a large_scale motif_discovery tool hegma and shown that hegma is not only applicable to large_scale data but also can stably detect motifs even if only a small fraction of the examined sequences contain the motifs thus hegma is applicable to situations where the fraction of motif containing sequences is uncontrollable such as the detection of splicing enhancers or silencers in exon and intron sequences or the detection of microrna binding_sites in utr sequences a huge number of such sequences have already been collected in databases however as our knowledge of those motifs is yet far from complete it is difficult to know in advance the percentage of sequences holding the motifs we consider that the speed and precision of hegma would facilitate discovery of novel motifs from a heap of sequence_data
