toward better understanding of artifacts in variant_calling from high coverage samples motivation whole_genome high_coverage has been widely used for personal and cancer_genomics as well as in various research_areas however in the lack of an unbiased whole_genome truth set the global error_rate of variant_calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain_unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant_calling methods results we made single_nucleotide and indel call sets with two read_mappers and five variant callers both on a haploid human_genome and a diploid_genome at a similar coverage by investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid_genome we identified the erroneous realignment in low complexity regions and the incomplete reference_genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors which press for continued improvements in these two areas we estimated that the error_rate of raw genotype_calls is as high as in kb but the error_rate of post filtered calls is reduced to in kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity availability_and bwa mem alignment and raw variant_calls are available at http bit ly g xqrt scripts and miscellaneous data at https github com lh varcmp since the sequencing of the first personal genome and in particular the first genomes sequenced with the illumina technologies resequencing has been widely used for personal and cancer_genomics for the discovery of de_novo mutations associated with mendelian_diseases for the reconstruction of human population history and for the understanding of mutation processes in most of these studies mapping based single_nucleotide snp insertion_deletion indel calling plays_a the accuracy of the calls has a fundamental impact on the biological_interpretation in this context various research groups have attempted to evaluate the performance of variant_calling the simplest approach to the evaluation of variant_calling is to simulate variants and reads from a reference_genome however we are unable to simulate various artifacts such as the non random_distribution of variants dependent errors incomplete reference_genome and copy_number an improved version is to incorporate real variants instead of using simulated variants but it does not address the artifacts caused by large_scale effects either a better simulation is to take the reads sequenced from one sample with a finished genome map them to another finished genome call variants and then compare the calls to the differences found by genome to genome alignment however this approach is limited to small haploid genomes there are attempts to apply a similar idea to mammalian_genomes but as the mammalian reference_genomes are frequently incomplete and the whole_genome alignment is imperfect such a simulation is still different from realistic scenarios the difficulties in simulation have motivated us to focus more on real_data one simple approach is to thoroughly sequence a small target_region with mature technologies such as the sanger sequencing_technology and take the resultant sequence as the ground_truth it does not capture largescale artifacts though another more commonly used method is to measure accuracy either by comparing variant_calls from different pipelines or by comparing calls to variants ascertained with array genotyping or in another study however array genotyping is biased to easier portions of the genome and may have a higher_error per assayed site than the variant_calling error_rate simply comparing call sets would only give us an estimate of the relative accuracyif two pipelines are affected by the same artifact that a third pipeline does not have then the third pipeline will appear worse even though it is in fact better in addition comparative_studies usually measure the accuracy with summary_statistics such as the fraction of calls present in dbsnp or the transition to transversion ratio they do not tell us the wrong sites many studies also experimentally_validated typically up to a few hundred variants with miseq or sanger_sequencing or sequenom genotyping nonetheless such experiments are biased toward easier regions and may also be subjected to other artifacts such as on primer variants and non specific amplification the genomes_project analysis subgroup personal communication calling heterozygotes from sanger sequence_data are also challenging by itself in the authors view it is better to evaluate variant_calling by comparing samples from a pedigree or from the same individual including cancer samples l ower et_al because we expect to see only tens to hundreds of somatic_mutations or mendelian errors per genome most other inconsistencies are likely to be errors however this method is insensitive to systematic errors if at a locus a caller finds erroneous heterozygotes in all samples the errors would not be identified after these efforts we are still not clear about a basic question the error_rate of snp and indel calling although a few papers give an estimate of one error per kb it is either estimated on easy sites or not sufficiently backed with published_data in addition only a few works have attempted to identify the sources of errors analyzing systematic errors is even rarer as most existing evaluation methods hide them in this article we use an exceptional dataset sequencing_data from a haploid human cell_line to evaluate the accuracy of variant_calling as the vast_majority of heterozygous calls are supposed to be errors we almost know the ground_truth unbiasedly across the whole_genome we are able to pinpoint errors investigate their characteristics experiment filters and get a reasonable estimate of the error_rate not limited to non systematic errors in addition to the unique dataset our study also differs from many previous ones in the use of multiple read_mappers unpublished but well developed variant callers and caller oblivious genotyping and filtering when studying the effect of filters on variant_calling we initially applied the filters independently on each call set however when presenting the results in the following we applied the filters in an order with a filter applied later depending on the filters applied before it we did this for clarity and to highlight filters having major effects overviews the breakdown of various filters across multiple call sets if we consider that there might be true heterozygotes in chm potentially because of somatic_mutations call sets generally have an error_rate in kb i e false heterozygotes per genome after filtering
