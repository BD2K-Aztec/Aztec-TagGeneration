exploiting ontology graph for predicting sparsely annotated gene function motivation systematically predicting gene or protein_function based on molecular_interaction has become an important tool in refining and enhancing the existing annotation catalogs such as the gene_ontology go database however functional labels with only a few annotated_genes which constitute about half of the go terms in yeast mouse and human pose a unique challenge in that any prediction algorithm that independently considers each label faces a paucity of information and thus is prone to capture non generalizable patterns in the data resulting in poor predictive_performance there exist a variety of algorithms for function prediction but none properly address this overfitting issue of sparsely annotated functions or do so in a manner scalable to tens_of of functions in the human catalog results we propose a novel function prediction algorithm clusdca which transfers information between similar functional labels to alleviate the overfitting problem for sparsely annotated functions our method is scalable to datasets with a large number of annotations in a cross_validation experiment in yeast mouse and human our method greatly outperformed previous state of the art function prediction_algorithms in predicting sparsely annotated functions without sacrificing the performance on labels with sufficient information furthermore we show that our method can accurately_predict genes that will be assigned a functional label that has no known annotations based only on the ontology graph_structure and genes associated with other labels which further suggests that our method effectively utilizes the similarity between gene_functions availability_and https github com wangshenguiuc clusdca automated annotation of gene or protein_function has become a critical task in the post genomic era fortunately an increasing compendium of genomic proteomic and interactomic data allows us to extract patterns from functionally well characterized genes or proteins to accurately infer functional properties of lesser known ones in particular recently_developed high_throughput such as yeast_two screens and genetic_interaction assays have helped to build molecular_interaction in bulk topological structures of these networks can be exploited for function prediction using the guilt byassociation principle which states that genes or proteins that share similar neighbors or other topological_properties in interaction networks are more likely to be functionally_related to this end a variety of graph_theoretic and machine_learning have been developed to provide a way of refining and enhancing existing functional_annotations e g gene_ontology go database based on network data a popular class of graph_theoretic algorithms uses a diffusion_process to examine the local topology of nodes exploiting both direct and indirect linkages alternatively the number of occurrences of different elementary subgraphs known as graphlets in the neighborhood can be used to characterize each node and to establish pairwise affinity scores more sophisticated machine_learning such as genemania have also been proposed genemania uses label propagation on an integrated_network specifically constructed for each functional label and is currently available as the state of the art web_interface for gene_function in multiple_organisms despite the success of existing algorithms a major_difficulty that has not been sufficiently addressed is that of predicting rare labels because many molecular_functions mfs are inherently specific in their scope a large number of functional labels have only a few annotated_genes or positive annotations for instance in the human go annotation database there are currently go labels with at least annotations of which have annotated_genes and labels have genes the distributions of go labels with different numbers of annotations in yeast and human are shown in nearly half of the go labels have annotations in both species predicting new associations for these sparsely annotated labels is substantially more challenging than those for labels with a lot of annotations because patterns extracted from the few known genes are more likely to be statistical artifacts that cannot be generalized which is commonly known as the overfitting problem in machine_learning and statistics one way to mitigate overfitting is to take similarities between labels into account for instance if we have a priori_knowledge that two labels reflect similar mfs e g they are both children of the same parent in the ontology graph we would also expect the two corresponding sets of genes or proteins to be similar if one of the gene_sets contains only a few genes then the other may provide_valuable about missing associations thus by propagating information along the edges in the ontology graph one can pool available data together for increased robustness to overfitting notably previous_efforts to incorporate label similarity into function prediction_algorithms have largely been unsuccessful they formulated the problem as a single structured output hierarchical classification hc instead of binary_classification but its predictive_performance for sparsely annotated functional labels is far from satisfactory another related work exploited the similarity between munich information center for protein_sequences mips functional_categories via a regularization scheme however this approach does not scale to tens_of of sparse go annotations in human as it employs a computationally_expensive optimization our approach to this problem is based on diffusion component analysis dca a recently_developed algorithm that combines network diffusion such as random_walk with restart rwr with dimensionality_reduction to obtain low_dimensional vector representations of nodes in a graph that capture topological_properties topological_features extracted from interaction networks in this manner can be used in conjunction with k nearest_neighbors knns or support_vector svms to outperform the corresponding state of the art for predicting hundreds of mips labels in yeast however dca also suffers from overfitting for sparsely annotated labels when predicting go labels for a larger human interactome if we want to train label wise classifiers for all labels in this work we introduce clusdca an improved function prediction algorithm based on dca we attached a two page abstract of dca in the supplementary data which i incorporates the similarity between functional labels and ii scales to a large number of annotations the key idea of clusdca is to perform dca also on the ontology graph to obtain compact vector representations of labels the gene_vectors from the original method are then projected onto the space of label vectors so that the projections of positively annotated_genes are geometrically close to their assigned labels because labels that are similar to each other in the ontology graph are co localized in the label vector space classifiers for sparsely annotated labels will now favor genes associated with other similar labels in the neighborhood this is how information is transferred between labels to avoid_overfitting in our approach when compared with state of the art methods that do not incorporate label similarity our experiments on yeast mouse and human datasets demonstrate that our method substantially improves the predictive_accuracy of sparsely annotated labels while achieving comparable_performance for go labels with sufficiently many genes we also demonstrate the performance improvement of clusdca over an alternative approach to utilizing the ontology graphs based on hc furthermore our method can be used to predict new genes for a given go label even in the extreme case where there are no existing gene_annotations and the only information available is the labels position in the ontology graph and the genes associated with other labels in addition to improving function prediction on its own this demonstrates the potential for our method to be used in conjunction with recent methods that extract new ontology_terms from data to provide an improved way of refining and extending our knowledge of gene or protein_function we introduced a novel algorithm clusdca for gene_function the major idea of clusdca is to leverage similarity between functional labels in addition to similarity between genes to prevent overfitting of sparsely annotated go labels we achieve_this by learning low_dimensional vector representations of genes and functions and matching gene_vectors to function vectors via a projection that best preserves known gene function associations similar labels are co localized in the vector space which allows the transfer of information between neighboring functions when genes are assigned to them since learning the projection solves the prediction of all labels simultaneously our method has the added benefit of being scalable to datasets with a large number of annotations although based on dca clusdca is a substantial advance as evidenced by its superior_performance over dca as well as genemania and hc on sparsely annotated go labels while maintaining a comparable_performance on labels with many genes moreover we demonstrated clusdcas ability to identify putatively associated genes for newly created go labels without any annotations which suggests that our method can be used to improve poorly_annotated labels and thus takes a significant step towards more comprehensive understanding of gene or protein_function in various organisms
