svd phy improved_prediction of protein functional_associations through singular_value of phylogenetic profiles a successful approach for predicting functional_associations between non homologous_genes is to compare their phylogenetic distributions we have devised a phylogenetic profiling algorithm svd phy which uses truncated singular_value to address the problem of uninformative profiles giving rise to false_positive benchmarking the algorithm against the kegg_pathway we found that it has substantially improved_performance over existing phylogenetic profiling methods availability_and the software is available under the open_source bsd_license atphylogenetic profiling methods are able to predict functional interactions between genes that encode_proteins from the same complex or pathway by comparing their phylogenetic distributions the underlying idea is that when two genes are functionally_related they should tend to be co inherited since the loss of either one of these genes would be detrimental to that particular function here we present a new phylogenetic profiling_method svd phy which performs considerably better than existing_methods for both bacteria and eukaryotes we have shown that svd phy has better predictive_power than existing phylogenetic profiling algorithms this improvement was achieved by performing truncated svd on the profiles before calculating their similarities an intuitive explanation of this transformation is that it collapses phylogenetic profiles that are shared by many proteins into fewer dimensions principal_components this reduces noise and increases the diversity of the resulting profiles which was recently shown to be beneficial s kunca and the benefit is that it prevents high similarity_scores between uninformative profiles that can be trivially explained by simple vertical inheritance of genes along the taxonomic tree or by broad similarities in the lifestyles of the organisms this includes highly_similar profiles caused by the inclusion of multiple strains of a species clade specific proteins and enzymes that have been lost in most parasites because they instead import metabolites from their hosts we fully integrated our proteinprotein_interaction predictions with the string database supplementary figs s s the data can be browsed online and is freely_available for download in tab_delimited format svd phy executes very fast its run time is on average about min per organism on a normal workstation this allows us to execute the algorithm for all species in the string database and makes it possible for others to utilize the algorithm within their web resources in a recent study tabach et_al b successfully used their method to shed light on several disease pathways phylogenetic profiling algorithms have also been applied to analyze non coding elements nces such as small_rnas showing that phylogenetic profiling is indeed an important technique that can be used to shed light even on nce functions and interactions
