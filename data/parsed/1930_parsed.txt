structural_bioinformatics gass identifying enzyme active_sites with genetic_algorithms motivation currently of proteins annotated in pfam have their function unknown one way of predicting proteins function is by looking at their active_site which has two main parts the catalytic_site and the substrate_binding the active_site is more conserved than the other residues of the protein and can be a rich source of information for protein_function this article_presents a new heuristic_method named genetic active_site search gass which searches for given active_site d templates in unknown_proteins the method can perform non exact amino_acid matches conservative mutations is able to find amino_acids in different chains and does not impose any restrictions on the active_site size results gass results were compared with those catalogued in the catalytic_site atlas csa in four different datasets and compared with two other methods amino_acid pattern search for substruc tures and motif and catalytic_site identification the results show gass can correctly identify of the templates searched experiments were also run using data from the substrate binding_sites prediction competition casp and gass is ranked fourth among the methods considered availability_and source_code and datasets dcc ufmg br glpappa gass over protein_families are currently annotated in pfam http pfam sanger ac uk from which more than still have their functions unknown experimental_tests are expensive_and and in their absence studies have shown that protein_function can be successfully inferred based on the sequence or structure similarity between the hypothetical protein and proteins of known function one way of predicting protein_function is by searching for enzyme binding_sites according to enzyme binding_sites are regions on the surface of an enzyme specially modelled to interact with other molecules there are different types of binding_sites the most important being the active_site the active_site is divided_into two or three parts which include the catalytic_site and the substrate_binding the former is usually a set of two to six residues that perform the catalytic_reaction while the latter recognizes the molecule upon which the enzyme acts for the sake of simplicity as finding a binding active or catalytic_site refers to the same computational_problem this article always refers to active_sites which is a broader term and encompasses both catalytic and substrate binding_sites due to their importance to enzyme_function active_sites amino_acids are more conserved during evolution than the sequence as a whole consequently they can be a rich source of information for function prediction fn several methods have been proposed to inferprotein function based on active_site similarity and they can be grouped into three major categories sequence_based structure based and hybrid when using sequence multiple_alignments of various organisms have been widely used to verify conservation of residues that may be structurally or functionally_important including in contrast take advantage of different types of information including surface_accessibility physiochemical_properties or homology_modelling this article is particularly interested in methods for searching active_sites based on structural data in general structure based_methods proposed to identify active_sites in proteins are based on graphs where nodes represent atoms in the amino_acid and neighbour atoms are connected with edges weighted by their distances in this context proposed a simple graph search method based on a depth first search called patterns in non homologous tertiary_structures which finds all possible residue patterns considering all template atoms common to the template of the target protein in contrast proposed amino_acid pattern search for substructures and motifs assam which models the problem as a sub graph isomorphism problem assam searches for maximum common sub graphs to find similar structures between the template active_site and the enzyme the graph represents the amino_acids in the side chain and each node consists of two pseudoatoms distances among different structures are calculated using root_mean deviation rmsd in turn introduced catalytic_site identification catsid the algorithm performs a protein to template_matching using a sub graph search method and a library of catalytic residue templates from catalytic_site atlas csa a database of catalytic_sites in enzymes of known d structure these results are refined using a logistic scoring procedure to re score the matches found in the first phase and use information such as binding_site predictions and others physical descriptors to improve the structure matching previously_obtained many methods have also been proposed for substrate_binding in the context of the casp competition sp align for instance detects substrate binding_sites by remote template identification and superimposition structure pocket alignment and binding_site clustering guided by the template substrates dligandsite in contrast aligns similar structures with the query superimposing their bound ligands onto the query structure this article proposes a method to identify active_sites using genetic_algorithms gas and information about the proteins d structure gas are widely used to solve combinatorial search problems and emulate the process of evolution and survival of the fittest they have the advantage of performing a global search being independent of application and tolerant to noise the proposed method can perform non exact amino_acid matches without restricting the number of amino_acids in the template and finds catalytic_residues and binding residues in different protein_chains its global heuristic_search is used to prune the search_space and only information about the d structure is required having the active_sites identified in a second phase protein_function can be inferred using methods based on a similarity threshold or more sophisticated techniques such as logistic_regression this section discusses the results obtained when evaluating gass using the two strategies previously described a summary of the results obtained by gass when comparing its results with csa templates is presented in the differences among the number of enzymes searched and those with known catalytic_sites in csa happen for two reasons i sometimes an enzyme has more than one catalytic_site ii not all enzymes have their catalytic_sites catalogued in csa the results are detailed in the following sections this work proposed gass a method for active_site search based on gas the method receives as input one or more active_sites templates and looks for them in one or more proteins returning a ranking of solutions as big as its population_size it also takes_into conservative mutations during the search by using a substitution matrix the method can also find active_sites in different protein_chains and its results can be further improved by using additional attributes to describe the sites gass has no predefined_criteria to search the candidate solution_space such as catsid nor uses a limit for the size of the active_site as assam does results show the method is effective in finding catalytic_sites already catalogued in csa with accuracy rates above in most datasets besides when considering the dataset used in the fn task in casp when compared with the other methods gass is ranked fourth according to values of mcc it can be a powerful_tool to improve the current catalytic_sites and add new ones to csa as future work we intend to enhance the presented techniques so it verifies the accessibility and location of the amino_acids pockets found by gass the current solution can be further extended to consider physicochemical attributes during gass search additional_tests with other substitution matrices will also be performed finally we plan to make gass available from a web_server after the aforementioned issues are addressed
