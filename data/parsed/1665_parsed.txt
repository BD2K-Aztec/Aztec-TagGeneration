evolutionary profiles improve protein_protein prediction from sequence motivation many methods predict the physical_interaction between two proteins protein_protein ppis from sequence alone their performance drops substantially for proteins not used for training results here we introduce a new approach to predict ppis from sequence alone which is based on evolutionary profiles and profile kernel support_vector it improved over the state of the art in particular for proteins that are sequence dissimilar to proteins with known interaction_partners filtering by gene_expression data increased accuracy further for the few most reliably predicted interactions low recall the overall improvement was so substantial that we compiled a list of the most reliably predicted ppis in human our method makes a significant_difference for biology because it improves most for the majority of proteins without experimental annotations availability_and implementation and most reliably predicted human ppis available at https rostlab org owiki index php profppikernel ppis physical proteinprotein_interactions between different proteins we define ppis as interactions that bring two different proteins a and b directly into physical_contact this molecular perspective on ppis differs from the view adopted by many users of interaction data who look for associations again for us the crucial aspect of an interaction is the direct physical_contact this molecular perspective is a crucial component of curated resources such as hippie as well as of our method predictions and experimental_evidence intertwined ppis are supported by an increasing amount of data derived for example from sequences structures co evolution co expression domain co occurrence text_mining or subcellular co localization many in silico tools use these data to enrich ppi_networks and to predict new interactions for instance high_throughput data in integrative_models such as bayesian_networks improves predictions and blurs the line between in vitro and in silico predictions can be improved further by e g developing better statistical_models protein_sequences improve most integrative_models e g through homology based_inference and are highly_predictive of ppis on their own sequences are also by far the most abundant data homology based_inference assigns feature f to a protein a if another protein b is experimentally annotated with feature f and sequence similar to a this concept works well for gene_ontology and can even outperform advanced predictions of subcellular_localization for ppis however it is substantially more challenging and many advanced sequence_based ppi prediction_methods have been developed new prediction method for difficult cases park and marcotte recently_introduced three classes of difficulty for predicting whether proteins a and b interact c if both a and b were in the dataset used to develop the prediction method but not the ppi ab itself c if this was the case for either a or b and c if neither of the two was in the dataset even todays best sequence_based perform significantly_worse if a and b were not used for method training here we introduce a new method that tackles this problem it only uses features that are available for all proteins of known sequence and combines empirical rules with advanced machine_learning protocols we show that it slightly outperformed other methods for classes c and c and that it improved_substantially for c a filter_based on recent tissue_specific gene_expression data further increased performance finally by generalizing classes c c we could identify and predict all difficult query_protein pairs in human
