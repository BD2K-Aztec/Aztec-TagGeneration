data_and a novel feature based_approach to extract drug_drug from biomedical_text motivation knowledge of drugdrug_interactions ddis is crucial for health_care to avoid adverse_effects when co administering drugs to patients as most newly_discovered ddis are made available through scientific_publications automatic ddi_extraction is highly_relevant results we propose a novel feature based_approach to extract ddis from text our approach consists of three steps first we apply text preprocessing to convert input sentences from a given dataset into structured representations second we map each candidate ddi pair from that dataset into a suitable syntactic structure based on that a novel set of features is used to generate feature_vectors for these candidate ddi pairs third the obtained feature_vectors are used to train a support_vector svm classifier when evaluated on two ddi_extraction challenge test datasets from and our system achieves f scores of and respectively outper forming any state of the art ddi_extraction system availability_and the source_code is available for academic use atdrugdrug interaction ddi is a situation when one drug increases or decreases the effect of another drug information about ddis is crucial for drug_administration to avoid adverse_drug or therapeutic failure van for example a recent study reports that ddis are a significant cause of hospital_admissions while specialized databases are available for finding known ddis such as drugbank http www drugbank ca or micromedex http micromedex com their coverage is limited and there are discrepancies in ddi listing between existing databases as a consequence most of newly_discovered ddis need to be extracted from scientific_publications text_mining techniques such as automatic relation extraction have been applied successfully in large_scale experiments to extract various types of relations e g proteinprotein_interactions ppis gene disease efficiently therefore automatic ddi_extraction methods can be particularly relevant to effectively extract ddis and corresponding evidence from the scientific_literature to develop and evaluate automatic ddi_extraction methods a ddi corpus has been created by this corpus was manually_annotated with pharmacological substances mainly consisting of generic and brand names and ddis with the availability of this corpus and the introduction of two ddi_extraction challenges in and several approaches have been proposed to extract ddis from biomedical_text in both challenges systems built on machine_learning ml approaches were dominant and achieved the best results in these systems the ddi_extraction tasks are modeled as classification_problems where each candidate ddi pair is classified as an interacting pair or not to build the classification_models data from annotated ddi corpora are often transformed into more structural representations using various natural_language nlp tools among these ml based systems support_vector svm methods are the most popular in general ml based ddi_extraction systems can be categorized into two groups namely feature and kernel based_methods in feature_based systems each data instance is represented as a feature_vector in an n dimensional_space the main focus in these systems is to define features that potentially best represent the data characteristics for ddi_extraction tasks various feature_types have been used ranging from lexical to syntactic and semantic_information for example seguradeveloped a system using bag of words and local_context features to improve the performance of feature_based systems some authors combine multiple types of features with the hope that these features can complement each other introduced a system that uses lexical semantic and domain_knowledge features chowdhury and lavelli a proposed a system that combines heterogeneous features their system comprises lexical syntactic semantic and negation features derived from sentences and their corresponding parse trees in kernel_based systems the structural representations of data instances e g syntactic parse trees or dependency graphs are exploited various kernels have been proposed to quantify the similarities between two instances by computing the similarities of their representations these kernels differ from each other to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com based on how syntactic representations are used and how similarity functions are calculated for the ddi_extraction challenges the use of kernels varies between the participating systems among them the most commonly used kernels are all paths graph_kernel shallow linguistic kernel and path enclose tree kernel as the proposed kernels exploit different types of structural representations and similarity functions they all have pros_and to compensate for the weakness of each individual kernel kernel combination is often used for example chowdhury and lavelli b proposed a hybrid kernel which combines three different kernels their system achieved the best results in the ddi_extraction challenge task furthermore the combination can take place at the output level ensemble approach where the output of multiple systems is combined using a voting scheme developed a system that combines the output of two kernel_based systems and a case based reasoning system using a majority_voting scheme this system yielded the best result in the ddi_extraction challenge although systems using feature_based kernels alone did not yield the best performance in the ddi_extraction challenges feature_based kernels still play_an in relation extraction tasks in fact the winning teams of the ddi_extraction and challenges both incorporate feature_based kernels proposed byas part of their systems furthermore have shown that their featurebased ppi extraction system achieved state of the art results on five ppi corpora a recent study byon the performance of various types of kernels for ppi extraction tasks also suggests that to improve the performance of the current ppi extraction systems novel feature_sets should be explored over novel kernel functions this suggestion may also apply to the ddi_extraction tasks as most current approaches to extract ddi pairs have also previously been used to extract ppi pairs in this article we propose a novel feature based_approach to extract ddis from biomedical_text our approach differs from existing_approaches in two ways first we partition candidate ddi pairs into five groups based on their syntactic structures second we apply a set of novel features that is optimized for each group based on the syntactic properties our results show that the proposed system achieves the best results in terms of f scores and performance efficiency when compared with the state of the art ddi_extraction systems
