gene_expression amplicon identification using sparse_representation of multiplex pyrosequencing signal adviser_m application to bacterial_resistance genotyping motivation pyrosequencing is a cost_effective dna_sequencing that has many applications including rapid genotyping of a broad_spectrum of bacteria when molecular_typing requires to genotype multiple dna stretches several pyrosequencing primers could be used simultaneously but this would create overlapping primer specific signals which are visually uninterpretable accordingly the objective was to develop a new method for signal_processing adviser_m to automatically analyze and interpret multiplex pyrosequen cing signals in parallel the nucleotide dispensation order was improved by developing the senator selecting the nucleotide dispensation order algorithm results inthis proof_of study quintuplex pyrosequencingwas applied on eight bacterial_dna and targeted genetic_alterations underlying resistance to lactam antibiotics using senator driven dispen sation order all genetic_variants of were correctly_identified with adviser_m among nine expected negative results there was only one false_positive that was tagged with an unsafe label availability_and senator and adviser_m are implemented in the adviser_m r package http sites uclouvain be md ctma index php softwares and can be used to improve the dispensation order and to analyze multiplex pyrosequencing_signals generated in a broad range of typing applications pyrosequencing is a dna_sequencing based on pyrophosphate release during nucleotide incorporation the four possible nucleotides are sequentially dispensed in a pre determined order the first chemiluminescent signal produced during nucleotide incorporation is detected in the pyrosequencer and displayed as a pyrosequencing signal also known as pyrogram tm the number of incorporated nucleotides at each position is computed from the corresponding peak_height in the pyrosequencing signal it has to be emphasized that the current pyrosequencing method should not be confused with high_throughput which also use pyrosequencing reactions this article is clearly restricted to the analysis of pyrosequencing_signals obtained with the pyrosequencing pyromark technology commercialized by qiagen hilden germany pyrosequencing has many applications including rapid genotyping of a broad_spectrum of bacteria and human single_nucleotide snp_genotyping despite the increased use of next_generation for studying genomic_diversity pyrosequencing as defined here remains a costeffective solution for genotyping short dna stretches within bacterial_genomes this has previously been demonstrated by detecting snps associated with quinolone_resistance and clustered in short dna_sequences known as quinolone resistancedetermining region considering that antibiotic resistance_mechanisms are often linked to several hotspots located a small distance apart in the nucleotide_sequence of a single gene as well as in several distinct genes extended dna based identification of antibiotic_resistance requires therefore analyzing successively or at best in parallel resistance determinants spread at different locations anyway pyrosequencing reactions have to be conducted one by one a procedure which substantially increases analytical expenses and technician workload the alternative is to use several pyrosequencing primers simultaneously however the unavoidable consequence of this solution is that overlapping primer specific signals are created which are not visually interpretable another complementary issue is the need to select the nucleotide dispensation order for taking maximum advantage of all nucleotide_sequence differences between the respective genetic targets regarding the first issue related to multiplex signal interpretation it is worth stating that complementary mpsqed and the to whom correspondence should be addressed multipsq softwares were recently_developed to help researchers designing and analyzing multiplex pyrosequencing assays the mpsqed software is used to define pyrosequencing primers which generate unique uniplex pyrosequencing fingerprints and prevent the occurrence of competing signals from snps at different locations the multipsq software enables the analysis of multiplex pyrogram tm originating from various pyrosequencing primers multipsq computes the similarity between multiplex pyrosequencing raw_data and fingerprints resulting from any combination of theoretical uniplex pyrosequencing_signals generated from a known sequence the goal is to select the combination leading to the highest similarity while multipsq was claimed to suit the analysis of multiplex pyrosequencing_signals generated by an unrestricted number of sequencing primers for identifying an unlimited number of polymorphisms the application was practically validated on duplex signals i e pyrosequencing reactions performed with two pyrosequencing primers in this study the new senator method was developed to improve the nucleotide dispensation order to be used all along the multiplex pyrosequencing experiment irrespective of the location of the pyrosequencing primer the dispensation order is a crucial feature for avoiding similarities between uniplex pyrosequencing_signals the senator function considers all unique nucleotide_sequences uns expected to be found within each genomic_region of interest hence improving the selection of a dispensation order that produces uncorrelated uniplex pyrosequencing_signals the global multiplex pyrosequencing signal is then interpreted using a new signal_processing method based on a sparse_representation of the pyrosequencing signal the problem solved by sparse_representation consists in creating a compact signal representation in terms of a linear combination of signals in an over complete dictionary i e a dictionary including a number of signals p that exceeds the dimension of the signal space n sparse_representation was recently used to develop adviserpyro a new method dedicated to the analysis of low pyrosequencing signal_intensities and complex signals from several target amplicons while used for rapidly identifying mycobacterial_species specific signals after pyrosequencing adviser_pyro showed high prediction performances in this article adviser_m is used as a modified and updated version of original adviser_pyro adviserm pyro is designed to enable the analysis and interpretation of multiplex pyrosequencing_signals considering the steady_increase of extended_spectrum bacteria esbl worldwide and the occurrence of large esbl related outbreaks a specific high_throughput and multiplex dnabased identification methods would have outstanding clinical_relevance this new analytical application was therefore selected as a proof_of for senator and adviser_m in this study adviser_m was used to interpret pyrosequencing_signals generated during quintuplex pyrosequencing experiments i e pyrosequencing reactions performed with five specific pyrosequencing primers to genotype snps within blatem and blashv beta_lactamase resistance genes to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that quintuplex pyrosequencing_signals are produced and reliably translated in sequences corresponding to each of their five respective targets pyrosequencing is a cost_effective dna_sequencing that can be used for genotyping short dna stretches within bacterial_genomes when the genotyping application requires analyzing multiple dna stretches for diagnostic relevance each pyrosequencing reaction must be carried_out successively or in parallel which increases reagent costs and technician work load an alternative would consist in performing multiplex_pcr followed by a multiplex use of pyrosequencing primers but visual interpretation of the resulting multiplex signals is tedious time consuming and mostly unreliable in this study adviser_m was therefore developed and used to test the feasibility of analyzing and automatically interpreting signals resulting from quintuplex pyrosequencing of snps located within blatem and blashv beta_lactamase resistance genes all being first amplified by multiplex_pcr the huge n number of possible genetic profiles characterizing each bacterial_strain made this case study highly_challenging nonetheless it enabled us to demonstrate the feasibility and strengths of the new analytical_approach while also clarifying its potential_limitations dealing with a huge number of potential genetic profiles creates the possibility that any new mutation being by definition not yet included in the original dictionary produces a multiplex pyrosequencing signal which may coincidentally match an irrelevant combination of uns signals already present in the library as illustrated in bottom panels of this would unavoidably lead to misleading interpretation of the pyrogram tm resulting in genetic_sequences assigned to wrong resistance determinants moreover the high correlation_coefficient between the recorded signal and model_predictions would prevent the operator from detecting such misinterpretation but would also lead to overlooking this yet unidentified mutation occurrence ofthose issues is however less probable when the multiplex pyrosequencing application targets a limited number of well defined highly_stable and reproducible genetic_alterations such as these found in human multiple snp_genotyping in other applications a regular update of the dictionary is compulsory for integrating newly_discovered unss in the current application the dictionary was therefore updated to reflect exactly the state of the art as for today defining the upper threshold for the number of various genetic profiles minimizing the risk of misinterpretation would be highly_valuable and extremely useful when designing new multiplex applications this is unfortunately hardly achievable except on a caseby case basis as too many factors influence directly the quality of genotyping_results among which the quality of the pyrogram tm i e the signal_to the number of genomic_regions targeted in the application the length of the signals i e the length of the target_sequence that determines the number of dispensed nucleotides and the pairwise correlation between uniplex pyrosequencing_signals referenced in the dictionary the same factors also influence the optimal number of genomic_regions to be considered in the updated dictionary for ensuring a reliable multiplex identification of snps including more than five genomic_regions in a multiplex application is perfectly feasible but with an increased risk of unsafe results the respective contribution of each genomic_region in sparse_representation of the multiplex result decreases when additional genomic_regions are included likewise the latter would increase the total number of unss hence the probability of finding unss that are so similar that they cannot reliably be discriminated from one another irrespective of the selected dispensation order in addition to its regular update on the basis of new data from the literature the dictionary needs also to integrate experimental uniplex pyrosequencing_signals generated by the analysis of genuine target samples in the present study using a dictionary only based on theoretical signals decreased_significantly the performances of adviser_m to be able to include experimental pyrosequencing_signals appears therefore to be a clear and significant benefit of adviser_m compared with the multipsq software moreover the sct parameter of adviser_m enables to discard less contributing uns hence avoiding false_positive which can not be prevented by multipsq in summary an essential prerequisite of adviser_m is to build an over complete dictionary based on a list of all unss expected to characterize the genotyping application and to update it regularly if necessary when a compiled overcomplete dictionary is available multiplex pyrosequencing produces highly_reliable results as shown in the current proofof concept study most unss were correctly_identified and tagged with a safe label enabling to reduce substantially the total number of pyrosequencing reactions from to this novel multiplex pyrosequencing approach which integrates the selection of the nucleotide dispensation order with senator and the signals interpretation with adviser_m reading software enables therefore to lower the global turnaround time of genotyping and to decrease substantially analytical reagent costs while providing reliable target specific results note for each genomic_region the first column corresponds to the identified uns while the second column corresponds to the contribution of this uns to the global multiplex pyrosequencing signal uns contributions lower than two were tagged as unsafe
