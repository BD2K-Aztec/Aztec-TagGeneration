srinversion a tool for detecting short inversions by splitting and re aligning poorly mapped and unmapped sequencing_reads motivation rapid development in sequencing_technologies has dramatically improved our ability to detect genetic_variants in human_genome however current methods have variable sensitivities in detecting different types of genetic_variants one type of such genetic_variants that is especially hard to detect is inversions analysis of public_databases showed that few short inversions have been reported so_far unlike reads that contain small_insertions which will be considered through gap alignment reads carrying short inversions often have poor mapping quality or are unmapped thus are often not further considered as a result the majority of short inversions might have been overlooked and require special algorithms for their detection results here we introduce srinversion a framework to analyze poorly mapped or unmapped reads by splitting and realigning them for the purpose of inversion detection srinversion is very sensitive to small inversions and can detect those less than bp in size we applied srinversion to both simulated_data and high_coverage data from the genomes_project and compared the results with those from pindel breakdancer delly gustaf and mid a better performance of srinversion was achieved for both datasets for the detection of small inversions availability_and srinversion is implemented in perl and is publicly_available atinversions are a type of structural_variations svs that may play_an in human genetic_diversity and disease_susceptibility nevertheless unlike other svs such as deletions insertions and cnvs detection of inversions has been lagging behind analysis of sequencing_data was reported to be able to find around of known deletions but for inversions the fraction of detection is still insignificant so_far as shown in supplementary summary of all records on svs to date from public_databases such as dbvar and dgva demonstrated an obvious lack of documentation of inversions especially for small inversions bp to around bp this is inconsistent with previous suggestions that small svs are much more frequent in the genome than large svs suggesting that the majority of inversions might remain to be identified several computational_methods are available to detect svs based on short_read sequencing_data most of which have the function for inversion detection but only one of these tools was designed specifically for detecting short inversions most of these tools rely on signals of inconsistent mapping directions of the reads in a read_pair in paired_end which requires both reads of the pair to be mappable to the reference_genome and one read to almost entirely overlap with the inversion as a consequence this limits the minimum_length of inversions that can be detected to at least longer than the read_length software such as pindel tries to solve this problem by combining paired_end method with split_read method which makes it possible to detect inversions that are shorter than the read_length however by requiring at least one end of the read to be mapped to the reference_genome to serve as an anchor it loses power in detecting certain inversions such as those adjacent to other complex svs or repeat regions which are common for inversions as reported_previously and in this study here we introduce srinversion a framework that applies a split_read method on next_generation ngs_data to detect inversions smaller than kb instead of relying only on mapped_reads as anchors srinversion also makes use of poorly mapped or unmapped reads splits or inverts them and then re aligns them to the reference_genome to detect inversions by considering the unmapped reads which are overlooked for inversion detection by other tools the sensitivity of inversion detection is improved_significantly this is because for short inversions especially those shorter than the read_length most of the reads covering them are usually poorly mapped or unmapped gustaf and mid also try to use poorly mapped_reads to generate split map contigs for short inversion detection however the sensitivities of these methods are affected by their pre requisites such as requiring both ends of each read be mapped to the reference_genome with high_confidence we applied srinversion to both simulated_data from a parent_child trio from the genomes_project pindel breakdancer delly gustaf and mid were also applied on both datasets and the results were compared a better performance for srinversion was achieved on both datasets especially for small inversions step extract poorly mapped_reads in scenario reads partially covering inversion region and marked as soft clipped by bwa are extracted and in scenario reads covering the whole inversion region and considered unmapped are extracted step split_reads in scenario each extracted read will be split into two segments at different split sites and in scenario for each read sequence within windows of different sizes at different sites will be changed into reverse complement sequence step re map reads segment generated from step are aligned back to the reference and only segment pairs or segments that are exactly matched are selected for step step inversion region detection each matched segment or segment pair from step produces a start and end position of the inversion it covers and by merging those positions from different reads inversion region can be determined
