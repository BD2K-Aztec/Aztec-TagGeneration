sequence_analysis lacking alignments the next_generation mapper segemehl revisited motivation next_generation has become an important tool in molecular_biology various protocols to investigate genomic transcriptomic and epigenomic features across virtually all species and tissues have been devised for most of these experiments one of the first crucial steps of bioinformatic_analysis is the mapping of reads to reference_genomes results here we present thorough benchmarks of our read_aligner segemehl in comparison with other state of the art methods furthermore we introduce the tool lack to rescue unmapped rna_seq which works in conjunction with segemehl and many other frequently used split read_aligners availability lack is distributed together with segemehl and freely_available at www bioinf uni leipzig de software segemehl the problem of aligning short_sequencing to larger reference_genomes has_received in recent_years and many different alignment tools based on a variety of distinct algorithmic approaches have been published so_far a survey at the ebi currently counts more than different mappers this competitive field has seen quite a bit of evolution and progress early mappers were restricted to aligning short_reads with no or few mismatches and reads with insertions_and were excluded more often than not bowtie and segemehl were among the first next_generation ngs aligners that explicitly implemented strategies for aligning_reads with indels the rise of rna_seq protocols has added yet another layer of complexity to the problem splicing when mapping cdna reads that join two or more exons the aligner is required to split the read and align its parts to the appropriate exons in the reference_genome alternatively the mapper needs to be provided with junction or paired_end information to predict or construct mrna references today most of the tools allow only a single split while reads that span_multiple exonexon junctions may not be properly aligned as read_lengths are constantly increasing algorithms that allow multiple splits are clearly favorable segemehl facilitates multi split alignments using a local transition algorithm that was shown to perform very well in simulated and read data benchmarks the alignment of reads of bisulfite treated dna i e methylcytosine sequencing also requires specialized algorithms and methods the split_read and bisulfite features of segemehl have recently been published along with extensive benchmarks the diversity of tools and the rapid development of algorithms and software requires frequent transparent and reproducible benchmarks here we present the results of performance tests for dna_seq and rna_seq read_alignments and provide detailed information on them we have therefore assembled an extensive electronic supplement http www bioinf uni leipzig de publications supplements comprising all data custom scripts and detailed_descriptions on how to re run the analyses in reference to recent heated debates on the comparison of mappers we would like to stress that benchmarks only measure specific aspects and may not be used to claim any universal superiority or inferiority of any tool we would like to encourage all readers to reproduce this data and to come up with alternative benchmarks in addition to the benchmarking we propose a novel tool lack for remapping previously unmapped rna_seq using supplied splice_junctions the workflow of common split_read and bisulfite mapping using segemehl and remapping by lack is depicted in in this article we show that segemehl is a versatile and accurate read_aligner that performs equally well for reads from dna and rna_seq experiments and is largely independent of read_length and technology since the initial publication segemehl has been continuously updated and extended here we have focused updating segemehls performance in aligning dna_seq or unspliced rna_seq while the core algorithms remained_unchanged we have adjusted several parameterizations to optimize the tool our results indicate that segemehl is not only more sensitive in finding the optimal alignment with respect to the unit edit_distance but also very specific compared to the most commonly used alternative read_mappers these advantages are observable for both real and simulated reads in addition we have presented lack to rescue previously unmapped rna_seq that have emerged from splicing_events it shows excellent_performance for every dataset with all splitread aligner tested and hence represents a valuable extension to rna_seq analysis_pipelines
