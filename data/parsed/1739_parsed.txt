farao the flexible all round annotation organizer with decreasing costs of generating dna sequence_data genome and metagenome projects have become accessible to a wider scientific_community however to extract meaningful_information and visualize the data remain challenging we here introduce farao a highly scalable software for organization visualization and integration of annotation and read_coverage data that can also combine output data from several bioinformatics_tools the capabilities of farao can greatly aid analyses of genomic and metagenomic_datasets availability_and farao is implemented in perl and is supported under unix like operative systems including linux and macos the perl source_code is freely_available for down load under the mit_license fromrapid advancements in dna_sequencing have quickly shifted the bottleneck for biological_knowledge generation from restricted availability of sequence_data to limited ability to analyze and mine the datasets generated thus the analysis of nucleotide_sequences from recent genomics projects requires tools that cannot only handle massive_amounts of sequence_data but can also filter it and present the most relevant_information to the user in an efficient manner in this process visualization of dna sequence_data and its associated annotations is key however annotations are often generated using a range of tools and databases each with its own output_formats and restrictions hence the ability to combine annotations from different sources is instrumental to form a complete picture of the sequences under scrutiny furthermore with the advent of shotgun metagenomics which can produce_highly fragmented assemblies with thousands or even millions of contigs from a single sample scalability becomes an important issue to consider metagenomics and rna_sequencing also introduce the ability to quantify the abundance of contigs and features in the data based on read_coverage which therefore also becomes an important part to incorporate in analysis and visualization frameworks a multitude of tools for visualization of annotated sequence_features exist but most of them either cannot integrate annotation and read_coverage data e g focus mainly on visualizing coverage_information lack scalability beyond a few hundred sequences cannot efficiently filter the data to the needs of the user or pose restrictions on what tools and file_formats that can be used for input of annotated features and or coverage_information there also exist a range of web_based tools that can visualize high_throughput data generally connected to automated pipelines for sequence_annotation e g however none of these tools present a scalable multi purpose framework for integrating annotation and coverage_information from several different database sources into a database that can be queried at the request of the user consequently there is a need for highly_flexible and adaptable software_tools that can bridge disparate annotation and quantification approaches such a toolkit should be agnostic to what kind of bioinformatic_tools that have been used to annotate sequences and must be able to adapt to novel annotation utilities as they are introduced for example by providing extension modules to the software that can be tapped into by users skilled in programming given the challenges associated with filtering the data the software needs to be able to process it in a way that is scalable up to millions of sequences with hundreds of features each finally it is desirable if the software is able to produce publication quality visual output that can be further processed by users recently_introduced a web_server tool with many of these capabilities which however requires the user to upload the sequence and annotation data this might be prohibitive for users with limited internet connection and while web_based tools are convenient for many users they do not lend themselves to integration with unix and or linux based workflows which typically rely on command_line with these limitations in mind we have developed farao the flexible all round annotation organizer that functions as a highly configurable set of command_line that i integrate annotation and coverage_information for the same sequence set ii are scalable to millions of sequences and features iii can filter out sequences with annotations satisfying criteria given by the user iv can handle annotations produced by a range of bioinformatics_tools and v provide a flexible interface for writing custom parsers for virtually any format not supported out of the box
