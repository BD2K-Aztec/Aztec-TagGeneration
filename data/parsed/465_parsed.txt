systems_biology a rank_based statistical_test for measuring synergistic_effects between two gene_sets motivation due to recent_advances in high_throughput data on various types of genomic annotation have accumulated these data will be crucially helpful for elucidating the combinatorial logic of transcription although several approaches have been proposed for inferring cooperativity among multiple factors most approaches are haunted by the issues of normalization and threshold_values results in this article we propose a rank_based non parametric statistical_test for measuring the effects between two gene_sets this method is free from the issues of normalization and threshold value determination for gene_expression values furthermore we have proposed an efficient markov_chain method for calculating an approximate significance value of synergy we have applied this approach for detecting synergistic combinations of transcription_factor and histone_modifications availability c implementation of the method is available fromone of the important goals of genome biology is to unravel the transcriptional regulatory_mechanism among various statistical_approaches one common approach is to check non random association between gene_expression and the presence of various factors close to the transcription_start of genes although studies have mostly been performed on the relationships between expression_patterns and transcription_factor recent_advances in high_throughput have made it possible to consider other genome_annotations such as in vivo transcription_factor e g histone_modification e g nucleosome_positioning e g and open_chromatin e g among the statistical_methods used for testing relationships between functional genome elements and gene_expression gene to whom correspondence should be addressed set enrichment_analysis gsea has several merits over other statistical_approaches such as the chi_squared and fishers_exact because gsea measures the significance of the gene_set on the basis of the rank of the expression_level threshold_values do not need to be set in advance for determining upregulated and downregulated genes as discussed in this threshold independent property is crucially helpful because variations in expression caused by changes in the biological environment are often modest and the list of statistically_significant genes is usually difficult to reproduce if the experiments are performed in different laboratories in addition because gsea has a non parametric framework the validity of probabilistic assumptions such as the normality of noises need not be considered however gsea has one limitation gsea in its present form cannot be directly used to infer the combinatorial logic of multiple factors many biological studies have shown that gene_expression in some cases is induced only when multiple factors come in place and many pairs of transcription_factors that work in synergy have been identified such as e f and nf y tata and creband estrogen_receptor and foxa because of the accumulation of various types of genome_annotation data statistical_methods for detecting combinations of multiple factors functioning in synergy for transcription are becoming increasingly important several approaches for identifying cooperativity among transcription_factors have been proposed one popular_approach e g is to screen synergistic pairs of two transcription_factor on the basis of expression coherence if genes with both the motifs have expression_patterns that are significantly coherent than those of genes with only one motif then we can conclude that these two factors work in synergy this approach was successfully used to identify many cooperative combinations of motifs especially those related to cell_cycle however it requires many types of samples for determining coherence among genes which is not the case in general problems furthermore the choice of threshold for coherence is another difficult issue another approach e g is to treat the subject as a predicting problem of gene_expression from sequence_motifs and examine whether the interaction_term of two factors is important however these approaches usually make several assumptions on probabilistic_models such as the linearity of the effects of relevant_factors and their interaction_terms and the validityfirst using the method described in section we extracted the gene_sets whose enrichment score was positive supplementary after filtering the pairs whose common sets include genes q q for a robust inference we measured the synergistic_effect of each combination of these gene_sets by using the proposed method then to account for multiple_hypothesis false_discovery fdr q values are calculated supplementary_material for the detailed procedure the significant synergistic combinations are listed in e f and nf y whose cooperativity have been verified in many published_studies are reported to be highly synergistic although the single effects of these motifs are already significant their cooperativity provides additional benefits furthermore the motifs for e f and nf y were also enriched in upregulated genes in tumor_samples from patients with breast_cancer these observations confirms that the combinatorial functions of these two transcription_factors are closely_related to transcription mechanism in breast_cancer in this article we proposed a novel non parametric framework for measuring the synergy between two gene_sets the choice of normalization method and threshold_values are issues that need not be considered for this approach application to sequence_motifs and histone_modifications data implies that our method is helpful for unraveling the gene_expression mechanisms however our approach still has several limitations first we did not take into account the positional relationships between two factors in this study several studies have reported the importance of positional relationships e g therefore methods that can use this information should be devised second although this is not just confined to our approach identifying gene_sets itself is a very difficult problem the members of gene_sets
