systems_biology morpheus a user_friendly modeling environment for multiscale and multicellular systems_biology morpheus is a modeling environment for the simulation and integration of cell_based with ordinary_differential and reaction_diffusion it allows rapid development of multiscale models in biological terms and mathematical expressions rather than programming code its graphical_user supports the entire workflow from model construction and simulation to visual ization archiving and batch processing availability_and binary packages are available at http imc zih tu dresden de wiki morpheus for linux mac osx and ms windows systems_biology is rapidly_expanding its scope from the study of intracellular networks to the analysis of tissue and organ scale systems this increases the need for computational_methods and software that support the simulation and integration of cell_based with models for intra_and dynamics currently available modeling environments typically require programming or scripting to account for dynamical feedback between submodels at different scales yet as models grow more complex it becomes increasingly important to separate modeling from implementation to automate multiscale model integration and to provide intuitive user_interfaces sutterlin morpheus is a user_friendly application for the modeling simulation and integration of cell_based ordinary_differential and reaction_diffusion it supports the construction of multiscale models using biological terminology and mathematical constructs based on a novel domain specific language its graphical_user gui supports the whole workflow from model development and simulation to visualization and data output and features tools for archiving and batch processing morpheus has hitherto been used in a variety of studies including collective_motion morphogenesis kohnkohn and cell_fate b
