sequence_analysis pinstripe a suite of programs for integrating transcriptomic and proteomic_datasets identifies novel proteins and improves differentiation of protein_coding and non coding_genes motivation comparing transcriptomic_data with proteomic_data to identify protein_coding is a long_standing challenge in molecular_biology one that is exacerbated by the increasing size of high_throughput datasets to address this challenge and thereby to improve the quality of genome_annotation and understanding of genome biology we have developed an integrated suite of programs called pinstripe we demonstrate its application utility and discovery power using transcriptomic and proteomic_data from publicly_available datasets results to demonstrate the efficacy of pinstripe for large_scale analysis we applied pinstripes reverse peptide mapping pipeline to a transcript library including de_novo assembled transcriptomes from the human illumina body atlas iba and gencode v gene_annotations and the ebi proteomics identifications database pride pep tide database this analysis identified canonical open_reading orfs supported by three or more pride peptide_fragments that are positioned outside any known coding dna_sequence cds because of the unfiltered nature of the pride database and high_probability of false discovery we further refined this list using independent evidence for translation including the presence of a kozak sequence or functional_domains synonymous non synonymous substitution ratios and orf length using this integrative approach we observed evidence of translation from a previously_unknown let e primary transcript the archetypical lncrna h and a homolog of rd reciprocally by exclusion of transcripts with mapped peptides or significant orfs codon we identify loci with rnas longer than nt that are unlikely to encode_proteins availability_and pinstripe pinstripe matticklab com is freely_available as source_code or a mono binary pinstripe is written in c and runs under the mono framework on linux or mac os x and both under mono and net under windows contactalthough the annotation of the human_genome has undergone considerable effort with protein_coding loci identified the extent to which the genome is transcribed and subsequently translated remains_unclear as well as mrnas long rnas with little or no protein_coding capacity long_non or lncrnas are abundantly_expressed from the human_genome with non coding loci currently in gencode the most comprehensive annotation of the human_genome adding to the known catalog of rnas transcriptomic sequencing_experiments are identifying thousands of new transcripts on an ongoing basis confidently determining which rnas encode_proteins is difficult traditional approaches classify the protein_coding potential of an rna based on the presence of long canonical open_reading orfs phylogenomic evidence of codon conservation and or recognized functional_domains the former approach is highly dependent on orf length with codons typically used as the threshold for the identification of mrnas however this approach results in an unknown false_negative and positive rate as shorter proteins are known to exist and short orfs can occur by chance phylogenomic comparisons also have limitations notably their inability to detect orphan genes lacking homologs in other lineages and the tendency for recently evolved genes to encode smaller proteins than older genes moreover data from which evidence of orf and codon conservation can be determined are limited especially at short evolutionary_distances annotation of protein_coding is further confounded by factors such as rna_editing to whom correspondence should be addressed y these authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors z present_address wellcome_trust cancer research uk gurdon institute university of cambridge cambridge cb qn uk present_address garvan institute of medical_research darlinghurst sydney new_south australia genotypic variation non canonical start_codons and ribosomal frameshifting although many of the transcripts identified in de_novo assembled transcriptomes can be annotated through comparison with known reference_databases such as gencode or refseq this approach does not provide a means for classifying novel transcripts and is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the reference_database even determining the protein_coding capacity of novel transcript_isoforms of known genes is not straightforward as the insertion deletion and extension of exons may disrupt the existing orf or establish an alternative orf identifying the consequences of such events to the encoded protein_sequence on a genomic_scale is challenging and not addressed by existing_tools although the comparison of transcriptomic datasets to identify overlapping non overlapping features is facilitated by applications such as bedtools such applications do not consider the frame of the cds the classification of novel transcripts with a putative orf can be discerned with greater_confidence using proteomic_data mapping of proteomic sequences to transcriptomic_data is typically performed using software such as blast or blat use of these programs with high_throughput transcriptomic datasets requires considerable pre_and processing custom nucleotide_sequence dictionaries must be created from spliced genomic_coordinates before blast comparisons and resulting matches are reported with respect to mrna coordinates that require transformation into genomic_coordinates after mapping each orf then needs to be analyzed to determine the extent of supporting proteomic_data currently there is no software to facilitate this process although high_throughput proteomicgenomic comparisons in arabidopsis and proteomictranscriptomic integration in mice have been undertaken here we present an integrated software_suite pinstripe which overcomes many of the difficulties in such tasks providing programs supplementary to analyze transcriptomes specifically enabling i orf aware comparison with proteincoding gene_annotations identifying cdss with in frame overlap ii mapping of proteomic_data to the transcriptome leveraging blastp and tblastn and reporting results as genomic_coordinates and iii annotation of orfs supported by peptides from proteomic_datasets in addition pinstripe features a multitude of tools for analyzing transcriptomes including intersection by feature name identification of best representative transcripts for loci and extraction of dna_sequence or predicted orfs from genomic_coordinates we demonstrate the utility of pinstripe by analyzing transcriptomes assembled de_novo from high_throughput of human tissues and mass_spectrometry from the embl ebi proteomics identifications database pride finding previously_unidentified protein_coding and providing high_confidence annotations for thousands of long ncrnas differentiating between ncrna and mrna is far from trivial with traditional strategies relying on characteristics or features of known mrnas such as codon conservation orf length or homology such strategies are effective at identifying mrna that are well conserved contain large canonical orfs are similar to known mrna or encode known protein_domains but less reliable for detecting_small poorly conserved proteins with specific non redundant function as a supplement to such approaches pinstripe provides a suite of tools designed to integrate and aggregate large sets of proteomic and transcriptomic experimental_data providing not only new tools for the identification of rna potentially encoding proteins but also foramino acid protein and is the primary transcript for mir let e mir a and mir b it is conserved in mammals and contains a immunoglobulin like and transmembrane_domain the start of transcription is supported by h_k modifications indicative of initiation d hmgdc encodes a amino_acid testis specific protein with helixloophelix dna_binding and hmg_box domains the protein is conserved in mammals and extends a predicted ensembl gene integrating data from in silico genomic comparisons by existing applications such as phylocsf signalp and iprscan there is growing evidence that large_numbers of rnas without well conserved long canonical orfs are actually translated for example the humanin genes_encode short orfs amino_acids and are found only in humans translation of upstream orfs is a demonstrated regulatory_mechanism and non canonical start sites are common in mouse_embryonic as a result algorithms dependent on orf length canonical start_codons conservation or synonymous non synonymous_substitution will not always be sufficient to identify and differentiate between coding and non coding_genes this is especially true in the case of short proteins which are challenging to identify as orfs codons regularly occur by chance as other methods including conservation analysis and dinucleotide content are only predictive and have shortcomings the integration of experimental evidence_supporting translation is often required for confident annotation of novel proteins pinstripe is designed to allow users to integrate any available experimental_data in the form of gene_annotations peptide_identifications or external analyses using applications such as phylocsf or signalp although pinstripe is entirely dependent on the integrity of the pepfrags annotations and transcriptomes used for analysis users can adjust the thresholds for identification to improve the probability of correct classification the appropriate thresholds will largely depend on the quality of the data notably the accuracy of pepfrag identifications most commonly the process of correctly identifying pepfrags from spectra relies on the statistically_robust concordance of the queried peptide fragment with predicted spectra from a target_database although using pepfrags that have already been sequenced dramatically_reduces the computational task the fidelity of the original identification is lost this can be addressed by pre screening of spectra selecting only those with a set level of confidence using peptides from quality controlled sources such as the peptideatlas or at the protein identification stage by requiring an increased number of coincident pepfrags or other supporting_information such as conservation or functional prediction to identify coding_genes our analysis of the iba data demonstrates that application of pinstripes programs accurately maps pepfrags and integrates them with transcripts to identify supported orfs and identifies rna with little or no protein_coding capacity although not all orfs containing mapped pepfrags represent genuine protein_coding additional lines of evidence including signal_peptide potential positive phylocsf scores and multiple pepfrags identify potential protein_coding including the validated protein rd lp variants of gipc and aak and a protein translated from the putative ncrna h pinstripe allows researchers to identify transcripts with little or no protein_coding potential and which have no pepfrags mapping to putative orfs regardless of size this is especially important as knowledge of whether a given transcript is coding or non coding will guide the design of any subsequent experimental work to characterize its function pinstripe is freely_available for download at pinstripe matticklab com
