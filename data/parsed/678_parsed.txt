bayesian joint analysis of heterogeneous genomics data a non parametric bayesian factor model is proposed for joint analysis of multi_platform genomics data the approach is based on factorizing the latent space feature_space into a shared component and a data specific component with the dimensionality of these components spaces inferred via a beta bernoulli process the proposed approach is demonstrated by jointly analyzing gene_expression copy_number and gene_expression methylation data for ovarian_cancer patients showing that the proposed model can potentially uncover key drivers related to cancer availability_and the source_code for this model is written in matlab and has been made publicly_available at https sites google com site jointgenomics gene_expression are commonly used in the study of cancer_biology however human_cancers are highly_heterogeneous because of the combined effects of genetic instabilities and epigenetic_alterations hence it is notoriously_difficult to gain understanding of the mechanisms of cancer_progression from gene_expression data alone the root cause of cancer is due to several possible events for instance copy_number cnvs under selective_pressure change the dosage of key tumor inducing and tumor suppressing genes which thereby affect mrna_transcription and neoplastic cell_proliferation on the other hand the mechanism of epigenetic alteration is more complicated dna_methylation are globally disrupted in tumor_cells characterized by both global hypomethylation and regionspecific hypermethylation at cpg islands there is a recent explosion in the availability of cancer datasets of multiple heterogeneous data types from sources like the cancer_genome tcga cancergenome nih gov it is hoped that the availability of simultaneous measurements of multiple biological_features such as gene_expression dna_copy change dna_methylation and others will offer an increased insight into the root causes of cancer phenotypes these insights have the potential to distinguish genetic epigenetic changes that promote cancer_progression driver_mutation from those with no selective_advantage passenger mutation which could revolutionize the treatment of cancer by suggesting novel targets for cancer_therapeutics and by developing biomarkers to identify the patients who will most benefit from such therapeutics there are numerous publications on combining different types of dna_modifications with gene_expression perhaps the most natural of these are the brute_force methods such as expression_quantitative eqtl_analysis joint analysis of single_nucleotide snp data with gene_expression data by expression_quantitative involves testing every gene single_nucleotide pair for association with a t test and then correcting for multiple_hypothesis cnamet defines a similar approach to relate gene_expression changes with either copy_number change or dna_methylation other approaches use well established models for each of the individual data types and then combine the results into a statistic that addresses the problem of interest the approach ofis an example of this for the identification of genes that are regulated by dna_methylation a shortcoming of all of these approaches is that they do not reduce the dimension of the individual_datasets through an accounting of their respective correlation structures in the authors used kernel functions predefined for each data type and mapped to the same vector space which allows joint analysis in the common range of the kernels copy_number and expression in cancer has been proposed as a bayesian scoring_function that measures how well a set of candidate gene_regulators correlates with the expression of gene_modules groups of genes that are correlated with each other another approach uses a sparse factor sf model to describe the correlation_structure of the gene_expression data but uses post_hoc hypothesis_tests to draw connections between gene_expression and copy_number data these approaches allow for effective dimension_reduction but do not use correlation_structure in one dataset to inform the estimations of correlation in the others zheng andextended this approach by the development of a two sf model using aneuploidy and gene_expression as an example it assumes some factors are shared by two data where to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as z the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors there is a statistical_correlation and some factors are unique to each dataset the common factors are further linked by sampling gene_expression factors centered on the cnv factors with some gaussian_noise thereby preventing the difference in data size from overwhelming the information available on associations between them however it is difficult to check model_assumptions in high_dimension by specifying different numbers of factors in the recent_years model based integration approach has become popular for analyzing tcga data proposed a three node bayesian graphical_model to represent the dependence_structure of cnvs methylation and gene_expression this method identifies the mrna regulatory event separately for each candidate_gene but does not consider gene_modules as a whole ibag specifies gene methylation effect and other regulatory module controlled effect and then uses a two component regression_model to identify gene biomarkers that are associated with clinical_outcomes e g survival time tumor_stage and other demographic_variables in this way it assumes linear and independent effects between gene_expression and methylation as well as patient_survival and gene_expression however given the complexity of epigenetic regulatory_mechanisms more flexible bayesian non parametric_models may be preferred for jointly modeling heterogeneous data bayesian and semibayesian latent_variable have been developed to factorize the latent space into a shared and data specific part however in these approaches the number of latent_factors is chosen a priori alternatively one may consider multiple factor_models each with a different number of factors and perform model_selection based on information criteria such as akaike_information aic or bayesian_information bic however as stated earlier it is often challenging to check modeling assumptions in highdimensions hence a non parametric or semiparametric model is desirable in this article we propose a non parametric bayesian factor_analysis approach for integrating heterogeneous genomics data with the number of factors inferred from the available data our proposed approach is based on factoring the latent space into shared and data specific components using a beta bernoulli process to infer the dimension of these latent spaces we demonstrate the proposed approach on the joint analysis of genomics data for ovarian_cancer patients including three different data types gene_expression cnv and dna_methylation data we demonstrate that the joint analysis of gene_expression cnv and gene_expression dna methylation_levels can potentially identify genomic and epigenomic regulators influencing cancer pathophysiology outcomes the remainder of the article is organized as follows in section we present the proposed hierarchical_bayesian for jointly analyzing heterogeneous genomics data in section we discuss priors on factor_loadings and factor scores section outlines an mcmc inference algorithm section provides experimental_results for the proposed model on the analysis of multiple genomics data finally we provide concluding_remarks in section a non parametric joint factor_analysis method is introduced for modeling multiple disparate but statistically related data the proposed approach was demonstrated on the joint analysis of heterogeneous genomics data related to ovarian_cancer the proposed model uncovered key drivers of cancer some of which have been previously_reported in literature as well as some new genomic causes of cancer potentially in this article we have focused on integrating_multiple heterogeneous but statistically_correlated datasets via a joint factor_analysis approach where the latent space is factorized into a shared component and data specific components the joint factor_analysis model allows enough flexibility to incorporate additional information into the model for example we could alternatively use a gaussian_process prior or a sticky hmm prior on the loadings of cnvs to incorporate spacial dependence_structure in the model hence more refined regional peaks may be recovered we plan to investigate such priors in our future work besides we assume data specific linear mappings between the latent space and the observation space however the assumption that the data lie in or close to a lowdimensional subspace is restrictive and a better assumption is that the data lie on a manifold in the future we wish to relax the linearity assumption of our joint factor model via a mixture of factor analyzers approach loadings from factor with strong correlations between methylation a and gene_expression b at many different loci the gray denotes odd numbered chromosomes and the black denotes even numbered chromosomes diamond markers denote loci where the absolute value of loadings are and gene_expressions are significantly associated with adjacent methylation_sites detailed in supplementarygene identified in the loadings peak from factor of the joint factor model_fit to dna_methylation a and gene_expression b data the gray denotes odd numbered chromosomes and the black denotes even numbered chromosomes
