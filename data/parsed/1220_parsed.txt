sequence_analysis cushaw a cuda compatible short read_aligner to large_genomes based on the_burrows motivation new high_throughput have promoted the production of short_reads with dramatically low unit cost the explosive_growth of short_read datasets poses a challenge to the mapping of short_reads to reference_genomes such as the human_genome in terms of alignment_quality and execution speed results we present cushaw a parallelized short read_aligner based on the compute_unified cuda parallel programming model we exploit cuda compatible graphics hardware as accelerators to achieve fast speed our algorithm uses a quality aware bounded search approach based on the_burrows bwt and the ferraginamanzini index to reduce_the and achieve high alignment_quality performance evaluation using simulated as well as real short_read datasets reveals that our algorithm running on one or two graphics_processing achieves significant speedups in terms of execution time while yielding comparable or even better alignment_quality for paired_end alignments compared with three popular bwt based aligners bowtie bwa and soap cushaw also delivers competitive_performance in terms of single_nucleotide calling for an escherichia_coli test_dataset availability the emergence of high_throughput have led to an explosive_growth of the size and availability of short_read datasets it is therefore important and challenging to efficiently and effectively map the sheer volume of short_reads to genomes as large as the human_genome for existing short_read existing aligners are mainly based on two approaches hash tables and suffix prefix tries the aligners based on hash tables either hash the short_reads or the reference_genome by hashing short_reads aligners including rmap maq and shrimp usually have a flexible memory_footprint but may have the overhead introduced by scanning the whole_genome when few reads are aligned by hashing the to whom correspondence should be addressed reference_genome aligners such as soap pass and bfast can be efficiently parallelized using multiple threads but require large_amounts of memory to construct an index for the reference_genome the aligners based on suffix prefix tries essentially perform inexact matching based on exact matching compared with hash tables the advantage of the use of tries is that only one search pass is needed to find the alignments to multiple identical copies of a substring in the reference_genome whereas the hash tables need to perform one search pass for each copy the search using suffix prefix tries must rely on some algorithms and data_structures one such combination is the burrowswheeler_transform bwt and the ferraginamanzini fm_index several short_read have been developed based on the bwt and the fm_index including the popular bowtie bwa and soap these three aligners provide support for two types of alignments seeded alignment where the high_quality end of a read is used as the seed and end_to alignment moreover paired_end is usually also supported bowtie does not support gapped_alignment and soap and bwa support both ungapped and gapped alignments the three aligners have been parallelized using multi threading and are optimized for multi core cpus even though these aligners are fast they are still time consuming for large_scale re sequencing_applications the emerging many core graphics_processing gpus have evolved to be a powerful choice in addition to multi core cpus and other accelerators such as cell be for the high_performance world their compute power has been demonstrated to reduce the execution time in a range of demanding bioinformatics applications including sequence_alignment motif_discovery and short_read error_correction these successes have motivated us to use gpu computing to accelerate short_read as a first step implemented a short read_aligner based on the hash_table approach using gpus however this aligner can only work for small_scale microbial_genomes and does not support paired_end in this article we present cushaw a parallelized algorithm to align short_reads to large_genomes such as the human_genome it uses a quality aware bounded search approach based on the bwt and the fm_index and exploits compute_unified cuda compatible gpus to accelerate the alignment process the performance of our algorithm is comparedwe have evaluated the performance of cushaw by comparing to three popular short_read bowtie version bwa version rc and soap version using simulated and real short_read datasets the first three datasets inare paired_end datasets simulated from the human_genome using the wgsim utility program in the samtools package version with snp mutation_rate indel
