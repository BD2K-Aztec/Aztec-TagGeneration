systems_biology learning gene network_structure from time laps cell imaging in rnai knock downs motivation as rna_interference is becoming a standard method for targeted gene perturbation computational_approaches to reverse_engineer parts of biological_networks based on measurable effects of rnai become increasingly relevant the vast_majority of these methods use gene_expression data but little attention has been paid so_far to other data types results here we present a method which can infer gene_networks from high_dimensional phenotypic perturbation_effects on single cells recorded by time lapse microscopy we use data from the mitocheck project to extract multiple shape intensity and texture_features at each frame features from different cells and movies are then aligned along the cell_cycle time subsequently we use dynamic nested effects models dynonems to estimate parts of the network_structure between perturbed genes via a markov_chain approach our simulation_results indicate a high reconstruction_quality of this method a reconstruction based on gene knock downs yielded a network where all edges could be explained via the biological_literature availability the implementation of dynonems is part of the bioconductor r package nem the availability of large rnai screens has raised the interest in computational_approaches for reverse_engineering parts of biological_networks from measurable effects of targeted gene perturbations examples thereof range from graph_theoretical algorithms over bayesian_networks to factor graphs epistasis_analysis and ordinary_differential systems most of these methods make use of gene_expression data the few attempts to reverse_engineer gene_networks from phenotypic_data include studies by who rely on hierarchical_clustering of static images and who use a probabilistic_graphical for only one binary phenotypic variable in static images to our knowledge there is yet no method for the inference of networks from time lapse microscopy based on large_numbers of statistical image_features nested effects models nems are a class of probabilistic_graphical that have been introduced originally byand extended substantially later on by in nems indirect high_dimensional downstream_effects of multiple single gene knock downs are studied nems allow for inferring the signaling flow between these perturbed genes on a transcriptional as well as non transcriptional level based on the measured intervention effects extended the theory of nems to time series data and applied it to infer parts of a transcriptional_network involved in murine stem_cell development originally nems assumed downstream_effects to be measured via gene_expression but here we use phenotypic image_features from movies instead our movies were taken from the mitocheck database in which about human genes were silenced via rnai and subsequently screened for cell_cycle defects we use dynamic nems to estimate the network between perturbed genes based on the dynamic_response of the phenotype along the cell_cycle the inference is based on a markov_chain mcmc_algorithm which is introduced in this article we have shown that it is possible to learn pathway structures from phenotypic perturbation_effects recorded in time lapse movies at the heart of the method lies the extraction of morphological_features yielding measurable differences in cell_phenotypes we have developed a method to quantify these differences such that an extended version of the dynonem method is applicable to do so cell trajectories were automatically aligned to the standard cell_cycle and a likelihood_ratio score for the detection of feature changes was calculated here this was done by comparing the distribution of each feature across different cells in a control and treated population which makes the detection of significances sensitive given the large number of observed cells one might also imagine comparing each feature in a single treated cell against the population of control cells as an alternative this would probably be less sensitive but could also be valuable if cell by cell differences are of relevance we have developed a novel mcmc sampler for network structure_learning to estimate the posterior likelihood of each interaction our method allows for the inclusion of prior_knowledge in a bayesian fashion our whole approach aims at the reconstruction of small networks on the order of nodes for which the search_space of signaling graphs can be sampled representatively for larger_networks possible solutions include the restriction of the number of possible interaction_partners of each node as well as divide_and approaches but this is subject to future_research our simulations_demonstrate the high_sensitivity of our approach this is also reflected in our application to movies of sirna knock downs from the mitocheck database where all estimated interactions were explainable by literatureknown pathways we detect and exploit phenotypic_differences that develop in response to a perturbation of the cell in our present application all phenotypic_differences are derived from merely one fluorescence_staining of the cell gfp histone tagging we expect a significant increase in power of our method if multiple stainings were used and the individual fluorescence labels were indicative of the biological_process under investigation a basic assumption of our present movienem approach is that phenotypic perturbation_effects should occur at some point during the cell_cycle and then remain until the end of the cell_cycle this assumption may not be fulfilled in all cases even more some perturbations may not yield a phenotypic effect at all in such cases movienem is not applicable finally it is worth emphasizing that movienem up to now is certainly not an approach for large_scale network_reconstruction this is due to the huge network space increasing exponentially with the number of network nodes which makes sampling based_methods as well as heuristic approaches computationally slow the reconstruction of cellular_networks affords a better insight into the organization of a cell targeted rnai screens have revealed their great_potential for this purpose during the past_years given the fact that the combination with omics_data is not always possible or affordable image_based techniques can offer a promising alternative our movienem approach is therefore a step toward better exploiting this information rich data to uncover biological_mechanisms
