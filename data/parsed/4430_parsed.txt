stochkit software for discrete stochastic_simulation of biochemical_systems with events stochkit is the first major upgrade of the popular stochkit stochastic_simulation software_package stochkit provides highly_efficient implementations of several variants of gillespies stochastic_simulation ssa and tau leaping with automatic step size_selection stochkit features include automatic selection of the optimal ssa method based on model properties event handling and automatic parallelism on multicore architectures the underlying_structure of the code has been completely updated to provide a flexible framework for extending its functionality availability stochkit runs on linux unix mac os x and windows it is freely_available under gpl version and can be downloaded from http sourceforge net_projects stochkit contacttraditional deterministic representations of biochemical_systems are useful when the interacting chemical_species are present in high_concentrations however many processes in systems_biology are driven by reactions between chemicals with small copy_numbers these processes are inherently stochastic and often display behavior that cannot be captured by deterministic models gillespies stochastic_simulation ssa provides a method for generating trajectories that capture the stochastic behavior of biochemical_models the ssa begins with a model of n chemical_species s s s n with associated discrete populations x x x n these species interact via m reaction channels r r r m reaction r i is characterized by a stoichiometric vector denoted v i and a propensity function denoted a i the stoichiometric vector describes the change in population that occurs when reaction r i fires the propensity function describes the probability that reaction r i will occur in the next infinitesimal time interval dt with a few simplifying assumptions including spatial homogeneity the evolution of the system can be represented as a markov jump process that is described by the chemical master_equation cme the cme is generally too complex to solve directly the ssa is a monte_carlo method that proceeds by simulating every reaction event in the system to generate exact trajectories of the cme to whom correspondence should be addressed generally an ensemble of trajectories is run to obtain an estimate of the probability_distribution since gillespies pioneering work there have been numerous advances in efficient exact ssa variants as well as approximate_methods that sacrifice exactness in exchange for increased computational_efficiency e g the stochkit software_package allows practicing systems biologists to perform stochastic_simulations of biochemical_models the simulation algorithms automatically detect and utilize multicore architectures for efficiency and perform consistency checks for reliability the code has been built upon a carefully_designed simulation framework to be easily extensible
