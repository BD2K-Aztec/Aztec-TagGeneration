protein subcellular_location pattern_classification in cellular images using latent discriminative models_motivation knowledge of the subcellular_location of a protein is crucial for understanding its functions the subcellular pattern of a protein is typically represented as the set of cellular_components in which it is located and an important task is to determine this set from microscope images in this article we address this classification_problem using confocal_immunofluorescence images from the human_protein hpa project the hpa contains images of cells stained for many proteins each is also stained for three reference components but there are many other components that are invisible given one such cell the task is to classify the pattern type of the stained protein we first randomly select local image regions within the cells and then extract various carefully_designed features from these regions this region based approach_enables us to explicitly study the relationship between proteins and different cell components as well as the interactions between these components to achieve these two goals we propose two discriminative models that extend logistic_regression with structured latent_variables the first model allows the same protein pattern class to be expressed differently according to the underlying components in different regions the second model further captures the spatial dependencies between the components within the same cell so that we can better infer these components to learn these models we propose a fast approximate algorithm for inference and then use gradient based_methods to maximize the data likelihood results in the experiments we show that the proposed models help improve the classification_accuracies on synthetic data and real cellular images the best overall accuracy we report in this article for classifying proteins into classes of patterns is about which to our knowledge is the best so_far in addition the dependencies learned are consistent with prior_knowledge of cell organization the systematic study of subcellular protein location patterns is required for the full characterization of the human_proteome as these location patterns provide context necessary for understanding the proteins functions given human_protein hpa images that demonstrate the spatial distribution of various proteins and components organelles in cells each of which has been assigned to one of location pattern classes by visual_inspection our goal is to learn to recognize those pattern classes in future images we can solve this problem using multiclass classification methods however a key difficulty is that we can only observe three types of reference components due to the limitation of staining and imaging_techniques therefore it is hard to infer the locations of the invisible components given the observations for example we may want to classify a protein into the class of golgi_complex if it mainly overlaps with the golgi_complex but the golgi_complex is not directly visible to us in the images thereby it is important to uncover these invisible parts and then use them for classification from their co occurrence information with the protein although invisible we still have some clues about the presence of a component in some region of one cell for instance one component may have an effect on the appearance of another overlapping and or interacting component we can also make inference about the component in the given image region based on the distribution of certain proteins in the cell e g locations and shapes and its relative distances to other components if we can discover the dependencies between the observed features extracted from regions and the underlying components as well as the co localization relationships between components then the presence of those hidden components can be inferred and our classification task would be easier we therefore aim at learning from the data the dependencies among features components and the protein pattern classes into which the images have been divided to accomplish this we build two graphical_models with latent_variables to capture the components and these dependencies these two models are based on logistic_regression lr the first model called hidden logistic_regression hlr introduces the concept of component as a latent_variable into the simple lr so that the protein and the component can determine the expressed features together the second model called hidden conditional_random hcrf further introduces spatial dependencies among components at different locations as in conditional_random crf developed by these two models can capture the components influence on the expressed features and their spatial configurations hopefully improving our ability to recognize the patterns we use gradient based_methods to estimate the models parameters we show that the gradients depend on the marginal probabilities on the nodes and edges in the model for hlr this computation is easy but for the hcrf model inferences for these marginals cannot be done exactly to address this difficulty inin this article we address the problem of classifying proteins based on their subcellular localization_patterns given the spatial distribution of a protein in the cells we want to know the class of this protein to solve this problem we proposed two discriminative models that extend lr with latent_variables the first one called the hlr extends regular logistic_regression so that the features can depend on factors other than the class label the hlr model addresses the issue that the same protein can be expressed differently at different locations of the cell the second model called the hcrf further extends the hlr model by allowing the regions in the same cell to interact with each other hcrf is able to guess the component at a location based on information from other regions thus helping us better predict the class of the protein in both synthetic and real_data experiments we demonstrate that the proposed models are able to enhance classification_performance particularly on the hpa dataset hcrf achieved overall accuracy on proteins which is best result up to now in the future we plan to enhance the performance by using better features and devise more accurate learning algorithms for example we can incorporate richer dependencies between components the features can also be transformed to take potential non linearity into considerable more efficient inference algorithm can be developed to allow for more complex interactions between components moreover because there are much larger amounts of images of proteins that can localize in more than one component in cell we want to apply the models proposed in this article to classify more challenging protein subcellular_location pattern complexes
