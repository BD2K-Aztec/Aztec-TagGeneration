nemo a tool for analyzing gene and chromosome territory distributions from d fish experiments three_dimensional fluorescence_in d fish is used to study the organization and the positioning of chromosomes or specific sequences such as genes or rna in cell_nuclei many different programs commercial or free allow image_analysis for d fish experiments one of the more efficient open_source programs for automatically processing d fish microscopy_images is smart d fish an imagej plug in designed to automatically analyze distances between genes one of the drawbacks of smart d fish is that it has a rather basic user_interface and produces its results in various text and image files thus making the data post_processing step time consuming we developed a new smart d fish graphical_user nemo which provides all information in the same place so that results can be checked and validated efficiently nemo gives users the ability to drive their experiments analysis in either automatic semi_automatic or manual detection mode we also tuned smart d fish to better analyze chromosome_territories availability nemo is a stand alone java_application available for windows and linux platforms the program is distributed under the creative commons licence and can be freely downloaded from https www lgc now that genome_sequencing has been mastered and cell imaging_techniques have vastly improved our understanding of cell structure and function there is an increasing demand in life_science studies for cell imaging_techniques and for ways to provide accurate localization of genes and their products within cells and tissues threedimensional fluorescence_in d fish is used to study the organization and positioning of chromosomes sub chromosomal_regions and or specific sequences such as genes or rna in cellular preparations with the d structure of the chromatin preserved by hybridization of probes with complementary_sequences many different programs allow image_analysis for d fish experiments commercial or free and onereliable and fast measurements of the relative positioning of genes toward their chromosomal territories are essential to analyze the role of nuclear architecture on the regulation of gene_expression in three dimensions nemo is a user_friendly interface to interactively analyze and visualize fish d images nemo automatically detects objects in the images spots cts or nuclei nevertheless the user has the possibility to interact with the program to delete or add objects the results are then stored in a relational_database mysql for further analyses
