predicting tumor_purity from methylation microarray_data motivation in cancer_genomics research one important problem is that the solid tissue_sample obtained from clinical_settings is always a mixture of cancer and normal cells the sample mixture brings complication in data analysis and results in biased findings if not correctly accounted for estimating tumor_purity is of great interest and a number of methods have been developed using gene_expression copy_number or point_mutation data results we discover that in cancer samples the distributions of data from illumina_infinium k methylation microarray are highly_correlated with tumor purities we develop a simple but effective method to estimate purities from the microarray_data advances of high_throughput have revolutionized the cancer_genomics research tremendous efforts have been made to study the genomic characteristics of different types of cancers for example by large consortiums like the cancer_genome tcga results from these studies contribute significantly to the understanding of cancer etiologies and the discovery of diagnostic_biomarkers and therapeutic_targets in cancer research one important problem cannot be overlooked is that the solid tissue_sample obtained from clinical_settings is always a mixture of cancer and normal cells the mixture brings complication to data analysis and results in biased and even erroneous findings if not correctly accounted for the problem of estimating tumor_purity or the proportion of cancer_cells from a mixed tissue has been of great interests a number of statistical_methods and software_tools were developed over the last several years based on data for gene_expression or copy_number and point_mutations in particular absolute is a statistical_method for inferring tumor_purity and absolute_copy from a mixed sample based on snp_array it takes the estimated copy ratios as input and jointly estimates purity and ploidy by maximizing the whole data likelihood absolute has been applied to most of the tcga samples and its purity estimates have become the de facto gold_standards provided by tcga nevertheless many of the existing_methods still require data from purified samples or significant prior_biological which could be difficult to obtain in clinical_settings due to the heterogeneity of cancer the limitations significantly undermine the practical usefulness of the existing_methods in this work we discover through extensive real_data exploration that dna_methylation data from illumina_infinium k microarray are informative for tumor purities dna_methylation is an important epigenetic_modification of dna_molecule with essential role in many basic biological_processes it often shows abnormality in various types of cancers an important feature of dna_methylation is that a majority of the genome are either fully methylated or unmethylated from a mixed tumor_tissue genomic_regions that are differentially_methylated between cancer and normal will likely show mid level methylation so the distribution of mid level methylation provides information for the tumor_purity although there are several reports on the existence of intermediately methylated regions imr even from pure sample our real_data observations show that there are much more imrs from mixed_samples so that the tumor_purity can still be inferred from imrs with carefully_designed algorithm a recently_developed method methylpurify estimates tumor_purity from bisulfite_sequencing bs_seq data the method uses the methylation information from single sequence_read and performs estimation through a two component mixture_model using em_algorithm an important advantage of the method is that it does not require data from reference samples so it has a wider application in clinical_settings however because of the high_cost of bs_seq experiment application of the method is still rather limited in large_scale population level studies for example the epigenomewide association study epigwas microarray_technology such as illumina_infinium k microarray is still widely_applied in this work we seek to understand whether the tumor_purity can be estimated from methylation microarray_data we discover that there exist probes mostly with intermediate methylation_levels that are informative for inferring tumor_purity we develop a method to estimate tumor_purity from illumina_infinium k microarray and then apply the method on the tcga lung_adenocarcinoma luad data results show that the method can accurately_predict the tumor_purity levels in this work we discover that the methylation microarray_data from tumor_samples contain important information for tumor_purity in particular the shape of the beta values distribution is strongly influenced by the purity we explained the phenomenon using a statistical_model and show that the distributions can be utilized to estimate tumor_purity in essence beta values of informative probes dmps follow a bimodal_distribution and the locations of the modes are related to the tumor_purity by obtaining the modes of these beta values tumor purities can be estimated from a linear_model we design an algorithm infiniumpurify for purity estimation and show that it provides good results from several sets of tcga data there are several advantages of infiniumpurify compared with existing tumor_purity estimation methods first it does not require data from reference_panels which could be difficult to obtain in clinical_settings due to the heterogeneity of cancer second it is very cost_effective compared with base resolution methylation data such as whole_genome bs_seq moreover since the dna samples are much easier to collect compared with mrna the purity estimation based on methylation data will provide a more practical mean in clinical_settings from large cancer related epigwas studies the purity estimation can be obtained as a by product from the methylation microarrays finally absolute usually provides several solutions corresponding to local maxima of the likelihood prediction results from infiniumpurify can help researches make a final decision we use absolute estimates as benchmark for model training and results comparison because of the following reasons first absolute is one of the earliest and arguably the most influential tools for tumor_purity estimations it is widely used as a gold_standard to evaluate new purity estimation methods for example abscn seq and thete second it provides tumor_purity estimates for several types of tumors and thousands of samples which can facilitate large_scale comparison third infiniumpurify is designed and tested using data from tcga samples and absolute is the official tumor_purity predictor for tcga consortium the fact that infiniumpurify estimates are highly_correlated with absolute estimates albeit using a very different data type and computational_model further justifies the accuracy of absolute estimates independently we compared our results with several cnv based_methods and show good agreements in purity estimation however although both cnv and methylation contain information for cancer purity they do not have to be correlated in the raw_data level both types of methods use genomewide distributions of quantities cnv or intermediate methylated probes to estimate purity the cnv and methylation could be completely unrelated at finer scales such as within a few hundred base_pairs it is important to note that infiniumpurify does not take ploidy information of tumor_cells into consideration which could slightly bias our prediction however since the prediction is based on relatively large number of dmps across the genome and a majority of them will not have copy_number we expect the aberrant copy_numbers would not significantly change the overall result the selection of dmps plays an important role in the method in its current form infiniumpurify only works when the number samples is reasonably large fortunately in tcga most important cancer_types have large_sample it will be interesting and useful to explore whether it is possible to combine data from different cancers and construct universal dmps moreover infiniumpurify is only focused on estimating tumor_purity decoupling signals from mixed sample to estimate the methylation_levels from cancer normal is our research plan in the near future infiniumpurify is specifically_designed for data from illumina_infinium k arrays which is the most widely used platform for dna_methylation it is conceivable that the same principle and methods can be applied to data from other platforms in this work we present a simple but effective method to estimate tumor_purity from methylation microarray_data the method can serve as an alternative for existing_methods with similar goals although the method is focused on tumor_tissues it can potentially be applied to other highly heterogeneous_samples such as blood or brain furthermore it will be very interesting to combine methylation with other genetic and genomic_data such as gene_expression and genetic_variants and build a joint model for tumor_purity estimation such model will have potential to significantly improve the estimation accuracy
