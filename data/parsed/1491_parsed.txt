systems_biology drug_target interaction prediction by learning from local information and neighbors motivation in silico methods provide efficient ways to predict possible interactions between drugs and targets supervised_learning approach bipartite local model blm has recently been shown to be effective in prediction of drugtarget_interactions however for drug_candidate compounds or target candidate_proteins that currently have no known interactions available its pure local model is not able to be learned and hence blm may fail to make correct prediction when involving such kind of new candidates results we present a simple procedure called neighbor based interaction profile inferring nii and integrate it into the existing blm method to handle the new candidate problem specifically the inferred interaction profile is treated as label_information and is used for model learning of new candidates this functionality is particularly important in practice to find targets for new drug_candidate compounds and identify targeting_drugs for new target candidate_proteins identification of interactions between drugs compounds and protein targets is an important part of the drug_discovery pipeline the great advances in molecular_medicine and the human_genome provide more opportunities to discover unknown associations in the compoundprotein interaction_network the newly_discovered interactions are helpful for discovering new drugs by screening candidate compounds and also may help understand the causes of side_effects of existing_drugs since experimental way to determine drugtarget_interactions is costly_and in silico prediction becomes a potential complement that provides useful information in an efficient way generally the prediction_performance is decided by both the data used and the particular analysis method that is applied to an intuitive and straightforward way to identify new targets for a drug is to compare the candidate_proteins with those existing targets of that drug different results may be obtained depending on which perspective the comparison is made with respect to compare targets based on the chemical_structure of ligands that bind to them as reviewed in the structure of binding_sites is another important way to compare proteins or to measure the similarity between proteins although binding_site is an effective measure for identification of new targets the structures of binding_site are only available for a small set of proteins of which the d structures are known to be able to consider more proteins amino_acid may be used as it is available for most proteins similarly to identify new targeting compounds for a specific target comparison is made on the compound side or drug side with respect to chemical_structures side_effects or other possible measurements of drug more sophisticated_statistical and machine_learning have been developed recently for prediction of genome_wide drugtarget_interactions in multiple groups of drug related features and protein related features have been extracted to describe each drugtarget pair after feature_selection a certain classifier is used to predict whether a given pair is interacting or not proposed a supervised bipartite_graph learning approach in this approach the chemical_space and the geometric space are mapped into a unified space so that those interacting drugs and targets are close to each other while those non interacting drugs and targets are far away from each other by mapping the query pair of drug and target to that space with the learned mapping function the probability of interaction between them is then calculated as their closeness in the mapped space another method called the weighted profile method was also given in for a query drug the weighted profile method assigns a probability of interaction to the query target based on how the neighbors of this drug interact with this target basically weighted profile is a nearest_neighbor approach and it is called drug based targetbased similarity inference in other than to whom correspondence should be addressed inferring interactions from the drug similarity or target similarity network_based was also studied in which infers or predicts drugtarget_interactions based on the topology of the known interaction_network different from the work in which makes use of the drug similarity target similarity and network based similarity separately apply random_walk on a heterogeneous network constructed with these three types of similarities another promising approach is the bipartite local model blm approach showed that the ensemble of independent drug based prediction and target based prediction with supervised_learning performs much better than only using each single type of prediction the blm method has been further studied and improved in xia et_al and laarhoven et_al the main differences of these three methods include the drugdrug and targettarget similarities the classifiers and the way used to combine the drug based and target based interaction probabilities in semi_supervised approach is used instead of supervised approach for local model learning whilefound that using only the kernel_based on the topology of the known interaction_network is able to obtain a very good performance in the existing framework of blm the model for the query drug or target is learned based on local information i e its own interaction profile despite a good performance blm has limitations it is unable to learn without training data and hence is not able to provide a reasonable prediction for drug_target candidates that are currently new here a drug_candidate compound is new if it does not have any known targets and a target candidate protein is new if it is not targeted by any drugs compounds we call this the new candidate problem of blm since a large number of compounds and proteins which are possible drug_candidates and target candidates respectively are new in this study we focus on handling the new candidate problem by proposing an improved version of blm called blm with neighbor based interaction profile inferring blmnii the nii procedure is developed to incorporate the capacity of learning from neighbors into the original blm method more specifically when the query involves a new drug_target candidate we first derive the initial weighted interactions for the new candidate from its neighbors interaction profiles and then use the inferred interactions as label_information to train the model in general neighbors refer to compounds proteins that have large similarities to the query compound protein the presented nii idea happen to be similar to the weighted profile method in some sense however our blmnii method is substantially different from the weighted profile method in the following aspects in blmnii the derived interaction profile is used as label_information to train the local model or the classifier while in the weighted profile method the derived weighted interaction is directly used as the final predicted interaction probability moreover in blmnii the nii procedure is integrated into the blm framework where a certain classifier plays the main role in model learning and nii is activated only for new drug_target candidates while in the weighted profile method there is no other classifier and the procedure of deriving the weighted profile acts as a classification process which is applied for any drug_target candidates to sum up the blmnii is an enhanced blm method and it is different from the weighted profile method which is a nearest_neighbor approach our experimental_results show that blmnii performs much better than the weighted profile method systematic experiments are conducted to simulate the task of drugtarget_interactions prediction cross four datasets compared with state of the art approaches our proposed approach achieves consistent improvement in terms of area under roc auc curve and area under precision versus recall aupr curve as these four datasets contain different portions of new drug_candidates and target candidates in the simulation the improvements of blmnii compared with blm are also different for the four datasets the most significant_improvement is achieved on the nuclear_receptor dataset which contains the largest portion of new candidates this shows that the nii strategy i e to infer label_information or training data from neighbors when there is no training data readily available from the query compound protein itself is feasible and effective for dealing with the new candidate problem of the original blm
