automatic selection of reference taxa for protein_protein prediction with phylogenetic profiling motivation phylogenetic profiling methods can achieve good accuracy in predicting proteinprotein_interactions especially in prokaryotes recent_studies that the choice of reference taxa rt is critical for accurate prediction but with more than fully_sequenced taxa publicly_available identifying the most informative rt is becoming increasingly difficult previous_studies on the selection of rt have provided guidelines for manual taxon selection and for eliminating closely_related taxa however no general_strategy for automatic selection of rt is currently available results we present three novel methods for automating the selection of rt using machine_learning on known protein_protein one of these methods in particular tree based search yields greatly_improved prediction_accuracies we further show that different methods for constituting phylogenetic profiles often require very different rt sets to support high_prediction availability the datasets and software used in the experiments can be found atwith the advent of next generation technologies genomic_data are now appearing at a rate that renders manual_annotation and analysis of genome_sequences infeasible thus motivating the development of automated computational_methods prediction of proteinprotein_interactions ppis is a key problem in systems_biology and methods based on e g interactions between protein_domains gene fusion_events and phylogenetic profiling pp support genome_scale inference at low_computational the application of pp in ppi prediction is based on the hypothesis that gene_products which function together are likely to exhibit a common pattern of occurrence across taxa the phylogenetic profile of a gene or gene_product represents its pattern of presence and absence across a set of taxa and thus similarity between profiles can be used as an indicator of functional linkages ppi prediction using pp has to whom correspondence should be addressed proven to be fairly accurate in prokaryotes but has been much less successful in eukaryotes a situation attributed to the modularity of eukaryotic_proteins large_scale evolutionary trends including secondary endosymbioses and parasitism and the limited diversity of sequenced_genomes many studies identify the choice of reference taxa rt as critical for accurate prediction and suggest that accuracy can be improved by matching the rt to the interaction_network under investigation representatives of all three domains of life bacteria archaea and eukaryotes should be used for highly_conserved networks whereas close_relatives are best suited for predicting more specialized functions furthermore inclusion of too many closely_related taxa and taxa with derivative or biased gene complements can diminish the prediction_accuracy balancing these considerations greatly complicates manual rt selection thus motivating the development of automatic selection approaches here we introduce three novel machine_learning for selection of informative rt based on known ppi_networks we compare the accuracy with which ppis in one prokaryote and three eukaryotes are predicted with the resulting taxon sets and demonstrate that one of the methods in particular tree based search tbs supports highly accurate_predictions four different pp methods are used in the ppi prediction experiments and we show that no single taxon set achieves top accuracy with all pp methods finally we show that taxon sets can be optimized using ppi_networks from other taxa without substantially affecting the prediction_accuracy
