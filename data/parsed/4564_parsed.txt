structural_bioinformatics tfreg calculating dna and rna melting_temperatures and opening profiles with mesoscopic models the mesoscopic statistical physics models known generically as peyrardbishop pb models have found many applications for the study of oligonucleotide properties unfortunately pb models have not reached a wider non specialized audience for the lack of freely_available software implementations here we present an exten sible c implementation of four variants of the pb model which allows the user to calculate melting_temperatures from tested model_parameters even for a non specialist it should be straightforward to change these parameters to reflect different experimental environments or different types of oligonucleotides for users with some proficiency in c programming it should be feasible to extend the code to other pb models owing to the generic programming implementation adopted for tfreg pre_calculated parameters are included that allow the immediate calculation of melting_temperatures and thermal equivalence indexes for dna and rna availability c source_code and compiled binaries for several linux distributions are available from https sites google com site geraldweberufmg tfreg and from opensuse build service at http the peyrardbishop pb model was introduced in it is a mesoscopic statistical_method with two terms describing separately the hydrogen_bond between the base_pairs and the stacking interaction of the dna_molecule these two terms describe the dna physics well enough to make it a popular choice for the study of numerous physical_properties additionally the method is simple enough to make it computationally_feasible to calculate a large number of different sequences in short time a common requirement for many bioinformatics applications the model has been successful in numerous applications and is one of the leading approaches for modelling oligonucleotides at the mesoscale for a discussion on this see the review by being a computationally_efficient method it is unfortunate that as yet no software implementation was made available to a wider bioinformatics audience here we are trying to bridge the gap by providing an implementation of the pb model that is accessible to a non specialist but which we hope may also be valuable to pb model specialists the original code on which this application note is based was used to calculate the results of several of our publications on dna b and more recently on rna therefore this application note has the added purpose of providing specialists in this type of model with the opportunity to verify our published results currently software applications for melting_temperature analysis fall into two broad categories free_energy models such as the one pioneered byand those based on polandscheraga models such as umelt byand by both approaches are nearest_neighbour nn methods that is they model the interaction between consecutive base_pairs pb models on the other hand also consider the hydrogen_bonds of individual base_pairs through a morse potential our parametrization studies revealed that these morse potentials are remarkably consistent even when applied to completely different melting_temperature datasets for instance the hydrogen morse potential of cg base_pairs was found to be nearly identical for both dna and rna therefore the pb models offer the unique_opportunity to study what would happen to melting_temperatures and opening profiles under different strengths of hydrogen_bonds in essence the main parameters of the pb model are the morse potential d which represents the hydrogen_bond and the elastic constant k which represents the stacking interaction the potential d depends only on the base_pair and as a rule of thumb is roughly proportional to the strength of the hydrogen_bonds if the user wishes for instance to experiment with a stronger hydrogen_bond all that is needed is to set a larger value for d in this respect the pb model offers a much more intuitive framework for setting its parameters than the nearest_neighbour models based on gibbs_free for instance in we show an example for a dna_sequence where we calculate all opening profiles for a range of temperatures these opening profiles were calculated for open boundary_conditions and therefore clearly show the end fraying of the dna_sequence in we show the same sequence ofbut now calculated with periodic_boundary which would be equivalent to a circular_dna the characteristic end fraying is now absent and generally this structure appears much more stable at higher temperatures than for open_ended dna opening profiles calculated for a range of temperatures can be combined into opening maps such as exemplified in supplementary in terms of the accuracy of predicting melting_temperatures tfreg is at least on par with nearest_neighbour free_energy models supplementaryshows the melting_temperature average_error when compared for the dna dataset bycompared with the methods implemented by dnamate by panjkovich and melo and the phenomenological_model by khandelwal and bhyravabhotla one should be aware however that the accuracy of predictions is largely determined by the experimental_data used to calibrate a given method in supplementary section s we discuss these issues in more detail one aspect of interest is that tfreg has no fundamental restriction on sequence_length as shown in supplementary where we present the average_accuracy as a function of sequence_length as the accuracy of any prediction method depends so strongly on the dataset used to generate the regression_coefficients it is worth mentioning that tfreg can generate new regression sets from user provided melting_temperatures this means that users may use tfreg to predict new melting_temperatures based on the calibration of their own data instead of relying on pre established regression sets some bioinformatics applications of interest for tfreg would be the prospective_studies of melting for situations where little melting experimental_data are available for certain types of oligonucleotides given that the parameters are intuitive the opening profiles could also be used in addition to flexibility for studies of promoter_sequence recognition fagundes we provide a complete c implementation of the pb model in the framework of the transfer matrix integral method in addition to the calculation of the matrices that are essential to the method the application tfreg also calculates melting_temperatures for dna and rna providing thus an alternative method to the nearest_neighbour gibbs free_energy the application also provides the option of calculating the average helix opening profile a comprehensive user_manual with full explanation of the main aspects of the pb model is provided in the software_package and also included as supplementary_material
