classification of ncrnas using position and size information in deep sequencing_data small_non ncrnas play_important in various cellular_functions in all clades of life with next_generation techniques it has become possible to study ncrnas in a high_throughput manner and by using specialized algorithms ncrna classes such as mirnas can be detected in deep sequencing_data typically such methods are targeted to a certain class of ncrna many methods rely on rna_secondary which is not always accurate and not all ncrna classes are characterized by a common secondary_structure unbiased classification methods for ncrnas could be important to improve accuracy and to detect new ncrna classes in sequencing_data results here we present a scoring system called alps alignment of pattern matrices score that only uses primary information from a deep sequencing_experiment i e the relative positions and lengths of reads to classify ncrnas alps makes no further assumptions e g about common structural_properties in the ncrna class and is nevertheless able to identify ncrna classes with high_accuracy since alps is not designed to recognize a certain class of ncrna it can be used to detect novel ncrna classes as long as these unknown ncrnas have a characteristic pattern of deep_sequencing read_lengths and positions we evaluate our scoring system on publicly_available deep sequencing_data and show that it is able to classify known ncrnas with high_sensitivity availability calculated pattern matrices of the datasets hesc and eb are available at the project web sitenext generation sequencing_platforms such as solexa illumina abi solid or roche are extensively used to sequence small_rnas of roughly nt length at astonishing rates in various organisms for instance they are used to determine expression_profiles of mirnas nt_long rna_molecules that have emerged in recent_years as important posttranscriptional regulators in all known multicellular_organisms and that are known to play roles in development tumorigenesis and viral_infection besides mirnas other small noncoding_rna ncrna classes such as pirnas snornas or scarnas have been investigated only recently sequencing revealed the existence of nt_long rna therefore termed unusual small_rna or usrnas in cells infected with kshv usrnas to whom correspondence should be addressed are derived from both virus and host_cell and are associated with the rna_induced risc advances in throughput accuracy and the ability to sequence longer_reads will not only lead to more and more precise detection of already known ncrna classes but also to the discovery of new types it is therefore of great interest to develop methods for automatic classification of ncrna using deep sequencing_data most ncrnas have very specific structural_properties that have been used to classify them e g trnas possess a cloverleaf structure whereas mirna_precursors form stable hairpins however these methods rely on the prediction of rna_secondary and even for short molecules the current rna_secondary energy_model is not always able to predict the native_structure this can be due to the incompleteness of the nearest_neighbor energy_model or explained by the fact that the minimal free_energy structure is not necessarily the native one due to unknown modifications or effects of folding kinetics in the case of de_novo prediction of e g mirnas the exact pre mirna sequence is not known a priori even if the hairpin can be predicted for the pre mirna sequence it could be disrupted if a few bases upstream or downstream are appended or removed from this sequence therefore multiple windows around a putative mirna are folded or a local folding tool such as rnalfold is used this however necessarily leads to an increased false_positive since many genomic_sequences that do not encode mirnas can fold into stable hairpins deep_sequencing offers additional_criteria to distinguish ncrna classes a typical experimental_setup is to determine the content of small ncrna in a cell under certain conditions therefore only intervals on the genome are considered where enough sequencing_reads have been aligned to the specific number of reads depends on the tradeoff between sensitivity_and if the experiment aims to identify a special class of ncrnas specialized algorithms can be applied that detect specific features of that ncrna class based on biological_knowledge for example in mirna_biogenesis one strand of the precursor is preferentially included into risc the mature mirna and the other is rapidly_degraded mirna star considering this bias together with structural mirna properties can dramatically_increase specificity of mirna detection as shown before mirnas recognize their targets by their seed_region and due to their biogenesis have specific lengths both features of mirnas should be detectable in an excess of deep sequencing_reads that align to a specific genomic_position and have a specific length however this is not always the case for mirnas in large_scale experiments e g the read start position of many mirnas follow a narrow distribution that is often skewed toward the mirna end c a snrna u frequencies of reads starting at position x axis and of length y axis are visualized in different shades of gray note that both the snrna and the trna could easily be mistaken for a mirna if only the most abundant read is considered graphical respresentations for all pattern matrices are available on the project_web and read_lengths are often variable see also such alternative mature mirna forms are often referred to as isomirs in addition to positioning and lengths of reads distances of reads aligned in close_proximity of other reads also carry information about ncrna classes at least for animals the mirna star should be detectable at a distance of roughly nt to the mature mirna distance information also helps to distinguish mirnas from degradation_products of other abundant rna species such as trnas or snrnas and most importantly using this information can help to classify novel ncrna or ncrnas that do not possess a characteristic secondary_structure in this article we show how to exploit position and lengthdependent read patterns to classify ncrnas we make no further assumptions about structural and other class specific properties and only consider primary information from the alignment of deep sequencing_reads on the genome our method alps alignment of pattern matrices score allows to detect mirnas and other known ncrna classes with high_accuracy and due to its unbiased nature it also provides a straight_forward way to discover and classify novel ncrnas our approach is complementary to existing_methods that rely on structural_properties and we expect that their combination with our approach allows to increase their sensitivity_and we applied our method to previously_published illumina sequencing_data where small_rnas of human embryonic i page i i i pattern matrix frequencies are visualized in different shades of gray and white areas correspond to unaligned parts of the matrices note that with the gap cost_function in a the mirna star start positions on the right parts of the matrices are correctly aligned whereas slightly altered parameters in b erroneously move the necessary gap to the end where it is not penalized stem_cells hesc and embryoid_body cells eb have been sequenced we used bowtie to align the trimmed reads to the human_genome hg obtained from the ucsc_genome we allowed no mismatches but did not restrict the number of loci a read can be aligned to we identified intervals as described in section t m and assigned them to the classes in we determined the normalized pattern matrices see project_web for graphical visualizations and computed all pairwise alps similarities for various scoring_systems first we checked which choices of gap parameters make differences in the alignments of intervals we considered the intervals of hsa_mir b and hsa_mir that are both donors i e the mature mirna originates from the arm of the precursor are expressed at similar levels and reads in eb respectively and have different loop lengths thus a correct alignment must introduce a gap between the positions of the mature mirna and the mirna star in the sequence of column vectors of mir which has the shorter loop if we calculate the optimal freeshift alignment using the hill matrix h and min product matrix multiplication gap parameters of o and e are indeed able to produce a correct alignment we emphasize that meaningful ranges of gap parameters are highly dependent on the other parameters and that automated parameter_optimization could resolve these ranges a second theoretical consideration can be made by examining the inner and outer score distributions when the sum min and the sum product operator is used with the same matrix the identity matrix scores of the former naturally tend to be higher than scores of the later if the identity matrix is replaced by h or h scores also tend to increase for all parameter choices it is apparent that inner and outer scores are significantly different but their distributions are not completely separated the outer distribution describes all alps similarities between pairs of intervals one annotated as mirna the other not annotated as mirna however mirbase is not complete and as a consequence it is possible that the outer score distribution contains mirnamirna scores which can explain the elongated right tail of all p outer the inner distribution consists of all pairwise alps similarities of two intervals both annotated as mirna especially when using m id l many scores tend to be small since only exact agreements in length are rewarded and two mature_mirnas may have differing sizes in addition mirna may be donors or donors or both mature and mirna stars are expressed at very similar levels as a consequence p inner does not only contain overall high scores but also scores indicating differing subclasses however all these parameter choices are able to separate mirnas from other ncrnas when we use all scores for classification using any aggregate statistics fails in many cases if the maximal scores is used a true mirna may be too similar to an interval with unknown annotation which is in fact a still unknown mirna leading to a misclassification if one uses the minimum the inner scoring is hampered by subclasses therefore using all scores and a statistically_robust method to combine them such as fishers method is necessary for reliable classification in order to assess whether alps is able to classify ncrna reliably we applied the following procedure each annotated interval i was removed from its cluster c a and the described method was used to determine the class of i since we did not restrict the number of loci a read could align to and many of the abundant ncrnas are present in multiple copies in the human_genome we considered only scoressscores scoress i j where the genomic_sequences of i and j did not contain common subsequences of length i e no deep_sequencing read has been counted in both intervals i and j for all other scores p values were calculated and combined as described we then calculated recall and precision for each class a separately as the number of intervals correctly assigned divided by the number of intervals originally belonging to c a recall and divided by the number of intervals assigned to c a precision respectively as indicated above we tried various parameter combinations to classify ncrnas since there are only very few unique snrnas snornas and rrnas we only considered mirnas and trnas for evaluation except for some obviously too extreme parameter combinations e g too negative gap parameters for global alignments the classification_performance was remarkably stable with recall values of up to at a precision of for mirnas these relatively low precision values in the mirna class rise the question whether our scoring tends to classify too many intervals as mirnas however the classes unknown and misc rna are not excluded from our analyses and nearly all of the intervals additionally assigned to the class mirna originate from unknown and misc rna whose pattern matrix indeed is very similar to that of mirnas we predicted the secondary_structures of the corresponding sequences using rnafold and some of them are indeed predicted to be able to fold into hairpins whether these reads really correspond to mature_mirnas are degradation_products or otherwise processed rnas must still be elucidated however here we applied our method only to abundant ncrnas this is inherent to the method as we have to estimate the distribution of read_lengths per position for an ncrna gene which is only possible if enough reads have been sequenced due to further development of current sequencing_techniques it will be possible to achieve more and more sequencing_depth at lower_costs and therefore also low abundant ncrnas will be represented by enough sequencing_reads i page i i i deep sequencing_reads of ncrnas follow very specific patterns regarding their length and positions with respect to their genes classes of ncrnas are defined by their function and biogenesis and often share a common structure each of these can contribute to a biased distribution of reads on the ncrna gene bullet regulatory_rnas such as mirnas pirnas or sirnas are believed to recognize their targets by a short complementary region seed therefore for a proper_function the cell has to take care that the seed of these rna classes is not shifted and as a consequence a wealth of deep sequencing_reads starting at specific positions should be detectable this can be observed in the pattern matrices computed for high_throughput sequencing_data the consideration of reads starting at adjacent positions allows to distinguish these ncrna classes from degradation_products of other abundant species bullet the specific pattern observed for longer ncrnas such as trnas see can possibly be explained by their degradation cleavage by rnases can be biased toward certain parts of the trna which leads in the case of the cloverleaf structured trnas to a pattern of trna halves or quarters although some of these degradation_products can be mistaken for e g a mirna due to similar length the consideration of longer intervals and the i page i i i
