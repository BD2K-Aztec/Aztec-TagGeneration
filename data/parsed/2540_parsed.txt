interactome transcriptome integration for predicting distant_metastasis in breast_cancer motivation high_throughput gene_expression yields genomic_signatures that allow the prediction of clinical conditions including patient outcome however these signatures have limitations such as dependency on the training_set and worse lack of generalization results we propose a novel algorithm called iti interactome transcriptome integration to extract a genomic signature predicting distant_metastasis in breast_cancer by superimposition of large_scale proteinprotein_interaction data over a compendium of several gene_expression training on two different compendia showed that the estrogen_receptor specific signatures obtained are more stable stability can be generalized on independent data and performs better than previously_published accuracy availability the iti algorithm source_code from analysis are available under cecill from the iti companion website http the advent of post genomic technologies provided the opportunity to potentially decipher the genomic origin of human_diseases including cancer thus gene_expression analysis using dna_microarrays allowed improving the classification and prognostication of several types of cancer including breast_cancer this approach can also help predict the metastatic recurrence and outcome in breast_cancer bc the current prognostic_features poorly reflect the heterogeneous clinical_outcome the consequence is that many patients receive unnecessary adjuvant systemic_chemotherapy genomic_tools could provide an opportunity to refine prognosis and improve treatment strategy and lay down foundation of personalized_medicine in bc several studies have produced signatures linked to bc distant_metastasis the mammaprint gene to whom correspondence should be addressed signature van_de classified bc patients in either good or poor_prognosis groups reported a gene_signature specific to estrogen_receptor er_status genes for er patients and for er these two signatures have an overlap of only three genes which raised concerns about their reliability reanalyzed the van_de vijver dataset and concluded that the signatures obtained in such studies are unstable and dependent on the patients training_set from a classification standpoint any gene classifier can be a good one as long as it performs and generalizes well however from either a scientific or clinical standpoint both the content and stability of signatures are of primary importance so as to decipher their molecular basis to reinforce their robustness and widespread_acceptance of their routine clinical use and eventually to lead to new therapeutic_targets reasons for inherent instability of gene based signatures have been previously enumerated besides experimental variability variation in patient sampling and microarray_platform bias other reasons explain the lack of stability of signatures reasons best explaining this instability are i the curse of dimensionality and ii the biological nature of gene_expression the curse of dimensionality is well known of statisticians and is due to the inherent microarray_data topology too few samples for too many variables the biological nature of instability is the following microarrays measure messenger_rna transcript_abundance to the extent that perturbations linked to a particular phenotype are reflected by changes in messenger_rna transcript_levels microarrays may be useful for measuring perturbations linked to a particular phenotype genes however are not independent but their products act in concert through proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network s our hypothesis is that phenotypes such as cancer result from isolated and subtle molecular perturbations changes in gene_expression and or mutations for example in driver_genes that may provoke expression changes of greater amplitude in downstream_genes statistics for differential_expression detect changes of greater amplitude and reveal only these downstream_genes superimposing an interaction_network to expression changes can detect driver_genes associated with more subtle expression changes factors cited previously may be more problematic for markers for subtle changes in differential_expression but we expect their effect to be attenuated by combination of several datasets such genes page we conceived a network based algorithm iti to identify prognostic genomic_signatures generalizable over multiple and heterogeneous microarray_datasets this algorithm works in two steps first it integrates data from a compendium of bc microarray_datasets and second it finds subnetworks i e interacting gene complexes whose this illustrates a discriminative subnetwork from the sabatier and coworkers dataset nodes and edges correspond to genes_encoding proteins and ppis respectively yellow and blue nodes denote an overexpression and an underexpression respectively among patients with distant_metastasis compared with the other ones expression discriminates two conditions of interest subnetworks are filtered by statistical validation we applied the iti algorithm to the particularly important but still unresolved_question of finding markers for bc distant_metastasis for which a large body of public data is available our approach illustrates the feasibility of integrating gene_expression data compendia bc tumor_samples were integrated and large_scale ppi data it represents a potential data_mining tool for gene_expression repositories it features inclusion of prior data under the form of ppis and clinical annotations we produced two er_status specific signatures that were validated on independent datasets held out from training repeating the experiments for two datasets desmedt and van_de vijver yielded_higher classification_performance than previously_published classifiers in both cases for desmedt er and for van_de vijver er our subnetwork based signatures reflect the large biological footprint of metastasis and is consequently larger that previously_published signatures the classifier obtained with iti subnetworks was less sensitive to platform bias than previously
