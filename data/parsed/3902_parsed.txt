structural_bioinformatics rclick a web_server for comparison of rna d structures rna_molecules play_important in key_biological in the cell and are becoming attractive for developing therapeutic_applications since the function of rna depends on its structure and dynamics comparing and classifying the rna d structures is of crucial importance to molecular_biology in this study we have developed rclick a web_server that is capable of superimposing rna d structures by using clique matching and d least_squares fitting our ser ver rclick has been benchmarked and compared with other popular servers and methods for rna structural_alignments in most cases rclick alignments were better in terms of structure overlap our server also recognizes conformational changes between structures for this purpose the ser ver produces complementary alignments to maximize the extent of detectable similarity various examples showcase the utility of our web_server for comparison of rna rnaprotein complexes and rna ligand structures availability_and the rclick web_server is freely_accessible atcomparing rna d structures gives us unique insights into their evolution and function while there are numerous methods for comparing and classifying protein d structures there have been very few such methods for rna d structures given the rapid pace with which new rna_structures are deposited in the pdb it is crucial to have tools to classify and categorize these structures and investigate them for similarities at different levels here the rclick web_server is designed to provide a user_friendly interface to compare rna d structures and produces accurate alignments when the structures are similar the performance of rclick was compared to other popular servers and methods that align rna d structures including arts sara click setter and r d align on different benchmark rna datasets supplementary figs s s and supplementary tables s s the structure overlaps of rclick in these comparisons were better and supplementary s and s a and b in show the utilities of rclick for comparison of large_ribosomal rna protein_complexes and rna ligand structures while rclick produced accurate alignments of rnaprotein interactions between two ribonuclease iii pdb codes lup and rc when compared to other web_servers such as setter and arts which could not align correctly rna binding_sites supplementaryand b show two thiamine_pyrophosphate tpp riboswitches pdb codes cky chain a and gdi chain x aligned with one another and the similarities of conformation of the bound tpp ligands in both rna_structures these examples highlight the capabilities of our web_server that produces accurate alignments of rna_structures and additionally aids in the general area of prediction of rnaprotein and rna ligand interactions in addition to the best of our knowledge this is the first rna_structure comparison server that shows conformational changes in the rna_structures being compared supplementaryand b
