sequence_based prediction of protein crystallization purification and production propensity motivation x_ray based protein structure_determination which accounts for majority of solved structures is characterized by relatively low success_rates one solution is to build tools which support selection of targets that are more likely to crystallize several in silico methods that predict propensity of diffraction quality crystallization from protein_chains were developed we show that the quality of their predictions drops when applied to more recent crystallization trails which calls for new solutions we propose a novel approach that alleviates drawbacks of the existing_methods by using a recent dataset and improved protocol to annotate progress along the crystallization process by predicting the success of the entire_process and steps which result in the failed attempts and by utilizing a compact and comprehensive set of sequence derived inputs to generate accurate_predictions results the proposed ppcpred predictor of protein production purification and crystallization predict propensity for production of diffraction quality crystals production of crystals purification and production of the protein material ppcpred utilizes comprehensive set of inputs based on energy and hydrophobicity indices composition of certain amino_acid types predicted disorder secondary_structure and solvent_accessibility and content of certain buried and exposed residues our method significantly_outperforms alignment based_predictions and several modern crystallization propensity predictors receiver_operating roc_curves show that ppcpred is particularly useful for users who desire high true_positive tp rates i e low rate of mispredictions for solvable chains our model reveals several intuitive factors that influence the success of individual_steps and the entire crystallization process including the content of cys buried his and ser hydrophobic hydrophilic segments and the number of predicted disordered segments structural_genomics sg is an international initiative that aims at solving d shapes of important biological macro molecules primarily focusing on proteins and which significantly contributes to the overall protein structure_determination efforts this initiative shifts the focus from one by one determination of individual protein_structures to protein familydirected structure analyses where a group of proteins is targeted and structure s of representative members are determined terwilliger to whom correspondence should be addressed the process of choosing the representative proteins which is known as target_selection encompasses restricting the candidate_proteins to those that are tractable and of unknown structure and prioritizing them according to the expected interest and accessibility for instance in case of the protein_structure initiative psi target_selection concentrates on representatives from large structurally uncharacterized protein_domain and from structurally uncharacterized subfamilies in very large and diverse families with incomplete structural coverage the most recent psi biology phase psi nature structural_biology knowledgebase includes four major sg centers that will continue high_throughput structure_determination defined through community nomination process importantly these approaches allow for flexibility in the selection of the targets and would benefit from tools that support target_selection protein_structures are solved using x_ray nmr_spectroscopy electron_microscopy and recently by application of computational_approaches such as homology_modeling the most popular method which accounts for about of the structures deposited into the protein_data pdb is the x_ray one of the main challenges the sg faces is that only about of protein targets pursued yield high_resolution protein_structures a more recent analysis shows that about of targets produce the diffraction quality crystals moreover estimates show that of the cost of structure_determination is consumed by the failed attempts while crystallization is characterized by a significant rate of attrition and is among the most complex and the least understood problems in the structural_biology this provides motivation for further research in this area several strategies have been proposed to improve the success_rates including obtaining one representative structure per protein_family and working with multiple orthologs in spite of the advances made in the context of protein crystallization the production of high_quality crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the structure_determination pipelines this problem is usually tackled using an empirical trial and error approach where a large number of experiments is brute forced to find a suitable setup and through understanding of the fundamental_principles that govern crystallization the latter is used to design new and improved methodologies that produce the high_quality crystals one of the steps taken to alleviate difficulties in solving the structures via the x_ray was to create databases that record information concerning both successful and failed attempts to produce the structures the largest and most comprehensive database targetdb the proposed ppcpred method which utilizes the order based aggregation of the propensities predicted by the four svm models was evaluated on the test datasets for the predictions of each of the four outcomes i e prediction of material production purification crystallization and diffraction quality crystallization as well as for the class_prediction we compare the results generated by the ppcpred with the existing_methods for the prediction of the crystallization propensity with the blast_based solution and with the maximum based aggregation scheme
