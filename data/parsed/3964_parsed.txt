bioinformatics_discovery structural_bioinformatics relation between sequence and structure in membrane_proteins motivation integral polytopic_membrane contain only two types of folds in their transmembrane_domains helix bundles and b barrels the increasing number of available crystal_structures of these proteins permits an initial estimation of how sequence_variability affects the structure conservation in their transmembrane_domains we thus aim to determine the pairwise sequence_identity necessary to maintain the transmembrane molecular_architectures compatible with the hydrophobic nature of the lipid_bilayer results root_mean rmsd and sequence_identity were calculated from the structural_alignments of pairs of homologous polytopic_membrane sharing the same fold analysis of these data reveals that transmembrane_segment pairs with sequence_identity in the so_called twilight zone display high structural_similarity rmsd a moreover a large group of b barrel pairs with low sequence_identity still maintain a close structural_similarity rmsd a thus we conclude that fold preservation in transmembrane_regions requires less sequence_conservation than for globular_proteins these findings have direct implications in homology_modeling of evolutionary related membrane_proteins integral polytopic_membrane mediate the interaction of the cell with its surroundings being involved in multiple_cellular as selective molecular transport signaling respiration and motility because of their relevance to cellular_physiology and their accessibility from the extracellular_environment membrane_proteins represent a significant portion of therapeutic drug_targets particularly g_protein transport proteins and ion_channels are among the most prominent target families for the pharmaceutical_industry although membrane_proteins represent of all proteins in sequenced_genomes only of crystal_structures deposited in the protein_data are membrane_proteins mainly because of the difficulty of their overexpression purification and crystallization thus because of the limited high_resolution structural_information on membrane_proteins computational_techniques to predict their three_dimensional d structure from the amino_acid are a valuable_tool recently de_novo techniques using evolutionary_constraints have been applied to predict d structures for transmembrane tm proteins homology_models of proteins with unknown experimental structure can also be built from homologous_proteins of known structure and similar sequence templates this method is based on the fact that in homologous_proteins structure is more conserved than sequence in general homologous_proteins with a sequence_identity have a similar d structure this similarity is less common in pairs of homologous_proteins with sequence_identity in the twilight zone threshold of although these conclusions were achieved from the analysis of crystal_structures of soluble_proteins homology modeling_methods are also appropriate for membrane_proteins obtaining rmsd a relative to the native_structure in the tm region for sequence_identities of however because of the relative scarcity of reference structures these methods are frequently_applied using templates with sequence_identity below the twilight zone with reasonable_results see for instance this is particularly true for the core of the tm regions and has inspired new template based coordinate generation protocols for membrane_proteins this apparent_difference between membrane and globular_proteins probably arises because of their different environment the lipid_bilayer imposes a physical constraint that limits the number of folds that polypeptide_chains can adopt when inserted in a membrane these include helix bundles in bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic_cells and b barrels in the outer_membrane of bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts these two folds contain secondary_structure that maximize the hydrogen_bond among backbone atoms whereas hydrophobic side_chains are preferentially oriented toward the membrane_lipids as a consequence many tm proteins share similar structural arrangements even with marginal sequence_identities suggesting that relatively few conserved_residues are sufficient to determine the molecular_architecture of a particular tm fold the present study aims to test the hypothesis that computational structural biologists have been implicitly using when building homology_models of membrane_proteins using templates of low sequence_identity the fold in membrane_proteins is less dependent on sequence_variability than in globular_proteins by analyzing the relationship between structure and sequence in a database of membrane_protein crystal_structures we show that fold preservation in the tm region of membrane_proteins requires a lower degree of sequence_conservation than in globular_proteins
