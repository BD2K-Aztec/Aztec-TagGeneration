evaluation of hybrid and non hybrid methods for de_novo of nanopore reads motivation recent_emergence of nanopore sequencing_technology set a challenge for established assembly methods in this work we assessed how existing hybrid and non hybrid de_novo methods perform on long and error_prone nanopore reads results we benchmarked five non hybrid in terms of both error_correction and scaffolding assembly pipelines as well as two hybrid assemblers which use third generation sequencing_data to scaffold illumina assemblies tests were performed on several publicly_available minion and illumina datasets of escherichia_coli k using several sequencing coverages of nanopore data and we attempted to assess the assembly_quality at each of these coverages in order to estimate the requirements for closed bacterial genome_assembly for the purpose of the benchmark an extensible genome_assembly benchmarking framework was developed results show that hybrid methods are highly dependent on the quality of ngs_data but much less on the quality and coverage of nanopore data and perform relatively well on lower nanopore coverages all non hybrid methods correctly assemble the e coli_genome when coverage is above even the non hybrid method tailored for pacific_biosciences reads while it requires higher_coverage compared to a method designed particularly for nanopore reads its running time is significantly_lower during the last ten years next_generation ngs devices have dominated genome_sequencing market in contrast to previously used sanger_sequencing ngs is much cheaper less time consuming and not so labor_intensive yet when it comes to de_novo of longer genomes many researchers are being skeptical of using ngs_reads these devices produce reads a few hundred base_pairs long which is too short to unambiguously resolve repetitive_regions even within relatively small microbial_genomes although the use of paired_end and mate_pair technologies has improved the accuracy and completeness of assembled_genomes ngs sequencing still produces highly fragmented assemblies due to long repetitive_regions these incomplete genomes have to be finished using a more laborious approach that includes sanger_sequencing and specially tailored assembly methods owing to ngs many efficient algorithms have been developed to optimize running time and memory footprints in sequence_assembly alignment and downstream_analysis steps the need for technologies that would produce longer_reads which could solve the problem of repeating regions has resulted in the advent of new sequencing approachesthe so_called third_generation the first among them was a single_molecule sequencing_technology developed by pacific_biosciences pacbio although pacbio sequencers produce much longer_reads up to several tens_of of base_pairs their reads have significantly_higher error_rate to than ngs_reads existing assembly and alignment_algorithms were not capable of handling such high_error this caused the development of read_error methods at first hybrid correction was performed using complementary ngs illumina data later self correction of pacbioonly reads was developed which required higher_coverage the development of new more sensitive aligners blasr and optimization of existing ones bwa mem was required in oxford nanopore technologies ont presented their tiny minion sequencerabout the size of a harmonica the minion can produce reads up to a few hundred thousand base_pairs long d reads from the minion sequencer with the latest r chemistry have raw base accuracy less than while higher quality d reads accuracy comprise only a fraction of all d reads this again spurred the need for development of even more sensitive algorithms for mapping and realignment such as graphmap and marginalign any doubt about the possibility of using minion reads for de_novo was resolved in when loman et_al demonstrated that the assembly of a bacterial_genome escherichia_coli k using solely ont reads is possible even with high_error thanks to extremely long_reads and affordability and availability of the nanopore sequencing_technology these results might cause a revolution in de_novo sequence_analysis in near future following up on the results from loman et_al and we explored the applicability of existing hybrid and nonhybrid de_novo tools that support third generation sequencing_data and assessed their ability to cope with nanopore error profiles in our study we compared seven assembly tools pipelines which include five long_read assemblers pipeline published by loman et_al in continuation lqs pipeline pbcr falcon https github com pacificbiosciences falcon miniasm and canu https github com marbl canu and two hybrid assemblers allpaths_lg and spades these tools were tested on real publicly_available datasets of a well known clonal sample of e coli k mg all of the tools pipelines were evaluated on all test datasets up to the draft assembly level not including the polishing phase draft assemblies containing one big contig of at least mbp were polished using nanopolish and compared for the purpose of our analyses we developed a benchmarking framework nanomark which automates running of different assemblers and processing of the results the framework provides wrappers with uniform interfaces for each assembly tool simplifying their usage for the end_user in our study we developed a benchmarking framework for de_novo tools focused on third generation sequencing_data and compared several hybrid and non hybrid de_novo assemblers as well as assessed their ability to work with nanopore sequencing_data each examined tool proved capable of assembling a whole bacterial_genome under the right conditions needless to say the choice of the best assembly tool will heavily depend upon the characteristics of the dataset keeping in mind that hybrid and non hybrid assemblers are not directly comparable we can say that allpaths_lg showed overall the best results however it requires a rather specific set of illumina paired_end and mate_pair short_read libraries to perform the assembly which might not always be practical to obtain in case only paired_end are available spades might be a good choice of the non hybrid assembly tools on some datasets lqs pipeline came close to or even surpassed hybrid tools however extremely_high cpu time used by nanocorrect might make itbold values present the best scoring result for a particular dataset prohibitively slow on larger genomes and larger datasets in which case canu falcon or pbcr could be used instead miniasm must be considered apart from other assemblers while the lack of error_correction and consensus phases results in assemblies with a significant error_rate astonishing cpu efficiency makes it a perfect candidate for time critical applications especially if it could be enhanced with a suitably efficient consensus phase applying nanopolish to miniasm assemblies showed that they could be significantly_improved but at this point still fall behind other assemblies polishing draft assemblies with nanopolish improved the results of non hybrid assemblies but worsened the results of hybrid ones relative assembly_quality remained the same but after polishing the difference between hybrid and non hybrid assemblies reduced substantially the high contiguity of nanopore only assemblies provides a number of other important opportunities for example even small bioinformatics laboratories can now study genomic structural_variations and rearrangements or identify large antibiotic_resistance islands in genomes for which exact base variations are not of such high importance all in house we can expect that with further development of nanopore technology and other long_read sequencing_technologies read quality will increase and the technology will become more accessible and more affordable this will make de_novo using nanopore reads faster more precise and applicable to larger genomes
