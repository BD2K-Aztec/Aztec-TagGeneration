bioimage_informatics automated analysis of giant_unilamellar using circular hough transformation motivation in order to obtain statistically_relevant results the study of membrane effects at the single vesicle level requires the analysis of several hundreds of giant_unilamellar guvs which becomes a very time consuming task if carried_out manually complete and user_friendly software for fast and bias free automated analysis has not been reported yet results we developed a framework for the automated_detection tracking and analysis of individual guvs on digital microscopy_images our tool is suited to quantify protein binding to membranes as well as several aspects of membrane_permeabilization on single vesicles we demonstrate the applicability of the approach by comparing alternative activation methods for bax a pore_forming protein involved in mitochondrial permeabilization during apoptosis availability_and the complete software is implemented in matlab the mathworks inc usa and available as a standalone as well as the full source_code atin recent_years giant_unilamellar guvs have become powerful and widely used tools to study membrane processes among other applications guvs are extensively used to investigate the mechanisms of pore_forming molecules in previous work we developed a guv based single vesicle method for the analysis of membrane_permeabilization the individual vesicle integrity the permeabilization degree the stability of the permeabilized state the binding of proteins to the membrane as well as the kinetics of single vesicle leakage can be successfully addressed with this approach however to achieve high statistical accuracy several hundreds of guvs per experiment need to be considered the analysis of guv experiments is mostly carried_out on digital microscopy_images using basic image_processing like measuring mean pixel intensities on defined regions of interest or quantifying certain shape_features due to the high amount of vesicles this method usually turns out to be extremely time consuming and can additionally suffer from subjective bias if carried_out manually the researcher might tend to select guvs following certain characteristics like size or degree of filling and thus introduce a bias into the sample so_far integrated_systems for segmenting large populations of lipid_vesicles are scarce in publishing research proposed a vesicle segmentation_algorithm based on the markov_random model which depends on a bright vesicle rim and a generous intensity contrast between the inner and outer region of the vesicle this is hardly the case in permeabilization studies since a reduced dye concentration and laser_power during image_acquisition is required to not considerably affect membrane_properties we propose the circular hough transformation cht a robust technique to find circular patterns in images for the segmentation of guvs and demonstrate its efficiency on noisy real experiment images to our best knowledge this article_presents the first complete and user_friendly framework for the automated_detection and analysis of large guv populations it is suitable for an entire permeabilization analysis including kinetics and the size and stability of pores in addition radial profiles for each vesicle can be used to acquire quantitative information about protein binding to membranes the automatization is not only advantageous in terms of time saving but also guarantees an unbiased statistical_analysis to the highest possible extent the software is therefore powerful not only in detecting circular objects in microscopy_images but also objects which moderately deviate from the circular shape for the analysis of movies we implemented a tracking algorithm which allows tracking of single vesicles making the software applicable to moving guvs to validate the approach and demonstrate the applicability of our program we investigated the degree of individual vesicle to whom correspondence should be addressed permeabilization induced by bax under different activating conditions bax is a member of the bcl family with a major role in the regulation of apoptosis it induces the permeabilization of the outer_mitochondrial omm that releases cytochrome_c cyt c during apoptosis despite intense research the mechanism of bax induced omm permeabilization is under debate previous_studies showed that the cleaved form of the bh only protein bid activates bax furthermore bax activation has been shown to occur in vitro by incubation with detergents acid_ph or high_temperature but whether these methods induce comparable bax activation and pore activity remains_unknown in this article we compared the effect of these four activating methods on bax induced membrane_permeabilization at the single vesicle level our results demonstrate that all four methods efficiently activate bax and yield comparable all or none pore activity on cardiolipin containing guvs
