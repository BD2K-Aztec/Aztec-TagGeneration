cell_free dna_fragment size_distribution analysis for non_invasive prenatal cnv prediction background non_invasive detection of aneuploidies in a fetal genome through analysis of cell_free circulating in the maternal_plasma is becoming a routine clinical test such tests which rely on analyzing the read_coverage or the allelic ratios at single_nucleotide snp loci are not sensitive enough for smaller sub chromosomal_abnormalities due to sequencing biases and paucity of snps in a genome results we have developed an alternative framework for identifying sub chromosomal copy_number in a fetal genome this framework relies on the size_distribution of fragments in a sample as fetal origin fragments tend to be smaller than those of maternal origin by analyzing the local distribution of the cell_free dna_fragment sizes in each region our method allows for the identification of sub megabase cnvs even in the absence of snp positions to evaluate the accuracy of our method we used a plasma sample with the fetal fraction of down sampled it to samples with coverage of x x and simulated samples with cnvs based on it our method had a perfect accuracy both specificity and sensitivity for detecting mb cnvs and after reducing the fetal fraction to and it could correctly identify of the mb cnvs and had a true negative rate of availability_and our source_code is available on github at https github com compbio uoft fsda prenatal testing for genetic_abnormalities aneuploidies and copy_number cnvs is a routine_practice for pregnant_women complexities associated with traditional invasive prenatal diagnostic_methods such as chorionic_villus or amniocentesis have led to research for safer non_invasive approaches after the discovery of fetal cell_free cfdna in maternal_plasma several studies examined the potential of using fetal cfdna for non_invasive nipt their results showed that methods using next_generation were highly_accurate for detecting aneuploidies leading to several companies e g natera verinata and sequenom offering clinical nipt today the two complementary approaches that use fetal cfdna in plasma for detecting aneuploidies or smaller copy_number cnvs are based on read_coverage and single_nucleotide snp allelic ratios in both cases cfdna is sequenced using next_generation while earlier methods have generated this data via whole_genome more recent_approaches oftentarget only the chromosomes or regions of interest to reduce the cost of sequencing in methods that rely on coverage the copy count of chromosomes for aneuploidies and regions for smaller cnvs are predicted by comparing the proportion of fragments that align to the target compared to a set of controls an orthogonal information_source is the allelic ratios observed at snp loci even though fetal origin dna is only a small fraction of total cfdna fetal fraction also called the fetal content is typically depending on gestation age and maternal_weight the presence of extra copies of fetal chromosomes changes the observed_frequencies of the alleles at the snp positions while the change may be imperceptible at a single locus due to low fetal fraction incorporating several snps can allow for accurate prediction of aneuploidies for example proposed a bayesian maximum_likelihood method that uses allele counts at snp loci together with genotype_information of the parents to predict copy count in target chromosomes in a recent article we demonstrated that the information provided by allelic ratios and coverage approaches is complementary and can be unified within a single probabilistic_framework e g using hidden_markov there are multiple issues which complicate the use of coverage and allelic ratios to uncover cnvs there are significant number of known e g gc_content and unknown biases that affect the coverage such biases are especially prominent in smaller regions and extensive control datasets are required to fully model them allelic ratios at snps while less affected by biases are available only in a small fraction of the genome furthermore they are not uniformly_distributed across the genome leading to blind spots in the analysis finally in some cases analysis of such snp sites requires the presence of a paternal sample which is often not readily available several studies have shown that fetal and maternal origin cfdna have distinct size distributions first reported this by using amplicons of different sizes in a panel of quantitative_polymerase assays their results showed that fetal fragments are generally shorter than maternal ones this result was confirmed bythrough high_throughput pairedend sequencing of the plasma in a recent study have used fragment_size distributions to predict aneuploidies using microchip based capillary_electrophoresis however their method is unable to detect shorter cnvs as it considers the fragment size_distribution of the whole_genome rather than specific regions and different regions can have different distributions due to epigenetic_factors such as the position of nucleosomes in this work we develop a novel method for identifying subchromosomal cnvs in a fetal genome from cfdna fragment_size information for a given target_region the method identifies a set of control regions with similar fragment size_distribution characteristics and utilizes this set of controls for predicting the fetal copy_number in the target_region we test our methods on multiple sets of simulated_data and show that our method is able to identify submegabase cnvs with high_accuracy which increases with the fetal dna fraction depth of sequencing and length of cnvs being predicted in this section we evaluate the performance of our method by performing tests using the cfdna samples i and g in section we evaluate the performance of our method on cfdna data with altered fetal fractions reduced coverages and simulated cnvs of different types and sizes as well as investigating the effects of choosing different thresholds for control bin selection in section we compare the performance of our method with our own previous cnv_detection algorithm that is based on combined allele ratio and coverage analysis in this work we introduce a novel method for accurate submegabase cnv prediction based on the fragment size_distribution of the cfdna in maternal_plasma to overcome the challenge of variability of the cfdna fragment_size distributions throughout genome as described in section we noted that the regions that have similar distribution signatures are likely to be similar across different samples our method takes_advantage of this by using an orthogonal reference_sample to find such regions depending on the application it can be important to have fewer false_positives calling wrong cnvs or fewer false_negatives missing actual cnvs the prior on the fetal copy_number which we assumed to be uniform in our experiments can be adjusted to change the cnv_calling rate and the sensitivity_specificity trade_off our model has several shortcomings which can be addressed in future work first while we model the length_distribution based on combination of maternal and fetal genomes we do not directly model the presence of small_scale insertion_deletion indel variation which also impacts the distribution of fragment_lengths see e g or cnvs in the maternal sample while these events are rare and lead to changes of the fragment length_distribution that are different from changes by fetal copy count they could compromise the accuracy of our method and hence should be modeled directly the accuracy of our method depends highly on the fetal fraction r which we assume is known the estimation of r from real_data is straightforward at higher fetal fractions and coverages based on sites where the mother is homozygous for one allele and the paternally inherited allele is different as fetal fraction decreases and coverage falls this becomes harder due to allele dropout and for coverages lower than x we would need orthogonal methods for identifying such fragments effective methods for directly estimating r from nipt data would improve the robustness of our algorithm a general weakness of our experiments is in the simulation where we assume that the size_distribution of fetal origin dna is uniform across the genome this makes our simulated_data cleaner than a realistic sample a better simulation framework or availability of real_samples with cnvs would help the development of new methods in this field
