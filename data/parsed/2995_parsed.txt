genome_analysis mirnakey a software for microrna deep_sequencing analysis motivation micrornas mirnas are short abundant non_coding critical for many cellular_processes deep_sequencing next_generation are being readily used to receive a more accurate depiction of mirna_expression in living_cells this type of analysis is a key_step towards improving our understanding of the complexity and mode of mirna regulation results mirnakey is a software_package designed to be used as a base station for the analysis of mirna deep sequencing_data the package implements common steps taken in the analysis of such data as well as adds unique features such as data statistics and multiple read determination generating a novel platform for the analysis of mirna_expression a user_friendly graphical_interface is applied to determine the analysis steps the tabular and graphical output contains general and detailed reports on the sequence_reads and provides an accurate picture of the differentially_expressed in paired_samples availability_and seemicrornas mirnas are short non_coding abundant in all animal cells these small non coding molecules bind to mrna_transcripts and control their expression through facilitated mrna_degradation or protein inhibition mirnas are involved in many cellular_processes suggesting their dominant role in regulation of gene_expression mirna_expression obtained under different conditions or from cells of different origins provides a basis for the investigation of the regulatory_role of mirnas in health and disease deep_sequencing next_generation have recently_emerged as powerful technologies providing unprecedented insights into biological_systems with automated sequencing_technologies becoming routinely used the data_acquisition of millions of sequence_reads per experiment leads researchers to the subsequent challenge of data analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed currently there are several available software_packages that facilitate the analysis of small_rna short_read each software is designed via different approaches bearing its advantages and some limitations particularly software_packages for mirna data analysis such as mirdeep do not provide differential_expression between known mirnas in the input samples and do not have a graphic interface we note that this and other software is designated to predict novel mirnas other tools such as uea srna toolkit miranalyzer seqbuster dsap and mirtools require many processing_steps and are mostly web_based thus are either limited in file size or add a long upload stage to the analysis process this is underscored by the fact that many owners of deep sequencers do not have access to large_scale computing facilities or are not savvy with their use finally none of the existing software provides a method to rigorously deal with multiply mapped_reads treating multiply mapped_reads correctly is essential since small_rnas inherently result in short_reads even shorter than the accustomed nt and consequently these reads tend to be mapped to multiple genomic_locations most current software_packages for the analysis of small_rna sequencing_data remove such reads from the analysis thus sacrificing the accuracy of any expression_profile generated here we introduce mirnakey a software_package designed to be used as a base station for the analysis of mirna sequencing_data mirnakey can be locally run on any unix linux or mac computer with bit architecture via the graphical_user or on a computer cluster via the command_line the software is freely_available for download at http ibis tau ac il mirnakey the main output generated by mirnakey is a table comparing each pair of samples files this table contains the union of the observed mirnas in the two samples ranked from most differentially_expressed to least see supplementary each line contains the read_counts and rpkm expression indices for a specific mirna in the two samples and the differential_expression measure for the mirna between the two samples along with a p value and additional useful information such as data statistics and multiple read determinations the ranking of mirnas allows the user to focus on the most differentially_expressed in a pair of samples conditions thus reducing the high volumes of data generated from deep sequencing_experiments additionally many other output reports and plots are generated by mirnakey see supplementary data along with files to be used in downstream_analysis since mirnakey is a flexible stand alone application we found it more appropriate to map the short_reads to a known mirna database mirbase rather than to an entire reference_genome this allows a much faster and more flexible analysis with minor compromising in accuracy see description in supplementary data we used mirnakey to evaluate differential_expression for a pair of samples the samples consisted of a viral infected cell_line versus a non infected control see supplementary data the exact extracted total_rna was used for deep_sequencing analysis and for quantitative_real using mirnakey we discovered a number of highly differentially_expressed between the two samples which are likely to be pivotal players in the viral_infection process the most prominent mirnas were also validated using quantitative_real and indicated a strong correlation between the methods see mirnakey is a software_package designed as a base station for the analysis of mirna sequencing_data a friendly graphical_user is applied to determine the analysis steps the tabular output contains general and detailed reports on the sequence_reads and provides an accurate picture of the differentially_expressed in paired_samples mirnakey can run on a local unix linux or mac computer and deals with multiply mapped mirna reads the software can be downloaded at http ibis tau ac il mirnakey
