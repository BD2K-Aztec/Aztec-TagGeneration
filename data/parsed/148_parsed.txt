genome_analysis affypipe an open_source pipeline for affymetrix axiom genotyping workflow the affymetrix axiom genotyping standard and best practice work flow for linux and mac users consists of three stand alone executable programs affymetrix power tools and an r package snpolisher currently snp analysis has to be performed in a step_by procedure manual intervention and or programming_skills by the user is required at each intermediate point as affymetrix power tools programs do not produce input_files for the program next in line an additional problem is that the output format of genotypes is not compatible with most analysis software currently available affypipe solves all the above problems by automating both standard and best practice workflows for any species genotyped with the axiom technology affypipe does not require programming_skills and performs all the steps necessary to obtain a final genotype file furthermore users can directly edit snp probes and export genotypes in plink format availability_and https github com nicolazzie there are two widely used high_throughput snp genotyping_platforms illumina and affymetrix these producers differ not only in their genotyping technologies but also in the downstream software available to obtain genotype_calls illumina has developed an integrated software genomestudio v r with a graphical_user gui for visualization of the genotyping_data from the assay platform genomestudio v r only runs on the windows operating system os affymetrix provides a gui software genotyping console tm for windows os http www affymetrix com estore browse level seven software products only jsp productid however for linux unix and mac os users the affymetrix genotyping workflow consists of a step_by procedure for which no gui or automation is available there are two types of workflow the standard http www affymetrix com support downloads manuals axiom genotyping solution analysis guide pdf and the best practice http www affymetrix com support downloads manuals axiom best practice supplement user guide pdf workflow the standard workflow consists of a four step procedure and is the basic workflow the best practice workflow includes an extra step for platewise quality_control qc in both workflows the first three steps use a set of stand alone executable programs which were originally written in c affymetrix power tools aptools whereas the fourth step requires the use of the r programming_language http www rproject org and a specific r package snpolisher in addition if the best practice workflow is run users must manually calculate two platewise statistics excluding individuals in specific low quality plates a schematic overview of the process is shown in to carry out the analysis executable programs the snpolisher r package and many input_files for each of the steps have to be downloaded from the affymetrix web_site in addition to writing long command_line instructions for each step the first phase of the analysis is sample qc which creates a statistic dish qc to measure the signal across nonpolymorphic loci affymetrix suggests retaining samples with a default dish qc both the evaluation of the output_file and the creation of the new input_file for the next program in the workflow i e excluding samples that do not pass the threshold have to be executed manually in the second phase genotyped samples with call rate cr lower than a default value of are identified users then need to manually evaluate the output_file and create a new input_file selecting the cr cutoff and excluding samples failing the cr criteria the best practice workflow has an extra step for platewise qc this step however is not automated and requires the manual calculation of two statistics plate pass_rate and average plate call rate with default values and respectively users then have to assess the quality of each plate and create a new input_file for the next program the next phase requires the genotyping step to be rerun for the samples passing the quality_criteria in the last phase the snpolisher r package is used to evaluate the quality of the signal and to classify each snp probe into six classes the affymetrix workflow provides genotypes irrespective of their snp probe quality in snp probe by row format with a coding for homozygotes b and a and respectively heterozygotes and missing genotypes although the use of the aptools does not require any c programming_skills just basic command_line use the use of snpolisher requires at least a basic_knowledge of r therefore the lay user cannot easily run the full analysis currently a linux or linux based environment is commonly to whom correspondence should be addressed used to handle large_datasets therefore a pipeline that integrates the analyses steps into a single application would be of general use affypipe is a python based pipeline that addresses the need to automate the whole workflow and hence reduce the time effort and programming_skills needed to obtain genotype_calls affypipe allows both standard and best practice workflows to be run and produces edited final files in plink format a standard and widely used format for genetic_analyses although this pipeline was built originally for the water_buffalo axiom k assay it is able to handle any species genotyped with the affymetrix axiom technology
