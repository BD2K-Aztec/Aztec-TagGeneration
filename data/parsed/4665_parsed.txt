gene_expression tigar transcript_isoform abundance estimation method with gapped_alignment of rna_seq by variational bayesian_inference motivation many human genes express multiple transcript_isoforms through alternative_splicing which greatly_increases diversity of protein_function although rna_sequencing rna_seq technologies have been widely used in measuring amounts of transcribed mrna accurate estimation of transcript_isoform abundances from rna_seq is challenging because reads often map to more than one transcript_isoforms or paralogs whose sequences are similar to each other results we propose a statistical_method to estimate transcript iso form abundances from rna_seq our method can handle gapped alignments of reads against reference_sequences so that it allows insertion or deletion errors within reads the proposed method optimizes the number of transcript_isoforms by variational bayesian_inference through an iterative procedure and its convergence is guaranteed under a stopping criterion on simulated_datasets our method outperformed the comparable quantification_methods in inferring transcript_isoform abundances and at the same time its rate of convergence was faster than that of the expectation_maximization we also applied our method to rna_seq of human cell_line samples and showed that our prediction result was more consistent among technical_replicates than those of other methods availability an implementation of our method is available at http alternative_splicing is a biological_process in which an exon can be either included or excluded or there can be several splice_sites so that it allows a gene to have multiple forms of proteins a recent_study that of human genes undergo alternative_splicing and that many alternative_splicing vary among tissues it has also been reported that some aberrant_splicing results in human_diseases such as cystic_fibrosis and spinal_muscular hence it is important to identify transcript_isoforms that are expressed in particular tissues under some conditions and not in others to quantify transcription_levels rna_seq that uses highthroughput_sequencing of cdna has been widely used advantages of rna_seq over other conventional methods such as dna_microarrays include precise measurements of levels of transcripts and splice patterns because the sequencebased approach directly determines mrna_sequences probabilistic approaches have been proposed to compute the relative_frequencies of alternative splice_isoforms for each gene but these methods do not handle reads that map to multiple gene_loci and hence do not estimate global transcript_abundances for each isoform in most cases reads are often shorter than a full transcript and sequences of alternatively_spliced transcript_isoforms and paralogs are often similar to each other hence short_reads generated by rna_seq do not always map uniquely to reference cdnas which lead to inaccurate estimation of transcript_isoform abundances several approaches have been proposed to resolve ambiguous reads that map to multiple transcript_isoforms multi map reads one ad_hoc approach is to allocate fractions of multimapped reads to target transcript_isoforms equally which is implemented as the default option in cufflinks another approach is to allocate fractions of the reads in proportion to the coverage of uniquely_mapped divided by the length of the transcript_isoforms rescue method which is implemented as the u option in the latest_version of cufflinks statistical_methods that use a generative_model of rna_seq have been proposed in which the transcript_isoform abundance is estimated as a latent random variable by the expectation_maximization em_algorithm althoughshowed that the statistical_methods performed better than the rescue method their methods cannot handle the gapped_alignment of reads i e an alignment with insertions into reference_sequences or deletions from reference_sequences when reads generated from high_throughput sequencers become longer with some insertion or deletion errors it will be more difficult to map the reads to reference_sequences without allowing gapped_alignment hence the limitation of methods that are unable to handle gapped alignments of reads is a huge drawback when more sophisticated mapping tools such as bowtie to whom correspondence should be addressed or novoalign www novocraft com are considered also the em_algorithm used in these statistical_methods tends to overfit the model_parameters to the rna_seq i e the methods try to estimate as many transcript_isoforms as possible as long as the likelihood_function increases it is problematic for example when there are many transcript_isoforms whose sequences are similar to the one that is actually expressed and the read sequences contain base substitution insertion and deletion errors as a result of the maximum_likelihood the method might predict false_positives spurious transcript_isoforms and hence the transcript_abundances estimated for true isoforms are affected one strategy to avoid such overfitting is to consider a model_selection framework based on the marginal likelihood where a tradeoff of matching of sequence_reads and the number of isoforms can be considered however this involves integrating over all latent_variables as well as model_parameters which is usually difficult and intractable to compute in this article we propose a statistical method_named tigar a transcript_isoform abundance estimation method with gapped_alignment of rna_seq by variational_bayesian vb inference the proposed method can handle gapped_alignment of reads to reference_sequences allowing mismatches insertions_and our vb inference approach resolves the issue of overfitting by optimizing the number of transcript_isoforms under the model_selection framework the vb inference approximates full posterior distributions by assuming the factorization of latent_variables and model_parameters an approximation of the posterior_distribution is obtained via an iterative em like algorithm with a closed form solution in each iteration and its convergence is guaranteed we show from simulation_experiments that the proposed method successfully predicts transcript_isoform abundances more accurately than other comparable methods and at the same time its rate of convergence is faster than that of the em_algorithm we also apply our method to rna_seq of human cell_line samples and show that the prediction result obtained by the proposed method is more consistent than those obtained by other methods in this article to estimate transcript_isoform abundances from rna_seq we proposed a statistical_method named tigar which can handle gapped alignments of reads against reference_sequences to avoid_overfitting we also proposed vb inference that iteratively optimizes the number of transcript_isoforms we showed through simulation_experiments that in quantifying transcript_isoform abundances from rna_seq tigar vb performed better than the popularly used cufflinks and rsem especially when the length of reads became longer with some insertion and deletion errors we also showed that the convergence speed of tigar vb was faster than those of tigar em and rsem which is likely explained by the optimization of the number of transcript_isoforms in the early iterations we also applied our method to real_data from human cell_line samples and showed that the prediction result by our method was more consistent than those by other methods in estimating transcript_abundances of technical_replicates notably tigar vb made fewer predictions of transcript_isoforms whose fpkm were small e g in comparison with predictions by cufflinks and rsem many of which we believe might be false_positives it is also important to consider experimental_noise introduced during library_preparation under different conditions to handle such variations among multiple replicates or experimental_conditions methods such as cuffdiff or ebseq can be considered in a downstream_analysis the performance of tigar will become more significant when it is applied to rna_seq produced with new types of sequencers such as the ion pgm and pacific_biosciences rs whose reads are longer but with relatively many insertion and deletion errors our tigar vb optimizes the number of transcript_isoforms by maximizing the lower_bound of log_likelihood for rna_seq on the contrary other model_selection methods such as the bayesian_information bic or a sampling based_approach can be considered however it has been reported that the variational lower bounds outperform the bic in finding the correct model structure while approaching the performance of the much more costly sampling procedure hence we believe that the proposed method offers the advantage of bayesian_inference to avoid_overfitting but keeps the computational speed comparable with that of the em_algorithm a useful application of tigar vb might be the quantification of novel alternative spliced isoforms or fusion_transcripts from rna_seq by augmenting reference_sequences to include novel splice_junctions another useful application might be fusion_transcripts predicted from discordantly mapped mate_pairs in such cases because the number of possible splice_junctions or combinations of exons increases dramatically the proposed method will be helpful to select a set of plausible transcript_isoforms so that predictions can be further validated alternatively if we know in advance from other experiments that certain transcript_isoforms expressed more than others then the proposed method might be able to incorporate the prior information by setting the hyperparameter as an effective read_count hence hyperparameters can be fixed according to prior_knowledge or can be chosen as a maximizer of the lower_bound of the log marginal likelihood as described in the article the current model cannot distinguish between sequencing_errors and the alignment mismatches because of single_nucleotide snps or structural_variations inherent in samples it will be useful to incorporate structural_variation information in the dbsnp http www ncbi nlm nih gov projects snp our future work will include investigations of topics mentioned earlier in text
