structural_bioinformatics glycoprofileassigner automated structural assignment with error estimation for glycan lc data motivation sequencing glycan_structures is a difficult problem that requires the use of multiple experimental_approaches one powerful approach to glycan sequencing is the combination of liquid_chromatography with sequential exoglycosidase digestions however interpreting this can be difficult and time consuming to aid this process we introduce glycoprofileassigner software for automated structural assignment of glycan profile data from liquid_chromatography experiments results glycoprofileassigner has been tested on human_igg data and can retrieve the correct structure in out of peaks tested availability_and the programme and its source_code is available at https bitbucket org fergaljd glycoprofileassignerthe study of glycans and glycoproteins is central to understanding a wide_range of biological_problems the majority of human proteins are glycosylated by oligosaccharides attached to asparagine n glycans or serine_threonine o glycans glycosylation is also the single most important post_translational observed on biotherapeutic proteins glycans affect the stability safety and efficacy of biotherapeutics and understanding which glycans are present on a glycoprotein is vital to understanding its function glycan_structures are challenging to analyze because a large variety of possible monosaccharide linkages and complex isomeric branched structures may exist for any given monosaccharide composition a large range of analytical_tools have been developed to elucidate glycan_structures including liquid_chromatography mass_spectrometry and capillary_electrophoresis these approaches are often supplemented with exoglycosidase digestions to reduce glycan_structures by sequentially removing defined monosacharrides to a well defined sugar core glycoprofileassigner is a software_tool that assists in the interpretation of hilic hplc and uplc data hilic hydrophobic_interaction is a technique that separates structures on the basis of their hydrophilicity for glycan data this is roughly_equivalent to glycan size hplc and uplc are high and ultra_performance respectively for glycan lc experiments chromatographic retention_times can be expressed in normalised glucose units gu for comparability across different experimental_setups combining lc derived gu data with sequential enzyme digestions is a powerful method for analyzing the glycan_structures and their relative_abundances in a biological_sample the main difficulty with the current u hplc approach is that assignment of glycan_structures is difficult and time consuming as it can require manually ascertaining the correct digestion pathways for dozens of glycans between five or more digestion panels glycoprofileassigner aims to aid this process by offering a fast and accurate method of enumerating and scoring glycan_structure assignments glycoprofileassigner is not the first time automated structural assignment software has been developed autogu was the original work on this topic however this software was limited to experimentally_observed glycan digestions glycoprofileassigner represents a major advance on this software by being able to predict the activity of any common glycosidase on any n or o glycan_structure and by including an assignment score to estimate the likelihood of a correct assignment glycoprofileassigner does have some limitations it assumes a single glycan_structure per chromatographic peak and that all enzymatic_digestion steps run to full completion applying glycoprofileassigner to under digested profile data or profile data where glycan_structures are not separated into unique peaks will result in poor_quality assignments glycoprofileassigner can also be a powerful_tool in conjunction with mass_spectrometry data the glycoprofileassigner gui displays the theoretical mass of all the predicted assignments allowing them to be easily compared with ms experimental_data
