genome_analysis unipro ugene a unified bioinformatics toolkit unipro ugene is a multiplatform open_source with the main goal of assisting molecular_biologists without much expertise in bioinformatics to manage analyze and visualize their data ugene integrates widely used bioinformatics_tools within a common user_interface the toolkit supports multiple biological data_formats and allows the retrieval of data from remote data_sources it provides visualization modules for biological objects such as annotated genome_sequences next_generation ngs assembly data multiple_sequence phylogenetic_trees and d structures most of the integrated algorithms are tuned for maximum performance by the usage of multithreading and special processor instructions ugene includes a visual_environment for creating reusable workflows that can be launched on local_resources or in a high_performance hpc environment ugene is written in c using the qt framework the built in plugin system and structured ugene api make it possible to extend the toolkit with new functionality availability_and ugene binaries are freely_available for ms windows linux and mac os x at http ugene unipro ru download html ugene code is licensed under the gplv the information about the code licensing and copyright of integrated tools can be found in the license rd party file provided with the source bundle the number of available bioinformatics_tools has grown dramatically over the past_two however as a result of increasing complexity of the tools and a lack of rigorous software engineering practices using installing and configuring a bioinformatics application along with ensuring that it is communicating well with other programs can be a challenging_task moreover a large number of computational_methods and tools are available only as source_code packages command_line utilities which can run only in a linux unix environment web_services or programming libraries and cannot be easily accessed by biologists who do not have the necessary skills a number of existing_tools also lack user documentation and have limited support to whom correspondence should be addressed some solutions have been proposed to improve the situation there are bioinformatics_tools which are multiplatform easy to install and hide the underlying complexity behind an easy to use gui interface usually these tools are focused on a particular niche good examples of such tools are the artemis genome_browser jalview multiple_alignment editor tablet and igv next_generation data visualization packages applications such as galaxy or taverna solve communication issues between tools by providing easily_accessible capabilities to manage bioinformatics workflows but still require significant effort to set up on a local server there are also closed source commercially_available programs such as vectornti www invitrogen com geneious www geneious com or clcbio www clcbio com that could act as a bioinformatics swiss army knife in this article we introduce unipro ugene a multiplatform open_source application which integrates popular bioinformatics algorithms and tools providing both graphical and command_line interfaces it has an active user community and support from a team of professional software_developers to perform complex computational_experiments ugene allows the construction of reusable workflow diagrams
