sequence_analysis fetalquant deducing fractional fetal dna concentration from massively_parallel of dna in maternal_plasma motivation the fractional fetal dna concentration is one of the critical parameters for non_invasive prenatal_diagnosis based on the analysis of dna in maternal_plasma massively_parallel mps of dna in maternal_plasma has been demonstrated to be a powerful_tool for the non_invasive prenatal_diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploi dies with the rapid advance of mps technologies the sequencing cost per base is dramatically reducing especially when using targeted mps even though several approaches have been developed for deducing the fractional fetal dna concentration none of them can be used to deduce the fractional fetal dna concentration directly from the sequencing_data without prior genotype_information result in this study we implement a statistical mixture_model named fetalquant which utilizes the maximum_likelihood to estimate the fractional fetal dna concentration directly from targeted mps of dna in maternal_plasma this method allows the improved deduction of the fractional fetal dna concentration obviating the need of genotype_information without loss of accuracy furthermore by using bayes rule this method can distinguish the informative single_nucleotide loci where the mother is homozygous and the fetus is heterozygous we believe that fetalquant can help expand the spectrum of diagnostic applications using mps on dna in maternal_plasma the discovery of circulating cell_free in maternal_plasma in has opened up new possibilities for non_invasive diagnosis to date a wide_variety of noninvasive diagnostic applications have been developed including fetal rhd blood_group genotyping fetal sex_determination for sex linked disorders chromosomal aneuploidy detection and detection of monogenic diseases in a number of these applications the accurate deduction of the fractional concentration of fetal dna is critical for the diagnostic_algorithms for example for the prenatal_diagnosis of autosomal_recessive diseases the relative concentrations of the mutant and wild_type sequences in maternal_plasma are used to infer if a maternal mutation is passed onto the fetus because the maternal allele inherited by the fetus would be present in a slightly_higher concentration in this diagnostic_approach the fetal dna concentration is an essential parameter for determining if an apparent allelic_imbalance in maternal_plasma is statistically_significant there are several existing_approaches for inferring the fractional fetal dna concentration in a maternal_plasma sample for instance the ratio of the concentrations of sequences located on chromosome y and an autosome was used for estimating the fractional fetal dna concentration in pregnancies carrying male fetuses however these approaches are not applicable for pregnancies with female fetuses an alternative approach would be the analysis of fetal specific_alleles in maternal_plasma in this approach the fractional fetal dna concentration is calculated by determining the ratio of dna_fragments carrying the fetal specific_alleles and the alleles shared between the mother and the fetus in previous_studies the genotype_information of the fetus and the mother was used for identifying the fetal specific_alleles however in actual clinical_scenarios during non_invasive prenatal_diagnosis the fetal genotypes would not be available beforehand alternatively the comparison between the maternal and paternal genotypes can be used for identifying obligately heterozygous polymorphisms in the fetus for this purpose however paternal dna may not be available for analysis and the approach would add cost and additional steps to the analysis as an alternative fetal specific epigenetic changes such as methylated rassf a and unmethylated serpinb sequences can be used as fetal markers irrespective of genotype_information however the analytical process used for quantifying these epigenetic markers involves either bisulfite_conversion or digestion with methylation_sensitive enzymes and thus might potentially_affect the precision of these methods massively_parallel mps of plasma dna_fragments can produce millions of short_reads that can be aligned to the reference_genome the fractional fetal dna concentration also referred as the fetal dna proportion or fetal dna fraction can be determined by quantifying fetal specific_alleles and alleles shared between the fetus and the mother shared alleles in the maternal_plasma based on their genotype_information this kind of analysis is thought to be a gold_standard for fetal dna fraction estimation in previous_studies prior_knowledge of at least the maternal genotype was obtained through additional laboratory analyses in clinical practice it would be ideal to have new methods to determine fetal dna fraction directly from the sequencing_data that provide the diagnostic_information without additional laboratory steps the emergence of targeted mps technology makes it possible to obtain the sequencing_data with high sequencing_depth coverage in a cost effective_manner it permits efficient and unbiased detection of fetal specific_alleles at genomic_regions of interest as well as fetal dna proportion inference in maternal_plasma when using maternal and fetal genotypes in this study we present a new approach named fetalquant using a statistical binomial mixture_model to deduce the fractional fetal dna concentration directly from targeted mps data in this method the allelic counts are inferred from aligned plasma dna_reads at each single_nucleotide snp sites annotated in the dbsnp ucsc hg fetalquant is implemented in c which is available for non commercial users the major advantage of this approach over existing_methods is that it can directly determine the fractional fetal dna concentration by sequencing the dna in maternal without using any fetal or paternal genotype_information
