systems_biology metnetmaker a free_and tool for the creation of novel metabolic_networks in sbml format an application has been developed to help with the creation and editing of systems_biology sbml format metabolic_networks up to the organism scale networks are defined as a collection of kyoto_encyclopedia kegg ligand reactions with an optional associated enzyme classification ec_number for each reaction additional custom reactions can be defined by the user reactions within the network can be assigned flux constraints and compartmentalization is supported for each reaction in addition to the support for reactions that occur across compartment boundaries exported networks are fully sbml l v compatible with an optional l v export for compatibility with old versions of the cobra toolbox availability_and the software runs in the free microsoft access runtime microsoft inc which is included with the installer and works on windows xp sp or better full source_code is viewable in the full version of access or users must have a license to use the kegg ligand database free academic licensing is available please go to www bioinformatics leeds ac uk pytf metnetmaker for software download help and tutorials contact pytf leeds ac ukflux balance analysis fba as described in with an updated description inand clarified in a primer by seeks flux solutions corresponding to steady_state metabolite_concentrations s v where s is the stoichiometric matrix of a reconstructed metabolic_network and v is a vector of the flux through each reaction in the network stoichiometric matrices typically have more reactions columns of s than metabolites rows of s meaning that a solution v can be any linear combination of many vectors in the null space of s the linear combination of these vectors that gives a single optimal vector can be found by linear_programming often by maximizing the creation in the correct proportions of the metabolites defined in an experimentally_measured biomass function or more generally maximizing or minimizing any other chosen objective_function additional constraints on the flux through certain reactions can be addedoften with reference to known uptake_rates of carbon and nitrogen sourcesproviding a further link between the computational_model and experimental_results the cobra toolbox which applies techniques to whom correspondence should be addressed set out in is a commonly used tool for fba in addition to many other features this software can perform constraints based fba on systems_biology sbml format metabolic_networks containing additional information on reaction flux contraints many existing whole organism metabolic_network reconstructions have been created using the pathway tools software based on the biocyc pathway genome_database collection and the metacyc compound reaction_pathway naming convention these reconstructions are often unsuitable for fba since they contain holes due to a lack sufficient manual_curation manipulation of these networks such as adding new transport reactions or adding removing pathways and quickly exporting sbml format models is cumbersome and limits the usefulness of the software for rapid network design and testing fba ready metabolic_network models are generally recreated as outlined in thiele and palsson recent_examples of this approach are for the pathogens leishmania_major and salmonella_typhimurium both of which were built in simpheny genomatica inc a well developed but closed source and expensive software_package that uses a custom compound reaction naming convention
