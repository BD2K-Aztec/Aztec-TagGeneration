cytoscaperpc a plugin to create modify and query cytoscape networks from scripting languages cytoscaperpc is a plugin for cytoscape which allows users to create query and modify cytoscape networks from any programming_language which supports xml rpc this enables them to access cytoscape functionality and visualize their data interactively without leaving the programming environment with which they are familiar availability install through the cytoscape_plugin manager or visit the web_page http wiki nbic nl index php cytoscaperpc for the user tutorial and download cytoscape is a network_visualization and analysis tool which is mainly used in the life_sciences it enables users to display the data as graphs and helps them to perform basic actions such as gathering network topological statistics it comes with its own plugin management system to facilitate the easy implementation of new functionality researchers in the life_sciences often use scripting languages to process their data and use cytoscape to visualize it their workflow when using cytoscape comes down to running their algorithm converting the output data such that cytoscape can use it loading the data into cytoscape and then setting the appropriate layout and visualization rules to control how the data is displayed the last three steps of this process are repetitive and time consuming we present cytoscaperpc a cytoscape_plugin created to solve the aforementioned problems by enabling users to create a connection to cytoscape using xml rpc allowing them to create modify and query cytoscape networks from within their own programming environment
