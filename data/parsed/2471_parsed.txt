genome_analysis infire a novel computational_method for the identification of insertion_sites in transposon mutagenized bacterial_genomes motivation infire insertion finder via restriction digest is a novel software_tool that allows for the computational_identification of transposon insertion_sites in known bacterial genome_sequences after transposon_mutagenesis experiments the approach is based on the fact that restriction_endonuclease digestions of bacterial_dna yield a unique pattern of dna_fragments with defined sizes transposon_insertion changes the size of the hosting dna_fragment by a known number of base_pairs the exact size of this fragment can be determined by southern_blot subsequently the position of insertion can be identified with computational_analysis the outlined method provides a solid basis for the establishment of a new high_throughput technology availability_and the software is freely_available on our web_server at www infire tu bs de the algorithm was implemented in the statistical programming_language r for the most flexible use infire is provided in two different versions a web_interface offers the convenient use in a web_browser in addition the software and source_code is freely_available for download as r packages on our website transposons are mobile_genetic capable of random insertions into host genomes this fundamental feature has been employed for decades to inactivate genes leaving a detectable signature at the locus of integration this well developed genetic technique is applicable to the genomes of viruses prokaryotes and eukaryotes various modifications of traditional transposon_mutagenesis facilitated the development of new techniques such as signature target mutagenesis transposon mediated differential hybridization genetic footprinting and gene_expression analysis the crucial step of all these methods is the localization of the transposon insertion_sites in the course of the last years several methods for the localization of transposons have been developed among them are the vectorette pcr inverse pcr and the cloning of restricted chromosomal dna_fragment into vectors with subsequent amplification single primer pcr allows a rapid identification of insertion_sites but often requires optimization of the amplification conditions with the improvement of dna sequencing_techniques it became possible to determine the transposon insertion_site from the bacterial chromosomal_dna here we present a novel computational_method for the identification of insertion_sites in transposon mutagenized bacterial_genomes the functionality of the algorithm was successfully demonstrated using a mini tn transposon legionella_pneumophila corby library in this study we developed a new approach for the prediction of transposon insertion_sites in transposon mutagenized bacteria infire is based on a simple_algorithm and allows the simultaneous_determination of insertion_sites by standard restriction digestion combined with southern_blot the method is applicable to all sequenced organisms and therefore has a great_potential to bring benefits in a wide_range in comparison to existing_methods infire has several advantages first the method does not require intensive experimental optimization therefore numerous insertion mutants can be analyzed simultaneously second infire overcomes the difficulties associated with the amplification and sequencing of gc_rich genomic fragments lastly the method allows for the determination of exact position of a transposon_insertion in any genome this is especially important for identification of the transposons which are integrated in repetitive_sequences although long repeated_sequences are carefully annotated in sequenced_genomes less attention was paid to investigate the biological role of these structures thus infire may also open new ways to analyze the functions of repeated_sequences in prokaryotic_genomes
