sequence_analysis sapa tool finding protein regions by combination of amino_acid scaled profiles patterns and rules functional_modules within protein_sequences are often extracted by consensus sequence_patterns representing a linear motif however other functional_regions may only be described by combined features such as amino_acid profiles of amino_acid and randomly_distributed short_sequence if only a small number of functional examples are well characterized the researcher needs a tool to extract similar sequences for further investigation availability_and we provide the web_application sapa tool which allows the user to search with combined properties ranks the extracted target_regions by an integrated score estimates false_discovery by using decoy sequences and provides them as a sequence file or spreadsheet source_code user_manual and the web_application implemented in perl html css and javascript and running on apache are freely_available sapafinding functional_regions in protein_sequences is an important annotation task although many features of proteins are encoded by interacting amino_acid positioned apart from each other in sequence some exist as linear motifs represented by a continuous stretch of residues estimations for eukaryotes assume that such linear regions cover up to of all protein_sequences they have diverse functions in protein_folding protein complex_assembly protein_protein ligand_binding signalling and as sites of post_translational many such sites may be extracted with distinct sequence_patterns simple or complex rules for amino_acid neighbourhoods or position specific matrices which describe a specific amino_acid and its allowed variations as collected by the interpro or the prosite database functional_regions may also be predicted by a specific amino_acid and similarity to a scaled amino_acid profile or index which defines for each residue a weight for being part of a sequence with a specific property such scaled profiles are collected by the aaindex database and may be applied by scanning tools like the application pepwindow of the emboss program suite in silico identification and analysis of hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins from arabidopis thaliana were recently performed by the bio ohio software a tool which combines the searches for regions of biased amino_acid e g past and that for repeated small patterns like ap pa sp and tp a functional region may also be characterized by low complexity because of stretches of the same amino_acid or the repeated occurrence of short_sequence as compiled by thecontrol sequences the region of the proteins to be scanned may be restricted the set minimum_size of the target_sequence has to comply with all settings overlapping or adjoining targets will be fused three decoy methods riffled shuffled reversed allow the user to make a set of decoy sequences which are scanned together with the imported proteins for estimation of a cumulative local_false fdr the fdr for a specific target score is two times the observed number of decoy targets above or equal to that score divided by the number of all observed targets above or equal to that score although the reversed method conserves local amino_acid completely the random method would scramble it however it removes the natural sequence redundancy and underestimates the fdr we designed a riffling method which mixes the sequence analogous to the riffled shuffle of a stack of playing cards mostly conserves sequence redundancy and destroys local amino_acid for details see the programs decoy help file manual and the supplement the user selects minimum occurrence percentages for up to six single amino_acids or three groups of related amino_acids which must be found in selected target_sequences up to three scaled aaindex amino_acid profiles can be used for scoring and or selecting target_sequences which can be set to remain below or above a specified mean score value targets are also optionally selected depending on their motif content the motifs are defined by an extended version of the prosite pattern syntax and are combined with and not or or operators each target_sequence is scored by the information content of each amino_acid matched by a composition setting the scores of the appropriately re scaled and weighted aaindex scales and the information content of the defined motifs details of the scoring_scheme are described in the manual and the supplement the scores of each protein are the sum score of their target scores the result screen summarizes the applied search settings the scoring_scheme and target protein extraction results a result table shows all targets sorted by their scores and contains protein_sequence icons with highlighted target_regions where the scores are encoded by different colour intensities when clicking on an icon a pop up window shows the sequence with the highlighted regions all setting and result tables may be downloaded as a multiple excel spreadsheet file and protein_sequences as a fasta formatted sequence file the sapa tool enables easy subsetting of any protein list using compositional profile and motif data scores the targets appropriately and estimates their fdr the example provided in the supplementary_information shows how the sapa tool can extract sequences with properties derived from o glycosylated peptides often only a few experimentally confirmed example sequences are available similar sequences when extracted can be experimentally_investigated for more information which allows a new and better informed round of sequence retrieval by the sapa tool for example mass_spectrometric of fragmented peptide ions provides quantitative information on their amino_acid via their immonium ions this information can be used to extract the respective subset of sequences resulting in higher confidence_levels for peptide_identification more usage examples and references for them are described in section of the supplementary data
