mobyle snap workbench a web_based analysis portal for population_genetics and evolutionary genomics previously we developed the stand alone snap workbench toolkit that integrated a wide_array of bioinformatics_tools for phylogenetic and population_genetic we have now developed a web_based portal front end using the mobyle portal framework which executes all of the programs available in the stand alone snap workbench toolkit on a high performance linux cluster additionally we have expanded the selection of programs to over tools including population_genetic genome_assembly and analysis tools as well as metagenomic and large_scale phylogenetic_analyses the mobyle snap workbench web_portal allows end_users to i execute and manage otherwise complex command_line programs ii launch multiple exploratory_analyses of parameter rich and computationally_intensive methods and iii track the sequence of steps and parameters that were used to perform a specific analysis analysis_pipelines or workflows for population_genetic metagenomic and genome_assembly provide automation of data conversion analysis and graphical visualization for biological inference availability the mobyle snap workbench portal is freely_available online at http snap hpc ncsu edu the xmls can be downloaded at http carbonelab org system files snap xmls tgz each xml provides links to help files online documentation and sample data previously we developed the snap workbench toolkit that integrated phylogenetic and population_genetic and made complicated sets of program functions settings and parameters accessible and transparent to the user the snap workbench provided a graphical_user for command_line programs and a workflow to guide the user on the assumptions and limitations of the methods that test for population_differentiation although useful for methods based on summary_statistics and simple evolutionary_models further insights into the magnitude and direction of evolutionary_forces required the use of coalescent andbayesian methods that are parameter rich and frequently computationally_intensive this translated into long computational times often requiring several days or weeks particularly for larger datasets and complex models that included migration and recombination also restrictive was the large parameter_space that must be examined for complex phylogeographic models to ensure reliable and accurate parameter_estimation in practice this requires performing multiple separate independent simulations which is prohibitive on a single standalone machine to overcome_these we have migrated our stand alone snap workbench to a web_based that allows for execution on a high performance linux cluster this eliminates the need to provide multi_platform installations of the workbench and has allowed us to expand our repertoire of tools to include large_scale phylogenetic_analyses metagenomics genome_assembly and comparative_analyses and an enriched population_genetic toolkit see supplementary next_generation ngs_reads or metagenomic_data because these files are typically multiple gigabytes in size and require several consecutive pre_processing in this case each workflow can be scripted into a single xml eliminating the transfer of intermediate metadata over the network a formal description of the xml grammar https projets pasteur fr projects mobyle wiki is available on the mobyle project website although there is currently no mechanism in mobyle for browsing files on the server the path to files can be specified in the xml we provide a tool for uploading large data_files using the velocity service https velocity ncsu edu hosted at nc state_university users that set up a local instance of the portal can also upload ngs data_files via sftp using clients such as cyberduck for mac http cyberduck ch and winscp for windows http winscp net eng index php the workflows track all metadata from original source data to final results thereby ensuring that data_recording and analysis are explicitly traceable
