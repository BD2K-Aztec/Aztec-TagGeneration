braker unsupervised rna_seq based genome_annotation with genemark et and augustus motivation gene_finding in eukaryotic_genomes is notoriously_difficult to automate the task is to design a work flow with a minimal set of tools that would reach state of the art performance across a wide_range of species genemark et is a gene prediction_tool that incorporates rna_seq into unsupervised training and subsequently generates ab_initio gene predictions augustus is a gene finder that usually requires supervised training and uses information from rna_seq in the prediction step complementary strengths of genemark et and augustus provided motivation for designing a new combined tool for automatic gene prediction results we present braker a pipeline for unsupervised rna_seq based genome_annotation that combines the advantages of genemark et and augustus as input braker requires a genome_assembly file and a file in bam format with spliced alignments of rna_seq to the genome first genemark et performs iterative training and generates initial gene structures second augustus uses predicted genes for training and then integrates rna_seq read information into final gene predictions in our experiments we observed that braker was more accurate than maker when it is using rna_seq as sole source for training and prediction braker does not require pre trained parameters or a separate expert prepared training step availability_and braker is available for download attranscriptome sequencing_data rna_seq aligned to a genome_sequence have great_potential to improve the accuracy of structural genome_annotation spliced alignments may indicate intron_positions and coverage increase and decrease along genomic_sequence may indicate locations of exon noncoding region borders nevertheless rna_seq coverage alone is no reliable_indicator of protein_coding the prediction of protein_coding in genomes is often accomplished by tools that use statistical_models some gene prediction_tools can additionally use rna_seq to improve prediction_accuracy statistical_models used in gene prediction usually require a training step to identify species specific parameters for many tools including augustus the training has to be performed on a set of example genes in the past training_sets have often been produced with help of expressed_sequence ests or protein data and sometimes have been subject to validation by experts with the rapidly_growing number of novel sequenced_genomes this approach becomes infeasible fast and fully_automated training methods ideally using the nowadays often available rna_seq can provide significant advantages in principle rna_seq can be assembled into longer contigs such contigs can be used similarly to est data both in training of gene_finders and in the prediction step one of the tools that follow this idea is the maker pipeline however the rna_seq genome_annotation assessment project rgasp has shown that transcriptome_assembly is prone to errors to avoid transferring assembly errors into gene prediction it is advantageous to use the transcript information contained in unassembled mapped_reads we have developed braker a pipeline that combines the complementary strengths of two gene prediction_tools genemarket incorporates unassembled rna_seq into unsupervised training and subsequently generates ab_initio gene predictions a subset of genes predicted by genemark et are used to train augustus augustus lacks an unsupervised training_procedure and requires a good training_set additionally augustus incorporates information derived from mapped unassembled rna_seq into the prediction step in rgasp augustus was one of the most accurate tools for predicting protein_coding with rna_seq support we report accuracy results for braker on four model_organisms and compare to the accuracy of maker recently published codingquarry a pipeline for rna_seq assembly supported training and gene prediction but recommend its application only to fungi therefore we include codingquarry into the comparison on schizosaccharomyces_pombe
