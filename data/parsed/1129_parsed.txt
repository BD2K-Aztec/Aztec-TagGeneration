comrad detection of expressed rearrangements by integrated analysis of rna_seq and low coverage genome sequence_data motivation comrad is a novel algorithmic framework for the integrated analysis of rna_seq and whole_genome wgss data for the purposes of discovering genomic_rearrangements and aberrant transcripts the comrad framework leverages the advantages of both rna_seq and wgss data providing accurate classification of rearrangements as expressed or not expressed and accurate classification of the genomic or non genomic origin of aberrant transcripts a major benefit of comrad is its ability to accurately identify aberrant transcripts and associated rearrangements using low coverage genome data as a result a comrad analysis can be performed at a cost comparable to that of two rna_seq experiments significantly_lower than an analysis requiring high coverage genome data results we have applied comrad to the discovery of gene_fusions and read throughs in prostate_cancer cell_line c a derivative of the lncap cell_line with androgen_independent characteristics as a proof_of we have rediscovered in the c data of the fusions previously_identified in lncap we also identified six novel fusion_transcripts and associated genomic breakpoints and verified their existence in lncap suggesting that comrad may be more sensitive than previous methods that have been applied to fusion discovery in lncap we show that many of the gene_fusions discovered using comrad would be difficult to identify using currently available techniques availability a c and perl implementation of the method demonstrated in this article is available athigh throughput sequencing of cdna rna_seq is rapidly accelerating our understanding of the sequence content of the human_transcriptome rna_seq can be used for high_throughput quantification of transcript_abundance as has been done previously using microarrays however microarray based_approaches require pre_existing knowledge of the transcriptome sequence rna_seq in contrast can be used for de_novo characterization of the transcriptome including unbiased discovery and nucleotide level characterization of novel transcripts compared to previous sanger_sequencing based_approaches for discovering novel transcripts rna_seq is higher throughput for lower cost applied to cancer_genomics rna_seq can be employed for the discovery of novel aberrant transcripts with implications for cancer_biology used rna_seq to rediscover known gene_fusions in chronic myelogenous leukaemia cml and prostate cell_lines and also discovered novel gene_fusions in prostate tumours similarly applied rna_seq to the discovery of gene_fusions in melanoma used a newly_developed called fusionseq to discover gene_fusions in rna_seq from prostate tumours anddeveloped peralign and used it to discover gene_fusions in breast_cancer the general_methodology used by all of these studies was the paired_end method i rna_seq is used to sequence both ends of a set of cdna_fragments ii the resulting sequence pairs are aligned to the reference_genome or transcriptome iii a chimeric transcript will produce chimeric fragments and those chimeric fragments will produce a pair of sequences paired_end that align to different genes thus any paired_end for which one end aligns to one gene and the other end aligns to another gene is considered potential evidence of a gene_fusion despite the aforementioned methodological advances and associated discoveries accurate prediction of gene_fusions from rna_seq remains a difficult problem the large amount of sequence_data produced by high_throughput and the complexity of the transcriptome make rna_seq difficult_to high expression levels combined with sequencing_errors and novel splicing produce many sequence pairs that appear to have been produced from chimeric fragments furthermore the reverse transcription step used to produce cdna has been shown to produce chimeric fragments via the process of template switching previous_studies dealt with false_positives produced by false chimeric fragments with the application of heuristic filters another common practise was to discard paired_end with multiplepage comrad provides the first accurate computational_method for simultaneous analysis of rna_seq and low coverage wgss data for the purposes of identifying fused genes and for differentiating fusions of genomic origin from those fusions that are non genomic i e co transcription of adjacent genes or trans splicing_events we have used the c data and a theoretical_analysis to show that comrad is able to discover fusions that other methods would not be capable of discovering given the same data the advantages of comrad are fold first comrad is able to leverage unambiguous wgss data in order to correctly identify a fusion_transcript supported by multi map rna_seq and visa versa second comrad is able to accurately identify genomic_rearrangements that result in gene_fusions even if that genomic rearrangement is supported by only one wgss read this second advantage means that genomic_rearrangements producing gene_fusions can be accurately_identified in low coverage genome data i e a comrad analysis can be performed for roughly twice the cost of an rna_seq experiment as a proof_of we have shown that we are able to rediscover in the c data of fusions previously_identified in the closely_related cell_line lncap we then successfully validated the fusion_transcripts and rearrangement breakpoints for of the page
