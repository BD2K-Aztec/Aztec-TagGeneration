identifying cancer related micrornas based on gene_expression data downloaded from motivation micrornas mirnas are short non_coding that play_important in post_transcriptional regulations as well as other important biological_processes recently accumulating_evidences indicate that mirnas are extensively involved in cancer however it is a big_challenge to identify which mirnas are related to which cancer considering the complex processes involved in tumors where one mirna may target hundreds or even thousands of genes and one gene may regulate multiple_mirnas despite integrative_analysis of matched gene and mirna_expression data can help identify cancer associated mirnas such kind of data is not commonly available on the other hand there are huge amount of gene_expression data that are publicly_accessible it will significantly improve the efficiency of characterizing mirnas function in cancer if we can identify cancer mirnas directly from gene_expression data results we present a novel computational framework to identify the cancer related_mirnas based solely on gene_expression without requiring either mirna_expression data or the matched gene and mirna_expression data the results on multiple cancer datasets show that our proposed method can effectively_identify cancer related_mirnas with higher_precision compared with other popular approaches furthermore some of our novel predictions are validated by both differentially_expressed and evidences from literature implying the predictive_power of our proposed method in addition we construct a cancer mirna_pathway network which can help explain how mirnas are involved in cancer availability_and the r code and data_files for the proposed method are available at http comp sysbio org mir path contact micrornas mirnas as a large family of gene_regulators are involved in various biological_processes such as cell development proliferation differentiation and apoptosis specifically they play_essential in regulating gene_expression after the genes are transcribed where one mirna may regulate multiple genes it was found that more than of the protein_coding in the human_genome are regulated by mirnas recently accumulating_evidences indicate that mirnas are extensively involved in tumors for example mir induces invasion and metastatic capacity in colon cancer_cells while mir up regulation and let a down_regulation can be used to predict the poor_survival of lung_cancer patients in past_years the impact of mirnas on various cancers has been determined with biological_experiments unfortunately it is not feasible to detect all cancer associated mirnas in laboratory due to the wide_range in which the mirnas are involved recently some computational_approaches have been proposed to predict cancer related_mirnas for example some statistical_approaches have been developed to detect mirnas that are differentially_expressed between normal and cancer samples and these mirnas are considered related to cancer however few of such mirna_expression data are available compared with the huge amount of mrna_expression data furthermore the noise inherited in the expression data makes_it to detect the differentially_expressed considering mirnas are regulators of gene_expression and the aberrant gene_expression might lead to certain diseases some methods have been proposed to predict disease associated mirnas based on the mirna gene_regulation circuit nevertheless it is not an easy task to identify cancer related_mirnas based only on their target_genes as one mirna may target hundreds or even thousands of genes while one gene may be regulated by multiple_mirnas furthermore the lack of context information about the regulation also degrades the performance of such approaches under the circumstances some approaches have been developed to predict cancer related_mirnas by investigating matched gene and mirna_expression data as well as mirna gene regulations unfortunately the scarceness of matched mirna and gene_expression limits the application of this promising approach compared with the rare matched mirna and gene_expression there are huge_amounts of gene_expression that are publicly_available which can help provide insights into the functions of their mirna regulators in this work we propose a novel computational framework to identify cancer associated mirnas based on their target_genes expression_profiles as well as the mirna gene regulation_network assuming that mirnas are related to cancers by regulating the pathways in which their target_genes are located we respectively identify sets of mirnas related to lung_cancer colon_cancer breast_cancer and gastric_cancer the benchmarking results demonstrate the higher accuracy of our proposed method compared with other popular approaches the high consistency between results on independent distinct datasets for the same cancer type implies the robustness of our proposed method furthermore part of our novel predictions are validated by both differentially_expressed and evidences from literature indicating the predictive_power of our approach in addition the pathways regulated by cancer associated mirnas can help explain how mirnas are involved in the initiation and progression of cancers the mirnas are important regulators of gene_expression the aberrant function of which may drive the initiation and development of cancer however the global cancer mirna association landscape is far from complete and only a limited number of mirnas are knownrelated to cancer which hinders the development of mirna based therapeutic_strategies in literature some computational_approaches have been developed to detect which mirnas are associated with which cancer_types among which the integrative_analysis of matched gene and mirna_expression is one of the most promising approaches unfortunately the matched gene and mirna_expression are not commonly available on the other hand the large amount of public accessible gene_expression data provides an alternative way to investigate the associations between mirnas and cancers in general the existing_approaches utilize the predicted mirna gene regulations to identify the cancer associated mirnas whereas the noise in the regulation relationship as well as the lack of the context information about these regulations may degrade the performance of those promising approaches in this work we developed a novel framework to identify cancer mirnas based on gene_expression data and mirna gene regulations unlike existing_approaches we proposed a new technique to filter out those noisy and false regulations based on gene_expression data and detected cancer mirnas the benchmark results on four distinct cancer datasets demonstrate the predictive_power of our proposed method and the good performance on multiple independent datasets for the same cancer type indicates the robustness of the proposed approach furthermore among our predicted cancer mirnas some of them have been reported in literature and some are found to be differentially_expressed based on independent mirna_expression datasets which validate our predictions to some extent with a cancer mirna association_network constructed here we also detected some pancancer mirnas and cancer_type mirnas thereby providing insights into the mechanism of cancers in particular we identified the pathways regulated by cancer mirnas which can help explain how mirnas are involved in cancers the good performance of our proposed approach attributes to the removal of noisy interactions between mirnas and genes in this work we detected the context specific target_genes of mirnas with the assumption that they will fluctuate together if they were regulated by the same mirna s however that is not the case if two genes are respectively regulated by two sets of mirnas while share few mirnas where we can only detect the major regulators of these genes the integrative_analysis of matched mirna and gene_expressions has shown to be promising approach in determining the mirna gene regulations we believe the performance of our proposed approach will be significantly_improved if such kind of data could be integrated in our framework in the future in addition we only considered around mirnas here but there are more than human mature_mirnas recorded in mirbase now our approach can be easily extended to the new mirnas as long as their target_genes are available with more information about mirnas as well as their target_genes emerging more cancer mirnas are believed to be discovered in the future
