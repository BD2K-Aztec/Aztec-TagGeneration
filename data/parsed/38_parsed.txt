sequence_analysis acceleration of short and long dna read_mapping without loss of accuracy using suffix_array hpg aligner applies suffix_arrays for dna read_mapping this implementation produces a highly_sensitive and extremely fast mapping of dna_reads that scales up almost linearly with read_length the approach presented here is faster over for long_reads and more sensitive over in a wide_range of read_lengths than the current state of the art mappers hpg aligner is not only an optimal alternative for current sequencers but also the only solution available to cope with longer_reads and growing throughputs produced by forthcoming sequencing_technologies availability_and https github com opencb hpg aligner among the many applications of the high_throughput hts technologies dna resequencing is probably the most extensively used because of its important clinical_implications the most time consuming step in hts data_processing is the mapping_process for which many tools are already available however while accuracy of short_reads mapping_process is quite reasonable speed still remains to be an issue and moreover given the way in which available mappers implement current state of the art mapping algorithms such as burroughs wheeler transform accuracy usually falls down as read_length increases because of the accumulation of errors therefore there is an obvious need of new approaches that overcome these current and future problems given that the trend in hts technologies is to increase read_length and throughput suffix_array sa has recently started to be applied to accelerate dna or rna read_mapping here we propose an approach based on sa that enormously increases the mapping speed without sacrificing accuracy for an ample range of read_lengths we have compared the proposed aligner to the most extensively used dna_seq mappers bwa a mem and bowtie benchmarks were performed in a high end machine with two hexa core intel_xeon e ghz cpus and gb of memory all executions were done using the cores available and memory use was monitored hpg aligner showed a memory peak of gb
