bambino a variant detector and alignment viewer for next_generation data in the sam bam format bambino is a variant detector and graphical alignment viewer for next_generation data in the sam bam format which is capable of pooling data from multiple source files the variant detector takes_advantage of sam specific annotations and produces detailed output suitable for genotyping and identification of somatic_mutations the assembly viewer can display reads in the context of either a user provided or automatically generated reference_sequence retrieve genome annotation_features from a ucsc genome_annotation database display histograms of non reference allele_frequencies and predict protein_coding changes caused by snps availability bambino is written in platform independent java and available from https cgwb nci nih gov goldenpath bamview documentation index html along with documentation and example data bambino may be launched online via java web start or downloaded and run locally contact edmonson nih gov the sam format along with bam its compressed equivalent is an emerging standard for efficient storage and retrieval of second generation sequencing_data and their associated mapping results reference sequence_alignment programs such as mapping and assembly with qualities maq and burrows_wheeler alignment_tool bwa support sam either directly or via conversion with samtools our program bambino can detect snps insertions_and directly from bam_files leveraging a wide_range of sam sequence annotations during the process this is an advantage over tools such as varscan which are driven from intermediate files in the sparser pileup format because sam provides an ideal interchange format it is desirable to have visualization and analysis tools that not only support sam but also can work with collections of files bambinos variant detector and assembly viewer are capable of pooling and analyzing data from multiple bam_files simultaneously dynamic pooling of to whom correspondence should be addressed bam data facilitates integrated analysis of paired_tumor samples as well as data from multiple runs or platforms and obviates the need for expensive construction of combined files for these analyses this is an advantage over programs such as magicviewer which can only work with a single file at a time to assess the accuracy of bambinos variant detector we sequenced a set of snps called from three liver_cancer samples in submission selecting candidates with a coverage depth of at least reads and a predicted minor_allele of of these snps were validated for the subset of snps having a coverage depth of reads or more of were validated we also compared bambinos predicted calls with two collections of validated variants from the cancer_genome tcga project available from its data access portal http tcgadata nci nih gov tcga in a set of somatic variants identified in next_generation data of ovarian_cancer bambino was able to detect of the same sites of the variants which were not found showed no supporting reads in the associated bam_files and showed only a single supporting read often of low quality because bam_files distributed by the tcga project are subject to replacement by updated versions it is possible we did not have the same versions used by the sequencing centers for their calls if we eliminate these sites from consideration our detection rate approaches additionally we obtained a set of seven normal samples from the tcga ovarian_cancer project which have both whole_genome next_generation and affymetrix snp_array bambino identified of heterozygous snps called from affymetrix snp_array in the equivalent whole_genome next_generation data it is important to note that these tcga dataset comparisons checked only for false_negatives because we did not perform any validation experiments in these data it is difficult to estimate a false_positive call rate validation rates generally will be heavily influenced by the settings used for variant detection and any subsequent filtering of putative sites
