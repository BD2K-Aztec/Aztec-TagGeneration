an integrated structure and system based framework to identify new targets of metabolites and known drugs motivation the inherent promiscuity of small_molecules towards protein targets impedes our understanding of healthy versus diseased metabolism this promiscuity also poses a challenge for the pharmaceutical_industry as identifying all protein targets is important to assess side_effects and repositioning opportunities for a drug results here we present a novel integrated structure and system based_approach of drug_target prediction idtp to enable the large_scale discovery of new targets for small_molecules such as pharmaceutical drugs co factors and metabolites collectively called drugs for a given drug our method uses sequence orderindependent structure alignment hierarchical_clustering and prob abilistic sequence_similarity to construct a probabilistic pocket ensemble ppe that captures promiscuous structural_features of different binding_sites on known targets a drugs ppe is combined with an approximation of its delivery profile to reduce false_positives in our cross_validation study we use idtp to predict the known targets of drugs with sensitivity_and we then predicted novel targets for these drugstwo that are of high pharmacological interest the peroxisome_proliferator and the oncogene b_cell were successfully validated through in vitro binding_experiments our method is broadly_applicable for the prediction of protein small_molecule interactions with several novel applications to biological_research and drug_development availability_and the program datasets and results are freely_available to academic users atmost metabolites and pharmaceutical drugs bind to more than one protein resulting in a phenotype composed of many molecular side_effects for the pharmaceutical_industry predicting and minimizing off target effects is important because they are the source of low efficacy and high toxicity that result in a high failure_rate of new drugs in clinical_trials recent_studies estimate that each drug on average binds to at least six known and several unknown targets thus knowledge of off target effects can help reduce drug_resistance and provide opportunities for multi_target drug_development moreover off target ligands for a given drug may inspire drug_repositioning where a drug already approved for one condition is redirected to treat another condition thereby overcoming delays and costs associated with clinical_trials and drug approval therefore predicting off target binding_sites to comprehensively understand the side_effects of drugs and exploit drug_repositioning opportunities is central for rapid costefficient drug_development in addition to drug_development identifying all cellular_targets of a given biological cofactor metabolite or other small_molecules is of great_importance for understanding cellular function and dysfunction in general e g metabolome target interactions and associated diseases finally identifying possible targets of environmental_pollutants may help us to understand and avoid health_hazards from released chemicals computational_methods to predict new targets for existing endogenous or administered small_molecule compounds are therefore of high biological and pharmacological value for simplicity we herein refer to all these compounds collectively as drugs meaning a small_molecule chemical substance with effects on a biological system these methods can be divided_into three broad categories structure based expression based and ligand based structure based_methods utilize information from drug_targets by employing binding_site similarity or molecular_docking expression based_methods exploit molecular activity perturbation signatures that result from drug activity and ligand based_methods utilize the chemical and structural_properties of a drug to discover new targets in addition to these methods previously_unknown targets for existing_drugs have also been predicted using side effect similarity genome_wide and medical_genetics recently methods that combine_information from multiple sources have been introduced and will likely become the preferred approach however because most of these methods were not benchmarked on drugs with known targets sensitivity analysis it is difficult to evaluate their success_rate to date the only studies to report a true_positive prediction rate have done so at relatively low rates and respectively moreover a high_throughput framework based on structural_information remains unavailable and current methods do not satisfactorily capture the structural flexibility of drugs that can adopt several conformations allowing them to interact differently with different targets in this study we propose a novel computational drug_target prediction method that integrates structural signatures of small_molecule compounds with their tissue delivery profiles idtp incorporates four major_developments i unlike previous methods this framework is generic and does not target a specific drug ii idtp uses the probabilistic pocket ensemble ppe to capture the promiscuous nature of different binding_pockets for the same drug iii idtp uses the approximated drug_delivery profile addp of the respective drug to predict biologically_relevant targets the drug_delivery profile ddp is defined as the distribution of drug concentrations in different tissues after circulation since such information is not directly available we approximated the ddp denoted as addp as the average of the mrna_expression of the known drug_targets in human tissues thus an addp is a vector of length iv idtp has a performance guarantee supported by i cross_validation on a benchmark_dataset ii in vitro binding_experiments and iii large_scale text_mining application of idtp allowed us to propose a novel cellular target for coenzyme a coa a novel druggable pocket and lead compound for bcl and plausible mechanistic_information for the inhibition of cyp e by trolox we have developed a computational_method to extract implicit structural signatures of a drug binding_site from an ensemble of structures of proteins to which this drug binds we showed that such a ppe can be built using as few as one structure of a drugprotein complex and a set of apo structures of other known drug binding_proteins the ppe of a given drug is constructed using sequence orderindependent alignments and a probabilistic scoring_function which allows weakly conserved but significant structural patterns of the interactions between the drug and its several target_proteins to emerge and be quantified thus our ppe is able to encode features related to promiscuous target interactions and structural flexibility of a drug the validity of ppes was confirmed by illustrating that they reliably identify known targets of the respective drugs we found that by combining a ppe with an addp as an orthogonal source of structure independent information the resulting method idtp enables large_scale prediction of novel drug_targets the challenge of identifying new drugtarget_pairs in silico has attracted significant interest from the computational community however compared with other algorithms idtp includes unprecedented features because no previous_studies have combined sequence_order independent alignment and probabilistic scoring_function to model the drugprotein interaction nor have they employed the addp to filter out false_positive most previous_studies have not assessed the performance of their methodologies by exploiting known drug_targets as we did here to validate the success_rate of ppe because other studies used considerably different datasets and their programs are not publicly_available a direct comparison among methodologies is unfortunately impossible however compared with idtp other existing_methods including conventional docking or structure_based share one or more of the following limitations i they are known to scale poorly with the size and complexity of drugs and drug binding_sites and ii their algorithms do not appropriately account for the different conformations of both drug and binding_site residues our method addresses these concerns by constructing a structural signature from a set of binding_sites instead of a single binding_site and by using a probabilistic sequence_similarity function that allows accounting for the different conformations of drugs and binding_site residues the improvement expected from this methodology is analogous to the improvement from a multiple_sequence compared to a pairwise_alignment we also incorporated the addp to identify relevant new targets the predictive_power of idtp was supported by both computational cross_validation and text_mining additionally we validated two of our predicted interactions by in vitro experiments first we showed that coa bound to hpparc lbd with an apparent k d of less than mm displaying characteristics of a neutral antagonist coa is a ubiquitous cofactor that can reach high_concentrations in eukaryotes depending on cell_type and subcellular_localization and mm in animal cytosol peroxysomes and mitochondria respectively it is therefore possible that this predicted interaction plays a currently unrecognized measured from fa titrations between fluoresceine labeled pgc nr n cornr ncor rid or s cornr smrt rid peptides and hpparc lbd in the absence of a ligand or in the presence of a a m excess and bd increasing molar excess of rosiglitazone coa or cd respectively idtp a computational drug_target prediction methodbiological role in fatty_acid signaling and metabolism idtp predicted that the coa binding_site on hpparc lbd is the receptors ligand_binding which also binds rosiglitazone and cd indeed the ligand_binding of hpparc is one of the largest among the nuclear_receptor protein_family allowing hpparc to bind a variety of ligands thus coa may trigger a conformational_change that disrupts or unsettles the binding surface of both coactivators and corepressors producing the characteristics of a neutral antagonist however we cannot strictly rule out that coa binds to the surface where coactivators and corepressors would normally bind creating competition for the binding_site second we verified another coa interaction predicted by idtp by showing that coa binds in vitro to recombinant bcl with a k d of lm the predicted coa binding_pocket on bcl is adjacent to the known binding_site for bax bh because we showed that coa binds bcl without displacing bax bh we can indeed infer non competitive_binding the predicted binding_pocket of coa is interesting for drug_design purposes because it is located adjacent to the well explored bax bh binding_pocket therefore it may provide an alternative target_site with possible synergetic effects beyond validating our computational predictions our in vitro experiments also suggest the usefulness of idtp for various applications the case of the coa hpparc illustrates how idtp might be used to reveal biologically_relevant interactions between small_molecules ligands cofactors or metabolites and cellular_proteins thus our method could help establish metabolite protein pairs for large_scale metabolic analyses or for predicting possible targets for chemical small_molecule pollutants such as bisphenols the interaction between coa and bcl illustrates how idtp could be used for drug_discovery by suggesting possible lead_compounds and novel druggable protein binding_pockets in addition idtp could provide insight into the binding mechanisms of known drugs for which the drugtarget complex has not yet been determined for example our results suggest that formic_acid binds to cyp e supplementary_file predtargets cyp e is an enzyme known to interact with more than small drugs and xenobiotic_compounds induction of cyp e has been shown to cause oxidative_stress and alcohol induced_liver in mouse_models however trolox hydroxy tetramethylchroman carboxylic_acid a drug that contains the formic_acid structure has been shown to reduce the aforementioned toxicity hence our results suggest a direct interaction between the trolox formic_acid moiety and cyp e that results in reduced_toxicity to further evaluate the usefulness of idtp for pharmaceutical purposes we identified the genetic_diseases associated with the predicted target_proteins for each drug using the databasesonline mendelian_inheritance in man and human gene_mutation database a cocitation index with high statistical_significance p was found for predicted drugtarget_pairs including coa hpparc the predicted drug_targets were associated with major human_diseases such as cancer heart problems and metabolic dysfunctions supplementary making these results a potentially valuable basis for drug_discovery and repositioning however the use of idtp for drug_repositioning in the strict sense of re using a fda_approved chemical compound remains currently limited as a relatively large set of d structures of known targets is required to construct a high_confidence ppe the rapid pace of experimental determination of protein_structures will reduce this limitation in the future
