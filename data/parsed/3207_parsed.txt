sequence_analysis ncpro seq a tool for annotation and profiling of ncrnas in srna_seq data non coding rna ncrna profiling in small_rna srna_seq ncpro seq is a stand alone comprehensive and flexible ncrna analysis_pipeline it can interrogate and perform detailed profiling analysis on srnas derived from annotated non coding_regions in mirbase rfam and repeatmasker as well as specific regions defined by users the ncpro seq pipeline performs both gene based and family based analyses of srnas it also has a module to identify regions significantly_enriched with short_reads which cannot be classified under known ncrna families thus enabling the discovery of previously_unknown ncrna or small_interfering sirna producing regions the ncpro seq pipeline supports input read sequences in fastq fasta and color_space format as well as alignment results in bam format meaning that srna raw_data from the three current major platforms roche illumina solexa and life technologies solid can be analyzed with this pipeline the ncpro seq pipeline can be used to analyze read and alignment data based on any sequenced_genome including mammals and plants availability source_code annotation files manual and online version are available at http research on small_non ncrnas has advanced tremendously over recent_years as a consequence of the widespread_adoption of small_rna srna_seq which has helped to characterize members of known srna families such as micrornas mirnas small_interfering sirnas and piwi interacting rna pirna in addition analysis of srna_seq data has led to the identification of several novel small ncrna families including heterochromatic srna small_nucleolar snorna derived rnas sdrnas transfer_rna trna derived_rna trfs transcription_initiation rnas tirnas splice_site rnas splirnas and enhancer rnas ernas given that most of the genome is transcribed further small ncrna families are still probably hidden in unannoated regions awaiting detailed exploration despite this most of the existing srna_seq analysis tools only focus on mirnas whereas some other tools are applicable to the prediction of special or general sirna loci as far as we are aware only two approachesseqcluster and dario are currently available for annotating and classifying whole srna_seq data in an unbiased way seqcluster not only carefully groups non mirna reads into units but also provides classification and annotation of unit srnas dario web_server contains both srna annotation and prediction engines but cannot be used to process repeat associated srnas owing to the size limitation of data submission furthermore these tools perform mostly gene based analyses providing information about read_mapping in each ncrna gene region however to systematically investigate small ncrna species in a given annotation family i e mirna other srnas families or repeats families profiling analyses which refers to detailed_descriptions of diverse features of read_distribution in annotation families are necessary the ncrna profiling in srna_seq ncpro seq pipeline circumvents these limitations by providing detailed information on all types of small ncrnas and identifying unannotated regions that are significantly_enriched in matching srnas to whom correspondence should be addressed the ncpro seq pipeline provides a comprehensive approach for the annotation and prediction of small ncrnas in srna_seq data the pipeline can analyse different annotation families rather than just focusing on mirnas various sequence and alignment inputs from different metazoan and plant_genomes are supported the great advantage of the pipeline over others is the capacity to perform profiling analyses of annotation families which is critically_important to investigate known small ncrna families and to define novel small ncrna families the significant regions predicted in the pipeline can be further interpreted to identify novel mirna loci and sirna clusters
