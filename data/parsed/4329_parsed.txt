solubis optimize your protein motivation protein_aggregation is associated with a number of protein_misfolding diseases and is a major_concern for therapeutic_proteins aggregation is caused by the presence of aggregation_prone regions aprs in the amino_acid of the protein the lower the aggregation propensity of aprs and the better they are protected by native interactions within the folded structure of the protein the more aggregation is prevented therefore both the local thermodynamic_stability of aprs in the native_structure and their intrinsic aggregation propensity are a key_parameter that needs to be optimized to prevent protein_aggregation results the solubis method presented here automates the process of carefully selecting point_mutations that minimize the intrinsic aggregation propensity while improving local protein_stability availability_and all information about the solubis plugin is available at http soluprotein aggregation remains a major_bottleneck in the production of many therapeutic_proteins to reduce this aggregation problem several approaches have been developed such as i generation of a fusion_protein containing a solubilizing tag ii careful formulation of the buffer or iii increasing the colloidal_stability by increasing the net_charge nowadays it is however common knowledge that aggregation is mediated by the presence of aggregation_prone regions aprs resulting in several computational_methods that can predict the aggregation tendency and therefore the effect of a mutation on protein_aggregation supplementary as none of the available methods currently takes_into protein_stability there is a need of integrating these with protein_stability predictors supplementary the solubis method is such an integration approach that selects mutations that reduce the aggregation tendency by combining both tango and the empirical forcefield foldx this combination results in a tool to guide the design of aggregation resistant protein_sequences by identifying mutations that reduce tango while respecting the thermodynamic_stability we experimentally_validated the approach by improving the solubility and abundance of both protective_antigen and alpha galactosidase unpublished results in addition we analyzed the performance of our method on published variants that increase solubility supplementary eighteen of the variants lower the aggregation tendency dtango where the other six mutations do not increase he aggregation tendency in contrast many of them do not pass our conservative criteria of respecting structural_stability ddg however for a large fraction of mutations with a ddg higher than the calculation were based on homology_models which is known to negatively_affect the performance of foldx overall out of the analyzed variants that increase solubility can be identified following the solubis method presented here butthis number increases to six out of seven if homology_models are not included therefore the use of homology_models is not recommended to obtain an accurate prediction of the effect on protein_stability for user_friendliness we here present an implementation of solubis in the yasara molecular viewer environment
