kebabs an r package for kernel_based analysis of biological_sequences kebabs provides a powerful flexible and easy to use framework for kernel_based analysis of biological_sequences in r it includes efficient implementations of the most important sequence kernels also including variants that allow for taking sequence annotations and positional_information into account kebabs seamlessly integrates three common support_vector svm implementations with a unified interface it allows for hyperparameter selection by cross_validation nested cross_validation and also features grouped cross_validation the biological_interpretation of svm models is supported by the computation of weights of sequence_patterns and prediction profiles that highlight the contributions of individual sequence_positions or sections availability_and the r package kebabs is available via the bioconductor_project the analysis of biological_sequences is a fundamental task in bioinformatics in the last two decades kernel methods have been established as an important class of sequence_analysis methods for the classification of sequences in particular support_vector svms have emerged as a sort of best practice to apply svms for sequence_analysis it is necessary to either use a vectorial representation of the sequence_data or to use sequence kernels that is positive semi definite similarity_measures for sequences the use of sequence kernels however is not limited to sequence classification for example they can also be used for regression tasks and similarity based clustering on the scientific computing platform r which is widely used in bioinformatics only the kernlab package provides a limited selection of sequence kernels this article_presents kebabs an r bioconductor_package for kernel_based sequence_analysis that is primarily focused on biological_applications compared with the shogun toolbox kebabs provides a wider selection of up to date sequence kernels and facilitates seamless interplay with r and bioconductors sequence_data packages
