crisprdirect software for designing crispr_cas guide rna with reduced off target_sites crisprdirect is a simple and functional web_server for selecting rational crispr_cas targets from an input_sequence the crispr_cas system is a promising technique for genome_engineering which allows target specific_cleavage of genomic_dna guided by cas nuclease in complex with a guide rna grna that complementarily binds to a nt targeted sequence the target sequence_requirements are twofold first the ngg protospacer adjacent motif pam sequence must be located adjacent to the target_sequence second the target_sequence should be specific within the entire_genome in order to avoid off target editing crisprdirect enables users to easily select rational target_sequences with minimized off target_sites by performing exhaustive searches against genomic_sequences the server currently incorporates the genomic_sequences of human genome_engineering is a promising technique to manipulate endogenous chromosomal_dna in a site specific_manner a novel system that employs the prokaryotic immune_defense system based on the clustered_regularly crispr and crispr associated cas protein has been reported as a prominent genome engineering_approach recent_studies utilize the rna_guided endonuclease cas from streptococcus_pyogenes and a guide rna grna which acts as a guide to define the target_site to introduce dna double_stranded break a remarkable advantage of the crispr_cas system is that the target dna_sequence is recognized by simple base_pairing complementarity by the grna thus the crispr_cas system can be programmed only by changing the grna sequence and the synthesis of the grna for targeting a specific gene is easy at low_cost however it should be a critical issue to avoid the cleavage of the unintended off target_genes since double_stranded break results in stable and heritable modification of the genome in this study we present crisprdirect http crispr dbcls jp which provides efficient selection of crispr_cas target_sites with reduced numbers of potential off target candidates crisprdirect investigates the entire_genome for perfect matches with each candidate target_sequence mer and their seed_sequence or mer flanking the pam users can also browse the detailed list of potential_off that have partial complementarity with the selected sequence the server incorporates genomic_sequences of human mouse rat marmoset pig chicken frog zebrafish ciona fruit_fly silkworm caenorhabditis_elegans arabidopsis rice
