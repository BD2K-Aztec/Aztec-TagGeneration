hubalign an accurate and efficient method for global_alignment of protein_protein motivation high_throughput have produced a large amount of proteinprotein_interaction ppi data the study of ppi_networks such as comparative_analysis shall benefit the understanding of life process and diseases at the molecular level one way of comparative_analysis is to align ppi_networks to identify_conserved or species specific subnetwork motifs a few methods have been developed for global ppi network_alignment but it still remains_challenging in terms of both accuracy and efficiency results this paper_presents a novel global_network algorithm denoted as hubalign that makes use of both network_topology and sequence homology_information based upon the observation that topologically important proteins in a ppi_network usually are much more conserved and thus more likely to be aligned hubalign uses a minimum degree heuristic_algorithm to estimate the topological and functional_importance of a protein from the global network topology_information then hubalign aligns topologically important proteins first and gradually extends the alignment to the whole network extensive tests indicate that hubalign greatly outperforms several popular_methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency especially in detecting functionally_similar proteins availability hubalign is available freely for non commercial purposes athigh throughput experimental_techniques such as yeast twohybrid and protein co immunoprecipitation have produced a large amount of proteinprotein_interaction ppi data for several organisms such as homo_sapiens and saccharomyces_cerevisiae ppi_networks contain a significant amount of information about modular_organization of cells and protein functions comparative_analysis such as alignment of ppi_networks can help identify evolutionarily_conserved pathways complexes that may be structurally or functionally_important and species specific pathways complexes and infer protein functions similar to sequence_alignment we can also align ppi_networks either locally or globally local_network lna such as networkblast mawish and alignnemo aims to find small isomorphic subnetworks corresponding to pathways and protein_complexes and thus may yield a many to many mapping between the proteins these methods search for conserved subnetworks using an alignment graph in which nodes correspond to groups of orthologous_proteins and edges to conserved interactions these methods mainly differ in building alignment graphs the definition of dense clusters and search algorithms different from lna global_network gna aims to maximize the overall match between the input networks such methods such as isorank b mawish mi_graal ghost piswap and netal are designed for pairwise_alignment while others such as networkblast graemlin and isorankn for multiple_alignment in addition to network topology_information all network_alignment excluding netal and magna make use of sequence_similarity to help improve alignment_accuracy isorank aligns two ppi_networks by exploiting the observation that two proteins are good match if their interacting_partners can match well isorankn is an extension of isorank and mainly for multiple network_alignment it applies isorank to compute the alignment score between each pair of networks and then employs a pagerank nibble algorithm to cluster all the proteins by their alignment score graemlin integrates network_topology and phylogeny information and uses a hill climbing algorithm to generate alignments mi_graal an improved version of graal integrates network topology_information such as graphlet signature and sequence_similarity to align two nodes ghost uses graph spectrum to measure the topological_similarity of proteins both mi_graal and ghost use a seedand extend strategy to build an alignment mi_graal fulfills this by solving a weighted bipartite matching while ghost by solving a quadratic problem piswap refines an alignment generated by other tools such as isorank it iteratively swaps the edges in an alignment until reaching an optimum magna uses a genetic_algorithm to search for the best alignment saraph and milenkovic milenkovic netal aligns two proteins based upon their interacting_partners current global_network methods have two major_issues one is that existing algorithms run slowly especially in aligning very large ppi_networks the other is that the alignment_accuracy is still low this motivates us to develop a new method for global_network to significantly improve both alignment_accuracy and computational_efficiency this paper_presents a novel global_network algorithm denoted as hubalign to align two ppi_networks using both network_topology and sequence homology_information based upon the observation that topologically and functionally to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an

heuristic_method to estimate the relative importance of one protein from the global network topology_information such a score reflects the topological and functional_importance of one protein in a ppi_network then we use a greedy_algorithm to align two proteins based upon the combination of their importance scores and sequence_similarity that is we align more important proteins first and then gradually less important such a procedure is more biologically_meaningful and leads to a much faster and more accurate alignment algorithm we have tested hubalign on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ppi_networks showing that hubalign greatly outperforms several popular_methods such as isorank mi_graal ghost and piswap in terms of both alignment_accuracy and running time we compare our algorithm hubalign with several popular and publicly_available global_network methods isorank b mi_graal ghost and piswap following we use the alignment produced by graal and isorank as input of piswap we do not compare hubalign with graemlin because the latter requires the knowledge of phylogenetic_relationship among species we do not compare hubalign with graal because mi_graal is an improved version of graal following kuchaievs work we evaluate network alignment_quality by five measures including edge correctness ec largest common connected subgraph lccs symmetric substructure score s functional consistency fc and average of functional_similarity afs meanwhile ec lccs and s reflect network topological_similarity of an alignment but not biological_significance fc and afs reflect biological_significance by measuring the consistency of the go gene_ontology assigned to the aligned_proteins fc and afs shall be more important metrics than ec lccs and s the alignment_accuracy of two ppi_networks depends not only on the evolutionary distance of two respective species but also on the quality of the ppi data that is the closer the two species are or the higher quality the ppis are the better alignment we may obtain edge correctness ec it is calculated as the percentage of edges in the first network that are aligned to edges in the second network here we assume the first network is smaller than the second one let v e and v e denote two networks under alignment where v and e denote nodes and edges respectively and g v v be an alignment mathematically ec is defined as follows symmetric substructure score s the intuition underlying s is to penalize the alignments that map sparse regions of the network to denser ones and vise versa saraph and milenkovic milenkovic let gv denote the induced subnetwork of g with node set v and eg denote the edge set oflargest common connected subgraph lccs it is calculated as the number of edges in the largest connected subgraph in an alignment larger and denser subgraphs give more insight into common topology of the network in addition the larger and denser subgraphs may be more biologically_important as bader and spirin have shown that a dense ppi subnetwork may correspond to a vital protein complex functional consistency fc we use go gene_ontology to measure the functional consistency of two aligned_proteins go terms describe some biological_properties of a protein such as cellular_component cc molecular_function mf and biological_process bp we exclude root go terms from the analysis proteins with similar go terms are supposed to be functionally_similar to analyze the biological_significance of an alignment we calculate the fraction of aligned_proteins sharing_common go terms the fraction is calculated with respect to the size of the smaller network because in a global_alignment all nodes of smaller network are aligned to nodes of larger network the larger the fraction the more biologically_meaningful the alignment is average of functional_similarity afs it is calculated based on the semantic_similarity of the go terms which depends on the distance between them in the ontology we can use semantic_similarity to calculate the functional_similarity in each category of bp mf and cc schlickers similarity based on the resnik ontological similarity is one of the best performing methods for computing the functional_similarity between proteins let s c u v denote the go functional_similarity of proteins u and v in category c i e bp mf or cc afs is defined as follows this paper has presented a new method hubalign for global_alignment of two ppi_networks by making use of topological importance of proteins in a ppi_network we have implemented and tested hubalign using quite a few ppi_networks and evaluated the resultant alignments using different performance_metrics we have also compared hubalign with currently popular global network_alignment such as isorank migraal netaal ghost and piswap experimental_results indicate that our algorithm greatly outperforms the others in terms of both alignment_accuracy and running time in particular our algorithm can align many more functionally_similar proteins
