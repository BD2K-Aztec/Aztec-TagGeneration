sequence_analysis protter interactive protein feature visualization and integration with experimental proteomic_data the ability to integrate and visualize experimental proteomic evidence in the context of rich protein feature annotations represents an unmet need of the proteomics community here we present protter a web_based that supports interactive protein data analysis and hypothesis_generation by visualizing both annotated sequence_features and experimental proteomic_data in the context of protein topology protter supports numerous proteomic file_formats and automatically integrates a variety of reference protein annotation sources which can be readily extended via modular plug_ins a built in export function produces publication quality customized protein illustrations also for large_datasets visualizations of surfa ceome datasets show the specific utility of protter for the integrated visual_analysis of membrane_proteins and peptide selection for targeted_proteomics availability_and the protter web_application is available atvisualization of features within biological_sequences is essential for integrated analysis and interpretation of experimental sequencing_data software solutions to visualize nucleic_acid such as genomic_dna in the context of rich feature annotations e g genes promoters and experimental_evidence e g rna_seq have become indispensable research_tools for interactive data analysis and hypothesis_generation prominent examples_include the ucsc_genome and igv in contrast only few tools support the visualization of protein features such as post_translational ptms or protein_domains within the context of a proteins topology andlike the examples abovedown to single_residue resolution these include rbde tmrpres d and topo http www sacs ucsf edu topo importantly none of these tools integrates experimental proteomic_data in an automated fashion see supplementary table s andfor a detailed comparison to exploit the unique insights into protein_structure and function that experimental proteomic_data provide tools are needed that would allow for their integrated visualization interactive analysis and hypothesis_generation for membrane_proteins which carry out many essential cellular_functions and represent more than half of all current drug_targets taking_into the topology is particularly important protter is an interactive and customizable web_based application that enables the integration and visualization of both annotated and predicted protein sequence_features together with experimental proteomic evidence for peptides and ptms onto the transmembrane topology of a protein it allows users to choose from numerous annotation sources integrate own proteomics data_files select best suited peptides for targeted quantitative_proteomics applications and export publication quality illustrations the protter web_application enables users to generate custom protein feature visualizations right in their browser by following four easy steps i a uniprot identifier or a protein_sequence is specified ii the proteins transmembrane topology is defined iii various protein features e g ptms secondary_structure sequence_motifs custom regions of interest etc see supplementaryfor supported annotation sources are highlighted iv additional options for the visualization are set selected_features are highlighted in the residue based protein diagram by varying four parameters the color of the amino_acid letter the shape of the amino_acid symbol the symbols frame color and the symbols background color as protter chooses appropriate default_settings automatically all but the first step are optional the interactive_visualization of the chosen protein is displayed freely scalable in the browser an online help guides the user through all steps and provides documentation on underlying annotation sources and technologies used a distinctive key feature of protter is the ability to overlay experimental proteomic_data either from individual experiments result files of peptideprophet proteinprophet mascot maxquant and skyline are supported or large data collections like peptideatlas identified proteins peptides and ptms can be inspected individually in the browser and a combined visualization of all proteins can be downloaded as one pdf document or as zip archive of separate files protter supports several common usage scenarios such as the visual_inspection of a proteins transmembrane topology the integrated assessment of both predicted and experimental peptide and ptm evidence the generation of publication quality figures and a wide_range of specific applications in proteomics research protter supports targeted proteomic approaches like selected_reaction srm which are based on selection of peptides that unambiguously identify and reproducibly quantify a specific protein of interest through integrated visualization of protease cleavage_sites peptide evidence classes previously experimentally_identified peptides e g from peptideatlas unipep n glycoprotein srmatlas transmembrane_regions and any known ptm or sequence variant suitable peptide candidates can be visualized and selected intuitively before the actual and after the proteomic experiment see supplementary to facilitate this process protter is supported via a plug in from the leading targeted_proteomics software environment skyline see supplementary proteomic evidence from surfaceome research generates glycopeptide derived topological_constraints where visualization using protter aids in the better prediction and validation of the actual transmembrane topology of cell_surface proteins see supplementary ligand based receptor capture lrc technology allows ms based identification of receptor_proteins to orphan ligands potential receptors need to have cell surfaceexposed n glycosylation_sites within mscompatible tryptic_peptides to be identifiable using a protter visualization one can judge at a glance whether a potential receptor will be amenable to lrc technology phosphorylation_site identifications from phosphoproteomic screens can be visualized in the context of annotated phosphorylation_sites as well as known protein_kinase sequence_motifs giving a direct hint on a proteins potential role in the cell signaling_network experimentally_identified peptides from large_datasets can be easily visualized via the web_interface as demonstrated in a combined pdf supplementary of plots visualizing proteins with predicted transmembrane_domains from the first complete membrane proteome described this big dataset was visualized in only a couple of minutesless than it takes to create a single protein plot using any of the other tools
