systems_biology topology of functional_networks predicts physical binding of proteins motivation it has been recognized that the topology of molecular_networks provides information about the certainty and nature of individual interactions thus network_motifs have been used for predicting missing links in biological_networks and for removing false_positives however various different measures can be inferred from the structure of a given network and their predictive_power varies depending on the task at hand results herein we present a systematic_assessment of seven different network_features extracted from the topology of functional genetic_networks and we quantify their ability to classify interactions into different types of physical protein associations using machine_learning we combine features based on network_topology with non network_features and compare their importance of the classification of interactions we demonstrate the utility of network_features based on human and budding_yeast networks we show that network_features can distinguish different sub types of physical protein associations and we apply the framework to fission_yeast which has a much sparser known physical interactome than the other two species our analysis shows that network_features are at least as predictive for the tasks we tested as non network_features however feature importance varies between species owing to different topological characteristics of the networks the application to fission_yeast shows that small maps of physical interactomes can be extended based on functional_networks which are often more readily available availability_and the r code for computing the network_features is available from www cellularnetworks org contactsinformation about physical proteinprotein_interactions ppis is essential for a system level understanding of complex biological_mechanisms two of the major areas of research in that respect are the discovery and interpretation of ppis a set of ppis can be represented as a network or graph where nodes represent proteins and edges represent physical binding_proteins the topology to whom correspondence should be addressed of molecular_networks contains an extra layer of information beyond the mere representation of binary interactions thus topological_properties and graph_theoretical algorithms can be used for understanding and interpreting these networks topological information is mainly used for the interpretation of ppis i e for extracting biological_information based on network_topology proteins have been assessed for their association with a given disease or functionally_related modules have been extracted hua milenkovicmilenkovic and in addition to interpretation ppi network_topology is also used for discovering new interactions features derived from network_topology have been used for improving the quality of ppis obtained by high_throughput such as yeast_two y h or co purification_methods followed by affinity_purification mass_spectrometry ap ms ppi_networks are improved either by eliminating false_positive edges or by complementing the network by adding undetected interactions for example friedel and zimmer used minimum spanning trees msts to infer the topology of direct binding in protein_complexes obtained from affinitypurification assays took advantage of the fact that high_quality ppis are well modeled by geometric graphs for the de_noising of ppis they embedded the given ppi_network into a euclidian space and predicted interactions between proteins that are mapped closer than a threshold distance in the euclidian space edges in the ppi that link proteins that are distant in the embedded space were classified as false_positives others have identified protein_complexes in networks by searching for densely_connected regions all of these studies require physical ppi_networks to be available as input which is often not the case for many less studied organisms direct measurement of physical protein binding is a resource_intensive task even though high_throughput such as ap ms and y h exist however there is a large amount of data derived from other techniques such as co expression or genetic_interactions that hint at functional_associations between genes or proteins rather than physical proteinprotein binding as a result predicted functional interaction networks where functional interaction is defined as pathway co membership are readily available for many organisms in this study we investigate the possibility of using functional interaction networks to predict physical binding given a functional network it is likely that only a subset of the edges will also correspond to physical association of the proteins but only xy and yz are directly interacting we observed in such situations that if we convert strength of the functional interactions to edge_weights such that stronger interactions have smaller weights the weight xz between x and z in the functional network is often higher than xy and yz this motivates the shortest_path ratio which is xy yz xz this ratio is less than if the edges xy and yz are strong small weight compared to xz
