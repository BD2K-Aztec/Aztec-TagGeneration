systems_biology bionet an r package for the functional analysis of biological_networks motivation increasing quantity and quality of data in transcri ptomics and interactomics create the need for integrative approaches to network_analysis here we present a comprehensive r package for the analysis of biological_networks including an exact and a heuristic approach to identify functional_modules results the bionet package provides an extensive framework for integrated network_analysis in r this includes the statistics for the integration of transcriptomic and functional data with biological_networks the scoring of nodes as well as methods for network search and visualization availability the bionet package and a tutorial are available fromintegrated analysis of microarray_data in the context of biological_networks such as proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks has become a major technique in systems_biology the primary objective is the identification of functional_modules significantly_differentially subnetworks within large_networks this can be achieved by computing a score for each node in the network reflecting its functional_relevance subsequently a network search algorithm is required to find the highest scoring subgraph in fact this problem has been proven to be np_hard various heuristic approaches have been proposed most of them inspired by the seminal work fromthat used a simulated_annealing heuristic to identify highscoring subgraphs in integrated networks recently we have devised an algorithm heinz heaviest induced subgraph that computes provably optimal and suboptimal solutions to the maximal scoring subgraph mss problem in reasonable running time using integer_linear ilp in extension to this we present an r package for i integrating_multiple p values obtained from different experiments ii scoring the nodes of the network by a modular scoring_function iii calculatingwe apply our package to gene_expression data from diffuse_large dlbcl and survival data with a human ppi_network based on human protein reference_database hprd respectively then we aggregate both p values by the second order_statistics using bionet we now fit a bum model to the distribution of aggregated p values and score the nodes using an fdr threshold of the exact search algorithm can be started from r by runheinz if the cplex library is installed alternatively the fast heuristic_search algorithm runfastheinz often delivers a close approximation finally the resulting modules can be visualized in d or d bionet captures an interaction module that has been described to play major biological_roles in the gcb and abc dlbcl subtypes the combination of biological and clinical data with ppi_networks generates a meaningful biological_context in terms of functional association for differentially_expressed survival relevant_genes
