x mate a flexible system for mapping short_read accurate and complete mapping of short_read to a reference_genome greatly_enhances the discovery of biological results and improves statistical predictions we recently presented rna mate a pipeline for the recursive mapping of rna_seq with the rapid increase in genome re sequencing_projects progression of available mapping software and the evolution of file_formats we now present x mate an updated version of rna mate capable of mapping both rna_seq and dna datasets and with improved_performance output file_formats configuration files and flexibility in core mapping software
