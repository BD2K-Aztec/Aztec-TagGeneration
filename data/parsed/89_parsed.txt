a comprehensive snp and indel imputability database motivation genotype_imputation has become an indispensible step in genome_wide gwas imputation_accuracy directly influencing downstream_analysis has shown to be improved using re sequencing based reference_panels however this comes at the cost of high computational_burden due to the huge number of potentially imputable markers tens of millions discovered through sequencing a large number of individuals therefore there is an increasing need for access to imputation quality information without actually conducting imputation to facilitate this process we have established a publicly_available snp and indel imputability database aiming to provide direct access to imputation_accuracy information for markers identified by the genomes_project across four major populations and covering multiple gwas genotyping_platforms results snp and indel imputability information can be retrieved through a user_friendly interface by providing the id s of the desired variant s or by specifying the desired genomic_region the query results can be refined by selecting relevant gwas genotyping plat form s this is the first database providing variant imputability information specific to each continental group and to each genotyping platform in filipino individuals from the cebu longitudinal health and nutrition survey our database can achieve an area under_the of and for markers with minor_allele and respectively specifically by filtering out of markers cor responding to a reduction of up to in computational costs for actual imputation based on the imputability information in our database we can remove and of the poorly imputed markers at the cost of only and of the well imputed markers with minor_allele and respectively genotype_imputation has proven to be a powerful_tool in genome_wide gwas by facilitating fine_mapping and the merging of datasets from different genotyping_platforms it is a way to predict genotypes computationally based on linkage_disequilibrium patterns instead of obtaining genotypes by laboratorybased procedure as it has been shown to directly affect downstream_analysis imputation_accuracy needs to be taken into consideration when designing and performing gwas for instance at the study_design stage a question of interest would be which commercially_available genotyping platform can provide the optimal imputation quality genome_wide or in certain genomic_region s of interest such a question can be answered by assessing the imputation_accuracy of relevant variants however there has been no resource available to provide variant imputability information without actually performing imputation a commonly used evaluation method is to mask a subset of markers impute their dosages and compare those dosages with the true masked genotypes for those markers this method however can only be used after genotypes have already been obtained and therefore cannot help guide study_design decisions in addition the evaluation procedure can be computationally_costly because of the requirement of conducting imputation particularly with the emergence of reference_panels built through re sequencing_efforts to facilitate genetic_studies in the era of genomic re sequencing we have built a database containing imputation_accuracy information for snps and indels identified from the genomes_project a sequencing based reference resource which has demonstrated its potential for enhancing the power of genetic_association in the post gwas era the assessment of marker imputability was carried_out through a leave_one imputation procedure a single individual serves as the imputation target and imputation is performed using haplotypes from all the other individuals as reference imputation_accuracy was quantified within each of the four major continental groups surveyed by the genomes_project we anticipate this database containing imputation_accuracy information searchable by continental group and by gwas genotyping platform will be a useful resource for geneticists in this sequencing era
