genome_analysis rna a fast and accurate short_reads numerical aligner the advent_of sequencers hts introduced the need of new tools in order to analyse the large amount of data that those machines are able to produce the mandatory first step for a wide_range of analyses is the alignment of the sequences against a reference_genome we present a major update to our rna randomized numerical aligner tool the main_feature of rna is the fact that it achieves an accuracy greater than the majority of other tools in a feasible amount of time rna executables and source codes are freely downloadable at http iga rna sourceforge net state of the art high_throughput sequencers hts are able to produce up to million_reads of length between and bp in a single run in almost every usage of such datanotably single_nucleotide snp_calling and copy_number cnv identificationthe first analysis step consists in aligning these huge datasets against a reference_genome recently a significant number of tools able to align the htsshort reads have been proposed the main efforts in the design of such tools are on improving speed and correctness on the one we need fast tools in order to keep the pace with data production and on the other hand we need to maximize the number of correctly placed reads and to be sure to align them in every possible location usually tools sacrifice correctness over speed allowing only few mismatches between reads and reference to maximize such trade_off tools like bowtie and bwa make use of the seed andextend heuristic in order to align a read r an almost exact match of the first l r bases of the read is a necessary condition bfast moves towards favouring correctness over speed allowing alignments with a high number of mismatches and insertions_deletions indels but is one order of magnitude slower than previous tools in this work we present a major update to rna randomized numerical aligner able to align in a to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as reasonable amount of time the multitude of reads produced by hts with regard to the previous implementation the present one supports fasta and fastq input_formats as well as the sam bam output format moreover it supports the alignment of single and paired_end and it can run on both parallel and distributed architectures finally a graphical_user gui allows an easy interaction with the various components of the tool rna is a highly_accurate tool able to align_reads in the presence of extensive polymorphisms high_error and small_indels as a further contribution we introduce a new alignment classification designed to better align_reads belonging to repetitive_regions rna is mainly designed for illumina data but it can also be used with solid together with a suitable conversion from color_space or data
