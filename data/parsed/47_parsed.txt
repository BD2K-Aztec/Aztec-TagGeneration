accurate disulfide_bonding network_predictions improve ab_initio structure_prediction of cysteine_rich proteins motivation cysteine_rich proteins cover many important families in nature but there are currently no methods specifically_designed for modeling the structure of these proteins the accuracy of di sulfide connectivity pattern prediction particularly for the proteins of higher_order connections e g bonds is too low to effectively assist structure assembly simulations results we propose a new hierarchical order reduction protocol called cyscon for disulfide_bonding prediction the most confident disulfide_bonds are first identified and bonding prediction is then focused on the remaining cysteine_residues based on svr training compared with purely machine_learning based_approaches cyscon improved the average_accuracy of connectivity pattern prediction by for proteins with more than disulfide_bonds cyscon improved the accuracy by on the benchmark set of pdbcys when applied to non redundant cysteine_rich proteins cyscon predictions helped increase or decrease the tm_score or rmsd of the ab_initio quark modeling by or this result demonstrates a new avenue to improve the ab_initio structure modeling for cysteine_rich proteins availability_and the methods of protein_structure can generally be grouped into template based and template free or ab_initio modeling since the topology of the protein_structure can be decided by the contact_maps many efforts have been dedicated to predicting residue residue_contacts in the template_based where homologous templates can be detected from the pdb residue_contacts can be reliably derived from the template structures but for the ab_initio modeling targets that do not have homologous templates the contact_information must be predicted from sequence either by feature_based training or correlated_mutations in the th casp critical assessment of proteinstructure prediction experiment the modeling of several new fold targets reached an unprecedented_resolution due to the successful integration of the ab_initio contact predictions however except for the targets that have a high number of homologous_sequences which can be used for detecting the conserved mutations and contacts the accuracy of ab_initio contact predictions is in general too low to be useful for d structure_determination one feasible improvement is to decompose the contact_map into different types of contacts that can be predicted more reliably such as disulfide_bonds disulfide_bonds are formed between cysteine_residues which are the only coded amino_acids that have a reactive sulfhydryl_group this type of residue interaction can be formed between residues from either the same or different polypeptide_chains which usually induces long_range along the protein_sequence it has been widely_acknowledged that the longrange contacts are crucial to protein_structure modeling because they constrain the possible conformations and reduce the entropy of unfolded_states thus accurate prediction of the disulfide_bonding network should improve ab_initio protein_structure disulfide_bonds are important for protein_function and structural_stability for instance the formation of disulfide_bonds is a key posttranslational_modification in numerous proteins in dual oxidase proteins disulfide_bonds contribute importantly to proteinprotein_interactions previous_studies have revealed that incorrectly formed disulfide_bonds can be deleterious to both the function and stability of some proteins due to the importance of disulfide_bonds in both protein structural and functional studies many computational_methods have been developed for predicting their connectivity patterns from protein_sequence with the aim to identify the correct bonding of oxidized cysteine_residues this problem was first addressed via maximum_weight perfect matching where the weight of each edge is equivalent to the contact potential between the two cysteine_residues which was derived by montecarlo simulated_annealing following this work considerable efforts were devoted to machine_learning ab_initio approaches to predict the contact potential for improving the performance progress in this regard focuses on two directions i developing more powerful prediction_algorithms e g neural_network nn support_vector svm kernel method correlated mutation analysis and support_vector svr ii introducing novel feature representations besides traditional global and local sequence derived features recent_studies that some features such as protein subcellular_localization correlated_mutations and context based features can also improve the performance in addition feature_selection such as fisher score were proposed to overcome the high_dimensional problems and improve the prediction different from the above ab inito approaches which perform predictions by only using the amino_acid sequence_information the other trend is using the homology_modeling techniques where some prediction features are extracted from the modeled structures for instance the spatial distance between the cysteine_residues in the modeled structure can be used as an encoding feature other studies in this trend include lin and tseng and o despite this type of methods is promising considering the rapid increase of the deposited d structures in pdb which may increase the possibility of finding good templates they may still fail for large portion of proteins which cannot find good templates in current pdb this study aims to further enhancing the disulfide_bonds prediction by using only the amino_acid sequence_information although existing_methods can predict disulfide connectivity patterns with reasonable accuracy there are still challenging problems that seriously limit the prediction_performance one of the biggest challenges is the high order problem sequences with more disulfide_bonds are much more difficult to predict accurately than those with fewer bonds in fact the entire pattern prediction_accuracy will be very low for sequences with more than five bonds the reason is that a disulfide connectivity pattern represents a unique correct combination of all the disulfide_bonds in the sequence and it is correct only if all the independent bonds are correctly_predicted for a sequence with bonds there will be different bond combinations c f equation where only arrangement is correct and the random prediction success_rate is the situation will be even worse for many cysteine_rich proteins which often contain more than five disulfide_bonds to this end we propose a new algorithmic improvement based on the idea of order reduction by first finding the most confident disulfide_bonds for example if we can determine confident bond from a query_sequence of high order e g bonds then the problem is reduced to finding the correct combination among remaining bonds which has only candidate patterns much less than the original it is fulfilled by an effective confident bond detector based on the observation that some disulfide_bonds are found aligned at the same positions in the multiple_sequence msa the detected confident bonds will be eliminated from the following decision_process to reduce the complexity then a maximum_weight graph_matching approach will be used to determine the remaining bonds where the weights are predicted using a statistical machine_learning predictor our hierarchical system for predicting disulfide connectivity patterns is called cysteine contact cyscon the new order reduction characteristic enables cyscon to achieve_higher prediction_accuracy than traditional approaches one challenge to the ab_initio prediction of disulfide connectivity pattern is the high order problem i e the prediction_accuracy will drop significantly with the increasing of number of disulfide_bonds the mathematical reason to the issue is that the number of possible disulfide connectivity patterns increases exponentially with the number of cyscine residues supplementary it consequently induces the high order of graph search in the maximum_weight graph_matching motivated by the straightforward idea of order reduction we developed a novel disulfide_bond predictor cyscon which successfully reduces the graph_matching order by eliminating the highly confident disulfide_bonds which are detected by a newly_designed detector the high order problem can be effectively solved by the proposed approach of this paper resulting in significant_improvement of the prediction_performance for instance on the spx dataset the residue based accuracy q c and the protein based accuracy q p in the subset of test proteins with bonds are and higher respectively when comparing the final cyscon predictor to the pure machine_learning svr method for the proteins with more than five bonds q p is two times better than the original performance on the pdbcys dataset q p is times better than the pure svr model for the proteins of bonds inspired by the improvements from sequence_alignment based order reduction we have also tried to remove the edge with the highest weight corresponding to machine_learning contact potential for comparison however the results are much worse for the protein_sequences in the spx dataset we found that q c is which is far worse than the proposed confident edge detector the reason is probably due to the noise from svr predictions which has a lower confidence than the stringent sequence_alignment derivations although the order reduction approach can improve the prediction_performance we found that the improvement depends on the detection coverage our experimental_results show that when using the big bdd as the searching pool the improvement is generally higher we will keep on updating bdd database to include the most up to date data for improving the confident bond detection success_rate which is expected to further enhance the overall prediction_accuracy for high order protein_sequences besides the high order problem inter chain disulfide_bond prediction is another important issue need to be addressed however there are few studies devoted to the problem probably due to the fact that the annotated inter chain bonds are very few in the current databases this type of bond is related to protein quaternary_structure and proteinprotein_interactions hence predicting inter chain disulfide_bonds will be an important follow_up work where similar idea of order reduction might expect to be helpful we also show that predicting reliable disulfide connectivity patterns can improve the d structure modeling of cysteine_rich proteins using quark as an example our data show that the quality of ab_initio structure predictions can be significantly_improved when adding the predicted disulfide connectivity patterns as distance_restraints this is consistent with the exciting successes on contact driven protein_structure recently observed in the casp experiment and other contact assisted structure_prediction efforts
