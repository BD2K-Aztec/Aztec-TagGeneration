genome_analysis evaluation and validation of de_novo and hybrid assembly techniques to derive high_quality genome_sequences motivation to assess the potential of different types of sequence_data combined with de_novo and hybrid assembly approaches to improve existing draft_genome results illumina and pacbio sequencing_technologies were used to generate de_novo and hybrid genome_assemblies for four different bacteria which were assessed for quality using summary_statistics e g number of contigs n and in silico evaluation_tools differences in predictions of multiple copies of rdna operons for each respective bacterium were evaluated by pcr and sanger_sequencing and then the validated results were applied as an additional criterion to rank assemblies in general assemblies using longer pacbio reads were better able to resolve repetitive_regions in this study the combination of illumina and pacbio sequence_data assembled through the allpaths_lg algorithm gave the best summary_statistics and most accurate rdna operon number predictions this study will aid others looking to improve existing draft genome_assemblies the development and evolution of next_generation ngs_platforms has dramatically changed biological studies in recent_years assembly of dna_reads to correctly reconstruct genomes is an essential task to facilitate genomic studies and a variety of assembly algorithms and methods for quality_evaluation have been developed however most sequenced_genomes are incomplete owing to technical_difficulties time and the expense leading to an increasing disparity in quality and usefulness between finished and draft_genomes in databases because of their low_cost accuracy and high_throughput illumina platforms have dominated the sequencing industry short_read sequencing_technologies have limited_power to resolve large repetitive_regions even within relatively small microbial_genomes the so_called third generation single_molecule sequencing_technology developed by pacific_biosciences pacbio has been compared with several ngs_platforms read_lengths up to kb have been reported for pacbio rs i chemistry and nearly kb for rs ii chemistry repetitive_dna such as ribosomal_dna rdna operons present one of the greatest technical_challenges during the assembly process which is exacerbated when repeat sequence_regions are longer than the read_lengths in many cases where repetitive_dna is present short_read genome_assemblies remain highly fragmented and often only achieve high_quality draft status the relative value of a finished genome technical_challenges and what is missing from finished versus draft quality genomes have been discussed previously several strategies proposed and implemented for improving genome_assemblies include the use of varying_size fragment_libraries longer length reads gap closure software and postprocessing to detect misassemblies recently draft_genome for bacteria isolated from the populus deltoides rhizosphere and endosphere were obtained using an illumina_hiseq instrument and the genomes were represented by contigs on average an additional two genomes were unsuitable for publication at that time because of high contig numbers and of the genomes contained contigs the aim of this study was to compare and select the most appropriate ngs_technology combinations assembly protocol and parameter_optimization to improve the genome_assemblies of the rhizobium sp strain cf and burkholderia sp strain bt that originally proved problematic as well as two other strains pseudomonas_sp strain gm and pseudomonas_sp strain gm of biological interest in addition to a variety of in silico techniques for evaluation of genome_assemblies a pcr and sanger_sequencing strategy was used to validate rdna operon predictions and further assess the assemblies
