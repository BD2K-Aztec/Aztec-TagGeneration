component wise gradient_boosting and false discovery control in survival analysis with high_dimensional covariates downloaded from motivation technological_advances that allow routine identification of high_dimensional risk_factors have led to high_demand for statistical_techniques that enable full utilization of these rich sources of information for genetics studies variable_selection for censored outcome data as well as control of false_discoveries i e inclusion of irrelevant variables in the presence of high_dimensional predictors present serious challenges this article develops a computationally feasible_method based on boosting and stability_selection specifically we modified the component wise gradient_boosting to improve the computational feasibility and introduced random permutation in stability_selection for controlling false_discoveries results we have proposed a high_dimensional variable_selection method by incorporating stability_selection to control false discovery comparisons between the proposed method and the commonly used univariate and lasso approaches for variable_selection reveal that the proposed method yields fewer false_discoveries the proposed method is applied to study the associations of common single_nucleotide snps with overall survival among cutaneous_melanoma cm patients the results have confirmed that brca pathway snps are likely to be associated with overall survival as reported by previous_literature moreover we have identified several new fanconi_anemia fa pathway snps that are likely to modulate survival of cm patients availability_and the related source_code and documents are freely_available atrapid advances in technology that have generated vast_amounts of data from genetic or genome studies have led to a high_demand for developing powerful statistical_learning methods for extracting information effectively for instance understanding clinical and pathophysiologic heterogeneities among subjects at risk and designing_effective treatment for appropriate subgroups is one of the most active areas in genetic_studies wide heterogeneities present in patients response to treatments or therapies understanding such heterogeneities is crucial in personalized_medicine and discovery of genetic_variants offers a feasible approach however serious statistical challenges arise when identifying real predictors among hundreds of thousands of candidates and an urgent need has emerged for the development of effective algorithms for model_building and variable_selection the last three decades have given rise to many new statistical_learning methods including cart random_forest neural_networks svms and high_dimensional regression boosting has emerged as a powerful framework for statistical_learning it was originally introduced in the field of machine_learning for classifying binary outcomes and later its connection with statistical estimation was established byproposed a gradient_boosting framework for regression settings b hlmann andproposed a component wise boosting procedure based on cubic smoothing splines for l loss functions b hlmann demonstrated that the boosting procedure works well in high_dimensional settings for censored outcome data ridgeway applied boosting to fit proportional_hazards and li and luan developed a boosting procedure for modeling potentially non linear functional_forms in proportional_hazards despite the popularity of aforementioned methods issues such as false discovery e g seletion of irrelevant snps and difficulty in identifying weak signals present further barriers simultaneous inference procedure including the bonferroni_correction has been widely used in large_scale testing literature however in many highdimensional settings such as in genetic_studies variable_selection is serving as a screening_tool to identify a set of genetic_variants for further investigation hence a small number of false_discoveries would be tolerable and simultaneous inference would be too conservative in contrast the false_discovery fdr defined as the expected proportion of false_positives among significant tests is a more relevant metric for false discovery control under the framework of variable_selection however few existing variable_selection algorithms control false_discoveries this has brought an urgent need of developing computationally_feasible methods that tackle both variable_selection and false discovery control we propose a novel high_dimensional variable_selection method for survival analysis by improving the existing variable_selection methods in several aspects first we have developed a computationally_feasible variable_selection approach for high_dimensional survival analysis second we have designed a random_sampling scheme to improve the control of the false_discovery finally the proposed_framework is flexible to accommodate complex data_structures the rest of the article is organized as follows in section we introduce notation and briefly_review the l penalized estimation and gradient_boosting method that are of direct relevance to our proposal in section we develop the proposed approach and in section we evaluate the practical utility of the proposal via intensive simulation_studies in section we apply the proposal to analyze a genome_wide of cutaneous_melanoma we conclude the article with a brief discussion in section
