structural_bioinformatics fast accurate and reliable molecular_docking with quickvina motivation the need for efficient molecular_docking tools for high_throughput is growing alongside the rapid_growth of drug fragment databases autodock vina vina is a widely used docking tool with parallelization for speed quickvina qvina then further enhanced the speed via a heuristics requiring high exhaustiveness with low exhaustiveness its accuracy was compromised we present in this article the latest_version of quickvina qvina that inherits both the speed of qvina and the reliability of the original vina results we tested the efficacy of qvina on the core_set of pdbbind with the default exhaustiveness level of vina i e a maximum of fold and an average of fold acceleration with a correlation_coefficient of for the first mode and for the sum of all modes were attained over the original vina a tendency for higher acceleration with increased number of rotatable bonds as the design variables was observed on the accuracy vina wins over qvina on of the data with average_energy difference of only kcal_mol on the same dataset gold produced rmsd smaller than a on of the data while qvina attained availability_and the c source_code of qvina is available at www qvina org autodock vinaalso referred to as vinaemploys the iterated local_search global optimizer to search for the minimum energy docking conformations subsequently quickvinareferred to as qvina hereinafterenhanced vinas computation time via heuristics that prevents unnecessary local searches as proof_of qvina needs high exhaustiveness level compared to the original vina here we present the most recent quickvinareferred to as qvina with improved reliability qvina avoids the unnecessary local searches in a similar manner to qvina in contrast to qvina however qvina misses fewer necessary local searches thanks to a new procedure to test if a randomized docked conformation is significant for local_search this improves qvina s reliability in discovering the minimum energy docking conformation the efficacy of qvina was assessed on the core_set of the release of the pdbbind dataset which contains proteinligand complexes these are considered as high_quality benchmarks for evaluating various docking scoring_methods vina qvina and qvina were first compiled on a centos release x machine with intel_xeon ghz x cpus and gb of ram the same testing methodology i e the search_space definition as well as the rmsd calculation as that observed in the original vina was adopted for each receptorligand complex in the benchmark set all three docking tools were given the same random_number seed and initialized with the same randomized ligand conformation we then explicitly set both the number of cpus available for use and the exhaustiveness level to for completeness of comparison we also docked the same receptorligand complexes using gold and dock summarizes the accelerations attained by qvina and qvina over the original vina under different numbers of active rotatable bonds in the range of summary on the complete range can be found in the supplementary_materials then shows the rmsd between the actual pdbbind conformations and the predicted ones produced by employing various docking tools defining a successful prediction as one with rmsd less than a the numbers of successes and failures of the various docking tools are summarized in the results indicate that qvina has the highest consistency with vina among the other docking tools on the accuracy against the experimental conformations dock is slightly more accurate than qvina at the expense of long computation time dock attained successes while qvina achieved meanwhile gold only had successes quickvina is a fast and accurate molecular_docking tool tested against proteinligand complexes that compose the core_set of the release of the pdbbind using default exhaustiveness level of qvina successfully attained up to fold acceleration over vina the pearsons_correlation between vinas and qvina s binding_energy was for the first predicted mode and for the sum of all predicted modes it is also witnessed that qvina is more accurate than gold and is only slightly less accurate than dock this shows that qvina has paved thefast accurate and reliable molecular_docking with quickvina way for some high_throughput and sufficiently accurate virtual_screening of molecular libraries this in turn brings great value to the fragment based computer_aided drug_design
