genome_analysis dragon tis spotter an arabidopsis derived predictor of translation_initiation sites in plants in higher_eukaryotes the identification of translation_initiation sites tiss has been focused on finding these signals in cdna or mrna_sequences using arabidopsis_thaliana a t information we developed a prediction_tool for signals within genomic_sequences of plants that correspond to tiss our tool requires only genome_sequence not expressed sequences its sensitivity_specificity is for a t for vitis_vinifera and for populus_trichocarpa which suggests that our tool can be used in annotation of different plant_genomes we provide a list of features used in our model further study of these features may improve our understanding of mechanisms of the translation_initiation availability_and our tool is implemented as an artificial_neural it is available as a web_based and together with the source_code the list of features and data used for model development is accessible at http one of the objectives of bioinformatics is to identify important biological_signals in genomic_sequences the translation_initiation tis is one such signal in mrna that denotes the start_codon at which translation initiates accurate recognition of tis signals can help in discovery of protein_coding and improve annotation of gene_loci in genomic_dna signals that correspond to tiss consist of the atg triplet of nucleotides except for the rare cases of acg or ctg triplets in this study we focus solely on the recognition of atg motifs within dna that correspond to genuine tis signals we will refer to the atg triplets as tis motifs our study addresses prediction of tis motifs in plant_species recognizing dna motifs in genomic_sequences that correspond to genuine tis signals is much more complex than recognizing them in mrna or cdna_sequences which was the main focus so_far pertea and salzberg achieved_accuracy of on both arabidopsis_thaliana a t and human genomic_sequences sparks and brendel developed metwamer tools achieving an accuracy of on a t open_reading sequences in this study using a t information we developed a model for predicting tis motifs within plant genomic dna_sequences and we generated a number of features to characterize the genomic surroundings of these motifs some of these features have already been used for related_tasks but we introduced a number of new features not previously used for tis predictions out of all the features initially considered we selected as the best set of features for the tis motif recognition task our feature_selection is based on a wrapper method that uses a genetic_algorithm ga and an artificial_neural ann there are other studies that deal with the generation and selection of features for the tis recognition for example to the best of our knowledge our tis predictor is the only publicly_available one for plants the sensitivity_specificity of our model for a t is and is the highest compared with those reported in the literature the accuracy tests on chromosomes of other plant_genomes show sensitivity_specificity for vitis_vinifera of and populus_trichocarpa of the web_based that implements our algorithm and our datasets are freely_accessible at http cbrc kaust edu sa dts
