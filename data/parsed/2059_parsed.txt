gimmemotifs a de_novo motif prediction pipeline for chip sequencing_experiments accurate prediction of transcription_factor that are enriched in a collection of sequences remains a computational challenge here we report on gimmemotifs a pipeline that incorporates an ensemble of computational_tools to predict motifs de_novo from chip sequencing chip_seq similar redundant motifs are compared using the weighted information content wic similarity_score and clustered using an iterative procedure a comprehensive output report is generated with several different evaluation metrics to compare and evaluate the results benchmarks show that the method_performs on human and mouse chip_seq gimmemotifs consists of a suite of command_line scripts that can be easily implemented in a chip_seq analysis_pipeline availability gimmemotifs is implemented in python and runs on linux the source_code is freely_available for download atthe spectacular development of sequencing_technology has enabled rapid cost efficient profiling of dna_binding chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput deep_sequencing chip_seq delivers high_resolution binding_profiles of transcription_factors tfs the elucidation of the binding_characteristics of these tfs is one of the obvious follow_up questions however the de_novo identification of dna_sequence remains a challenging computational task although many methods have been developed with varying_degrees of success no single method consistently performs well on real_biological eukaryotic data the combination of different algorithmic approaches each with its own strengths_and has been shown to improve prediction_accuracy and sensitivity over single methods here we report on gimmemotifs a motif prediction pipeline using a ensemble of existing computational_tools supplementary this pipeline has been specifically developed to predict tf motifs from chip_seq it uses the wealth of sequences binding to whom correspondence should be addressed peaks usually resulting from chip_seq to both predict motifs de_novo as well as validate these motifs in an independent fraction of the dataset gimmemotifs incorporates the weighted information content wic similarity_metric in an iterative clustering procedure to cluster similar motifs and reduce the redundancy which is the result of combining the output of different tools see_supplementary it produces an extensive graphical report with several evaluation metrics to enable interpretion of the results we present gimmemotifs a de_novo motif prediction pipeline ideally_suited to predict transcription_factor from chip_seq gimmemotifs clusters the results of several different tools and produces a comprehensive report to evaluate the predicted motifs we show that gimmemotifs performs well on biologically_relevant datasets of different tfs and compares_favorably to other methods
