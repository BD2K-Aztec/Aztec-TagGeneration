identification of drug_target interaction from interactome network with 'guilt by association' principle and topology features motivation identifying drugtarget protein interaction is a crucial step in the process of drug research and development wet_lab experiment are laborious time consuming and expensive hence there is a strong demand for the development of a novel theoretical method to identify potential interaction between drug and target protein results we use all known proteins and drugs to construct a nodes and edges weighted biological relevant interactome network on the basis of the guilt by association principle novel network_topology features are proposed to characterize interaction pairs and random_forest algorithm is employed to identify potential drugprotein interaction accuracy of derived from the fold_cross is about higher than that of the existing method we identify potential drugtarget_interactions some of which are associated with diseases such as torg winchester syndrome and rhabdomyosarcoma the proposed method can not only accurately_predict the interaction between drug_molecule and target protein but also help disease treatment and drug_discovery contacts most drugs are a class of small_molecule compounds which act by activating or inhibiting the biological_activity or function of the specific target_proteins identifying interaction between drug and target can help to not only reduce the time cost and failure_rates for new developing drug but also decipher the mechanism of drug_action and pathomechanism of disease experimental methods containing affinity_chromatography and protein microarray have been widely_adopted to identify drugtarget_interaction however these methods are ineffective in the face of massive biomolecules data with the completion of the human_genome and development of combinatorial_chemistry abundant biological and chemical data have been generated and deposited in the various database as of january the uniprotkb and chembl contain human protein entities and compound entities respectively undoubtedly it is impossible to carry out an exhaustive experiment for detecting all possible interactions between these proteins and compounds because the pairwise combinations are astronomical it motivates researchers to develop a theoretical method to not only quickly and accuratelydiscriminate the potential drugtarget_interactions but also guide experimentalists and provide_supporting for their experimental_results currently many studies show that relationship between disease and drug is far more complex than the one gene one drug one disease paradigm since proteins often interact with each other and with other molecules in cells to form an interaction_network network based researches have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate the identification of drugtarget_interaction these works generally model the drugtarget_interactions as a bipartite_graph in which vertex corresponds to either drug_molecule or target protein edge corresponds to drugtarget_interaction then various strategies are utilized to mine the bipartite_graph and predict potential drugtarget_interaction based on the known interaction in spite of the advances in bipartite_graph based_methods it is a challenge to accurately identify drugtarget_interaction the first reason is that most existing_approaches only consider the interaction of drugtarget and neglect the interaction of proteinprotein and relationship of drugdrug indeed target protein usually exerts their function by interacting with other protein rather than working alone at the cellular_level structurally different drugs can bind to the multiple_targets and express similar or identical bioactivities additionally more than one drug can be synergistically used in the treatment of diseases the second one is that bipartite_graph based_methods do not consider the false_positive of proteinprotein_interaction currently protein_protein data mainly comes from the yeast_two and affinity_purification with mass_spectrometry but the two methods usually suffer from high false_positive due to the technical limitation the third one is that drug and protein are only considered as nodes in mathematics and ignore their biological or chemical_properties in fact the interaction between drug and target is influenced by many factors such as volume shape and charge of drug compound as well as hydrophobicity polarity and tertiary_structure of target protein the fourth one is that only known targets are utilized to construct the bipartite_graph therefore they are usually unable to discover the new interaction of drugtarget excluded in the constructed network the last one is that the information of network_topology is not adopted to recognize drugtarget_interaction research of proteinprotein_interaction have shown that target_proteins usually have higher degree and betweenness_centrality than non target_proteins implying that network topology_information can be utilized to differentiate target_proteins from nontarget proteins in view of these reasons we develop a novel theoretical computation method to infer drugtarget_interaction based on the guiltby association principle and network_topology features instead of using only the bipartite network of drugtarget_interaction we construct a drugtarget interactome network containing three subnetworks of proteinprotein_interaction drugtarget_interaction and drugdrug relationship to grasp the complex interaction relationship between drug and target each node in the interactome network is weighted by using either protein primary sequence descriptors or drug molecular_structure features to characterize their attributes in the subnetwork of proteinprotein_interaction and drugdrug relationship edge is weighted based on the protein interaction probability score and the number of common target protein respectively with the use of the network topology_information we develop a novel network_topology feature_vector to characterize drugtarget_interaction the underlying assumption is guilt by association in which a target protein is likely to interact with a drug if the majority of proteins neighbors i e they can directly interact with the protein in the subnetwork of proteinprotein_interaction can interact with the drug vice_versa finally we employ random_forest rf algorithm to construct model for identifying potential drug_target interaction effectiveness and performance of the current method is evaluated against various datasets through the fold_cross and confirmed by comparing with the existing_methods and the results indicate that our method can accurately_predict the interaction between drug_molecule and target protein robustness on the false_positive proteinprotein_interaction is also confirmed based on a series of constructed protein_interaction and the corresponding drugtarget_interaction datasets success of the developed method can be attributed to three aspects firstly using interactome network supplies a comprehensive and system viewpoint to identifyof ligand db and receptor p as well as their interactions b the complex model c of ligand db and receptor q as well as their interactions d potential drugtarget_interaction and understand the interaction mechanisms secondly integrating drug molecular_structure information with target protein_sequence into a unified_framework provides further insight for the nature of the interaction between drug and protein thirdly resorting the guild by association principle opens up a new avenue to develop topology features for characterizing drugtarget_interaction pairs in the context of network the main advantages of the current approach are summarized as follows i compared with the structure based theoretical methods our method is not constrained by the d structure data of targets ii in contrast to experimental methods the developed approach only takes a few seconds to identify whether a drug_targets a protein at the proteome scale iii the proposed approach is able to identify those drugtarget_interaction pairs with low protein_sequence and drug structure similarity iv the developed method can aid in the research of drug_repositioning and drug promiscuity by recognizing an interaction between a new target protein and a known drug of course our approach also has some limitations for example it can predict only the binding between proteins and all known drugs because the constructed drugdrug relationship subnetwork only contains the drug molecules from the drugbank currently we are trying to expand the subnetwork by adding a variety of small_molecule compounds with bioactivity based on the database of bindingdb chebi and chembldb this strategy can help to discovery novel lead_compounds and drug molecules besides the negative drugtarget_interaction pair with the same size for positive pairs is used to construct dataset in order to overcome prediction biases for samples with larger_size we carry out test and the statistical results indicate that the current method is robustness for random_sampling of negative samples in fact the amount of negative samples is much higher than that of positive ones in nature it is significance to develop novel machine_learning algorithm for overcoming the problem but it is out of the scope of the current study in addition we do not take into account the mode of action of the drug_molecule due to the little database now devoted to the collection of data in future_research we will solve this problem with the accumulation of relevant data despite possible limitations we believe that our approach provides a novel avenue to determine drugtarget_interaction helps to fill the existing gap between chemical proteomics and network pharmacology and has an important impact on the mechanism of action of drugs and targets
