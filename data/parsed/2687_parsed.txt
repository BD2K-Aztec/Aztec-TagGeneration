gene_expression learning combinatorial transcriptional dynamics from gene_expression data motivation mrna transcriptional dynamics is governed by a complex network of transcription_factor tf proteins experimental and theoretical_analysis of this process is hindered by the fact that measurements of tf_activity in vivo is very challenging current models that jointly infer tf activities and model_parameters rely on either of the two main simplifying assumptions either the dynamics is simplified e g assuming quasi_steady or the interactions between tfs are ignored resulting in models accounting for a single tf results we present a novel approach to reverse_engineer the dynamics of multiple_tfs jointly regulating the expression of a set of genes the model relies on a continuous time differential_equation description of transcriptional dynamics where tfs are treated as latent on off variables and are modelled using a switching stochastic_process telegraph process the model can not only incorporate both activation and repression but allows any non trivial interaction between tfs including and and or gates by using a factorization assumption within a variational_bayesian treatment we formulate a framework that can reconstruct both the activity profiles of the tfs and the type of regulation from time_series we demonstrate the identifiability of the model on a simple but non trivial synthetic example and then use it to formulate non trivial predictions about transcriptional_control during yeast metabolism understanding the mechanisms by which cells alter gene_expression in response to external_stimuli is a fundamental challenge in systems_biology perhaps the most critical level at which this control is exerted is in the regulation of mrna_transcription a common mechanism for achieving this is by structural or chemical_modification of transcription_factor tf proteins the environmental signal typically a change in the concentration of some small_molecule causes a change in state in the tf which enables the protein to bind target promoters and hence modulate the rate of to whom correspondence should be addressed recruitment of rna_polymerase and consequently transcription this view lends itself to a straightforward mathematical formulation in terms of ordinary_differential odes and has played a prominent role in the success of kinetic_models of regulatory_networks enabling the construction of detailed models of many important processes despite the success of kinetic modelling a major_obstacle to its wider application is its reliance on an accurate_knowledge of a number of model_parameters that are often difficult to experimentally measure in particular tfs activity states are often difficult to assay in a dynamical fashion due to several technical_limitations tfs are often present at low intercellular concentrations and the changes in their activity state can occur rapidly due to post_translational this has led to considerable activity in the statistics and machine_learning community to develop computational_methods to infer tf_activity profiles from time course measurements of mrna_expression levels early tf inference models exploited the availability of maps of the architecture of the regulatory_network obtained e g through high_throughput chip on chip experiments to simultaneously infer the activity profile of a large number of tfs this approach was pioneered by the network_component model of which was subsequently cast in a probabilistic_framework while the predictions of such models have provided valuable biological_insights the large number of variables means that only extremely simplified models of transcriptional_control can be considered to ensure model identifiability to have more realistic predictions some authors have recently_proposed inferential approaches based on realistic ode based models of transcription thus gene_expression dynamics is governed by an ode with a driving_force represented by the tf_activity placing a suitable prior_distribution over the tf_activity posterior estimation can be performed along with estimation of model_parameters such as mrna_decay and synthesis rates while there is much promise in employing more realistic models the mathematical difficulties_encountered in solving this inverse_problem are significant and the inference procedure cannot handle models of the complexity routinely used in kinetic modelling to our knowledge all existing_methods restrict themselves to the single input motif sim scenario where a module of genes is controlled by a single tf in this contribution we build on our previous model of sim dynamics and extend the results to simultaneously infer the activities of multiple interacting tfs page
