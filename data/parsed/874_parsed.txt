sequence_analysis catrapid omics a web_server for large_scale prediction of protein_rna here we introduce catrapid omics a server for large_scale calculations of proteinrna interactions our web_server allows i predictions at proteomic and transcriptomic level ii use of protein and rna_sequences without size restriction iii analysis of nucleic_acid binding regions in proteins and iv detection of rna motifs involved in protein recognition results we developed a web_server to allow fast calculation of ribonucleoprotein associations in caenorhabditis_elegans danio_rerio drosophila_melanogaster homo_sapiens mus_musculus rattus_norvegicus saccharomyces_cerevisiae and xenopus_tropicalis custom libraries can be also generated the catrapid omics was benchmarked on the recently_published rna interactomes of serine arginine rich splicing_factor srsf histone_lysine n methyltrans ferase ezh ezh tar dna_binding tdp and rna_binding fus fus as well as on the protein interactomes of u u small_nucleolar x inactive specific transcript xist repeat a region repa and crumbs homolog crb untranslated_region rnas our predictions are highly_significant p and will help the experimentalist to identify candidates for further validation availability catrapid omics can be freely accessed on the web atincreasing evidence indicates that ribonucleoprotein interactions are fundamental for cellular_regulation moreover several studies highlighted the involvement of rna_molecules in the onset and progression of human_diseases including neurological_disorders to our knowledge there are two sequence_based for prediction of proteinrna interactions catrapid and rpiseq the catrapid algorithm exploits predictions of secondary_structure hydrogen_bonding and van_der contributions to estimate the binding propensity of protein and rna_molecules rpiseq is based on support_vector svm and random_forest rf models predicting proteinrna interactions from primary structure alone both methods show remarkable performances but catrapid discriminates positive_and cases with higher accuracy and has been tested on long_non here we introduce catrapid omics to perform high_throughput predictions of proteinrna interactions using the information on protein and rna domains involved in macromolecular recognition
