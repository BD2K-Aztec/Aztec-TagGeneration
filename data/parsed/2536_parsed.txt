genome_analysis interactive microbial genome visualization with gview gview is a java_application for viewing and examining prokaryotic_genomes in a circular or linear context it accepts standard sequence file_formats and an optional style specification file to generate customizable publication quality genome maps in bitmap and scalable_vector formats gview features an interactive pan and zoom interface a command_line for incorporation in genome analysis_pipelines and a public application_programming for incorporation in other java applications availability gview is a freely_available application licensed under the gnu public license the application source_code documentation file specifications tutorials and image galleries are available atthe commercial introduction of next_generation has reduced the time and expense of genome_sequencing to such an extent that it is now possible for virtually any microbiology lab to generate genome_sequences for the microorganisms that they study visualizing the genomic_features contained in these sequences is important to aid biologists in understanding the genetic_basis of microbial traits and to convey this information to others a number of software_packages already exist for this purpose supplementary early software_packages like genomeplot and genomap generate circular genome maps in bitmap png jpg formats but do not support standard sequence file_formats and have limited customizability cgview and circos can generate very high_quality highly customizable circular maps in bitmap and scalable_vector svg formats and can be incorporated in pipelines but have limited interactivity and like their predecessors require custom input_formats dnaplotter generates interactive high_quality customizable circular and linear maps but does not support svg image output and cannot save the customizations applied to a genome map for later use the motivation behind gview is to provide in a single application the to whom correspondence should be addressed best features of all these microbial genome viewing packages easeof use customizability interactivity ability to generate circular and linear maps ability to read standard sequence file_formats ready incorporation in pipelines and third_party applications and the ability to generate aesthetically_pleasing publication quality image output
