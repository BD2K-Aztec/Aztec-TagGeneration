identification of c h zf binding_preferences from chip_seq using rcade current methods for motif_discovery from chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq often identify non targeted transcription_factor tf motifs and are even further limited when peak sequences are similar due to common_ancestry rather than common binding factors the latter aspect particularly affects a large number of proteins from the cys his zinc_finger c h zf class of tfs as their binding_sites are often dominated by endogen ous retroelements that have highly_similar sequences here we present recognition code assisted discovery of regulatory_elements rcade for motif_discovery from c h zf chip_seq rcade combines predictions from a dna_recognition code of c h zfs with chip_seq to identify models that represent the genuine dna binding_preferences of c h zf proteins we show that rcade is able to identify generalizable binding models even from peaks that are exclusively located within the repeat regions of the genome where state of the art motif_finding approaches largely fail availability_and rcade is available as a webserver and also for download atchromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing chip_seq is the most widely used method for mapping the genomic_regions that are associated with transcription_factors tfs identification of direct tf_binding from chip_seq is an essential step for decoding the molecular_mechanisms the regulatory programs dictated by tfs and understanding how genetic changes can affect these programs in the absence of orthogonal information on dna binding_preferences of tfs such as in vitro binding data achieving this goal primarily depends on inference of a binding model such as a dna_motif from the chip_seq current approaches for motif_finding from chip_seq almost exclusively rely on the assumption that the genomic_regions associated with a particular tf have diverse sequences except at the sites that are directly bound by the tf where the sequences are converged to match the tf_binding preference however this assumption is violated in many cases such as when the chip_seq are dominated by binding_sites of the interacting_partners of the tf of interest represent targets of multiple cooperative regulatory_factors and or are enriched for repetitive_dna such as endogenous retroelements eres binding to eres with similar sequences particularly affects the ability of motif_finding approaches for identification of dna binding_preferences of the cys his zinc_finger c h zf class of tfs which is by far the largest class of tfs in most vertebrates the c h zf proteins constitute almost half of all human tfs and almost half of them bind primarily to eres as a result the motifs identified from the genomic_regions that they v c the author published_by
