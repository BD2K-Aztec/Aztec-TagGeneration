network predicting drug's anatomical_therapeutic code motivation discovering drugs anatomical_therapeutic atc classification rules at molecular level is of vital importance to understand a vast_majority of drugs action however few studies attempt to annotate drugs potential atc_codes by computational_approaches results here we introduce drug_target network to computationally predict drugs atc_codes and propose a novel method_named netpredatc starting from the assumption that drugs with similar chemical_structures or target_proteins share_common atc_codes our method netpredatc aims to assign drugs potential atc_codes by integrating chemical_structures and target_proteins specifically we first construct a gold_standard positive dataset from drugs atc_code annotation databases then we characterize atc_code and drug by their similarity profiles and define kernel_function to correlate them finally we use a kernel method support_vector to automatically predict drugs atc_codes our method was validated on four drug datasets with various target_proteins including enzymes ion_channels g protein couple receptors and nuclear_receptors we found that both drugs chemical_structure and target protein are predictive and target protein information has better accuracy further integrating these two data_sources revealed more experimentally_validated atc_codes for drugs we extensively compared our netpredatc with superpred which is a chemical similarity only based method experimental_results showed that our netpredatc outperforms superpred not only in predictive coverage but also in accuracy in addition database_search and functional_annotation analysis support that our novel predictions are worthy of future experimental_validation the anatomical_therapeutic atc classification system categorizes drug_substances at different levels by their therapeutic_properties chemical_properties pharmacological_properties and practical_applications this classification system is recommended by the world_health who and drugs atc_codes have been widely_applied in almost all drug_utilization studies specifically atc classification system can be used as a basic tool for drug_utilization research it also provides the presentation and comparison of drug_consumption statistics at international level and will greatly_facilitate the recent drug_repositioning and drug_combination studies though useful mapping atc_codes to drugs is challenging recently atc_codes for some well characterized drugs have been deposited in databases such as kyoto_encyclopedia kegg biomolecular relations in information_transmission and expression brite and drugbank these databases provide high_quality expert curated_data however they are in small_scale and the coverage is far from enough to serve practical usage even for some well collected drug datasets the atc_code assignments for drugs are far from complete for example the dataset incontains drugs with four different type target_proteins including enzymes ion_channels ics g protein couple receptors gpcrs and nuclear_receptors nrs these drugs all have manually_curated target_proteins from kegg brite brenda supertarget and drugbank even in this high_quality dataset there are drugs that do not have any atc_codes in all drugs targeting enzyme drugs that do not have any atc_codes in all drugs targeting ic drugs that do not have any atc_codes in all drugs targeting gpcr and drugs that do not have any atc_codes in all drugs targeting nr the percentage of drugs without atc_codes varies from to the bottleneck is that current data_collection procedure heavily relies on human curation and is not efficient one way out is to learn the underlying atc classification rules from the available high_quality atc_code annotations and further automatically assign new atc_codes to drugs by a computational predictor this strategy will accelerate the functional characterization of drugs under the atc classification_systems especially those barely characterized drugs importantly it will greatly speed up the mechanism understanding of a vast_majority of to whom correspondence should be addressed drugs action and narrow down the gap between the medical indications and drug effects elucidation at molecular level however few studies attempt to address this important problem dunkel et_al tackled this challenge by proposing a computational_method to classify the given compounds into atc classification system their method is based on the drug similarity in chemical_structures and physicochemical_properties they also developed a useful web_server which allows prognoses about the medical indication of novel compounds and to find new leads for known targets nevertheless the chemical_structure only describes the static state of drugs cells use proteins and small_molecules drugs metabolites or ligands networks to dynamically coordinate multiple biological_functions for instance single drug may possess different biological_functions by targeting different proteins therefore if the drug_target information is integrated into the prediction the performance improvement can be expected in this article we follow this idea to design a new predictive method that is we map atc_codes to a given drug based not only on its chemical_structure similarity with other compounds but also on its target_proteins the commonly_accepted assumption in drug_discovery is that drugs with similar pharmacological or therapeutic_properties usually share_common functions existing efforts demonstrated that chemical_structure similarity is useful in classifying compounds into atc classification system here we note that drugs pharmacological or therapeutic similarity may due to the fact that they interact with common or similar target_proteins thus it is reasonable to assume that drugs similar in target_proteins usually share_common atc_codes starting with this assumption we propose a novel computational approach_called netpredatc to predict potential atc_codes for drugs specifically we first construct the drug and atccode interaction_network based on the known drug atc_code annotations then we characterize atc_code and drug by their similarity profiles and define kernel_function to correlate drug with atc_code finally we infer drugs atc_codes by training a machine_learning model i e support_vector svms svms are motivated by statistical_learning theory and have been successful on many different classification_problems in bioinformatics our contributions here are not only in incorporating drug_targets information for the first time into the atc_code prediction but also in designing a novel predictive_model by data_integration the performance of our method was validated on four classes of drug target_proteins including enzymes ics gpcrs and nrs we show that both chemical_structure and target protein are predictive via cross_validation experiments and statistical_evaluation moreover target protein information is more powerful by combining them our method outperforms the chemical similarity only based method and more experimentally_observed drug atc_code annotations can be uncovered
