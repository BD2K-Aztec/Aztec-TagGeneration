sequence_analysis ebardenovo highly_accurate de_novo of rna_seq with efficient chimera detection motivation high_accuracy de_novo of the short_sequencing from rna_seq technology is very challenging we introduce a de_novo algorithm ebardenovo which stands for extension bridging and repeat sensing denovo this algorithm uses an efficient chimera detection function to abrogate the effect of aberrant chimeric reads in rna_seq results ebardenovo resolves the complications of rna_seq assembly arising from sequencing_errors repetitive_sequences and aberrant chimeric amplicons in a series of assembly experiments our algorithm is the most accurate among the examined programs including de_bruijn assemblers trinity and oases availability_and ebardenovo is available at http ebardenovo sourceforge net this software_package with patent pending is free of charge for academic use only rna_seq technology has revolutionized transcriptomic studies in recent_years in comparison with microarrays this highthroughput sequencing_technology allows the detection of novel transcripts it also has a wider dynamic range in detecting transcript_abundance than tiling arrays serial_analysis and cap_analysis rna_seq is especially important for studying organisms without reference_genomes with reference_genomes accurate reads can be identified and mapped to the reference for accurate and sensitive quantification of even lowly_expressed transcripts however for organisms without reference_genomes the short_reads from rna_seq have to be assembled into contigs representing the transcripts before the expression_level can be determined from the read_coverage in this case sequencing_errors may cause mis assembly create artificial contigs and consequently produce inaccurate interpretation of transcript_abundance de_novo of short_reads faces computational challenges from classical sequencing problems such as sequence repeats homologous_genes and artificial chimeric reads most de_novo rna_seq assemblers including trans abyss oases and trinity are de_bruijn based_methods in de_bruijn reads are either represented as k_mer nodes or as k_mer edges and eulerian paths between end nodes are examined for assembling sequences both sequence repeats and artificial chimeric reads will cause erroneous k_mer nodes most of de_bruijn genome_assemblers such as velvet and allpaths filter out low_frequency k_mer nodes to improve accuracy as low_frequency k_mer nodes are more likely to be sequencing artifacts however de_novo of rna_seq is more difficult because the abundance of rna_transcripts varies_significantly although de bruijnbased algorithms have been successfully used to construct many transcriptomes using rna_seq it has always been difficult to keep the assembly both accurate and sensitive low_frequency k_mer nodes are important for discovering low_abundance transcripts for sensitive detection of novel transcripts rna_seq assemblers usually do not eliminate low_frequency k_mer nodes unfortunately retaining low_frequency k_mer nodes would reduce assembly accuracy in this study we introduce an efficient algorithm for rna_seq assembly with special emphasize on detecting chimeric reads and to whom correspondence should be addressed assembly errors we showed that our new de_novo algorithm designated ebardenovo has enhanced accuracy while it still maintains high_sensitivity in determining transcript_abundance
