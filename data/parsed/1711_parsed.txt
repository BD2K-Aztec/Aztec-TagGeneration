systems_biology expression kinases mrna profiling linked to multiple upstream regulatory layers motivation genome_wide mrna profiling provides a snapshot of the global state of cells under different conditions however mrna_levels do not provide direct understanding of upstream regulatory_mechanisms here we present a new approach_called expression kinases x k to identify upstream_regulators likely responsible for observed patterns in genome_wide gene_expression by integrating chromatin immuno precipitation chip_seq chip and position_weight pwms data proteinprotein_interactions and kinasesubstrate phosphorylation reactions we can better identify regulatory_mechanisms upstream of genome_wide differences in gene_expression we validated x k by applying it to recover drug_targets of food_and fda_approved from drug perturbations followed by mrna expression_profiling to map the regulatory landscape of stem_cells and their differentiating progeny to profile upstream regulatory_mechanisms of breast_cancer tumors and to detect pathways from profiled hepatic_stellate and hippocampal_neurons the x k approach can advance_our of cell_signaling and unravel drugs mechanisms of action availability the software and source_code are freely_available at although genome_wide proteomic approaches are rapidly improving the most widely available and cost_effective genomewide expression data is still collected at the mrna_level these experiments are carried_out using either microarrays or more recently rna_sequencing rna_seq commonly studies examine cells under different experimental_conditions such as control versus drug treated disease versus normal states or as a time series for example during cell_differentiation since quantitative changes in mrna_levels do not directly explain how cell signaling_mechanisms are altered to to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as induce changes in gene_expression and in turn lead to changes in cellular_phenotype identification of such upstream regulatory_mechanisms has been the focus of many computational_systems studies such understanding will enable us among other things to better control cell_behavior with small_molecules and in turn translate such ability to therapeutics most popular approaches for data interpretation of changes in genome_wide gene_expression include promoter analysis gene_ontology the gene_ontology consortium or pathway enrichment_analyses as well as reverse_engineering of networks from mrna_expression data the ultimate_goal of many of these approaches is to identify and rank potential target_genes proteins that if knocked_down or overexpressed would explain the observed changes by for example reversing them such proteins may ultimately become drug_targets here we present a rational approach_called expression kinases x k to identify and rank putative transcription_factors protein_complexes and protein_kinase that are likely responsible for the observed changes in genome_wide mrna_expression by combining data from chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq chip experiments and or position_weight pwms proteinprotein_interactions and kinasesubstrate protein_phosphorylation reactions we demonstrate how we can better identify regulatory_mechanisms responsible for genome_wide differences in gene_expression the idea is to first infer the most likely transcription_factors the differences in gene_expression then use proteinprotein_interactions to connect the identified transcription_factors using additional proteins to build transcriptional_regulatory subnetworks centered on these factors and finally use kinasesubstrate protein_phosphorylation reactions to identify and rank candidate protein_kinases that most likely regulate the formation of the identified transcriptional complexes we show how transcription_factors protein_complexes and protein_kinase candidate identification and ranking are inferred robustly by cross validating the method with additional data such as those from drug perturbations followed by genome_wide mrna expression_profiling furthermore we demonstrate the application of the method to in several case studies where we developed several visualization methods that present a global view of cellfate trajectories at different layers of regulation all together x k can rapidly advance_our of cell_signaling regulation of gene_expression by utilizing different modalities of prior_knowledge the x k approach can assist in drug_target and help in unraveling drug mechanisms of action the x k pipeline presents a new rational approach to identify and rank upstream_regulators that are responsible for observed changes in gene_expression collected at the genome_wide scale from mammalian_cells the approach applied to datasets such as cmap has the potential to rapidly advance drug_target and help in unraveling drug mechanisms of action the application to mapping transcription_factor profiles and kinome profiles of many individual cell_types i e different cells during lineage_commitment or tumors from patients can be useful to obtain a global view of the axis of cell_signaling across many cell_types or to compare individual patients for suggesting appropriate pharmacological_interventions in addition specific applications to common studies that examine genome_wide gene_expression under two conditions such as the two case studies we presented for hscs and hippocampal_neurons can benefit from x k analysis for generating hypotheses for further functional experiments following the global expression_profiling while currently the x k method uses only protein_dna proteinprotein_interactions and kinasesubstrate reactions other types of data could be added for example histone_modifications micrornas and other types of post_translational could be incorporated into the pipeline while more sophisticated enrichment_analyses tests could be implemented i e gene_set gsea and better parameter_tuning can be achieved by cross_validation the initial application of the approach shows great promise the x k approach is useful for data_integration across layers and the reuse of prior_knowledge within newly acquired expression datasets linking expression changes to upstream regulation another limitation of the method is the assumption of independence between regulators and targets when applying the chea or kea steps it is known that the kinome and transcriptional regulome networks are made of tightly_coupled protein_kinases regulating other kinases and transcription factors_regulating other transcription_factors several recent_studies considered such interactions for transcription_factors such interdependencies could be added to the x k analysis where these two regulatory_networks could be dynamically modeled regardless of these limitations and future_directions the current application of x k presents an advancement toward our ultimate_goal of understanding mammalian_cell signaling_networks from a global perspective at a molecular level of resolution
