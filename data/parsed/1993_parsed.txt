genetic_algorithm for shift uncertainty correction in d nmr based metabolite identifications and quantifications motivation the analysis of metabolic_processes is becoming increasingly important to our understanding of complex_biological and disease_states nuclear_magnetic nmr is a particularly relevant technology in this respect since the nmr signals provide_a of the metabolite_concentrations however due to the complexity of the spectra typical of biological_samples the demands of clinical and high_throughput analysis will only be fully met by a system capable of reliable automatic processing of the spectra an initial step in this direction has been taken by targeted profiling tp employing a set of known and predicted metabolite signatures fitted against the signal however an accurate fitting procedure for h nmr_data is complicated by shift uncertainties in the peak systems caused by measurement imperfections these uncertainties have a large impact on the accuracy of identification and quantification and currently require compensation by very time consuming manual interactions here we present an approach termed extended targeted profiling etp that estimates shift uncertainties based on a genetic_algorithm ga combined with a least_squares optimization lsqo the estimated shifts are used to correct the known metabolite signatures leading to significantly_improved identification and quantification in this way use of the automated system significantly_reduces the effort normally associated with manual processing and paves the way for reliable high_throughput analysis of complex nmr_spectra results the results indicate that using simultaneous shift uncertainty correction and least_squares fitting significantly_improves the identification and quantification results for h nmr_data in comparison to the standard targeted profiling approach and compares_favorably with the results obtained by manual expert analysis preservation of the functional structure of the nmr_spectra makes this approach more realistic than simple binning strategies availability the simulation descriptions and scripts employed are available under the quantitative profiling of metabolites and the mathematical_modeling of metabolic_networks is set to make a major_contribution to our understanding of complex_biological including the processes underlying development and tissue_homeostasis the most commonly used methods for metabolite detection are mass_spectrometry ms and nuclear_magnetic nmr while each has its specific advantages the inherently quantitative nature of nmr makes it most attractive for providing data for the development of mathematical_models however the current challenge is to extract reliably quantitative data from experimental_spectra which are often complex and subject to background variability here we focus on the exact extraction of metabolite information from h nmr measurements the general_strategy involves pre_processing such as phase and baseline correction smoothing and data reduction followed by the identification of distinct metabolite signatures in the signal and the estimation of metabolite_concentrations with respect to the original biological_samples details of the basic pre_processing used in this work are provided in a number of approaches have been reported to help in the subsequent identification and quantification of individual metabolites from pre processed data however none of the methods currently available can be applied in the reliable automated fashion necessary for the high_throughput processing of complex biological_samples as an initial step toward automatic processing targeted profiling tp employs a set of known and predicted metabolite signatures targets fitted against the signal however an accurate fitting procedure for h nmr_data is complicated by small but significant shift uncertainties in the peak systems caused by even minor variations in parameters such as temperature and ph these uncertainties have a large impact on the accuracy of identification and quantification and currently need to be compensated by very time consuming manual interactions independent correction of the shift followed by fitting of the corrected target descriptions against the signals is not generally feasible because of the strong overlaps typical of h nmr_spectra generic methods for the compensation of peak shifts are typically based on a specific or average reference_signal taken from thepage in summary this work has shown that an approach combining gas with lsqo leads to highly_effective error estimates for the shift uncertainties in h nmr measurements the simultaneous fit outperforms the standard tp approach with respect to identification and quantification accuracy and compares_favorably to the expert analysis we have further shown that the usage of a data specific functional distance measure to calculate the fitness values is preferable to a standard euclidean measure it also significantly_improved the convergence_rate of the ga the interpretation of the obtained shifts over time with the best model allows an in depth analysis of the optimization revealing potentially unreliable fits this provides initial guidance for the expert to focus further manual improvement of the obtained fit where necessary reducing the demand for extensive shift corrections in order to generate correct uncertainty estimates furthermore the approach also allows the manual specification of concentration values in the fit for known concentrations by additional constraints overall the combined approach can improve the identification and quantification accuracy of nmr based targeted profiling to allow a semiautomatic high page
