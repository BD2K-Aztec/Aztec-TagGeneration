isoform level ribosome occupancy estimation guided by transcript_abundance with ribomap ribosome_profiling is a recently_developed high_throughput technique that captures approximately bp_long ribosome protected mrna fragments during translation because of alternative_splicing and repetitive_sequences a ribosome protected read may map to many places in the transcriptome leading to discarded or arbitrary mappings when standard_approaches are used we present a technique and software that addresses this problem by assigning reads to potential origins proportional to estimated transcript_abundance this yields a more accurate estimate of ribosome profiles compared with a na ve mapping availability_and ribomap is available as open_source atribosome profiling ribo seq provides snapshots of the positions of translating ribosomes by sequencing ribosome protected fragments the distribution of ribo seq footprints along a transcript called the ribosome profile can be used to analyze translational regulation and discover alternative initiation alternative translation and frameshifting and may eventually_lead a better understanding of the regulation of cell_growth the progression of aging and the development of diseases different environmental_conditions such as stress or starvation alter the ribosome profile patterns indicating possible changes in translational regulation in higher_eukaryotes alternative transcription_initiation premrna splicing and end formation result in the production of multiple_isoforms for most genes the resulting isoforms can have dramatically different effects on mrna_stability and translation regulation however to date ribosome_profiling analyses have been conducted at the gene rather than isoform level using either a single rate of ribomap is compared to if only uniquely_mapped are used estimation of mrna isoform abundance from rna_seq has also had to deal with ambiguous mappings however unlike in rnaseq coverage in ribo seq is highly non uniform regardless of sequencing bias since ribosomes move along mrnas at non uniform rates and it is in fact the non uniformities that are of interest further ambiguous mappings are much worse for ribo seq data since the read_length cannot exceed the ribosome size approximately bp while paired_end and longer_reads can be generated from rna_seq experiments to reduce the problem of ambiguous mappings methods developed for transcript_abundance are therefore not applicable to assigning ribo seq reads by observing that ambiguous mappings are mainly caused by multiple_isoforms supplementary ribomap assigns riboseq reads to locations using estimated transcript_abundance of the candidate locations on synthetic data our approach yields a more precise estimation of ribosome profiles compared with a pure mapping based_approach further the ribosome abundance derived using our method correlates better with the transcript_abundance on real ribo seq data
