structural_bioinformatics rrdistmaps a ucsf chimera tool for viewing and comparing protein distance maps motivation contact_maps are a convenient method for the structural biologists to identify structural_features through two_dimensional simplification binary yes no contact_maps with a single cutoff distance can be generalized to show continuous distance ranges we have developed a ucsf chimera tool rrdistmaps to compute such generalized maps in order to analyze pairwise variations in intramolecular contacts an interactive utility rrdistmaps visualizes conformational changes both local e g binding_site residues and global e g hinge motion between unbound and bound proteins through distance patterns users can target residue pairs in rrdistmaps for further navigation in chimera the interface contains the unique features of identifying long_range residue motion and aligning sequences to simultaneously compare distance maps the rapid_improvement of technology in recent decades has enhanced our knowledge of protein_structure as visualization software has revolutionized_our of molecular_mechanisms recent_applications such as cmview examine the nature of structural_differences or changes in proteins through the use of residueresidue rr contact_maps rr contact_maps are powerful two_dimensional d representations of protein d structure that plot patterns of spatial interactions e g pairs of amino_acids with a carbons a apart d contact_maps provide a complementary view to d molecular_visualization as they are unaffected by rotation or translation and can be easily compared and superimposed contact_maps are typically shown as square plots with markers denoting interactions between residues residue pairs that fall outside of the interaction threshold are completely unmarked however longer range interactions may be used to identify largerscale motions such as hinge movements instead of using a single cutoff threshold for contacts displaying a color_coded distance map can help users visualize longer range interactions as an extension to the molecular_visualization application ucsf chimera we developed rrdistmaps a tool to interactively compute and display distance maps for individual proteins and to compare the distance maps of pairs of similar proteins in the legend marks the distances for which the color coding is applied residue pairs whose rr distances fall outside of the rectangle are displayed in dark gray when only short distances are used for color coding the distance maps are effectively contact_maps for multi protein comparison rrdistmaps identifies corresponding amino_acids in the different chains using sequence_alignment this limits use of proteins with sequences similar enough to be aligned correctly and without topological rearrangements in general however distance map comparisons are only appropriate for proteins with the same basic architecture for two chains rrdistmaps uses the needlemanwunsch algorithm for more than two chains rrdistmaps uses muscle via an online rbvi web_service in both cases the sequence_alignment is displayed using chimeras multalign viewer tool only positions in the sequence_alignment where amino_acids are present for all chains are used for corresponding amino_acid the average a carbon distance and standard_deviation are computed using values from all chains the user can choose to display only the average distance or standard_deviation but the most useful display is the plot which color codes on both attributes with residue pairs with high standard_deviation shown in color and low in grayscale as with the singlechain interface the user can manipulate both the distance map and the color coding legend using the mouse
