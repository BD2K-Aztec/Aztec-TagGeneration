genomering alignment visualization based on supergenome coordinates motivation the number of completely_sequenced is continuously rising allowing for comparative_analyses of genomic_variation such analyses are often based on whole_genome alignments to elucidate structural_differences arising from insertions deletions or from rearrangement events computational_tools that can visualize genome alignments in a meaningful manner are needed to help researchers gain new insights into the underlying data such visualizations typically are either realized in a linear fashion as in genome_browsers or by using a circular approach where relationships between genomic_regions are indicated by arcs both methods allow for the integration of additional information such as experimental_data or annotations however providing a visualization that still allows for a quick and comprehensive interpretation of all important genomic_variations together with various supplemental data which may be highly_heterogeneous remains a challenge results here we present two complementary approaches to tackle this problem first we propose the supergenome concept for the computation of a common coordinate system for all genomes in a multiple_alignment this coordinate system allows for the consistent placement of genome_annotations in the presence of insertions deletions and rearrangements second we present the genomering visualization that based on the supergenome creates an interactive overview visualization of the multiple genome alignment in a circular layout we demonstrate our methods by applying them to an alignment of campylobacter_jejuni strains for the discovery of genomic islands as well as to an alignment of helicobacter_pylori which we visualize in combination with gene_expression data advances in high_throughput have dramatically_increased the speed at which genomes are sequenced this led to the establishment of large_scale genome_sequencing such as the genomes_project the genomes_project in arabidopsis_thaliana the k genomes_project which aims at sequencing vertebrate_genomes the insect genomes initiative i k as well as many projects sequencing prokaryotic species often at the level of individual strains the genome_sequencing are conducted with different long_term goals while the k and the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as to whom correspondence should be addressed i k initiatives aim at collecting genomes across a large part of the tree of vertebrates and insects respectively the and genome_projects focus on genetic_variation within one species regarding the prokaryotic species genome_projects often focus on this latter aspect comparing different strains of bacteria with the goal of understanding the genetic_basis of pathogenicity and drug_resistance the adaptability to environments the extent of horizontal_gene as well as to elucidate the architectural diversity of bacterial_genomes parallel to the increase in genomic_data with the development of new sequencing_technologies powerful visualization_tools have been developed and continue being developed an excellent review on methods as well as the challenges of visualizing genomes has recently been published by generally one can distinguish two approaches to the visualization of genomes a single_genome is visualized often in comparison to a reference_genome or multiple_genomes are compared in the first case genome_browsers are typically utilized which represent the genome linearly and can display multiple variables in parallel tracks aligned to the genomic_coordinates such tracks can contain annotation experimental or statistical data for the comparison of multiple_genomes the same linear approach as applied by genome_browsers can be used a typical example is the viewer integrated into mauve however large changes such as inversions can quickly lead to visual clutter and it can be difficult to deduce similarities and differences between genomes from the visualization some genome viewers employ a circular approach to visualize one genome with annotation and experimental_data or to present an alignment of several genomes circos is one of the most often used circular genome visualization_tools it displays genomic_data as a circular plot in which the relationships of genomic_elements are displayed using arcs it is therefore particularly useful for visualizing variation within one genome but it can also be applied to visualize the relationship of several genomes while circos without doubt produces aesthetically very attractive figures it has the major disadvantage of only presenting a static non interactive view of the data further circular genome viewers are medea and mizbee another circular approach is taken by the blast ring image generator brig that visualizes multiple prokaryotic_genomes each genome is compared to a reference_genome using blast the hits between each genome and the reference are then visualized as concentric rings using different colors for each genome additional rings representing meta_information such as gc_content can be added its main focus is to accompany sequencing_projects in particular to handle and visualize assembly data though a number of excellent visualization and analysis tools are already available for researchers working with multiple genomegenomering is a highly interactive tool for multiple_alignment visualization based on supergenome coordinates the concept of the supergenome together with genomering provides a quick and broad overview through the display of genomic_events from completely aligned genomes and allows for a detailed analysis of specific genes through the linkage of genomering to several other visualizations incorporated into mayday such as maydays genome_browser these aspects and the applicability of genomering to other fields of research make it a highly usable visualization strategy complementing already existing visualization_techniques in addition the supergenome coordinate system can be widely_applied beyond the field of visualization as it provides a generic solution to the problem of consistently specifying coordinates in multiple_genome without attributing a special status to an arbitrarily chosen reference_sequence
