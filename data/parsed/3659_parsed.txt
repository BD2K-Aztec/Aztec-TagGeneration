predicting the functional consequences of cancer associated amino_acid motivation the number of missense_mutations being identified in cancer_genomes has greatly_increased as a consequence of technological_advances and the reduced_cost of whole_genome whole_exome methods however a high proportion of the amino_acid detected in cancer_genomes have little or no effect on tumour_progression passenger_mutations therefore accurate automated methods capable of discriminating between driver cancer promoting and passenger_mutations are becoming increasingly important in our previous work we developed the functional analysis through hidden_markov fathmm software and using a model weighted for inherited_disease mutations observed improved performances over alternative computational_prediction here we describe an adaptation of our original algorithm that incorporates a cancer specific model to potentiate the functional analysis of driver_mutations results the performance of our algorithm was evaluated using two separate benchmarks in our analysis we observed improved performances when distinguishing between driver_mutations and other germ_line variants both disease_causing and putatively neutral mutations in addition when discriminating between somatic driver and passenger_mutations we observed performances comparable with the leading computational_prediction spf cancer and transfic availability_and a web_based implementation of our cancer specific model including a downloadable stand alone package is available at http fathmm human_cancers are characterized by the accumulation of somatic_mutations e g gross insertions_and as well as the more subtle single base_pair some of which confer a growth_advantage on the tumour_cells the catalogue of somatic_mutations in cancer cosmic is an online repository of somatic_mutation data which includes amino_acid aass the identification of cancerpromoting aass driver_mutations promises to lead to a better understanding of the molecular_mechanisms the disease as well as providing potential diagnostic and therapeutic markers however this remains_a as the majority of aass detected in cancer_genomes do not contribute to carcinogenesis rather these passenger_mutations are a consequence of tumorigenesis rather than a cause therefore accurate automated computational_prediction capable of distinguishing between driver and passenger_mutations are of paramount_importance a review bydescribes the performance of several computational_prediction using a gold_standard validation benchmark sasidharan in our previous work we developed the functional analysis through hidden_markov fathmm algorithm and using a model weighted for inherited_disease mutations observed improved_performance accuracies over alternative computational_prediction using the same benchmark however the value of traditional computational_prediction in cancer_genomics remains_unclear for example the shared characteristics between driver and other disease_causing allow for a significant proportion of cancer associated mutations to be identified high_sensitivity true_positive however these methods are incapable of reliably distinguishing between driver and other disease_causing furthermore with respect to carcinogenesis a large proportion of passenger_mutations are still misclassified as having a role in tumour_progression low_specificity true negative rate as a result several cancer specific computational_prediction capable of distinguishing between driver_mutations and other germ_line variants both disease_causing and putatively neutral mutations and or capable of discriminating between somatic driver and passenger_mutations have been developed in this work we describe an adaptation to our original algorithm which amalgamates sequence_conservation within hidden_markov hmms representing the alignment of

distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work homologous_sequences and conserved protein_domains with pathogenicity weights representing the overall tolerance of the corresponding model to mutations to potentiate the functional analysis of driver_mutations using a model weighted for cancer associated mutations we observe performance accuracies which outperform alternative computational_prediction when distinguishing between driver and other germ_line mutations both disease_causing and neutral polymorphisms furthermore when discriminating between driver and passenger_mutations somatic we observe performance accuracies comparable with other state of the art computational_prediction a web_based implementation of our algorithm including a high_throughput batch submission facility and a downloadable stand alone package is available at http fathmm biocompute org uk in this article we described an adaptation to the functional analysis through hidden_markov fathmm algorithm in which a cancer specific weighting_scheme was incorporated to potentiate the functional analysis of driver_mutations the performance of our method was then benchmarked against four alternative computational_prediction sift and polyphen mutation assessor and spf cancer using the capriotti and altman benchmarking datasets in terms of performance accuracies fathmm seems to be the best performing method available when assigned with the task of distinguishing between driver_mutations and other germ_line polymorphisms both disease_causing and neutral furthermore when tasked with discriminating between driver and passenger_mutations somatic our method seems to perform as well as the alternative leading prediction algorithm spf cancer although the performance of our algorithm in this category does not represent an improvement over spfcancer our method offers a large_scale high_throughput batch submission facility capable of analysing all foreseeable genomic cancer datasetsan important facility that is not offered with spf cancer in addition to facilitate a comparison between our algorithm and another leading computational_prediction algorithm chasm we performed a fold_cross procedure and observed an improved_performance when using our method we also compared the performance of our algorithm with four computational_prediction sift polyphen mutation assessor and transfic using a published benchmark once again we observed improved_performance accuracies over traditional computational_prediction sift polyphen and mutation assessor and we noted comparable performances with the mutation assessor transfic in any fair comparison care should be taken to reduce the potential overlap between the mutation datasets used for training and testing however this level of testing is not possible as it would require obtaining and retraining each algorithm with common datasets to remove the potential_bias in our results we performed a fold_cross procedure across our benchmark from this analysis we observed no significant_deviations in the performance of our algorithm and therefore concluded that the performances observed were not an artefact of the weighting_scheme used the potential benefits of incorporating cancer specific information into our predictions were assessed by comparing the performance of our cancer specific weighting_scheme with the performance of our original inherited_disease weighting_scheme in accordance with previous_findings we observed some similarities in driver scores predictions between the two weighting_schemes however we noted improved odds in identifying driver passenger_mutations using a cancerspecific weighting_scheme unsurprisingly we also noted significantly_improved odds in correctly classifying disease_causing non neoplasm mutations as having no effect on tumour_progression therefore by incorporating a cancer specific weighting_scheme we have shown that our method is capable of identifying mutations that directly contribute to carcinogenesis irrespective of other underlying_disease associations to facilitate the analysis of large_scale cancer genomic_datasets our public web_server available at http fathmm biocompute org uk provides unrestricted and near instant predictions for all possible amino_acid within the human_proteome for example we were capable of annotating the entire cosmic databasecomprising of over half a million mutationsin h using a single processing core in addition we also provide an open_source software_package allowing users to run our algorithm using their high_performance systems
