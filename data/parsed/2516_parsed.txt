genetics_and integration of snp_genotyping confidence_scores in ibd inference motivation high_throughput single_nucleotide snp_arrays have become the standard platform for linkage and association_analyses the high snp density of these platforms allows high_resolution identification of ancestral recombination_events even for distant_relatives many generations apart however such inference is sensitive to marker mistyping and current error_detection methods rely on the genotyping of additional close_relatives genotyping algorithms provide a confidence_score for each marker call that is currently not integrated in existing_methods there is a need for a model that incorporates this prior information within the standard identical by descent ibd and association_analyses results we propose a novel model that incorporates marker confidence_scores within ibd methods based on the landergreen hidden_markov the novel parameter of this model is the joint_distribution of confidence_scores and error status per array we estimate this probability_distribution by applying a modified expectation_maximization em procedure on data from nuclear families genotyped with affymetrix k snp_arrays the converged tables from two different genotyping algorithms are shown for a wide_range of error_rates we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in refining the detection of ibd signals using nuclear pedigrees and distant_relatives availability plinke a new version of plink with an extended pairwise_ibd inference model allowing per marker error probabilities is freely_available at the emergence of high_throughput genotyping_platforms introduces various challenges to genetic_mapping in particular highthroughput genotyping_data contain errors which even in small rates can obscure signals in genetic_mapping an important analysis in genetic_mapping is identical by descent ibd inference which aims to detect regions inherited from a common_ancestor merlin and plink are examples of popular tools for ibd inference in pedigrees and distantly_related individuals respectively these tools are based on an efficient implementation of the lander and green algorithm for ibd inference it is well recognized that ibd inference is sensitive to errors which in certain situations could result in loss of ibd signals although not complete error_detection in pedigree data can be quite effective and cleaning processes became a routine prior to ibd analysis a major_drawback of error_detection methods is the need to set threshold_values for flagging a mistyped genotype these thresholds balance between false_positive and often depend on other specific parameters such as pedigree structure allele_frequencies and error_rates moreover ibd mapping using distant_relatives and casecontrol association_analyses hold little or no information that facilitate error_detection in individual genotypes the alternative in these situations is to conduct strict qc procedures and re genotype suspicious samples an alternative approach is to incorporate error probabilities per marker in the statistical_models models that deal with inconsistent markers within long nearly identical stretches of markers were implemented for identical in state iis and identical by descent ibd methods for example purcell et_al implemented an iis procedure for detecting runs of homozygosity allowing for a few mismatched markers within a candidate run allowed a small probability of marker error for estimating homozygosity by descent and pairwise_ibd probabilities respectively these models assume a predefined error_rate for the entire data despite the fact that marker error probability may not be homogeneous error_rates may vary between samples due to sample specific preparation details wellcome_trust marker error probabilities may also depend on specific snp parameters for example markers with extreme allele_frequencies are generally more challenging for genotype_calling page in this study we proposed a model that integrates confidence_scores within the standard model for ibd inference confidence_scores measure the amount of certainty a genotyping algorithm has in each call and therefore contain relevant_information for error modeling even without pedigree data we found that the joint_distribution of confidence_score and error status holds relevant_information for error page
