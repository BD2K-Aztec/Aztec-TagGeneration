data_and a framework for analytical characterization of monoclonal_antibodies based on reactivity profiles in different tissues motivation monoclonal_antibodies mabs are among the most powerful and important tools in biology and medicine mab development is of great significance to many research and clinical_applications therefore objective mab classification is essential for categorizing and comparing mab panels based on their reactivity patterns in different cellular species however typical flow_cytometric mab profiles present unique modeling challenges with their non gaussian features and intersample variations it makes accurate mab classification difficult to do with the currently used kernel_based or hierarchical_clustering techniques results to address these challenges in the present study we developed a formal two step framework called mabprofiler for systematic parametric characterization of mab profiles further we measured the reactivity of hundreds of new antibodies in diverse tissues using flow_cytometry which we successfully classified using mabprofiler first mabprofiler fits a mabs flow_cytometric histogram with a finite mixture_model of skew t distributions that is robust against non gaussian features and constructs a precise smooth and mathematically rigorous profile then it performs novel curve clustering of the fitted mab profiles using a skew t mixture of non linear_regression that can handle intersample variation thus mabprofiler provides a new framework for identifying robust mab classes all well defined by distinct parametric templates which can be used for classifying new mab samples we validated our classification results both computationally and empirically using mab profiles of known classification monoclonal_antibodies mabs are among the most powerful popular and important tools in a biomedical laboratory for probing different cellular types states and functions research in the past_decades has led to the development of large collections of mab for specific binding to cell_surface which facilitated purification and functional characterization of a variety of cell_populations it also unlocked the great_potential of using mab for therapy in many serious diseases such as cancer using platforms such as flow_cytometry one can measure quantitatively the binding of a mab in single_cell resolution to the corresponding antigen whose expression may serve as a marker of cellular characteristics for a given specimen see therefore it is important to characterize mab reactivity patterns in different cell_types and tissues with analytical precision and rigor so that both known and new mab can be categorized and compared accurately and objectively mab classification is of great practical importance to many fields in biomedicine such as immunology hematology pathology and clinical immunotherapy large_scale attempts at analyzing mab to identify new molecules were pioneered in the human leukocyte differentiation antigens hldas workshops see review in zola andwhere the reactivities of large panels of mabs were measured against widely available cell_lines the reactivity was given a binary assignment compared with a negative controleither the antibody bound to its antigen on a given cell or it did notas measured by fluorescence_intensity the frequency with which this occurred over a cell_population was then recorded and hierarchical_clustering was employed to group similar reactivity thus was born the clusters of differentiation cd classes widely used today to identify various cell_populations in recent_years the workshop approach for identifying new molecules to define cell_types has become less applicable due to the current capabilities of molecular_identification at gene level an alternative approach for mab characterization involves the use of primary cell_populations thatfollowing data preparation and preprocessing in step mabprofiler modeled cytometric histograms for mab samples from six tissues using skew t mixture_models illustrates how a profile shown as gray curve constructed by mabprofiler offers a smooth and precise representation of mab density histograms this can be contrasted with the original cytometric input in the form of highly non smooth patterns as shown in supplementary to rigorously assess the precision of modeling with our skew t mixture_models stmix we computed log_likelihood maxima bic values the distances d n between the data and the fitted model based on kolmogorovsmirnov test and cpu times for stmix as well as for two competing_models of more commonly used mixtures of gaussian nmix and t distributions tmix and compared them in supplementary table s clearly as shown by bic mabprofiler gives the best fit in step for each tissue mabprofiler clustered the mab profiles specified as density curves with our new algorithm for non linear_regression of skew t mixture_models it selected the model that corresponded to the optimal tissue_specific group structure using the maximal value of the jump statistic over a range of clusters g g max summarizes the results of this clustering step the optimal choice of g over the values for which the em converged is marked inand supplementary right panel inf we show each of the six clusters of the spleen profiles notably the profiles were grouped by their significant features overcoming intersample variation thus the clustering was both accurate and robust further shows the mean profile of every cluster in its own color thereby contrasting the signature templates for every class while summarizing the characteristicfor each tissue type its count of mab profiles number of profile clusters i e mab classes iir average intracluster distance to average intercluster distance ratio and computing time ct in minutes of the em_algorithm for g g max features within each of them similar joint plots for every tissue are shown in supplementary which also includes the jump statistics that help in the determination of the optimal group structures we validated our mab classification both computationally and empirically since every fitted profile is defined by a probability_distribution we computed a symmetric form of kullbackleibler distance skl between all pairs of profiles and observed that the average intracluster distances between profiles are considerably_lower than the average intercluster distances the ratio iir in every tissue is shown in for illustration the distance_matrix for the six clusters for spleen is shown in supplementary for empirical validation for four tissue_types spleen thymocytes bone_marrow and lymph_node and two classes of antibodies class i mab t and anti lfa mab f as described in we generated data for two pairs of mab such that the mab within each pair were known to target_molecules of the same class but across pairs they targeted molecules from distinct classes as shown in supplementary indeed all profile pairs black thin curves cluster together within each class class i in left panel or anti lfa in right panel but separately across two distinct classes providing experimental_evidence for precise and objective classification by our framework as in the mean profiles are page shown in cluster specific colors for distinguishing the two classes in each tissue
