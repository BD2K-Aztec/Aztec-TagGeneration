reconstructing s rrna_genes in metagenomic_data metagenomic_data which contains sequenced dna_reads of uncultured microbial_species from environmental_samples provide_a to thoroughly analyze microbial_species that have never been identified before reconstructing s ribosomal_rna a phylogenetic marker gene is usually required to analyze the composition of the metagenomic_data however massive volume of dataset high_sequence between related species skewed microbial abundance and lack of reference genes make s rrna reconstruction difficult generic de_novo tools are not optimized for assembling s rrna_genes in this work we introduce a targeted rrna assembly tool reago reconstruct s ribosomal_rna from metagenomic_data it addresses the above challenges by combining secondary_structure aware homology_search zproperties of rrna_genes and de_novo our experimental_results show that our tool can correctly recover more rrna_genes than several popular generic metagenomic assembly tools and specially_designed rrna construction tools availability_and the source_code of reago is freely_available at https github com chengyuan reago microbes are ubiquitous species existing in all environments on earth including extreme_conditions from the desert to acid wastewater from pine forest_soil to mine drainage they sustain themselves using various mechanisms human_bodies are also habitats of microbes it is estimated that there are bacterial cell inhabiting on our body which is times more than our own cells human_life as well as the entire ecosystem are profoundly affected by microbes there is a strong need to understand the function of microbial_communities and how they interact with their hosts the function of microbial_community is defined by its composition and diversity in particular metagenomic_data which contains sequenced dna_reads of uncultured microbial_species from environmental_samples provide_a to thoroughly analyze microbial_species that have never been identified before a commonly adopted approach for identifying the microbial_species in environmental_samples is to conduct comparative_analysis of ribosomal rna_sequences the use of rrna for microbial phylogenetic_analysis had become such a relied upon methodology that by of all insdc bacterial dna_sequence submissions described an rrna gene sequence s rrna reads from metagenomic_studies provide a source of sequences that are not subject to pcr primer bias and therefore covers taxa that might be missed by existing popular primer_sets the rrna_genes are a patchwork of hypervariable rapidly_evolving and universally conserved_regions unassembled reads in metagenomic_data usually lack usable phylogenetic_signal thus there is a strong need to recover complete or near complete rrna_genes from the short_reads for analyzing microbial_composition in the underlying samples however the massive data volume short read_length skewed species abundance and high similarity of s rrna_genes all make rrna recovery in metagenomic_data very difficult the goal of this work is to provide a tool that can efficiently and accurately recover rrna_genes from metagenomic_data existing pipelines for annotating rrna_genes in metagenomic_data can be divided_into two groups the first type of pipelines relies on existing de_novo tools to output assembled_contigs which are then used as input to available genome_wide rrna search tools there are various metagenomic assembly programs
