gene_expression digep pred web_service for in silico prediction of drug_induced gene_expression based on structural formula experimentally found gene_expression are used to solve different problems in pharmaceutical studies such as drug_repositioning resistance toxicity and drugdrug_interactions a special web_service digep pred for prediction of drug_induced changes of gene_expression based on structural formulae of chemicals has been developed structureactivity relationships for prediction of drug_induced gene_expression were determined by prediction of activity spectra for substances pass software comparative_toxicogenomics with data on the known drug_induced gene_expression of chemicals was used to create mrna and protein based training_sets an average prediction_accuracy for the training_sets roc auc calculated by leave_one on the basis of mrna data compounds genes up and down regulations and protein data compounds genes up and down regulations exceeded availability freely_available on the web atdrug induced gene_expression digep is an important_determinant of the drug effect on a cell recent rapid advances in dna_microarray allow one to use in practice the digeps lamb introduced connectivity_map cmap as a phenotype based_drug approach based on comparison of disease gene_signature and drug_induced changes in gene_expression since then more than studies using cmap approach for drug_repositioning lead_discovery mechanism of action elucidation and so forth were published it was shown that cmap approach can be used to reveal side_effects of drugs estimation of drug_resistance and analysis of the drug synergistic_effects cmap approach is applicable only for several thousand drugs having experimentally_determined digeps but cannot be used for other drugs or new drug_candidates to overcome_this we decided to create a web_service to predict digeps for new drug like compounds on the basis of the existing data on digeps there are several freely_available databases on experimental digeps including ncbi gene_expression connectivity_map database and comparative_toxicogenomics ctd structureactivity relationships are traditionally used to decrease the number of experiments in the process of drug_development the gene_expression changes can be considered as a particular type of the biological_activity of a drug therefore prediction of activity spectra for substances pass approach can be applied for prediction of digeps to the best of our knowledge the developed web_service is the first tool that allows the prediction of drug_induced changes in gene_expression based on the structural formulae of chemical_compounds drug like organic_compounds based on their structural formula pass is based on the use of bayesian_approach and multilevel neighborhoods of atom descriptors for representation of a molecule structure it was earlier shown that the bayesian_approach used in pass being selected by comparison of many mathematical algorithms for analysis of structureactivity relationships overtakes them by accuracy of prediction and robustness a freely_available web_service for prediction of the biological_activity spectra for drug like molecules on the basis of pass technology http www way drug com passonline was developed earlier pass prediction results are represented by the list of activities with probabilities to be active pa and to be inactive pi the list is arranged in a descending order of papi thus the more probable changes of gene_expression are at the top of the list the list can be shortened at any desirable cutoff value but pa is used by default in this case both the chance to confirm the predicted digeps by the experiment and the number of false_positive are reasonable the detailed_description of pass approach is represented in the supplementary_material during pass training we selected the activities with three and more active_compounds and with receiver_operating roc area under an roc_curve auc values_calculated by leave_one procedure to reach accurate and robust results of digep prediction the average_accuracy of prediction for mrna based training_set of genes up and down regulations and for protein based training_set of genes up and down regulations was and respectively the accuracy of prediction for each activity is represented in the supplementary_material such accuracy is reasonable for application of digep pred to make prediction for new compounds input_data include the structural formula presented as mol file or smiles or can be drawn by marvinsketch input_data are sent to pass service that makes digep prediction on the basis of above_mentioned training_sets the prediction results are kept in mysql_database web_service through php scripts and appropriate links provides a possibility for a user to save digep prediction results as sdf or csv files one can use either mrna or protein based prediction or both the service provides links between gene names in predicted digeps and ctd site which simplifies the interpretation of predicted results because of access to the relationships of genes with diseases side_effects and biological_pathways digep prediction for captopril angiotensin_converting used as antihypertensive_drug that was not included in the training_sets was analyzed by ctd data the relationships between genes from predicted digep and hypertension ren cat agt and apoa and known side_effects mediguard https www mediguard org medication side_effects captopril fetal_death tmem b plxna pcdh mybl dizziness wipi agt ren fatigue tmem b c orf wipi tob ren cough ren were found apart from analysis between the changes of single gene_expression and diseases the results of digep prediction may be used as input_data of the methods based on cmap approach for drugs without known experimentally_determined microarray_data
