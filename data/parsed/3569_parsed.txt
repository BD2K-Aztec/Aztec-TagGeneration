systems_biology pinalog a novel approach to align protein_interaction implications for complex detection and function prediction motivation analysis of proteinprotein_interaction ppins at the system level has become increasingly important in understanding biological_processes comparison of the interactomes of different species not only provides a better understanding of species evolution but also helps with detecting conserved functional components and in function prediction method and results here we report a ppin alignment_method called pinalog which combines information from protein_sequence function and network_topology alignment of human and yeast ppins reveals several conserved subnetworks between them that participate in similar biological_processes notably the proteasome and transcription related processes pinalog has been tested for its power in protein complex prediction as well as function prediction comparison with psi_blast in predicting protein_function in the twilight zone also shows that pinalog is valuable in predicting protein_function availability_and the pinalog web_server is freely_available from http www sbg bio ic ac uk pinalog the pinalog program and associated data are available from the download section of the web_server in recent_years there has been a substantial increase in the quantity of proteinprotein_interactions ppis being detected by experimental methods the analysis of ppi_networks ppins at the system level has become increasingly important in understanding biological_processes comparison of the interactomes of different species not only provides a better understanding of species evolution but also helps with detecting conserved functional components and in function prediction several methods have been developed to align interactomes both globally and locally most of which use sequence_similarity or network_topology or both in establishing the equivalence pathblast marked the first local alignment_method and was similar in principle to the blast_search algorithm to whom correspondence should be addressed other local alignment_methods include networkblast which is the next generation of pathblast mawish which adopts the evolutionary_models of match mismatch and deletion of the proteins graemlin which infers an alignment from network modules the bayesian_method the match and split algorithm and phunkee which aligns proteins based on sequence and context in the networks the global_alignment of networks proves to be more challenging due to the complexity and scale of the problem graemlin formulates a model for protein duplication deletion and mutation and aligns the network progressively using a hill climbing algorithm the markovrandom field based method and isorank solve the problem by eigenvalue based_methods graal uses only the network topological_similarity to align the networks using a seed and extend method for graph alignment in many applications of ppin alignment the underlying objective is to equivalence proteins with related function and interacting_partners however in most alignment_methods only the sequence_data or network_topology are used to align the input networks despite the availability of other sources of information such as function_annotation or gene_expression while sequences are informative in elucidating the orthologous relationships of proteins across species they do not necessarily indicate functional_similarity the omission of function information could therefore result in many pairs of equivalenced proteins having little or no similarity of function this in turn makes it less accurate in detecting conserved functional_modules or predicting protein_function recently have introduced functional_similarity of proteins into a local alignment_method they used functional_similarity in combination with sequence_similarity in the local_alignment match and split algorithm and identified similar functional subnetworks the recently_developed method mi_graal presents a global_alignment algorithm in which different information can be incorporated such as topological_features sequence_similarity and functional_similarity however there has been no assessment on how the inclusion of functional_similarity might influence the resulting alignments and any subsequent applications here we describe pinalog a global_network algorithm pinalog forms the alignment between two ppins based on the similarities of protein_sequence and the protein_function between the two networks functional_similarity is formalizedalthough many methods have been developed to align ppins comparing their performance remains difficult due to the absence of an unambiguous correct alignment the complexity of the networks and the differing aims of the alignment_methods for local alignment_methods the difficulty is less severe as some local_alignments can be evaluated by their agreement with known protein_complexes however this approach is less useful to evaluate global alignment_methods often assessment is performed based on the correctness of mapping orthologous protein pairs however this assessment measure would always penalize equivalences based on network_topology when this conflicts with equivalences between orthologous pairs therefore this assessment method is not ideal in evaluating the performance of network_alignment accordingly we have also used a series of other measures pinalog is flexible in allowing the use of sequence only alignment or sequence function alignment depending on the requirement of the user for the sequence function alignment parameters are automatically calculated from the input species and this will help non experts when aligning two species where one or both species are poorly_annotated alignment might be biased towards aligning well annotated proteins whose functions are similar then it is advisable that sequence and network_topology only are used to align the networks to avoid bias we are developing a version of pinalog to perform alignment of ppins from multiple species a web_server for pinalog is available allowing users to upload necessary information and receive alignment results by email and by a link to the results file http www sbg bio ic ac uk pinalog the computing time of the alignment process depends on the size of the input networks the typical computing time is h with the longest run in our assessment being the human yeast alignment which takes h on a computer with ghz processor with gb_memory see_supplementary given the importance of the resulting alignment this time is acceptable the code for pinalog is available from the website download section
