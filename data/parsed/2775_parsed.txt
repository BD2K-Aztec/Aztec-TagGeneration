data_and magecomet web_application for harmonizing existing large_scale experiment descriptions motivation meta_analysis of large gene_expression obtained from public_repositories requires consistently annotated data curation of such experiments however is an expert activity which involves repetitive manipulation of text existing_tools for automated curation are few which bottleneck the analysis_pipeline results we present magecomet a web_application for biologists and annotators that facilitates the re annotation of gene_expression experiments in mage tab format it incorporates data_mining automatic_annotation use of ontologies and data validation to improve the consistency and quality of experimental meta_data from the arrayexpress repository availability_and source and tutorials forthe amount of experimental_data in public_repositories is accumulating at an ever increasing rate thanks to the advents of highthroughput technologies meta_analysis of these data are limited by the availability of harmonized consistently annotated data in machine_readable formats in the study of gene_expression mage tab is a commonly used file_format that provides flexibility and structure for describing experimental_data assays in the magetab format can be explicitly annotated with characteristics and experimental_variables which in turn are referenced to ontologies to provide explicit meaning public_repositories such as the arrayexpress archive house over experiments in the mage tab format which is also used by the tcga project the ability to perform meta_analyses requires considerable investment in human re annotation harmonization and mapping of data from different labs to single ontologies due to the spreadsheet nature of mage tab it is a convenient bridge between readability and interoperability but meta_analysis is faster if formatting to whom correspondence should be addressed validation ontology enrichment and common editing tasks are addressed within the application this addresses bottlenecks in the re annotation_process and allows users to extract implicit meta_data quickly from pre_existing mage tab documents and add to this in a convenient editing environment we present magecomet a web_application for curators that provides semi_automatic tools for annotating existing mage tab documents we have used it to curate hundreds of datasets imported into arrayexpress from geo
