gene_expression m as o menos a simple sign averaging method for discrimination in genomic_data analysis motivation the successful translation of genomic_signatures into clinical_settings relies on good discrimination between patient subgroups many sophisticated algorithms have been proposed in the statistics and machine_learning literature but in practice simpler algorithms are often used however few simple algorithms have been formally described or systematically investigated results we give a precise_definition of a popular simple method we refer to as m as o menos which calculates prognostic_scores for discrimination by summing standardized predictors weighted by the signs of their marginal associations with the outcome we study its behavior theoretically in simulations and in an extensive analysis of independent gene_expression studies of bladder breast_and altogether totaling patients with survival_outcomes we find that despite its simplicity m as o menos can achieve good discrimination_performance it performs no worse and sometimes better than popular and much more cpu intensive methods for discrimination including lasso and ridge_regression availability_and m as o menos is implemented for survival analysis as an option in the survhd package available from http www bitbucket org lwaldron survhd and submitted to bioconductor the successful translation of genomic_signatures into clinical_settings relies on good discrimination between patient subgroups that should receive different clinical_management relatively sophisticated methods such as penalized_regression support_vector random_forests bagging and boosting have seen detailed treatments in the statistics and machine_learning literature b uhlmann and van_de sch olkopf and however in practice many researchers prefer simpler algorithms a systematic meta_analysis of prognostic_models for late_stage ovarian_cancer found that the most common methods in the field and those used to generate the best performing models on independent datasets were of the univariate ensemble type where results of univariate regressions are aggregated to formulate a risk_score the simplest of the univariate ensemble class of prediction_methods sets the coefficients of a linear risk_score for standardized covariates equal to the signs of their univariate associations with the clinical_outcome of interest in other words for survival analysis it produces a risk_score equal to the sum of the bad_prognosis features minus the sum of the good prognosis features this method and closely_related variants can be found in the top clinical bioinformatic and general science journals and in commercially_available prognostic gene_signatures such as the myprs signature for multiple_myeloma prognosis it has even been proposed in a formula free article as a practical algorithm that can be performed in a spreadsheet with the software and skill_sets available to the cancer biologist despite the popularity and apparent effectiveness of this simplest of methods to our knowledge it has never been formally described or systematically investigated we give a precise_definition of the procedure and study its behavior theoretically in simulations and in an extensive analysis of independent gene_expression studies of bladder breast_and altogether totaling patients with survival_outcomes we provide theoretical arguments that this method has good discrimination power and low_variability when positively correlated features tend to have the same directions of marginal association with outcome in simulations under a variety of sparsity and covariance structures it performs competitively with lasso and ridge_regression under all situations except the unlikely scenario of independent features and was more than an order of magnitude faster in application to survival analysis of three large microarray databases it performed better than lasso and ridge_regression in two of three cancer_types and comparably in the third we refer to the method as m aso menos because in spanish the phrase m as o menos means both plus or minus describing the methods implementation to whom correspondence should be addressed and so so describing its theoretically non optimal but still practically useful discrimination_ability we have studied m as o menos a simple_algorithm for classification and discrimination that has seen popular adoption but has not been formally investigated we gave a precise_definition of the algorithm showed theoretically and in simulations that it can perform well and demonstrated in an extensive analysis of real cancer gene_expression studies that it can achieve good discrimination_performance in realistic settings even compared with lasso and ridge_regression our results provide some justification to support its widespread use in practice we hope our work will help shift the emphasis of ongoing prediction modeling efforts in genomics from the development of complex models to the more important issues of study_design model interpretation and independent_validation one reason why m as o menos is comparable with more sophisticated methods such as penalized_regression may be that we often use a prediction model trained on one set of patients to discriminate between subgroups in an independent sample usually collected from a slightly different population and processed in a different laboratory this cross study variation is not captured by standard theoretical_analyses so theoretically optimal methods may not perform well in real applications proposed a method for giving a realistic measure of the practical utility of algorithms in the presence of cross study variation at the same time we found using cross_validation experiments that even within the
