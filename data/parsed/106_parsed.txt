genome_analysis act aggregation and correlation toolbox for analyses of genome tracks we have implemented aggregation and correlation toolbox act an efficient multifaceted toolbox for analyzing continuous signal and discrete region tracks from high_throughput genomic experiments such as rna_seq or chip_chip signal profiles from the encode and modencode projects or lists of single_nucleotide from the genomes_project it is able to generate aggregate profiles of a given track around a set of specified anchor points such as transcription_start it is also able to correlate related tracks and analyze them for saturationi e how much of a certain feature is covered with each new succeeding experiment the act site contains downloadable code in a variety of formats interactive web_servers for use on small quantities of data example datasets documentation and a gallery of outputs here we explain the components of the toolbox in more detail and apply them in various contexts there is now an abundance of genome sized data from highthroughput genomic experiments for instance there are chip_chip chip_seq experiments from the encode encode_project and modencode modencode consortium projects there are also genome sequence_data that can be used to generate tracks measuring sequence content such as the densities of single_nucleotide snps from dbsnp and the genomes_project in most cases the representations of these data take the form of either signal tracks that describe a genomic landscape or distinct region tracks that tag portions of the genome as active the aggregation and correlation toolbox act provides a powerful set of programs that to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as can be applied to any experiments producing data in these formats the ability to analyze_multiple genomic_datasets is important as demonstrated by tools like galaxy act provides a unique set of functionality that complements existing_methods of analysis there are number of additional_analyses that can be done to finetune the output of act for instance it is possible to use the online genomic signal aggregator gsa which assigns each genomic_position to the nearest anchor in order to reduce the artifacts caused page
