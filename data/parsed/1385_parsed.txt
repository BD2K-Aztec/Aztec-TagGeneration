differential rhythmicity detecting altered rhythmicity in biological data motivation biological_rhythms such as rhythms in gene_expression controlled by the cell_cycle or the circadian_clock are important in cell_physiology a common type of experiment compares rhythmicity in tissues or cells either kept under different conditions or having different genotypes such investigations provide insights into underlying_mechanisms as well as functions of rhythms results we present and benchmark a set of statistical and computational_methods for this type of analysis here termed differential rhythmicity analysis the methods detect alterations in rhythm amplitude phase and signal_to in one set of measurements compared to another using these methods we compared circadian_rhythms in liver mrna_expression in mice held under two different lighting_conditions constant_darkness and light_dark cycles respectively this analysis revealed widespread and reproducible amplitude increases in mice kept in light_dark cycles further analysis of the subset of differentially rhythmic transcripts implied the immune system in mediating ambient light_dark cycles to rhythmic transcriptional_activities the methods are suitable for genome or proteome_wide studies and provide rigorous p values against well defined null_hypotheses availability_and the methods were implemented as the accompanying r software_package dodr available on cran biological_rhythms in metabolites or mrna_and include circadian daily_rhythms cell_cycle dependent rhythms and various ultradian rhythms the latter with periods of at most a few hours our research_focus is on circadian_rhythms which have been extensively_studied at the whole transcriptome level especially in mouse_liver and drosophila in mouse_liver thousands of transcripts exhibit rhythmic abundances which lead to rhythmic variations in numerous activities and aspects of cell_physiology l ck and when investigating mrna or protein expression on a genomewide scale rhythmic or not a task is often to compare samples harvested from subjects kept under different conditions undergoing different treatments or having different genotypes all these hereafter termed groups from each sample thousands of transcript or protein abundances may be estimated using technologies such as microarray expression_profiling rna_sequencing or mass_spectrometry on the data analysis side this routinely leads to the wellknown differential_expression problem in a basic differential_expression problem the researcher compares transcriptome metabolome or proteomewide expression_profiles or abundances of two groups each consisting of a few biological_replicates the objective is to identify metabolites transcripts or proteins whose concentrations or expression levels are significantly different between the two groups for studies on biological_rhythms on a transcriptome metabolome or proteome_wide scale samples are typically harvested from animals at different time points over a time span covering one or more period lengths when studying circadian_rhythms this entails for instance harvesting samples every or h over a time span of or h samples are often taken from animals either synchronized to h light h dark cycles or they may be taken from animals kept in constant_darkness the former condition allows detection of rhythms that are generated by the cellular core circadian_clock a small network of transcription factors_influencing their own expression present in all cells by the central circadian system acting upon the tissue in mammals the central system consists of the suprachiasmatic_nuclei in the hypothalamus or directly by the light cues via various mechanisms the latter condition allows the isolation of rhythms generated by the intrinsic circadian_clock either the cellular clock or the central circadian system in this way thousands of time series of features are obtained these time series have to be analyzed_statistically to isolate features whose levels vary in a circadian fashion suitable statistical_tests such as parametric harmonic regression_method spectral based_methods or nonparametric methods such as jtk cycle or rain are employed for this purpose many other methods exist as reviewed previously these tests result in a p value for each feature e g transcript for the null_hypothesis that its expression_level does not vary in a rhythmic fashion p values are then corrected for multiple testing and the investigator may then isolate a set of rhythmic transcripts of interest with a specified false_discovery fdr parametric methods are able to detect weaker rhythms they are more powerful than non parametric methods however parametric methods rely on stricter assumptions often measurement errors must have gaussian_distributions and the methods are sensible to outliers non parametric methods sacrifice some degree of power in order to gain robustness against outliers and they make fewer assumptions about measurement errors often transcriptome or metabolome wide circadian_rhythm studies compare two groups which leads to the subject matter of the present article one example is comparison of wild_type animals to mutant_animals with various deletions of core_clock transcription_factor genes such studies may allow isolating the contributions to the circadian transcriptome from various sources another example is comparative_studies of animals subjected to various nutritional challenges these studies all have a certain analytical task in common to detect changes in rhythmicity in many metabolites or transcripts here we will refer to this task as the differential rhythmicity problem to detect e g differentially rhythmic transcripts researchers have the typically isolated rhythmic transcripts in both groups using p value or fdr cutoffs against the null_hypothesis of no rhythmicity in each group transcripts with p values falling under the cutoff in one group and over the cutoff in the other group are then considered differentially rhythmic in principle the two cutoffs may also be chosen differently for each group in order for the procedure to be more conservative for example in order to detect transcripts whose rhythms have been lost in mutant_animals one may require a p value smaller than for wild_type animals and a p value greater than in mutant_animals additional_criteria might be employed too such as fold changes between peaks and troughs another approach to the differential rhythmicity problem was taken by investigators researching core_clock transcripts in two different rat_strains amplitudes were estimated with confidence_intervals for each transcript and strain using a non parametric method transcripts for which the confidence_intervals did not overlap were classified as differentially rhythmic unfortunately fdrs or p values for these approaches against reasonable null_hypotheses i e no change in rhythmicity between the groups have not been presented or computed routinely since a comprehensive framework for this task has been lacking in the field changes of phase peak time may also be of interest as was the case for a study on the effects of high_fat on the circadian transcriptome and metabolome although a rigorous method to estimate and assign p values to phase_shifts is lacking here we report a unified_framework for the estimation and detection of changes in rhythmicity both amplitudes and phases we present both parametric methods for the task as well as rank based_methods that are robust to outliers and non gaussian variations and measurement_error these methods were implemented as an accompanying r package called dodr the procedures were thoroughly benchmarked and compared to p value cutoff methods we also report an application of dodr to mrna expression_profiles of livers of mice kept in h light h dark conditions and in constant_darkness respectively by doing this we were able to quantify the lightgoverned circadian transcriptome and to implicate the transcription_factor irf in relaying light cues to the liver
