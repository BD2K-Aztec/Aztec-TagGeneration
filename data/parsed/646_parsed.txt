sequence_analysis baiucas a novel blast_based algorithm for the identification of upstream_open with conserved amino_acid and its application to the arabidopsis_thaliana genome motivation upstream_open uorfs are often found in the untranslated_regions of eukaryotic messenger_rnas some uorfs have been shown to encode functional peptides involved in the translational regulation of the downstream main orfs comparative genomic_approaches have been used in genome_wide searches for uorfs encoding bioactive_peptides and by comparing uorf sequences between a few selected species or among a small group of species uorfs with conserved amino_acid ucass have been identified in plants mammals and insects regulatory_regions within uorf encoded peptides that are involved in translational_control are typically amino_acids detection of homology between such short regions largely depends on the selection of species for comparison to maximize the chances of identifying ucass with short conserved_regions we devised a novel algorithm for homology_search among a large number of species and the automatic selection of uorfs conserved in a wide_range of species results in this study we developed the baiucas blast_based algorithm for identification of ucass method and identified novel arabidopsis uorfs whose amino_acid are conserved across diverse eudicot species which include uorfs not found in previous comparative_genomic studies due to low sequence_conservation among species therefore baiucas is a powerful method for the identification of ucass and it is particularly useful for the detection of uorfs with a small number of conserved_amino upstream_open uorfs are small orfs located in the untranslated_regions utrs of many eukaryotic mrnas recent genome_wide analyses revealed that of eukaryotic_genes contain one or more uorfs to whom correspondence should be addressed the presence of a uorf can modulate the translational_efficiency of the downstream main orf morf regulatory_roles of uorfs have been demonstrated in processes such as the stress_response and feedback regulation of biosynthesis although the effects of most uorfs seem to be independent of their amino_acid several uorfs have been shown to affect the translation of the morf in an amino_acid dependent_manner for example in the translational feedback regulation of the neurospora_crassa arg gene which encodes the small_subunit of arginine specific carbamoyl_phosphate the residue nascent peptide encoded by the arg uorf causes ribosome stalling at the stop_codon of the uorf in response to arginine resulting in translational_repression of the morf in plants uorfs with conserved amino_acid ucass have been reported to be involved in the translational regulation of four arabidopsis_thaliana genes and the importance of uorf encoded amino_acid has been demonstrated in the translational regulation of the samdc and bzip genes although uorfs present only in a limited number of species can have a regulatory_role it is more likely that evolutionarily_conserved uorfs have a regulatory_function therefore to identify uorfs with potential regulatory_roles genome_wide searches for conserved uorfs have been conducted using comparative genomic_approaches in various organisms including mammals yeasts plants insects and fungi some of these studies searched for ucass to identify peptide sequence_dependent regulatory uorfs in plants hayden and jorgensen identified groups of ucass by comparing uorf sequences between orthologous_genes of a thaliana and rice additionally they found seven groups of ucass by comparing a thaliana paralogous genes these ucass were referred to as conserved peptide uorfs cpus in mammals uorf sequences were comparedin this study we developed baiucas a novel algorithm to identify ucass and identified novel ucass in a thaliana using baiucas the main_feature of baiucas is the comparison of uorf sequences with est_sequences from a large number of species and the selection of uorfs conserved across multiple taxonomic categories this feature increases the chances of identifying ucass compared with conventional comparative genomic_approaches in which the uorf sequences are compared between a few selected species because baiucas can identify a ucas even if it is not conserved in certain species in fact conserved uorfs corresponding to some of the ucass were not found in certain taxonomic_groups for example although the at g ucas is conserved in dicots and monocots corresponding conserved uorfs were only found in solanales among asterids which is one of two large eudicot groups in addition although the at g ucas is conserved in angiosperms and gymnosperms no corresponding conserved uorf was found in homologous_genes of monocots this feature of baiucas is considered particularly advantageous for the identification of conserved uorfs with only a small number of conserved_amino because detection of the homology of such uorfs is largely dependent on the selection of species for comparison in fact we identified ucass such as at g and at g with relatively short conserved_sequences in addition we identified ucass such as at g and at g with relatively low sequence_conservation in a thaliana and only a small number of conserved_amino in this study we tested two selection_criteria in the fourth step of baiucas and demonstrated that by using different selection_criteria regarding taxonomic categories baiucas can extract uorfs conserved among different ranges of taxonomic_groups although the selection of uorfs conserved among smaller taxonomic_groups i e categories i and ii increased the risk of extracting uorfs whose sequences are retained at the nucleotide level such a selection led us to identify ucass more comprehensively the ucass identified in this study can be classified into the following two groups according to sequence_conservation patterns i uorfs with highly_conserved c terminal regions and perfectly conserved stop_codon positions and ii uorfs in which the entire sequences or the n_terminal and middle regions are conserved group i is composed of groups of ucass f g h l k m n o and p whereas group_ii consists of seven ucass c d e i j and q in contrast to the group i ucass the position of the stop_codons is not perfectly conserved in the group_ii ucass and differences in several codons of the stop_codon positions are observed among species the features of the group i ucass are consistent with those of previously_reported sequencedependent regulatory uorfs in some of which the importance of the c terminal amino_acid for translational regulation has been experimentally demonstrated for two of these regulatory uorfs cryo_electron analyses have shown that the c terminal regions of the uorf encoded nascent peptides interact with the ribosomal exit tunnel when ribosome stalling occurs to assess whether the amino_acid of the ucass identified in this study indeed have a regulatory_function experimental_validation is necessary for example this can be validated by comparing the effects of amino_acid alterations and synonymous codon changes of uorfs on translation of the morfs in addition to the identification of the ucass we also demonstrated that baiucas could extract of the previously_identified cpus taking these cpus into account baiucas could extract a thaliana ucass which are classified into homology groups although baiucas failed to extract of the cpus the reason why five of these were not extracted is that they did not fit one of our conditions that the amino_acid and the stop_codon position of a uorf must be conserved in the multiple eudicot categories additionally two of the cpus were eliminated because of the condition that a uorf must not be within an morf of a splice_variant in the sixth step two of the cpus were not extracted because of low conservation in the n_terminal region of the morf encoded_protein in this study to assess whether a thaliana uorfs and their tblastn hit ests are derived from homologous_genes we directly compared a thaliana protein_sequences and amino_acid encoded by putative partial morfs within the est_sequences if the protein database expands to include a greater variety of plant_species in the future an alternative approach would be possible in which full_length protein_sequences corresponding to partial morfs within the ests are compared with a thaliana protein_sequences such an approach may increase the number of conserved uorfs that are identifiable by baiucas in conclusion this study demonstrated that baiucas is a powerful method for the identification of ucass that makes it possible to more comprehensively identify_conserved uorfs than conventional comparative genomic_approaches because baiucas is particularly useful for the identification of conserved uorfs with a small number of conserved_amino the algorithms used in baiucas can be applied to the identification of short bioactive_peptides besides uorf encoded peptides such as peptide_hormones
