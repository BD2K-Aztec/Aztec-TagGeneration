sequence_analysis the scramble conversion tool motivation the reference cram file_format implementation is in java we present scramble a new c implementation of sam bam and cram file i o results the c implementation of for cram is slower than bam at decoding but faster at encoding we see file size savings of availability_and source_code is available at http sourceforge net_projects staden files io lib under the bsd software licence storage capacity has been the primary driver behind the development of the cram format the cram format is a practical implementation of reference based compression and is a viable alternative to the earlier bam format cram is now the preferred submission format for the european nucleotide archive the initial cram prototype was in python quickly followed by a picard http picard sourceforge net compatible java reference implementation https www ebi ac uk ena about cram toolkit we identified a need for a c implementation which was implemented as part of the staden packages io lib library our primary conversion tool is named scramble it can read and write sam bam and cram formats using a unified application_programming api we have demonstrated that the c implementation of cram performs well beating samtools picard and cramtools for encoding speed decoding speed is not as efficient as samtools but is still comparable with picard and nearly twice as fast as the java cram implementation also notable is that the nature of cram means some read operations for example flagstat and index are faster than with bam cram is not yet capable of achieving the top compression_ratios using bits base with quality bins and bits base with bins compared against only and for fqz comp and bits per read name in cram versus bits in fqz comp this demonstrates room for improvement in future cram versions partially achieved by replacing zlib with arithmetic coding or an asymmetric numerical system scramble is not a drop in replacement for the samtools api however a port of the cram components of scramble has been made to the htslib library and is available within samtools version available at https github com samtools
