nextflu real_time tracking of seasonal influenza_virus evolution in humans seasonal influenza_viruses evolve rapidly allowing them to evade immunity in their human_hosts and reinfect previously infected_individuals similarly vaccines against seasonal_influenza need to be updated frequently to protect against an evolving virus population we have thus developed a processing pipeline and browser_based visualization that allows convenient exploration and analysis of the most recent influenza_virus sequence_data this web_application displays a phylogenetic_tree that can be decorated with additional information such as the viral genotype at specific sites sampling location and derived statistics that have been shown to be predictive of future virus dynamics in addition mutation genotype and clade frequency trajectories are calculated and displayed availability_and python and javascript source_code is freely_available from https github com blab nextflu while the web_application is live at http nextflu org every year seasonal_influenza infects between and of the global_population resulting in substantial human morbidity_and vaccination remains the most effective public_health measure to combat seasonal epidemics however influenza_viruses constantly evolve and thereby undergo antigenic_drift allowing drifted viruses to reinfect individuals with acquired_immunity to previously circulating strains owing to antigenic_drift the seasonal_influenza needs frequent updating to remain effective in any given year the particular choice of vaccine_strain plays_a in determining vaccine_efficacy and so it is of critical importance to develop tools to analyze the ongoing evolution of the influenza_virus population in order to aid vaccine_strain selection the program nextflu presents a near real_time display of genetic_relationships among influenza_viruses and allows investigation of currently available sequence_data by visualizing many different genetic and epidemiological_features we hope that nextflu will help vaccine_strain selection currently nextflu tracks all four circulating lineages of seasonal_influenza a h n a h n pdm b victoria and b yamagata in implementation nextflu consists of a processing pipeline written in python called augur that analyzes virus sequence_data and a javascript based browser visualization called auspice that displays this processed information as input augur requires a fasta file of sequences with header labels containing relevant_information such as strain name sampling date and passage history for this purpose influenza sequence_data for the hemagglutinin ha gene is downloaded from the gisaid epiflu database which contains the most up to date collection of seasonal influenza_viruses the first step in the processing pipeline is to automatically select a subset of representative viruses here viruses without complete date or geographic information viruses passaged in eggs and sequences bases are removed in addition local outbreaks are filtered by keeping only one instance of identical_sequences sampled at the same location on the same day following filtering viruses are subsampled to achieve a more equitable temporal and geographic_distribution for our standard display period of years and viruses per month this typically results in viruses for which we align full_length ha sequences where available and partial sequences otherwise using mafft once aligned the set of virus sequences is further cleaned by removing v c the author published_by
