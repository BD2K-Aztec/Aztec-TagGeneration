systems_biology polynomial algebra of discrete models in systems_biology motivation an increasing number of discrete mathematical_models are being published in systems_biology ranging from boolean_network to logical models and petri_nets they are used to model a variety of biochemical_networks such as metabolic_networks gene_regulatory and signal_transduction networks there is increasing evidence that such models can capture key dynamic_features of biological_networks and can be used successfully for hypothesis_generation results this article provides a unified_framework that can aid the mathematical_analysis of boolean_network logical models and petri_nets they can be represented as polynomial dynamical_systems which allows the use of a variety of mathematical tools from computer algebra for their analysis algorithms are presented for the translation into polynomial dynamical_systems examples are given of how polynomial algebra can be used for the model analysis finite dynamical_systems that is discrete dynamical_systems with a finite state_space have been used extensively in systems_biology to model a variety of biochemical_networks such as metabolic_networks gene_regulatory and signal_transduction networks for many such networks the available data quantity and quality is not sufficient to build detailed quantitative_models such as systems of ordinary_differential which require many parameters that are frequently unknown in addition discrete models tend to be more intuitive and easily_accessible to life_scientists there is ample_evidence that such models can capture key dynamic_features of biological_networks and can be used successfully for hypothesis_generation g submitted for publication boolean_networks and their generalization the so_called multistate logical models thomas and d are the main types of finite dynamical_systems that have been used successfully in modeling biological_networks e g petri_nets have also been shown to be a good modeling to whom correspondence should be addressed paradigm for this field e g together these model types represent a large class of discrete models in systems_biology which are capable of simulating deterministic as well as stochastic processes several tools and techniques have been developed to simulate and analyze discrete models for logical models the open_source ginsim http gin univ mrs fr is available and for petri_nets the user has access to a wide_variety of software the laboratory of m heiner provides software with a particular focus on applications to systems_biology http www dssz informatik tucottbus de analysis tools for logical models including boolean_networks are described in in addition to a variety of simulation and visualization_tools other graph_theoretic analysis tools are available for the identification of steady_states and strongly connected components of the regulatory graph there are algorithms to compute dead states steady_states as well as t and p invariants which can be computed via linear algebra methods a survey of the use of petri_nets in systems_biology is given by the purpose of this article is to describe a mathematical framework that encompasses both types of models and makes accessible a broad range of mathematical tools for model analysis in order to complement existing_tools in these domain areas the fundamental observation underlying this framework is that logical models and k bounded petri_nets are particular instantiations of what we shall call algebraic models i e timediscrete dynamical systemswhere each coordinate function f i is a function of the n variables x x n each of which takes on values in a finite set f with algebraic structure and each f i is a polynomial aside from the mathematical simplicity of their definition an important feature of polynomial dynamical_systems is that one can employ a number of mathematical tools for their analysis for our purposes the principle tool is the capability to symbolically solve systems of nonlinear polynomial equations quite efficiently this can be used for instance to compute the steady_states and other features of an algebraic model we give algorithms that translate both logical models and petri_nets into this framework our algorithms are compatible with the algorithm in which translates logical models into petri_nets we furthermore provide several examples using models from the literature of how this translation can be used to analyze their dynamic_properties the article is organized as follows in section we briefly describe polynomial dynamical_systems pdss we then show how to use the algebraic framework in the analysis of logical models andpage the problem of giving mathematical structure to logical models has been studied by several authors e g egri for the purpose of computation and analysis the structure proposed here provides a class of simple and easily defined mathematical objects that can model both logical models and bounded petri_nets it has the advantage that it makes accessible the theoretical concepts algorithms and software from polynomial algebra such as grbner page
