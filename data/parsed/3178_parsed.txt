muscle automated multi objective evolutionary optimization of targeted lc_ms analysis developing liquid_chromatography lc_ms analyses of bio chemicals is both time consuming and challenging largely because of the large number of lc and ms instrument parameters that need to be optimized this bottleneck significantly impedes our ability to establish new bio analytical_methods in fields such as pharmacology metabolomics and pesticide research we report the development of a multi_platform user_friendly software_tool muscle multi_platform unbiased optimization of spectrometry via closed_loop experimentation for the robust and fully_automated multi_objective of targeted lc_ms analysis muscle shortened the analysis times and increased the analytical sensitivities of targeted metab olite analysis which was demonstrated on two different manufacturers lc_ms instruments availability_and available atliquid chromatography mass_spectrometry lc_ms is widely used in analytical laboratories for measuring a range of bio chemicals and as the principal technology for metabolomics and proteomics developing new lc_ms methods and transferring existing_methods between instruments and laboratories are time consuming and challenging mostly because of the large number of lc and ms parameters that require optimization varying all these parameters systematically to optimize the analysis of selected chemicals is generally regarded as impossible because of the large search_space previously a fully_automated closed_loop strategy was reported that successfully optimized gas_chromatography gc_ms and lc_ms methods for non targeted metabolite analyses resulting in increased analytical_sensitivity o although highlighting the value of closed_loop optimization in mass_spectrometry each of these implementations was for a specific manufacturers analytical platform extending this to further instruments would have required extensive reprogramming therefore significantly limiting the deployability of this approach here we present muscle multi_platform unbiased optimization of spectrometry via closed_loop experimentation a software_tool for robust and fully_automated optimization of targeted lc_ms analyses muscle is instrument manufacturer independent and requires no knowledge of computer programming to operate using a process called visual scripting users create a set of configuration scripts which instruct muscle how to operate an lc_ms these scripts can be imported and exported from muscle to facilitate sharing and re use across laboratories
