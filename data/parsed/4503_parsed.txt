synbadm a tool for optimization based automated design of synthetic gene_circuits motivation the design of de_novo circuits with predefined performance specifications is a challenging_problem in synthetic_biology computational_models and tools have proved to be crucial for a successful wet_lab implementation natural gene_circuits are complex subject to evolutionary tradeoffs and playing multiple_roles however most synthetic designs implemented to date are simple and perform a single task as the field progresses advanced computational_tools are needed in order to handle greater levels of circuit complexity in a more flexible way and considering multiple design_criteria results this works presents synbadm synthetic_biology automated optimal_design in matlab a software toolbox for the automatic optimal_design of gene_circuits with targeted functions from libraries of components this tool makes use of global optimization to simultaneously search the space of structures and kinetic_parameters synbadm can efficiently handle high levels of circuit complexity and can consider multiple design_criteria through multiobjective optimization further it provides flexible design capabilities i e the user can define the modeling framework library of components and target performance function s availability_and synbadm runs under the popular matlab computational environment and is available under gplv_license at https sites computer_aided design cad is fundamental in modern engineering during the last decade many efforts in the context of synthetic_biology have been dedicated to incorporate cad as part of the forward engineering design cycle marchisio and huynh and tagkopoulos offer a comprehensive_review of computational_tools for the design of synthetic biological circuits the gec language byand the parts pools framework by are pioneering works conceptualizing modular computational_design of synthetic gene_circuits both tools use search algorithms not based on optimization to explore designs compatible with prespecifications automated design of biocircuits was first formulated as an optimization_problem in optcircuit dasika and maranas including those non intuitive or previously_unknown want to be considered allowing identifying new design principles here we present synbadm synthetic_biology automated optimal_design in matlab a software toolbox that enables to automatically find biocircuit designs with pre specified performance starting from a library of biological_components using global optimization synbadm is developed aiming for optimality modularity biological_diversity and a high_flexibility regarding the target behaviours and components synbadm includes state of the art global mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp optimization solvers with proven efficiency in biocircuit design otero muras and it handles high levels of circuit complexity and incorporates multi objective design to find gene_circuits with best trade_offs between multiple conflicting criteria
