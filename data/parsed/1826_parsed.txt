finding optimal interaction interface alignments between biological complexes motivation biological_molecules perform their functions through interactions with other molecules structure alignment of interaction interfaces between biological complexes is an indispensable step in detecting their structural_similarities which are keys to understanding their evolutionary_histories and functions although various structure alignment_methods have been developed to successfully access the similarities of protein_structures or certain types of interaction interfaces existing alignment tools cannot directly align arbitrary types of interfaces formed by protein dna or rna_molecules specifically they require a blackbox preprocessing to standardize interface types and chain identifiers yet their performance is limited and sometimes unsatisfactory results here we introduce a novel method prosta inter that automatically determines and aligns interaction interfaces between two arbitrary types of complex structures our method uses sequentially remote fragments to search for the optimal superimposition the optimal residue matching problem is then formulated as a maximum weighted bipartite matching problem to detect the optimal sequence_order independent alignment benchmark evaluation on all non redundant proteindna complexes in pdb shows significant performance improvement of our method over tm_align and ialign with the blackbox preprocessing two case studies where our method discovers for the first time structural_similarities between two pairs of functionally_related proteindna complexes are presented we further demonstrate the power of our method on detecting structural_similarities between a proteinprotein_complex and a proteinrna complex which is biologically known as a proteinrna mimicry case availability_and the prosta inter web_server is publicly_available at http www cbrc kaust edu sa prosta structure alignment refers to the process of aligning two or more molecular_structures based on their three_dimensional conformations due to the correlation between the structure and the function of molecules structure alignment is an important step towards understanding the evolutionary_histories and the functions of the molecules of interest especially when only low_sequence exists between molecules with recent experimental advances in solving complex structures composed of multiple molecules different types of interaction interfaces have been extensively_studied including proteinprotein_interfaces proteindna interfaces and proteinrna interfaces biological_molecules perform their functions through interactions with other molecules therefore pairwise_alignment of individual_molecules without considering their interacting_partners in biological complexes may not capture the comprehensive structural_similarities between two complexes pairwise protein_structure the most widely_studied task of structure alignment has been addressed by a variety of methods one limitation shared among these methods is that the output alignment always obeys the sequence_order of the input complex structures however the sequence_order cannot be used safely in interface alignments becausein this article we propose a novel structure alignment_method prosta inter for aligning interaction interfaces formed by protein dna or rna_molecules our method naturally handles multiple types of interfaces multiple chains and multiple interfaces in complexes after employing remote fragments and the mwbm algorithm statistical benchmark evaluation on proteindna complex dataset demonstrates significant improvements over state of the art alignment_methods moreover unreported interface similarities in two pairs of proteindna complexes are discovered we finally illustrate the generic nature of our method through a proteinrna mimicry study we are currentlydeveloping new scoring_functions and applying our method to discover structural relevance of different types of interaction interfaces
