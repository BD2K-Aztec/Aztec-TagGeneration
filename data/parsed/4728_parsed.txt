transposome a toolkit for annotation of transposable_element families from unassembled sequence_reads motivation transposable_elements tes can be found in virtually all eukaryotic_genomes and have the potential to produce evolutionary novelty despite the broad taxonomic distribution of tes the evolutionary_history of these sequences is largely_unknown for many taxa due to a lack of genomic resources and identification methods given that most te annotation methods are designed to work on genome_assemblies we sought to develop a method to provide a fine_grained classification of tes from dna_sequence here we present a toolkit for the efficient annotation of te families from low coverage whole_genome shotgun wgs_data enabling the rapid identification of tes in a large number of taxa we compared our software transposome with other approaches for annotating repeats from wgs_data and we show that it offers significant improvements in run time and produces more precise estimates of genomic repeat abundance genomic repeat annotation is a challenging_task in part because there are dozens of tools available and not all have not been analyzed in terms of performance or accuracy current approaches for identifying transposable_elements tes involve using structural and similarity based_approaches with a genome_assembly mathematical or k_mer based_methods from genome_assemblies or random sequence_reads signature based_methods with annotated tes and cluster based_approaches from unassembled sequence_reads without question the most accurate method for identifying tes would be through a combination of the above methods one caveat with the aforementioned approaches is that most require a reference_genome i e assembled genome as input it is not however practical to generate a reference_genome for every species of interest given that genome sequencing_costs remain prohibitively high for non model species and genome_assembly algorithms are not able to easily resolve large and complex genomes such as those of many plant_species therefore the ideal solution to improving repeat annotation from understudied v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com species would be to leverage high_throughput dna_sequencing enabling phylogenetic descriptions of te properties in many species simultaneously here we present transposome a toolkit that is able to accurately estimate the genomic abundance of te families from very low coverage whole_genome shotgun wgs_data enabling the rapid detection of changes in genome composition across many species transposome borrows much of its design from repeatexplorer a recently_published tool for detecting repeats from wgs_data repeatexplorer provides an easy to use web_interface for users however we found this tool to be computationally inefficient and the design is not modular which makes analyses of multiple species and designing custom pipelines impractical transposome builds on the basic approach of repeatexplorer which is finding similarity in the genome through a graph_based analysis of similarity between wgs reads we extend this approach in transposome to provide a more fine_scale level of annotation of genomic repeats and we provide direct estimates of genomic repeat abundance in biological terms we demonstrate the utility of transposome by analyzing a set of wgs reads from the well studied maize zea_mays l genome and we compare our results to published estimates of genome composition for this species our findings indicate that tranposome is both more accurate at quantifying genomic repeats and more efficient than other approaches supplementary how effectively are we sampling the genomic_diversity of repetitive_elements to address_this we sampled sequence_data from maize at varying levels of genome_coverage and performed an analysis with transposome using default_parameters on each read set see supplementary_information as we know what fraction of the maize genome is comprised of tes we were also able to assess the total fraction of diversity being sampled at varying levels of genome_coverage i e the total percent of the genome the maize genome is tes with approximately of the genome being composed of just te families with just randomly_sampled paired_end sequences see supplementary_information transposome was able to correctly identify of the top families with the top families being correctly_identified as in albeit with minor reordering supplementary we note that transposome also generates estimates of genomic repeat abundance faster than other annotation procedures supplementary how many sequence_reads are required to capture the majority of the tes by genome_coverage it is clear that transposome is able to accurately_predict the abundance of tes and the number of te families by rank that account for that genome abundance supplementary this result indicates that it is not necessary to have high genome_coverage sequence_data i e in order to predict the genomic abundance of te families though increasing_coverage will yield more accurate estimates of te diversity and family level abundance
