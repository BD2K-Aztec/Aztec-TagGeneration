somaticsniper identification of somatic_point in whole_genome sequencing_data the sequencing of tumors and their matched normals is frequently used to study the genetic_composition of cancer despite this fact there remains a dearth of available software_tools designed to compare sequences in pairs of samples and identify sites that are likely to be unique to one sample results in this article we describe the mathematical basis of our somaticsniper software for comparing tumor and normal pairs we estimate its sensitivity and precision and present several common sources of error resulting in miscalls availability_and binaries are freely_available for download atsecond generation sequencing_technologies have been applied to several cancer_types to identify somatic_mutations in an unbiased genome_wide in terms of raw numbers the most common somatic alteration is the single_nucleotide snv these studies have proceeded by utilizing a variety of methods for identifying somatic snvs and have used the number and distribution of such changes in the genome to infer the driving_forces behind tumorigenesis as well as the degree to which tumors have been altered in addition the detection of these changes within coding_regions led to the discovery of candidate driver_mutations in genes such as dnmt a idh foxl and arid a the strategy used to identify somatic snvs has varied among studies but ultimately has hinged on the direct comparison of sequences from the tumor and matched normal_tissue either during discovery or validation previous_studies have relied on simple subtractions of tumor and normal genotype_calls to determine somatic status hard thresholds on read support or individual processing of genomes followed by comparison of likelihoods our own approach has revolved around the whole_genome wgs of the tumor and matched normal to depths of x x and subsequent comparison to discover mutations specific to the tumor in addition our initial focus on leukemia prompted consideration of sample impurities and their implications for the detection of snvs here we present our software somaticsniper which employs a bayesian comparison of the genotype likelihoods in the tumor and normal as determined by the germline genotyping algorithm implemented in the maq software_package we test the algorithm on simulated_data to estimate its detection_power additionally we evaluate our associated somatic snv detection pipeline on external data for sensitivity and on internal validation_data for an estimation of precision finally we examine sequence_features associated with an elevated false_positive especially the beginning of illuminas read segment quality_control indicator which is an extended run of base_quality q bases at the end of a read as a result of our work sequencing leukemia genomes we developed a method for identifying potentially somatic_mutations our algorithm previously referred to as glfsomatic manuscript category original paper explicitly calculates the likelihood of genotype difference between two genomes at all positions with coverage in both and reports variants in the tumor along with a somatic score a phred scaled value indicating the likelihood that the site is not somatic the detection of somatic snvs in tumors is an important part of tumor resequencing because these mutations can be directly relevant to the disease and are the most numerous one method of discovering somatic snvs is to compare the sequencing results between a matched tumor and normal pair to this end we developed somaticsniper to directly compare the tumor and normal reads and calculate the probability that the two samples have identical genotypes in both samples our simulations on the algorithm show that it should be able to detect most mutations if the mutation is present in the majority of cells and the normal is relatively pure we have evaluated somaticsniper on external data and found it to be more sensitive than other methods and based on the total number of calls of comparable specificity additionally we have explored the precision of our algorithm by validating predicted somatic_mutations on internally_generated data in contrast to our simulations which suggested an fdr if mapping error is non existent this validation experiment demonstrated a higher fdr our subsequent investigations revealed a number of reliable indicators that a predicted variant was in fact not real most interestingly we identify an association of false_positive bases with the illumina q base_quality designation this new feature may also prove useful in other false_positive reduction techniques such as base_quality recalibration by implementing some statistical and empirical filters we were able to greatly_increase the validation rate on both our training_set and four independent datasets with only a small number of validated somatic_mutations failing the filters while our precision is low on the aml sample this is expected since there are a smaller number of detectable events due to both tumor_cells in the normal sample and a lower mutation_rate for this cancer type in solid_tumors where neither problem is likely to be as severe we expect that the precision should be similar to that observed on the tested breast_cancer tumors despite the success of somaticsniper on the colo data this dataset represents an ideal case for somatic snv calling and there remains room for improvement in future work since colo is a cell_line it represents the simple case of a perfectly pure homogenous tumor with a perfectly pure homogenous matched normal cancer projects will rarely work with such an ideal sample and tumors can be expected to contain multiple subclones with varying expected allele_frequencies depending on their site_specific copy_number and abundance within the tissue_sample indeed the internal data with which we evaluated our precision were obtained from a patient with a high white_blood cells per microliter and our data indicate that of the cells from the normal sample were in fact tumor in addition the tumor sample will likely be impure in many cases while the matched normal can be expected to be free of tumor_cells for most samples this may not always be the case especially for liquid tumors that circulate into all tissues and for solid_tumors where the matched normal_tissue is obtained from adjacent_tissue our simulation_studies demonstrate the rapid decline of detection_power that occurs when the normal sample contains tumor_cells this is due in part to the assumptions of the maq genotyping model underlying somaticsniper which currently operates by ignoring the copy_number state and sample purity this is true for snvmix as well since it derives its expected genotype_frequencies from training on germline variants optionally our caller can take into account the prior_knowledge that somatic snvs are expected to be rare although our testing suggests that incorporating such a penalty significantly_reduces the sensitivity of the algorithm at current wgs coverage levels supplementary as outlined above these assumptions are inappropriate for optimal somatic snv calling and future improvements in somatic snv calling must take these issues into account sites predicted to be somatic by our method will include both true mutations and some false_positives the number_of is likely to be a function of the quality of the reference_sequence the alignments the data_quality and the ability to accurately provide error estimates to the software while our filters increase precision fully specified error models or adjustments to the error estimates provided in the mapping qualities and base qualities of the data ought to improve the specificity and sensitivity of these filters
