structural_bioinformatics ccbuilder an interactive web_based for building designing and assessing coiled_coil protein assemblies motivation the ability to accurately model protein_structures at the atomistic level underpins efforts to understand protein_folding to engineer natural proteins predictably and to design proteins de_novo homology based_methods are well established and produce impressive_results however these are limited to structures presented by and resolved for natural proteins addressing this problem more widely and deriving truly ab_initio models requires mathematical descriptions for protein_folds the means to decorate these with natural engineered or de_novo sequences and methods to score the resulting models results we present ccbuilder a web_based application that tackles the problem for a defined but large class of protein_structure the helical coiled_coils ccbuilder generates coiled_coil backbones builds side_chains onto these frameworks and provides a range of metrics to measure the quality of the models its straightforward graphical_user provides broad functionality that allows users to build and assess models in which helix geometry coiled_coil architecture and topology and protein_sequence can be varied rapidly we demonstrate the utility of ccbuilder by assembling models for coiled_coil structures from the pdb which cover of the known coiled_coil types and by generating models for rarer and de_novo coiled_coil structures availability_and ccbuilder is freely_available without registration atthe accurate prediction and modelling of protein_structures remain key_challenges in structural_bioinformatics advances here enable applications in protein_folding design and engineering where sequence_information needs to be translated to give insight into protein_structure function and mutation however given the degrees_of inherent in polypeptide_chains the modelling of all potential structures that a sequence even of modest length could adopt is intractable computationally therefore it is necessary to restrict the structural space being searched and modelled currently this is done through comparative modelling fold_recognition fragment based recombination or other methods of restricting conformational_space another route is to define the space to be searched by structural parameterization of protein_folds this becomes tractable i if there is a high_probability that a sequence will fall into a broad class of protein_structure and ii if these d structures can be described mathematically to allow robust parameterization the helical coiled_coil is an example of such a protein fold where there are good broad brush links between sequence and the overall structural_class furthermore the backbone architectures can be described by a small number of structural_parameters therefore we have developed a tool for coiled_coil structures that uses parametric modelling coiled_coils are bundles of helices in which component strands wrap around each other to form rope like super helical structures in the simplest cases this is encoded by a relatively straightforward seven residue repeating pattern of hydrophobic h and polar p amino_acids hpphppp often assigned abcdefg this patterning combined with the residues per turn of anhelix generates a hydrophobic stripe that spirals around each helix giving the interface between the component helices the interface is packed tightly together through so_called knobs into holes kih packing where the knob residue on one helix projects into a hole generated by a constellation of four residues on the partner helix despite the relatively straightforward sequence repeat and mode of packing complexity arises because coiled_coils are not limited to the common dimeric trimeric and tetrameric oligomers pentamers a decamer and a dodecamer are observed in nature while there also exist a de_novo hexamer and an engineered heptamer furthermore within these gross architectures the helices can be arranged in parallel antiparallel or mixed topologies and the assemblies can be homo or hetero typic for the lower order assemblies oligomer state is largely dictated by the side_chains that form the a d interface and how they can pack to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the

specification of oligomers above tetramer is less well understood but it is clear that more complex sequence_patterns than hpphppp are required in other words we have a good understanding of how parallel dimers trimers and tetramers are specified by natural sequences and how these can be made de_novo however beyond these there is more to learn although methods are available to model coiled_coils these only generate the helical backbones which severely_limits the modelling prediction and design of coiled_coil structures this is because of the clear link between the make up of helixhelix interfacing residues and coiled_coil oligomer state i e a side chain packing effect which must be captured in models our aim was to improve the modelling and design of coiledcoil sequences and structures and to develop a tool for nonspecialist to perform these tasks while the large database of known coiled_coils has informed and allowed us to test our approach coiled_coil proteins present considerable scope for generating completely de_novo structures this illustrates further the power and potential of this type of structural parametric modelling we set out to create an application that could model as many coiled_coil architectures and topologies as possible that is thoseat the a and d positions with polar_residues at the b c e f and g positions b a single helix from a coiled_coil highlighting the stripe of a d residues grey that forms the assembly interface c kih packing where the knob residue usually a or d from one helix grey projects into a hole created by four residues black on its partner e g dgad or adea d the pitch parameter describes the distance a for a component helix to screw around the super helical axis e the radius of assembly is measured from the super helical axis to the centre of a component helix f interface angle or is measured as the angle between the vector from the super helical axis to the helical centre and the vector from the helical centre to the c carbon of an a position residue c w observed already in nature plus those that are theoretically possible but currently without natural precedents to do this we divided the problem into two parts first to generate backbone models for the many coiled_coil structures possible second to fit and score sequences onto these frameworks ccbuilder is a web_based application that generates complete backbone and side chain atomistic models of heptad based coiled_coils in conformations specified by the user models are scored for feasibility with a measure of backbone strain a test for kih packing and two atom based forcefields a basic builder mode is capable of modelling homo and hetero oligomeric coiled_coils in parallel up to chains and antiparallel even numbered chains up to conformations this covers of coiled_coils in cc with sequence redundancy furthermore an advanced builder mode allows parameters to be specified for individual helices around a super helical axis enabling some of the remaining more unusual coiled_coil conformations to be modelled it also presents opportunities for building models for the many as yet unobserved but theoretically possible coiled_coil structures
