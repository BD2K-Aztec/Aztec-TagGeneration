mybionet interactively visualize edit and merge biological_networks on the web mybionet is a web_based application for biological network_analysis which provides user_friendly web interfaces to visualize edit and merge biological_networks in addition mybionet integrated kegg metabolic_network data from organisms and allows users to search and navigate interesting networks availability_and all kegg metabolic_network data are organized and stored in the mysql_database mybionet is implemented in flex actionscript and php languages and deployed on an apache web_server mybionet is accessible through all the flash embedded browsers atowning to the emergence and rapid_proliferation of new highthroughput sequencing_technologies more and more biological data are produced and are used to infer underlying networks by means of various methods in systems_biology network_visualization can map different sorts of biological_information onto the graph giving researchers new biological_insight in this respect network_visualization is becoming increasingly important for analyzing large_amounts of data developed network visualizations can be roughly classified as either web_based or stand alone traditional web_based visualization_tools e g visant are mostly implemented as java applets whereas a few web_based visualization_tools have been developed using the flash platform that is browser independent and more flexible for users to design their custom templates cytoscape_web is a web_based visualization_tool based on the cytoscape algorithm using the flash platform as a client component to visualize network data on websites another visualization_tool string utilizes the flash platform to visualize proteinprotein_interactions data on a web_server both to whom correspondence should be addressed these applications do not allow users to edit and update a network yworks developed a commercial web_application yfiles flex which integrates complicated graph visualization and editing functionality with an internet application relying on flash player http www yworks com en products yfilesflex about html however this is a canonical network tool not particularly tailored for analyzing biological_networks and in addition it is commercial software in this article we have developed a web_application mybionet on a flash platform mybionet is designed to be a lightweight easy to use web_based for analyzing biological_networks it has important features for biological_network operations including visualization editing and merging networks kegg metabolic_networks are integrated into mybionet allowing users to search and navigate the kegg data conveniently
