gene_expression dslice an r package for nonparametric testing of associations with application in qtl and gene_set many statistical problems in bioinformatics and genetics can be formulated as the testing of associations between a categorical variable and a continuous variable a dynamic slicing method was proposed for non parametric dependence testing which has been demonstrated to have higher powers compared with traditional_methods such as kolmogorovsmirnov test we introduce an r package dslice to facilitate the use of dynamic slicing method in bioinformatic applications such as quantitative_trait study and gene_set often in biological studies we need to test whether the underlying distributions of two or more populations are different from each other on the basis of independent samples from these populations the k sample test problem is equivalent to testing whether the value of an observation is independent of its label indicator i e which sample it comes from traditional_methods such as the t test and the rank_sum can only test differences in means or medians on the other hand classic omnibus testing methods such as kolmogorovsmirnov test have limited_power in detecting differences between distributions of different types proposed an omnibus k sample testing method based on regularized likelihood_ratio and dynamic slicing here we refer to the test_statistic as ds statistic and demonstrated its statistical_power compared with some existing well known methods through extensive_simulation here we introduce an r package dslice that implements this novel dynamic slicing ds method for nonparametric_tests and makes it a versatile statistical tool for applications in quantitative_trait qtl study and gene_set gsea testing of associations between a categorical variable and a continuous response is a frequently_encountered statistical problem in bioinformatics r package dslice implements a recently_proposed nonparametric dependency detection method although we use qtl and gene_set as examples to demonstrate the use of dslice it can be applied to other biological_problems such as protein
