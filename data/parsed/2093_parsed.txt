databases_and go module functional synthesis and improved interpretation of gene_ontology patterns go module is a web accessible synthesis and visualization_tool developed for end_user biologists to greatly simplify the interpretation of prioritized gene_ontology go terms go module radically reduces the complexity of raw go results into compact biomodules in two distinct ways by i constructing biomodules from significant go terms based on hierarchical knowledge and ii refining the go terms in each biomodule to contain only true_positive results altogether the features biomodules of go module outputs are better organized and on average four times smaller than the input go terms list p n gene_ontology go is a standardized representation of biological gene attributes organized in a directed_acyclic structure where nodes are go terms and edges are the hierarchical relationships between them prioritized go terms are routinely computed in functional_analyses of genomic studies such as gene_expression and high_throughput enrichment and gene_set analyses have been implemented to identify significant go terms from large prioritized gene_lists such as david onto express global test gostats etc however when presented with the resulting extensive list of go terms biologists cannot readily synthesize their relationships and rigorously prioritize hypotheses two approaches have generally been used for refining overabundant go terms resulting from genomic studies the first approach reduces the number of go terms studied thus decreasing the total prioritized ones for instance goslim contains a small list of key_terms august version curated a priori by expert biologists while gopad dynamically calculates the most informative subset of go terms from a prioritized gene_list by disregarding other statistically_significant go terms to whom correspondence should be addressed these approaches are designed to eliminate a massive number of go terms deemed as significant by statistics thus severely limiting the expressiveness of the resulting list of go terms a second group of approaches removes falsely prioritized go terms that are computational artifacts attributable to the inheritance of genes signal in the go hierarchy occurring in enrichment studies for example a bottom up conditional hypergeometric_test can conservatively remove inherited genes_annotated to statistically_significant descendants nodes before testing the parent go nodes however this test also eliminates true_positive go nodes such as those whose child nodes are all significant we developed an approach that only prunes a parent node if its inherited signal is equal or worse to that of its most statistically_significant child this approach retains key parent go terms whose increased statistical_significance is amplified by inheriting multiple childrens signals indicating an overarching systems property a key go term emerging from subsumed go terms we hypothesized that grouping prioritized go terms in biomodules could further improve their interpretation by biologists and would thus allow for the synthesis and reduction of the overall number of biological_features while explicitly encapsulating subsumed go terms this approach focuses on biomodules of go terms rather than of individual genes while prioritized gene_lists have been shown to aggregate in biomodules associated to go terms in co expression and protein interaction studies software_designed to group gene_lists into gene biomodules using go knowledge produce large_numbers of go terms for interpretation without any coherent organization
