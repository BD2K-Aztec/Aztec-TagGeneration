genetics_and a high_performance toolset for relatedness and principal_component of snp data genome_wide are widely used to investigate_the of diseases and traits but they pose many computational challenges we developed gdsfmt and snprelate r packages for multi core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures to accelerate two key computations on snp data principal_component pca and relatedness analysis using identity by descent measures the kernels of our algorithms are written in c c and highly optimized benchmarks show the uniprocessor implementations of pca and identity by descent are times_faster than the implementations provided in the popular eigenstrat v and plink v programs respectively and can be sped up to fold by using eight cores snprelate can analyse tens_of of samples with millions of snps for example our package was used to perform pca on subjects from the gene environment association studies consortium studies availability_and gdsfmt and snprelate are available from r cran http cran r project org including a vignette a tutorial can be found at https www genevastudy org accomplish ments software contact genome_wide gwas are widely used to investigate_the of many complex_diseases but the large volumes of data generated in chip and sequencing based gwas from thousands of study samples and millions of snps pose_significant analytical and computational challenges one important challenge is the inflated false_positive associations that arise in gwas results when population_structure and cryptic relatedness exist these challenges can be addressed by using principal_component pca to detect and correct for population_structure and identity by descent ibd methods to identify the degree of relatedness between each pair of study samples for both methods it is suggested to use a pruned set of snps which are in approximate linkage equilibrium with each other to avoid the strong influence of snp clusters however the computational_burden associated with these methods is especially evident with large sample and snp sizes and requires efficient numerical implementation and memory management especially as chip arrays increase in size and sequencing_data is used to call variants for example the genomes_project identified million snp loci from whole_genome sequencing_technologies recently genomes_project consortium r is one of the most popular statistical programming environment but it is not typically optimized for high performance or parallel_computing which would ease the burden of large_scale snp based gwas calculations to overcome_these we have initiated a project named corearray http corearray sourceforge net that includes two r packages gdsfmt to provide efficient platform independent memory and file management for genome_wide numerical_data and snprelate to solve large_scale numerically intensive gwas calculations i e pca and ibd on multi core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures the snp eigenvectors can be used to calculate the sample eigenvectors of a new set of samples which is useful in studies with substantial relatedness for relatedness analysis ibd estimation in snprelate can be done by either the method of moments mom or maximum_likelihood mle through identity by state our experience shows that mle is significantly more computationally_intensive than mom for large_scale data analysis although mle estimates are usually more reliable than mom additionally the functions for linkage_disequilibrium pruning generate a pruned subset of snps that are in approximate linkage equilibrium with each other to avoid the strong influence of snp clusters in pca and ibd analysis an actual kinship matrix of individuals can be estimated by either method which could be used in downstream association_analyses both r packages are written in c c use the posix threads library for shared memory parallel_computing on unix like systems and have an r interface in which the kernel has been highly optimized by blocking the computations to exploit the high_speed cache memory the algorithms are optimized to load genotypes block by block with no limit to the number of snps the algorithms are limited only by the size of the main_memory which is accessed by the parallel threads and holds either the genetic covariance_matrix or ibd coefficient matrix gds is also used by an r bioconductor_package gwastools as one of its data storage formats gwastools provides many functions for quality_control and analysis of gwas including statistics by snp or scan batch quality chromosome_anomalies association tests etc
