blsspeller exhaustive comparative discovery of conserved cis_regulatory motivation the accurate discovery and annotation of regulatory_elements remains_a the growing number of sequenced_genomes creates new opportunities for comparative_approaches to motif_discovery putative_binding are then considered to be functional if they are conserved in orthologous promoter_sequences of multiple related species existing_methods for comparative motif_discovery usually rely on pregenerated multiple_sequence which are difficult to obtain for more diverged species such as plants as a consequence misaligned regulatory_elements often remain_undetected results we present a novel algorithm that supports both alignment_free and alignment based motif_discovery in the promoter_sequences of related species putative motifs are exhaustively enumerated as words over the iupac alphabet and screened for conservation using the branch length score additionally a confidence_score is established in a genome_wide fashion in order to take advantage of a cloud_computing infrastructure the mapreduce programming model is adopted the method is applied to four monocotyledon plant_species and it is shown that high_scoring motifs are significantly_enriched for open_chromatin in oryza_sativa and for transcription_factor inferred through protein binding microarrays in o sativa and zea_mays furthermore the method is shown to recover experimentally profiled ga ox like kn binding_sites in z mays availability_and blsspeller was written in java source_code and manual areone of the major challenges in systems_biology is gaining a full understanding of gene transcriptional_regulation transcription_factors for which the binding_sites are usually hidden in the promoter_sequence of the gene are in this respect of particular importance computational_approaches for de_novo motif_discovery can be classified in i methods to identify binding_sites in promoter_sequences of co regulated_genes within a single_genome and ii comparative_approaches using homologous_sequences from multiple related species the first category uses clusters of co expressed genes which are assumed to be regulated by the same set of transcription_factors a drawback of these methods is that the relationship between co expression and co regulation relies on complex regulatory_mechanisms making_it to assemble reliable datasets since co expression does not necessarily imply that there is a common binding_site involved two different algorithmic approaches coexist the statistical and the exhaustive word based_algorithms the latter contain graph based_approaches and methods based on index structures due to the growing availability of genome_sequences a second category of algorithms based on phylogenetic_footprinting emerged orthologous regulatory_regions from multiple species are compared with the underlying assumption that functional_elements evolve at a much slower pace compared to the non functional part of the genome due to selective_pressure most comparative motif_discovery approaches rely in some way on multiple_sequence in which regulatory_signals are expected to be well aligned pioneering algorithms in this category are conreal phylonet and phyloscan more recent algorithms relying on alignments are used to study mosquitoes fusarium vertebrates and mammals it has however been shown that known regulatory_elements are not always correctly aligned an issue that is further complicated by the different alignments produced by various alignment programs transcription_factor tf_binding are short flexible against certain mutations and even mobile which explains why they are sometimes misaligned mechanisms have been observed that allow the modification of regulatory_sequences without altering their function divergence driving words and binding_site turnover regulatory_sequences can diverge freely if the divergence driving words which are specific short words in the non coding_dna are not altered since a tf can often bind to multiple similar sites mutations turning one site into another should not affect_regulation binding_site turnover on the other hand is the mechanism where the gain of a redundant binding_site allows the loss of a previously functional site the corresponding tf can then bind to the new site maintaining the regulatory interaction this allows binding_sites to relocate within the regulatory_sequence making_it for alignment_algorithms to correctly align them binding_site discovery especially in plants has to deal with large divergence times and complex diversification mechanisms such as genome duplications this makes approaches based on whole_genome alignments often used in de_novo algorithms impractical some of these problems have been addressed in earlier_studies used a mixed approach in a study with drosophila species starting from whole_genome alignments but allowing for limited motif movement within an alignment elemento and tavazoie designed an alignment_free algorithm to discover overrepresented k_mers over the exact acgt alphabet in pairs of related genomes finally mdos is a new version of this algorithm with improved statistics in this article four monocotyledonous plant_species are studied using a phylogenetic_footprinting approach oryza_sativa ssp indica osa brachypodium_distachyon bdi sorghum_bicolor sbi and zea_mays zma we adopt a gene centric approach where the promoter_sequences of orthologous_genes are grouped into gene_families a word based discovery algorithm was designed to exhaustively report all genome_wide conserved_motifs the term conserved relates to the occurrence of the motif in multiple promoter_sequences of a particular gene_family genome_wide conservation relates to the fact that this conservation occurs in more gene_families than what is expected by chance motifs are modeled as words k_mers over an alphabet that contains the four bases acgt and optionally additional degenerate characters from the iupac alphabet this degeneracy allows a motif to model a collection of binding_sites the algorithm can be run in both alignment_free or alignment based mode in case of alignment_free discovery the conservation of a motif is scored irrespective of its orientation or position within a promoter_sequence this relaxed definition of conservation was previously used byand is especially relevant when studying more diverged species for which accurate multiple_sequence are difficult to generate alignment based discovery adds the constraint that motifs must be aligned i e occur at the same position in the multiple_sequence robust algorithms for comparative_genomics are expected to gain in power when more related species are added most studies so_far only consider motifs that are conserved within all organisms the branch length score bls was developed to quantify motif conservation in a biologically_meaningful manner and ranges from not conserved to conserved in all sequences the bls takes the phylogenetic_relationships between the species into account by representing a relative evolutionary distance over which a candidate binding_site is conserved within a gene_family the bls was first used in a comparative_study with drosophila genomes and allows studying motifs only conserved in subsets of the organisms whereas most current_algorithms avoid exploring the full motif space by using greedy algorithms our method is unique in the sense that it is exhaustive mdos only processes promising k_mers and gradually adds degeneracy if this improves the conservation score use the mini motifs approach van only processing promising trinucleotide duos before adding degeneracy here every word that occurs in one of the input_sequences including their degenerate variants is considered as a candidate motif the only imposed restrictions are a prespecified minimum and maximum_length and a maximum number of degenerate iupac characters the advantage of such exhaustive approach is that the method yields globally optimal results in order to strongly reduce the runtime and avoid excessive memory_requirements the mapreduce programming model was adopted as a means to take advantage of a parallel distributed memory cloud_computing environment by enabling disk i o to store intermediate results the current mapreduce implementation overcomes the memory bottleneck in a prototype implementation of this software that relied on the message_passing mpi for parallelization a novel phylogenetic_footprinting approach was developed for the sensitive discovery of conserved cis_regulatory even in diverged sequences using iupac strings as motif model and using the mapreduce programming model to enable distributed computing it was shown that it is feasible to compute all genome_wide conserved words in a large dataset in an exhaustive manner for a given false_discovery it was demonstrated that an alignment_free approach detects more conserved words than an alignment based_approach even though millions of genome_wide conserved_motifs were identified by our method mapping of these motifs to the promoter_sequences results in constrained conserved genomic_regions it was shown that these conserved_regions were significantly_enriched for experimentally profiled open_chromatin in rice and for tf_binding inferred through protein binding microarrays in rice and maize finally it was shown that the alignment_free approach shows an improved recovery of the ga ox like kn binding_site compared to the alignment based_approach or competing_methods
