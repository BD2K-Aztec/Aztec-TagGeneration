template free detection of macromolecular_complexes in cryo_electron tomograms motivation cryo_electron cryoet produces d density maps of biological specimen in its near native states applied to small cells cryoet produces d snapshots of the cellular distributions of large complexes however retrieving this information is non trivial due to the low_resolution and low_signal in tomograms current pattern_recognition methods identify complexes by matching known structures to the cryo_electron tomogram however so_far only a small fraction of all protein_complexes have been structurally resolved it is therefore of great_importance to develop template free methods for the discovery of previously_unknown protein_complexes in cryo_electron tomograms results here we have developed an inference_method for the template free discovery of frequently occurring protein_complexes in cryo_electron tomograms we provide a first proof_of of the approach and assess its applicability using realistically simulated tomograms allowing for the inclusion of noise and distortions due to missing wedge and electron optical factors our method is a step toward the template free discovery of the shapes abundance and spatial_distributions of previously_unknown macromolecular_complexes in whole cell tomograms cryo_electron cryoet enables the d visualization of a cells interior under close to live conditions such tomograms are essentially d representations of the entire proteome providing a snapshot of the distributions of protein_complexes and their interaction networks however retrieving shape_information and distributions of macromolecular assemblies is not trivial due to the low_signal snr missing_data and nonisotropic resolution and the fact that individual macromolecules are difficult to recognize in a highly crowded environment so_far the identification of macromolecular_complexes is accomplished mostly by template_matching methods where the signals representing the density_map of a known protein complex structure are correlated to the signals in the cryoet map to whom correspondence should be addressed the cross_correlation between the template and tomogram is calculated for each position and every possible orientation peaks in the resulting cross correlation_function across the whole tomogram may indicate positions occupied by the particular complex a major_drawback however is that template_matching cannot discover yet structurally unknown complexes so_far only a relatively small fraction of large_protein have been structurally resolved furthermore recent work has shown that the quaternary_structure of large_protein varies_considerably across different organisms and available reference structures might therefore not be applicable to the desired organism even if a template structure is available the template based_methods may fail if the template structure is in a different conformation or is bound to additional proteins than the target complexes in the tomogram as a consequence template based_methods may fail in detecting an unbiased atlas of the spatial_arrangement of all complexes in a cell i e a cellular proteome atlas it is therefore of great_importance to develop template free methods for the detection of macromolecular_complexes in cryo_electron tomograms such methods will allow not only the discovery of the shapes of unknown macromolecular_complexes but also allow detecting their positions and orientations in the cryo_electron tomograms the key problem in a template free approach is to identify frequently occurring density patterns in cryo_electron tomograms a pattern is defined by voxel regions with similar intensity structures which appear multiple times at different position in the tomogram such frequently occurring patterns represent objects of biological interest in this article we focus on patterns that correspond to protein_complexes once identical complexes are discovered their subtomograms can be locally aligned and their density_distribution averaged producing a density_map of the complex with improved snr identifying recurrent patterns in cryo_electron tomograms is challenging because neither the composition nor the total number of the patterns is known moreover cryo_electron tomograms are of very low_resolution nm low snr and are subject to distortions due to electron optical effects therefore traditional_methods in computer vision derived for high_resolution and high snr d object_recognition usually cannot be directly applied to cryo_electron tomograms here we propose a step_wise approach for classifying cryo_electron tomograms into recurrent density patterns first an initial classification is generated based on rotation invariant features of the tomogram in the second step this initial classification is refined using a gaussian hidden markov_random ghmrf model as an inference_method ghmrf models have shownrobustness in d image segmentations at relatively high noise levels here we extend the ghmrf framework to the classification of recurrent patterns in d cryoet maps which contain high levels of noise and distortions in this article we provide the first proof_of of the method and demonstrate its applicability for the detection of frequently occurring protein_complexes in noisy density maps with relatively high_accuracy we test our approach on realistically simulated cryo_electron tomograms including low_resolution high levels of noise and distortions due to missing wedge effects and electron optical factors first we analyze the effectiveness of the rotation invariant feature_vectors in detecting pattern similarities in a tomogram then we describe the performances of the initial pattern_classification and the refined pattern_classification based on the ghmrf approach
