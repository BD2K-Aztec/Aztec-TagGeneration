readxplorer detailed read_mapping analysis and visualization from one single source motivation the vast amount of already available and currently generated read_mapping data requires comprehensive visualization and should benefit from bioinformatics_tools offering a wide_spectrum of analysis functionality from just one source appropriate handling of multiple mapped_reads during mapping analyses remains an issue that demands improvement results the capabilities of the read_mapping analysis and visualization_tool readxplorer were vastly enhanced here we present an even finer granulated read_mapping classification improving the level of detail for analyses and visualizations the spectrum of automatic_analysis functions has been broadened to include genome rearrangement detection as well as correlation_analysis between two mapping data_sets existing functions were refined and enhanced namely the computation of differentially_expressed the read_count and normalization analysis and the transcription_start tss detection additionally readxplorer features a highly improved support for large eukaryotic data_sets and a command_line version enabling its integration into workflows finally the new version is now able to display any kind of tabular results from other bioinformatics_tools we used readxplorer for the evaluation of an arabidopsis_thaliana rna_seq test data_set that was generated for this purpose several of the aspects described above were addressed namely extended read classification improved handling of eukaryotic data and the deseq integration the experiment focused on differential_gene analysis between the a thaliana col wild_type and a myb triplemutant line supplementary methods array based data for this biological_material are available three biological_replicates each of them consisting of two technical_replicates were created from wild_type each the samples produced million usable reads that were mapped to the tair a thaliana col reference besides visual_inspection we started the analysis with a read_count and normalization calculation to check the integrity of the biological and technical_replicates this was achieved by plotting their tpm values against each other to check for correlation supplementary for all except one technical replicate the resulting expression values corresponded to each other were located close to the diagonal thus the problematic technical replicate was excluded from further analysis further investigation showed that in the problematic sample rrna removal was incomplete this experimental complication occurs at low_frequency with the rna_seq kits from illumina to_identify between the wild_type and the mutant and simultaneously monitor the effect of employing the extended read_mapping classification we applied deseq via readxplorer twice with different included read_mapping classes once we only used the uniquely_mapped and in the second case we used the single perfect and single best match mapping classes also including reads with a distinctive best mapping the latter selection enabled us to include on average more reads per data_set in the analysis supplemental leading to more accurate gene_expression values and minimizing underestimation of expression levels this effect can be observed even in the most differentially_expressed two examples are the genes at g and at g their mean expression is increased from to reads in the first case and from to reads in the second case these and other examples supplementary convincingly show that the level of differential_gene is underestimated if only uniquely_mapped are used in total the expression of of all annotated_genes is underestimated of these genes can be assigned and genes additional mappings when applying the extended read classification the comparison of the deseq results between only incorporating uniquely_mapped and using the single perfect and single best match mapping classes is shown in supplementaryadditionally we show in supplementary table s that readxplorer offers several unique features and combines many useful features that are not present in this composition in one of the other commonly used read_mapping visualization_tools like savant igb artemis igv and genomeview finally we assessed the performance of analysis functions offered by readxplorer we benchmarked the performance on small mb medium mb and large gb reference_genomes supplementary this assessment also includes a comparative runtime benchmark between readxplorer and readxplorer supplementary the results show that on the same hardware the new version of our software significantly_outperforms the older release when the same tasks are executed the comprehensive read_mapping data visualization and automatic_analysis tool readxplorer features substantially enhanced capabilities from one source the major improvement presented here is the extended read_mapping classification which leads to more specific analysis results as shown in the results section further the extended classification enables meaningful integration of multiple mapped_reads and creates awareness for the different types of multiple mapped_reads e g to identify repetitive_regions moreover two newly implemented analysis functions and substantial improvement of existing analyses widen the spectrum covered by readxplorer and enable the user to screen for genome_rearrangements and correlation between two data_sets without the need to install additional software the read_count normalization can now be compared between different samples as the added tpm normalization is invariant between samples with deseq another widely used differential_gene analysis package is available from within the software the enhanced tss detection allows deeper insights into the tss landscape by analyzing additional properties of the tss and presenting them to the user the application range of readxplorer is further broadened by improving the handling of eukaryotic data using our a thaliana rna_seq data_set we were able to successfully evaluate the new features and could show that the enhanced read classification helps to improve the analysis results with the new command_line integration into automatic analysis_pipelines is enabled this allows handling experiments with many samples more efficiently than in the graphical_user as only a single command is needed to import all data and subsequently run all desired analyses finally integration of results from multiple tools and viewing the read_mapping data along with analysis results is important for researchers therefore the new possibility to import arbitrary data tables starting with a genomic_position column aids this need
