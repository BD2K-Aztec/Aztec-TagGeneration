besc knowledgebase public portal the bioenergy science center besc is undertaking large experimental campaigns to understand the biosynthesis and biodegradation of biomass and to develop biofuel solutions besc is generating large volumes of diverse data including genome_sequences omics_data and assay results the purpose of the besc knowledgebase is to serve as a centralized repository for experimentally generated data and to provide an integrated interactive and user_friendly analysis framework the portal makes available tools for visualization integration and analysis of data either produced by besc or obtained from external resources availability the united_states department of energy doe initiative to increase the production of renewable biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol has led researchers to explore various biomass feedstocks and microbes for alternative fuel solutions the bioenergy science center besc was established by doe in as a multi_institutional partnership driving scientific efforts in this direction besc is undertaking large experimental campaigns to understand and mitigate the recalcitrance of biomass for cellulolytic degradation by enzymes and organisms and to develop multitalented microbes for converting plant_biomass into biofuels in a single step researchers at besc are focused on comprehensive and system level understanding of the process of biomass and plant_cell formation degradation and biofuel_production as such the center is generating large volumes of diverse data including genome_sequences many types of
