genetics_and ebglmnet a comprehensive r package for sparse generalized linear_regression ebglmnet is an r package implementing empirical bayesian_method with both lasso eblasso and elastic_net eben priors for generalized_linear in our previous_studies both eblasso and eben outperformed other state of the art methods such as lasso and elastic_net in inferring sparse genotype and phenotype associations in which the number of covariates is typically much larger than the sample_size while high_density genetic_markers can be easily_obtained nowadays in genetics_and thanks to the advancements in molecular high_throughput ebglmnet will be a very useful tool for statistical_modeling in this area availability_and ebglmnet package is freely_available from the r archive cran http cran r project org in areas such as multiple quantitative_trait qtl_mapping and pathway based genome_wide gwas high_density gnomic markers can be obtained easily as technologies advanced in molecular genotyping including all marker effects in a single regression_model leads to a large number of model variables typically much larger than the sample_size traditional regression_methods failed when p n where p is the number of model variables and n is the sample_size we recently_developed an efficient empirical bayesian_method with lasso eblasso and elastic_net eben priors for variable_selection and effect estimation eblasso has two sets of hierarchical priors eblasso ne normal and exponential hierarchical prior eblasso neg normal exponential and gamma hierarchical prior enforcing different levels of shrinkage to produce a sparse model and eben encourages a grouping effect while inferring a sparse model which is able to select a group of highly_correlated variables when eblasso fails comprehensive simulation and real_data analysis in qtl_mapping and pathway based gwas demonstrated that eblasso and eben outperformed other state_ofthe algorithms such as lasso and elastic_net in term of power of detecting true effects pd false_discovery fdr as well as detecting a group of highly_correlated effects the aforementioned studies implemented those methods separately either in matlab or r and were not available for different generalized linear_regression glms in this paper we developed a cross_platform software_package ebglmnet with implementation of both gaussian and binomial models for all methods core algorithms in the software are programmed in efficient c c with user_friendly r interface comparing to the original implementation computational speed via ebglmnet is very fast thanks to the basic linear algebra subprograms blas and linear algebra package lapack utilized by the package
