finestr a web_server for single_base nucleosome_positioning the dna in eukaryotic_cells is packed into the chromatin that is composed of nucleosomes positioning of the nucleosome_core particles on the sequence is a problem of great interest because of the role nucleosomes play in different cellular_processes including gene_regulation using the sequence structure of base dna repeat presented in our previous_works and nucleosome_core dna_sequences database we have derived the complete nucleosome dna bendability matrix of caenorhabditis_elegans we have developed a web_server named finestr that allows users to upload genomic_sequences in fasta_format and to perform a single_base nucleosome mapping on them availability finestr server is freely_available for use on the web at http www cs bgu ac il nucleom the site contains a help file with explanation regarding the exact usage contact dna accessibility plays an important role in the regulation of processes such as transcription replication recombination and dna_repair dna accessibility in turn depends on the chromatin_structure of which the building_blocks are nucleosomes it is generally_accepted that the segment of dna_double which is wrapped around the histone_octamer forming the nucleosome should possess sequence_dependent bendability properties that would provide a stabilizing contribution to the free_energy of the nucleosome d structure we have discovered the sequence pattern characteristic for nucleosome dna of caenorhabditis_elegans and apparently applicable to the nucleosomes of all eukaryotes as described in the cited work the c elegans pattern is identical to the pattern uniquely defined by dna deformability properties in particular it is dictated by minimization of unstacking of dna bases and base_pairs in the nucleosome dna accordingly we built a web_server finestroctamer is measured from to as a ratio of the actual score to the maximal possible score for the probe crystallography at atomic_resolution at present time is the most accurate way to map nucleosome position on the sequence respectively any other mapping technique to be tested should use the crystallography data as reference in order to test our sequence directed algorithm that uses the nucleosome mapping probe we took all known nucleosomes crystallized with unique_sequences where the central base is determined with atomic_resolution these are protein_data pdb structures aoi eqz kx kx and nzd comparison of the nucleosome_positions calculated by our probe with the crystallography data showed an exact match within base
