bioimaging based detection of mislocalized proteins in human_cancers by semi_supervised motivation there is a long_term interest in the challenging_task of finding translocated and mislo cated cancer_biomarker proteins bioimages of subcellular protein distribution are new data_sources which have attracted_much in recent_years because of their intuitive and detailed_descriptions of protein distribution however automated methods in large_scale biomarker screening suffer significantly from the lack of subcellular_location annotations for bioimages from cancer tissues the transfer prediction idea of applying models trained on normal_tissue proteins to predict the subcellular_locations of cancerous ones is arbitrary because the protein distribution_patterns may differ in normal and cancerous states results we developed a new semi_supervised protocol that can use unlabeled cancer protein data in model construction by an iterative and incremental training strategy our approach_enables us to selectively use the low quality images in normal states to expand the training sample space and provides a general way for dealing with the small_size of annotated images used together with large unannotated ones experiments demonstrate that the new semi_supervised protocol can result in improved accuracy and sensitivity of subcellular_location difference detection knowing the subcellular_locations of proteins in human cancer tissues can improve the understanding of protein functions and cancer pathogenesis it has been demonstrated that the translocation of protein might be a signal of cancer the cyclin_d protein is an example it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a healthy cell and the reduction of exportation from the nucleus can lead to overexpression in the nucleus and the inactivation of the tumor suppressing protein retinoblastoma accurately detecting protein translocations in human cancer tissues can thus be of important help for clinical_diagnosis and treatment because traditional wet_lab are expensive in time and costs automated methods are highly desired for handling the increasing amounts of biomedical data despite its importance only a few studies have reported automated methods to detect translocation details in cancerous_tissues until now one reason is that sequence_based analysis by itself is not v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com sensitive enough for detection of protein translocation as translocation can be strongly effected by mutations outside the target_sequence for example mutations in nucleoporin complexes can have dramatic effects on the nuclear_localization of multiple other proteins due to recent_advances in microscopic_imaging image_based pattern analysis methods have gained popularity due to the intuitive and detailed information the images contain for example the murphy group discussed the potential applications of their models based on automated analysis of fluorescence microscopy_images to the analysis and classification of skin_cancers compared the abilities of automated_image and pathologist visual_examination in quantifying protein expression in ovarian_cancer recently our group developed a multilabel subcellular_location predictor ilocator and identified several translocated proteins as potential cancer biomarkers to compare the localization difference of a protein in normal and cancerous_tissues we have to know its subcellular_locations in both normal and cancerous states first this can be achieved either through wet_lab or computational predictions since image data with experimentally annotated subcellular_locations in cancerous states are rare prediction_models have been used instead especially in the large_scale screening due to the lack of location labels for proteins in cancerous states however most of the existing methods_employed an approach named transfer learning where models are first trained on proteins in normal_tissues and then used to predict the localization of proteins in cancerous_tissues the performance of these approaches is poor where one reason is the subtle differences in subcellular_location patterns between cancer and normal states which are influenced by cell mutations and morphological changes in fact there are a large number of images of proteins with cancerous_tissues the human_protein hpa version http www proteinatlas org database for example currently contains more than million immunohistochemistry ihc microscopy_images of proteins in cancerous_tissues but due to the lack of explicit subcellular annotations no attempt has been made in using these images from cancerous_tissues for constructing supervised models for cancer localization prediction to address the issues we present a heuristic semi_supervised framework for subcellular_location prediction by taking_advantage of the unannotated cancer samples in developing predictors the key_advantage of the proposed semi_supervised method in comparison to the traditional supervised_learning algorithms is that it can train prediction_models with only a few labeled image samples and a large_pool of unlabeled samples an iterative and incremental strategy was designed to select unlabeled samples into the training_set to choose the most discriminative samples we developed three different training modes a single training model consisting of only one classifier a co training model consisting of two classifiers and a tri training model consisting of three classifiers also as the incorporation of prior_knowledge can improve the performance of semi_supervised methods we took the location information from the corresponding normal_tissues as prior_knowledge to guide the selection process another advantage of the proposed semi_supervised framework is that the training samples become typically much more enriched compared with the traditional supervised_learning first it selected useful lower_quality images from normal_tissues for training in general researchers prefer using well stained images in the training_set but selecting only high_quality images may introduce bias into modeling because the number of high expression_level images in the hpa is relatively small therefore instead of being discarded some images of normal_tissues with weak expression levels were selected for use in training by the semi_supervised strategy used in this study then also the large cancer dataset was used for model construction by using the semi_supervised strategy of this study which results in a much larger dataset useable for model construction the final predictor by the semi_supervised training can be used for images from both normal and cancer tissues we have tested the method on an independent cancer_biomarker dataset composed of translocated or mislocated proteins which have been confirmed by biological_experiments comparing the prediction results from models trained with and without data from cancerous_tissues shows that using the cancer data improves the sensitivity of detecting protein translocations or mislocations in human cancer tissues shows the percentages of normal protein images with different levels of expression reliability in hpa version protein images with high and medium reliability corresponding to six subcellular_locations in tissues were collected supplementary the overlapping part of two circles represents overlap on the protein level because some proteins have different reliability levels in different tissues for example ornithine carbamoyltransferase is one such protein because its reliability of expression in liver is high while in the colon it is medium the idn is randomly_selected from the nonoverlapping proteins and avoids protein overlap with the training_set the adn and bdn are composed of the remaining images with high and medium reliability levels respectively note that idn has intersection with neither adn nor bdn at the protein level b some examples of protein images with different reliability levels and subcellular_locations c summary of all the datasets used in this study the cdc is built by images of proteins in cancerous_tissues where the proteins are proteins whose images in corresponding normal_tissues are of high_reliability of protein expression the ibd contains proteins that were reported being translocated in human_cancers by the literatures supplementary in the column of expression reliability h means high and m means medium
