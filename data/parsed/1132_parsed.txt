concerning the accuracy of fido and parameter choice a linear_programming model for protein inference problem in shotgun_proteomics a recent article by huang and he illustrates a method for applying linear_programming to protein inference and compares this method to a handful of established methods for protein inference proteinprophet nesvizhskii et_al msbayes li et_al and fido serang et_al unfortunately huang and he gives the impression that protein probabilities computed by fido are erratic yielding either markedly superior_performance e g in the sigma dataset or inferior performance e g in the humanmd dataset compared with the rest of the field however this erratic performance is simply the effect of not choosing the parameters by grid_search as specified in serang et_al performing a rough grid_search f g f g and f g to jointly optimize discrimination and calibration substantially improves the quality of the probabilities computed fig and makes fido competitive with proteinprophet performing the grid_search takes s on a core i laptop not only are fidos three parameters important for weighing many pieces of low scoring peptide evidence against fewer pieces of high_scoring peptide evidence but they also substantially determine the treatment of shared i e degenerate peptides as a result the optimal values for these parameters are influenced by many factors e g the coverage of the experiment the complexity of the sample and so forth and these parameters are understandably dataset specific although using blind parameter_estimates may give reasonable performance in some situations particularly when the parameters come from a dataset with similar characteristics fido is not intended to be run without these parameters intelligently set via the grid_search noted earlier in the text or manually to be fair there are situations where the means to estimate free_parameters i e true and false_positive labels are not available and in these cases it is not unreasonable to try parameters estimated from another similar data_set however even in this case the parameters in fido are not intended to be chosen arbitrarily without regard for their performance if no labels are available manual parameter choice is an option e g choosing parameters that rank a known highly abundant protein over others in the rare case when no information for validation is available fido like all models with free_parameters should not be used to better enable researchers to use fido in the way intended and to aid in future comparisons we have released an updated executable which automatically performs the grid_search as described in serang et_al without need of the previous shell script wrapper it is available for free download from
