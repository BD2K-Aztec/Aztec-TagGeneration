genome_analysis seqlm an mdl based method for identifying differentially_methylated in high_density methylation array data motivation one of the main goals of large_scale methylation studies is to detect differentially_methylated one way is to approach this problem sitewise i e to find differentially_methylated positions dmps however it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic_regions so it is more desirable to identify differentially_methylated dmrs instead of dmps the new high coverage arrays like illuminas k platform make it possible at a reasonable cost few tools exist for dmr identification from this type of data but there is no standard approach results we propose a novel method for dmr identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length mdl principle essentially solving the problem of model_selection the significance of the regions is established using linear_mixed using both simulated and large publicly_available methylation datasets we compare seqlm performance to alternative_approaches we demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing_methods this is achieved with minimal parameter_tuning and surprisingly quickest running time of all the tried methods finally we show that the regional differential_methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher_resolution sequencing_approaches availability_and the methods have been implemented in r package seqlm that is available through github https dna_methylation is an important cellular_mechanism that is associated to processes like x_chromosome and genomic_imprinting it has also been related to several diseases such as diabetes schizophrenia and cancer in recent_years the role of methylation in various diseases has received considerable interest from the research_community this can be attributed largely to the development of high_density methylation microarrays like illumina_infinium k which have made affordable the characterization of genome_wide patterns on large disease related cohorts the illumina k microarray covers around cpg_sites per gene such resolution reveals a spatially_correlated structure of dna_methylation closely situated cpg_sites often display almost identical methylation patterns this feature has been seen already in the early sequencing studies and it has been also shown that methylation is regulated in longer regions while strong spatial_correlation is a dominant feature in the data common analysis methods do not take this into account for example differential_methylation analysis is commonly performed in a sitewise manner thus ignoring correlations between probes to take spatial correlations into account when performing the analysis it is natural to search for differentially_methylated dmrs instead of sites statistically it could improve the sensitivity of the analysis and make the results less redundant biologically differential_methylation supported by multiple independent probes is less likely to represent an experimental artefact dmr centric analysis has been performed in multiple studies and there are several tools available for it however despite the numerous tools available there is no standard approach for dmr identification one possibility is to use predefined regions that are based on genomic_features such as gene parts or cpg islands this has been implemented in an r package ima but it has several shortcomings such an analysis often reveals large amount of regions that cover the same set of differentially_methylated sites while their rankings are more based on the concordance between the borders of true dmrs and predefined regions than the true extent of differential_methylation another a more general approach is to define the regions dynamically based on the data one such method is comb p that combines single site p values by using sliding_windows and taking_into the correlation between sites this method operates on p values which makes it flexible and computationally_efficient however the dmrs are then based on summary_statistics and this may lose some information compared to modeling directly on the measurements also the user must pick the minimum p value required to start a region and the resulting regions strongly depend on this parameter value maybe the most well known method is bump hunting integrated into r package minfi essentially it performs site level analysis on spatially smoothed data and then applies some rules to aggregate the sites into regions significance of these regions is assessed using permutations the number and nature of bumphunter results depends strongly on the effect_size cutoff and smoothing window_size parameters that are hard to interpret in biological terms and thus tricky to optimize second due to smoothing the method is unable to detect single site differential_methylation making it less effective in sparsely covered regions another tool aclust defines the regions by gradually clustering the consecutive sites together the significance of identified clusters is tested using the generalized_estimating gee model this approach relies on an even larger number of user_defined parameters such as correlation metric agglomeration method correlation threshold etc in this article we present a novel method for identifying dmrs probes are grouped into regions based similarity of differential_methylation profiles by using the minimum description length mdl principle the significance of these regions is estimated using linear_mixed such an information_theoretic background makes the model flexible in a variety of situations without the need of extensive parameter_tuning for validation we show that our approach is effective in finding true dmrs while appropriately controlling the number_of both on simulated and real methylation datasets we demonstrate the utility of seqlm method in three parts first we study the statistical_properties and performance of seqlm and other methods on simulated_data second we apply the methods to a large public methylation dataset covering different tissues in all cases we compare seqlm with bumphunter aclust comb p and ima finally we validate several dmrs that were identified using seqlm on illumina k chip data with sanger_sequencing the method as defined in this article opens up a number of future_directions for development the current model can also handle continuous variables in addition to the two groups of data thus it is possible to use seqlm to search for methylation quantitative_trait meqtls in such analysis even small improvements in statistical_power can have huge consequences the method can be generalized to handle raw_sequencing with methylation counts instead of aggregated methylation_values for that we must replace linear_regression with logistic_regression the change only alters the model_fitting inside fixed region and not the core of the dynamic_programming routine the mdl framework underlying seqlm is a powerful way to identify genomic_regions by employing different statistical_models it is possible to specify the properties of the desired regions for example one can include more sophisticated linear_models to test more complex hypotheses or use clustering_methods instead to perform unsupervised region finding we presented a novel approach for dmr identification described as a three stage process first the data is divided_into smaller segments based on genomic_distance between consecutive probes then each of these segments is divided_into regions with consistent differential_methylation patterns for this all possible segmentations are considered and the optimal one is chosen according to the mdl principle finally the significance of differential_methylation in each region is assessed using linear_mixed in our algorithm the latter two steps are naturally related as both the segmentation and assessing_the are based on the b parameter we showed that seqlm performs well on simulated_data being both more sensitive and more specific than the alternative_methods on a real_dataset we can see that dmrs found by seqlm cover more sites than other methods while controlling the type_i at the same time the redundancy within the results is smaller as the close sites are reported together finally we validated dmrs using sanger_sequencing and managed to show good correlation between the array and sequencing based estimates of differential_methylation
