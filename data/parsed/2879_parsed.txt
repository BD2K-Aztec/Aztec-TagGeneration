mesord stochastic reaction diffusion simulations in the microscopic limit mesord is a tool for simulating stochastic reaction_diffusion as modeled by the reaction diffusion master_equation the simulated systems are defined in the systems_biology with additions to define compartment geometries mesord supports scale dependent reaction rate_constants and reactions between reactants in neighbouring subvolumes these new features make it possible to construct physically consistent models of diffusion_controlled reactions also at fine spatial discretization availability mesord is written in c and licensed under the gnu_general gpl mesord can be downloaded at http mesord sourceforge net the mesord homepage http mesord sourceforge net contains detailed documentation and news about recently implemented features physical modelling is increasingly important to gain insights about how biochemical_processes work in living_cells different processes do however need to be modeled at different levels of detail it may for example be important to consider that chemical_reactions are stochastic spatially dependent or both the combined spatial stochastic models are for example needed when there are slow local fluctuations that influences the rates of chemical_reactions in a non linear way or when association dissociation events are interrupted by additional reaction before the reactants have reached uncorrelated positions mahmutovic et_al submitted for publication in these cases it is desirable to have a tool that can evolve a biochemical process at different levels of detail in a physically consistent_manner at the finest level of detail stochastic reaction diffusion kinetics can be consistently modeled using the spatially_and continuous framework developed by for reactive spheres and later extended to finite association rates and dissociation it is however often neither necessary nor practical to model reactions at this level of detail by discretizing space into subvolumes and keeping track of the number of molecules of each species in each subvolume and when they react the process is described as a continuous time discrete state markov_process the master_equation that governs this process is known as the reaction diffusion master_equation rdme the rdme has recently been shown to diverge and give unphysical solutions at high_spatial the divergence problem was solved by introducing scale dependent bi molecular reaction rate_constants where the new mesoscopic rate_constants are calculated from the microscopic framework here we describe recent_developments of mesord a tool for stochastic reaction diffusion simulations or more specifically a tool for simulating trajectories corresponding to the rdme how different tools van zon and ten for stochastic reaction diffusion modeling compares with each other in terms of capabilities has been discussed elsewhere the main enhancement compared with previous mesord versions and other rdme based simulators is the use of scale dependent mesoscopic reaction rate_constants which allows for microscopically consistent simulations at fine spatial discretization scale dependent rate_constants also make it possible to simulate rdme models on planar d surfaces membranes where the problems of diffusion_controlled reactions are much more severe than in d because reactants do not lose spatial correlations even at large_distances since our previous applications note we have also added functionalities for defining cellular compartment geometries using triangle meshes in addition to the previously available method based on constructive solid geometries csg and also included the possibility of running mean field simulations within mesord
