a computational_analysis of the antigenic properties of haemagglutinin in influenza a h n motivation modelling antigenic shift in influenza a h n can help to predict the efficiency of vaccines the virus is known to exhibit sudden jumps in antigenic distance and prediction of such novel strains from amino_acid differences remains a challenge results from analysis of amino_acid of wild_type h we propose updates to the frequently referenced list of amino_acids located at or near the five identified antibody_binding regions in haemagglutinin ha we introduce a class of predictive_models based on the analysis of amino_acid changes in these binding regions and extend the principle to changes in ha as a whole by dividing the molecule into regional bands our results show that a range of simple models based on banded changes give better predictive_performance than models based on the established five canonical regions and can identify a higher proportion of vaccine escape candidates among novel strains than a current state of the art model seasonal_influenza poses a serious world_wide threat to public_health with up to deaths being attributable on average to annual influenza_epidemics of particular concern are strains of influenza a the trimeric viral surface protein haemagglutinin ha of influenza a which contains the host_cell receptor binding_site is the primary_focus of successful attack by natural_antibodies antibodies binding to the sister surface protein neuriminidase are not generally considered to prevent_infection ha is synthesized as a single polypeptide_chain that subsequently cleaves into two chains ha amino_acids and ha amino_acids the two chains are covalently_attached by a disulfide_bond has rapid evolution through nucleotide polymorphism allows it to escape antibody activity periodically through antigenic_drift leading to epidemics and requiring regular updates to the recommended vaccine composition a separate mechanism genetic_reassortment between viral_strains and between species is usually responsible for the much larger antigenic shifts causing pandemics to whom correspondence should be addressed influenza h n has been the most frequently occurring subtype of influenza a in human_infections over the last years its ha component h is antigenically distinguishable from that of other numbered subtypes in the laboratory the haemagglutinin inhibition hi test is used to characterize an influenza strain antigenically who given an antiserum raised against influenza strain i c ij is the minimum serum concentration that is required to inhibit agglutination of viruses of strain j in the hi test c ij and c ii are measured by diluting serum until agglutination no longer takes_place hi results are conventionally expressed as dilutions but in keeping with more general chemical practice we will use concentrations in this summary proposed the ratioas an indicator of the potential effectiveness of a vaccine based on strain i in controlling a viral_infection by strain j if r ij is four or less then the vaccine is considered effective this is known as the antigenic escape threshold it should be noted that in generalthe geometric mean of the above ratios r ij r ji was introduced by archetti and horsfall as a measure of antigenic_variation and has been shown to be a superior predictor of vaccine_effectiveness against a particular strain than simple concentration_ratios lapedes and farber demonstrated that a shape space of low dimensionality can be constructed in which antisera and antigens are treated as points with the distance between them the antigenic distance being linearly related to the logarithm of the concentration_ratio the equationwill be used in the current work as a measurement of antigenic distance between strains i and j five regions of the ha monomer have been found to undergo mutations when the virus is cultured in the presence of monoclonal_antibodies eventually leading to antibody escape these regions are presumed to encompass the sites at which antibodies bind to ha they are conventionally labelled sites a to e another factor known to affect immunogenicity is the presence_or of n glycosylation_sites in this article we have presented an updated set of varying amino_acid close to the five antigenic_sites identified in the s by monoclonal_antibody studies using the same mechanism that was used to produce the original set but taking_advantage of the much larger number of ha sequences now available compared to the original the amount of the surface covered by this much larger set plus the analysis of the predictive_models we have presented lends support to the idea that neutralizing_antibody epitopes can occur at many points within or even of the distal end of the ha monomer the models we have described are simple in their approach and we believe that their performance can be further extended by incorporating more sophisticated measures of the region and density of amino_acid variation likewise while we have focussed on the h subtype of influenza a we anticipate that the approach would extend to other subtypes of interest such as h and h our artificial sites approach is particularly promising as it is not inherently data dependent all surface_residues within a given range of the distal end of the ha molecule can be incorporated irrespective of whether they have been shown to vary within existing strains use of the models could be combined with the use of an immunodominant page
