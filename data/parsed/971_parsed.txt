genome_analysis chromos an integrated web_tool for snp classification prioritization and functional_interpretation genome_wide and re sequencing_projects are revealing an increasing number of disease associated snps a large fraction of which are non coding although they could have relevance for disease_susceptibility and progression the lack of information about regulatory_regions impedes the assessment of their functionality here we present a web_server chromos chromatin modified snps which combines genetic and epigenetic data with the goal of facilitating snps classification prioritization and prediction of their functional consequences chromos uses a large database of snps and chromatin_states but allows a user to provide his her own genetic_information based on the snp classification and interactive prioritization a user can compute the functional impact of multiple_snps using two prediction_tools one for differential analysis of transcription_factor binding strap and another for snps with potential impact on binding of mirnas microsniper availability web_server chromos is freely_available atthe majority of snps from genome_wide gwas and resequencing projects are located in non coding_regions this impedes the assessment of snps functional effect and disease mechanisms handling this plethora of data requires an automated snp prioritization for initial analysis being followed by more focused functional analysis downstream in concurrent efforts epigenetics studies have resulted in many publicly_available chip_seq profiles designated chromatin_states defined by combinatorial patterns of marks using the multivariate hidden_markov this allows segmentation of the genome into six annotated general chromatin categories namely enhancer promoter insulator transcribed repressed and inactive states in turn these categories are subdivided further into strong weak and poised states based on their relationship to transcription_level of distal and adjacent genes and transcript positional enrichments here we introduce a web_server chromos which combines genetic and epigenetic data and facilitates snp classification and prioritization this integration is achieved through a large database of gwas results and chromatin annotations or through direct upload of user_defined data in standardized file_formats using this data snps can be classified as belonging to various functional_categories such as enhancer or promoter and prioritized for further analysis the relationships between snps and epigenetic categories were demonstrated by ernst and colleagues showing that disease associated snps were significantly more likely to be positioned within strong enhancer segments than neutral dbsnp variants chromos is also integrated with two prediction_algorithms strap and microsniper to assess the functional consequences of regulatory snps for some transcriptional_and mechanisms respectively
