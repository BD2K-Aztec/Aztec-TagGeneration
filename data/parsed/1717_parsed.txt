extending ontologies by finding siblings using set expansion techniques motivation ontologies are an everyday tool in biomedicine to capture and represent knowledge however many ontologies lack a high degree of coverage in their domain and need to improve their overall quality and maturity automatically extending sets of existing terms will enable ontology engineers to systematically improve text_based ontologies level by level results we developed an approach to extend ontologies by discovering new terms which are in a sibling relationship to existing terms of an ontology for this purpose we combined two approaches which retrieve new terms from the web the first approach extracts siblings by exploiting the structure of html documents whereas the second approach uses text_mining techniques to extract siblings from unstructured text our evaluation against mesh medical_subject shows that our method for sibling discovery is able to suggest first class ontology_terms and can be used as an initial step towards assessing the completeness of ontologies the evaluation yields a recall of at a precision of where the two independent approaches are complementing each other for mesh in particular we show that it can be considered complete in its medical focus area we integrated the work into dog dag an ontology generation plugin for the editors obo edit and protg making it the first plugin that supports sibling discovery on the fly availability sibling discovery for ontology is available as part of dog dag www biotec tu dresden de research schroeder dog dag for both protg and obo edit during the last decade the field of biomedicine has seen a data explosion made evident by the overwhelming number of published_articles databases nucleotide_sequences and protein_structures today ontologies are used extensively in the biomedical and healthcare sector for information and data_integration such as gene_product annotation analysis of high_throughput data and searching if an ontology cannot maintain a high degree of coverage in its domain its correctness and integrity will suffer leading to missing results when trying to find documents or genes semantically associated with terms however to keep up with new information ontologies must be revised and newly added terms need to be enriched with definitions cross_references and additional properties since ontologies are to whom correspondence should be addressed manually_curated developing and maintaining them is often a slow tedious and error_prone process to mitigate this bottleneck text_mining and related techniques can be employed to enrich ontologies in a semi_automated fashion among the variety of ontology learning methods proposed in the past mainly term recognition and patternbased relationship extraction methods are used in the biomedical_field in this article we present an alternative approach to enhancing ontologies by automatically finding suitable co hyponyms of terms i e finding terms which are in a sibling relationship to each other this approach can be used to extend ontologies in a horizontal way and therefore to complete a set of terms for instance an ontology that already includes the terms somatotrophs and trophoblasts which are both endocrine_cells could be extended by automatically proposing more terms with the same parent term with this approach ontology engineers can semi automatically extend ontologies using two to three terms which are the seed terms for the algorithm many existing ontologies can be expanded in this way with minimal effort our method extracts siblings of existing terms on the fly using web_sites returned by queries to search_engines thus implicitly incorporating full text journal_articles patents text books wiki pages etc as indexed by the engines in our methodology we are integrating two approaches which when combined efficiently improve the quality of the proposed siblings in terms of precision and recall
