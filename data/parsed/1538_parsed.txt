efficient algorithms for the reconciliation problem with gene_duplication horizontal_transfer and loss motivation gene_family evolution is driven by evolutionary_events such as speciation gene_duplication horizontal_gene and gene loss and inferring these events in the evolutionary_history of a given gene_family is a fundamental problem in comparative and evolutionary genomics with numerous important_applications solving this problem requires the use of a reconciliation framework where the input consists of a gene_family phylogeny and the corresponding species phylogeny and the goal is to reconcile the two by postulating speciation gene_duplication horizontal_gene and gene loss events this reconciliation problem is referred to as duplication transfer loss dtl reconciliation and has been extensively_studied in the literature yet even the fastest existing algorithms for dtl reconciliation are too slow for reconciling large gene_families and for use in more sophisticated applications such as gene_tree or species_tree reconstruction results we present two new algorithms for the dtl reconciliation problem that are dramatically faster than existing algorithms both asymptotically and in practice we also extend the standard dtl reconciliation model by considering distance_dependent transfer costs which allow for more accurate reconciliation and give an efficient algorithm for dtl reconciliation under this extended model we implemented our new algorithms and demonstrated up to fold speed up over existing_methods using both simulated and biological_datasets this dramatic_improvement makes it possible to use dtl reconciliation for performing rigorous evolutionary_analyses of large gene_families and enables its use in advanced reconciliation based gene and species_tree reconstruction methods availability our programs can be freely downloaded fromgene families evolve through complex evolutionary_processes such as speciation gene_duplication horizontal_gene and gene loss accurate inference of these events is crucial not only to understanding gene and genome_evolution but also for reliably inferring orthologs paralogs and xenologs to whom correspondence should be addressed reconstructing ancestral gene content and dating gene birth accurate gene_tree reconstruction and for whole_genome species_tree reconstruction indeed the problem of inferring gene_family evolution has been extensively_studied in the typical formulation of this problem the goal is to reconcile an input gene_tree gene_family phylogeny to the corresponding rooted species_tree by postulating speciation duplication transfer and loss events much of the previous work in gene treespecies tree_reconciliation has focused on either duplication loss dl or transfer loss tl but not on duplication transfer and loss together however duplication and transfer events frequently occur together particularly in prokaryotes and the analysis of such families requires reconciliation methods that can simultaneously consider duplication transfer and loss events this problem of gene treespecies tree_reconciliation by duplication transfer and loss simultaneously is referred to as the duplication tl dtl reconciliation problem previous work the dtl reconciliation problem has a long history and is well studied in the literature this is partly due to its close association with the hostparasite cophylogeny problem which seeks to understand the evolution of parasites analogous to genes within hosts analogous to species almost all known formulations of the dtl reconciliation problem are based on a parsimony framework but see alsofor an example of a probabilistic formulation as well asfor a probabilistic_framework based on gene content under this framework each duplication transfer and loss event is assigned a cost and the goal is to find a reconciliation that has the lowest total reconciliation cost optimal dtl reconciliations can sometimes violate temporal constraints that is the transfers are such that they induce contradictory constraints on the dates for the internal nodes of the species_tree we refer to such paradoxical reconciliations as time inconsistent after in general it is desirable to consider only those dtl reconciliations that are time consistent i e paradox free henceforth we refer to the problem of specifically computing optimal time consistent
