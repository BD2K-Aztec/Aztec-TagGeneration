gene_expression bayesian model_based of temporal gene_expression using autoregressive panel data approach_motivation in a microarray time series analysis due to the large_number evaluated the first step toward understanding the complex time network is the clustering of genes that share similar expression_patterns over time up until now the proposed methods do not point simultaneously to the temporal autocorrelation of the gene_expression and the model_based we present a bayesian_method that considers jointly the fit of autoregressive panel data models and hierarchical gene clustering results the proposed methodology was able to cluster genes that share similar expression over time which was determined jointly by the estimates of autoregression parameters by the average level of expression and by the quality of the fitted model availability_and the r codes for implementation of the proposed clustering method and for simulation_study as well as the real_and are freely_accessible on the webmicroarray time series mts analysis allows the researcher to characterize set of genes through their longitudinal pattern of expression according to the mts data analysis methodologies can be divided_into two classes the first one assumes the observations on the expression at each time as independent_variables and so the usual methods such as hierarchical process and the optimization can be directly used to cluster genes with similar expression pattern the second performs clustering based on the set of parameters estimates from specific models therefore it is considered more interesting from the statistical and biological viewpoint since the temporal expression behavior can be taken into account in the clustering among the second class of methods the dynamic the hidden_markov and the b splines models deserve special_attention although these methods are useful they are not suitable for relatively small to whom correspondence should be addressed experiments with less than temporal observations per gene however according to mts studies are generally characterized by a large_number evaluated but with a small number of the temporal expression measures per gene in the field of time series mainly in econometrics the bayesian autoregressive panel data model is recommended for situations with large number of small_series since it provides an increase in accuracy relatively to autoregressive model_fit to each one small_series considering these advantages of model_based methods and the difficulty of applying them to a large number of small_series here we propose a bayesian_method that considers simultaneously an autoregressive panel data model_fit and a hierarchical_clustering of the parameter_estimates from this model in addition we present the detailed r r development core codes with comments about the proposed method and its application to a mts dataset extracted from saccharomyces_cerevisiae stanford microarray database
