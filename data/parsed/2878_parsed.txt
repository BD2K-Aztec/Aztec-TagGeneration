mesmer minimal ensemble solutions to multiple experimental restraints motivation macromolecular structures and interactions are intrinsically heterogeneous temporally adopting a range of configurations that can confound the analysis of data from bulk experiments to obtain quantitative insights into heterogeneous systems an ensemble based_approach can be employed in which predicted data computed from a collection of models is compared to the observed experimental_results by simultaneously fitting orthogonal structural data e g small_angle nuclear_magnetic residual_dipolar dipolar electron_electron resonance spectra the range and population of accessible macromolecule structures can be probed results we have developed mesmer software that enables the user to identify ensembles that can recapitulate experimental_data by refining thousands of component collections selected from an input pool of potential structures the mesmer suite includes a powerful graphical_user gui to streamline usage of the command_line calculate data from structure libraries and perform analyses of conformational and structural_heterogeneity to allow for incorporation of other data types modular python plugins enable users to compute and fit data from nearly any type of quantitative experimental_data results conformational heterogeneity in three macromolecular systems was analyzed with mesmer demonstrating the utility of the streamlined user_friendly software availability_and https code google comchanges in macromolecular structure over a range of timescales are intrinsic to many biological_processes and by definition produce structural_heterogeneity within a defined timeframe henzler such structural_heterogeneity plays a role in functions as diverse as molecular_recognition catalysis transport regulation and allostery this heterogeneity presents_unique for structural_characterization as analytical_tools that probe molecular_structure involve measurements over defined time windows thereby providing at the extremes either snapshots reflecting the uniqueness of the populations or a weighted_average of the existing configurations a further complication is that many functionally_important states are short_lived or lowly populated existing amidst a diverse background of other states and intermediates therefore in order to understand the mechanistic_details of biological_processes it is often necessary to appreciate the range of structural configurations adopted by the system one approach to describing these configurations and their abundance is to fit experimental structural data against the predicted values obtained from ensembles of possible structures ensemble based v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com doi bioinformatics btv obtaining meaningful_results from ensemble based_approaches is contingent upon various factors these include the discriminating_power of the input_data the proper sampling of conformational_space and the selection of an appropriate ensemble size if the ensemble size is too small insufficient structural_variability will typically result in poor fits while overly large ensembles run the risk of over fitting the experimental_data and potentially including unreasonable components indeed the ensemble size embodies the difference between minimal ensemble and other ensemble based techniques some methods that employ larger ensembles and thus greater computational requirements such as eros typically avoid over fitting by using statistical_methods such as maximum_entropy which restricts excessive optimization of ensemble component concentrations contributions however even these approaches are subject to significant pitfalls most notably that insufficient or inaccurate sampling of conformational_space may result in unnecessarily large ensembles in the other extreme it is possible that an artificially small set of component structures may provide acceptable fits to experimental_data while insufficiently describing the systems true heterogeneity both concerns may be partially addressed by cross_validation with different types of experimental_data and examination of the variability present in multiple converged solutions mesmer facilitates the process of finding structural ensembles that can recapitulate data obtained from heterogeneous solutions we have validated mesmer by investigating a variety of case studies previously shown to exhibit structural_heterogeneity despite this heterogeneity the averaged experimental_data available from these systems were sufficient to report on specific structural_characteristics providing new insights into the systems function mesmer introduces several innovations that may find utility in similar ensemble based_methods streamlining much of the necessary workflow while retaining flexibility mesmers gui is intended to enable a wide user base to readily and intuitively investigate complicated structural_heterogeneity while its extensible and modular nature enables advanced users to incorporate new experiments and analytical_techniques
