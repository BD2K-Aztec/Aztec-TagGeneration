differential_protein and peak selection in mass_spectrometry data by binary discriminant_analysis motivation proteomic mass_spectrometry analysis is becoming routine in clinical_diagnostics for example to monitor cancer biomarkers using blood_samples however differential proteomics and identification of peaks relevant for class separation remains_challenging results here we introduce a simple yet effective approach for identifying differentially_expressed using binary discriminant_analysis this approach works by data adaptive thresholding of protein expression values and subsequent ranking of the dichotomized features using a relative en tropy measure our framework may be viewed as a generalization of the peak probability contrast approach of tibshirani et_al and can be applied both in the two group and the multi group setting our approach is computationally inexpensive and shows in the analysis of a large_scale drug_discovery test_dataset equivalent prediction_accuracy as a random_forest furthermore we were able to identify in the analysis of mass_spectrometry data from a pancreas_cancer study biological relevant and statistically predictive marker peaks unrecognized in the original study availability_and the methodology for binary discriminant_analysis is implemented in the r package binda which is freely_available under the gnu_general version or later from cran at url http cran r project org_web binda r scripts reproducing all described analyzes are available from the web_page http strimmerlab org software binda mass_spectrometry a high_throughput technology commonly used in proteomics enables the measurement of the abundance of proteins metabolites peptides and amino_acids in biological_samples the study of changes in protein expression across subgroups of samples and through time provides valuable insights into cellular_mechanisms and offers a means to identify relevant biomarkers e g to distinguish among tissue_types or for predicting health_status in practice however there still remain many analytic and computational challenges to be addressed especially in clinical_diagnostics a recent overview of statistical issues in the analysis of proteomics mass_spectrometry data is morris who discusses a wide_range of methods ranging from data preprocessing i e removal of systematic_bias peak identification peak alignment and quantification and calibration of relative peak_intensities to methods for high_level statistical_analysis such as peak ranking and classification of particular importance is the problem of differential_protein and the identification of peaks informative for group separation and class_prediction a special characteristic of mass_spectrometry data is their dualvalued nature i e they contain both continuous as well as discreteinformation specifically a protein may be differentially_expressed if its intensity of expression varies among groups and is relatively up or down_regulated or if a corresponding peak is either absent or present in a specific group consequently mass_spectrometry intensity matrices typically contain very large_amounts of missing_values which renders application of standard statistical methodology from other omics platforms such as regularized t scores difficult and potentially suboptimal accordingly this has initiated the development of new statistical methodology two main strategies to address_this in the high_level analysis of mass_spectrometry data have emerged all data are treated as continuous with missing intensity values set to zero or imputed subsequently standard omics methods are employed such as t scores for feature_selection e g the absencepresence data are used for data analysis in conjunction with the intensity values propose peak probability contrasts ppcs the absolute_difference in frequency of occurrence of a peak for ranking and feature_selection and also use ppc to improve absencepresence data by dichotomization of intensity values propose a test based on the ppc statistic and propose to apply joint false_discovery control of the union of intensity based and ppcbased rankings here we follow the second route and propose a novel coherent model for differential_protein and prediction based on binary discriminant_analysis binda our approach may be viewed as a generalization ofand comprises the following bullet the binary absencepresence data are explicitly modeled by a multivariate bernoulli mvb distribution bullet multi group binary discriminant_analysis binda is employed for feature ranking variable_selection and prediction bullet for ranking of peaks the natural relative entropy variable_importance measure coherent with binda is used rather than ppc bullet likewise for dichotomization of the intensity data matrix containing missing_values we employ the same entropy based criterion as a result we obtain simple principled framework for analyzing dual valued mass_spectrometry data without the need for imputation with a natural measure for variable ranking and for differential_protein and with coherent prediction rules in contrast to many other methods this approach also allows multiple groups as response variable and thus extends beyond simple pairwise_comparisons the remainder of the paper is structured as follows next we describe in detail the statistical methodology underlying binda then for validation we investigate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with a random_forest on a large_scale chemometric dataset subsequently we present a detailed case study analyzing mass_spectrometry data from a pancreas_cancer study for reproducibility we provide the r package binda implementing our approach and r scripts for all analyzes described finally we discuss applicability of the binda approach to other molecular data as well as further extensions we have presented a simple yet effective approach to differential_expression and classification for mass_spectrometry data using binda our approach may be viewed as generalization ofand can be applied also for multi group discriminant_analysis a particular feature is the use of the same relative entropy criterion for peak ranking and selection and for dichotomization of the continuous protein intensity data in addition we obtain decision thresholds from the protein intensities that are biologically and diagnostically easy to interpret in illustrative analysis of high_dimensional drug_discovery data we showed that our approach implemented in the r package binda is computationally effective and yet competitive with a random_forest furthermore in reanalysis of proteomics_data from a pancreas_cancer study we found statistically predictive marker peaks to tumor_cell unrecognized in the original analysis this confirms the importance of reproducible_research in proteomics where it is unfortunately still not common to provide analysis scripts and software openly in addition to mass_spectrometry analysis there are many bioinformatics applications in which binary_data are collected and hence in which the present methodology and software will potentially be useful examples_include meta genomics where the absence and presence of proteins and genes is compared with a pan_genome community analysis by dna_fingerprinting and chemometrics exploring additional applications may also lead to further methodological extensions of the procedures currently implemented in binda such as modeling overdispersion e g by employing the betabernoulli rather than bernoulli distribution and to take account of interactions among predictors e g by modeling pair_wise correlation
