aptani a computational_tool to select aptamers through sequence structure motif analysis of ht selex data motivation aptamers are synthetic nucleic_acid molecules that can bind biological_targets in virtue of both their sequence and three_dimensional structure aptamers are selected using selex systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment a technique that exploits aptamer target binding_affinity the selex procedure coupled with high_throughput ht selex creates billions of random_sequences capable of binding different epitopes on specific targets since this technique produces enormous amounts of data computational_analysis represents a critical step to screen and select the most biologically_relevant sequences results here we present aptani a computational_tool to identify target specific aptamers from ht selex data and secondary_structure information aptani builds on aptamotif algorithm originally implemented to analyze selex data extends the applicability of aptamotif to ht selex data and introduces new functionalities as the possibility to identify binding_motifs to cluster aptamer families or to compare output results from different ht selex cycles tabular and graph ical representations facilitate the downstream biological_interpretation of results availability_and aptani is available at http aptani unimore it dna or rna aptamers are small oligonucleotides nucleotides that recognize their ligands with an affinity equal or superior to antibodies these small_molecules are not immunogenic have a high capacity to penetrate tissues and can be easily modified to regulate their half_life or conjugated with drugs aptamers have entered the clinical pipeline with more than nine phase i and ii ongoing_clinical for diseases as macular_degeneration coronary_artery and various types of cancer aptamers are selected in vitro by the use of an unsupervised iterative_method called selex systematic evolution of ligands by exponentialenrichment in which aptamers specific for a ligand are selected from an initial pool of random oligonucleotides using counter selection and selection procedures historically a selex experiment required multiple rounds of selection with the undesirable effect of amplifying some intrinsic pitfalls as e g the selection of polymerase_chain pcr artifacts in recent_years the advent_of sequencing_technologies revolutionized the selex technique drastically reducing the number of cycles and consequently the possibility of generating artifacts ht selex the selex procedure coupled with high_throughput boosted the use of selex technique to identify monoclonal aptamers against different epitopes of a ligand or of a whole cell however the quantity of data derived from a single ht selex experiment requires the development of new computational_tools to effectively_identify aptamers with elevate binding proprieties considering that the binding_affinity of a specific aptamer toward its target depends on the aptamer secondary_structure structural_properties could be exploited to select those aptamers that more likely interact with a ligand to date even though interest in secondary_structures is rising most of the available algorithms and software that analyze htselex data do not make use of any structural_information but rely solely on the abundance frequency of the nucleotide_sequences at the various cycles to fulfill this gap we developed aptani a software_package to select aptamers from ht selex experiments using both sequence counts and structural_motifs aptani builds on aptamotif algorithm originally implemented by hoinka et_al to analyze selex data and extends its applicability to htselex data additionally aptani through the integrative_analysis of frequency and secondary_structure allows to identify not only those aptamers with the highest binding probability but also their putative binding_motifs finally aptani comprises some additional functionalities as the possibility to cluster aptamer families or to compare output results from different ht selex cycles to test aptani performances and validate its findings we analyzed a sequence library corresponding to an ht selex experiment designed to isolate aptamers specific for murine il_ra briefly epoxy beads conjugated with the extracellular_domain of il_ra were used to screen a combinatorial random rna library of approximately aptamer species libraries from the pcr_reaction of selex cycles and were tagged in and with dna tails containing the primers and tags for hybridization and control libraries were quantified via real_time and bio analyzer admixed equally and sequenced with an illumina ngs the derived fastq_files were processed with illumina software to separate the clones from each library and imputed to aptani to select potentially binding aptamers directed to il_ra the experiment comprised different cycles of evolutionary selection of the randomly_generated aptamers leading to a final cycle containing approximately million sequences setting the threshold for the frequency cut_off at aptani selected from cycle data different aptamer sequences of base_pair length the majority of the sequences from the last cycle were extremely similar similarity with clustal omega alignment to the cl aptamer previously demonstrated to be specific for mouse and human il_ra using conventional methods i e cloning and sequencing interestingly while conventional methods were able to identify the cl clone starting from cycle aptani identified cl just from the data of the first cycle of selection cycle i e from a pool of sequences still in the process of being selected and composed mostly of the initial random oligonucleotides with only few aptamers displaying affinity for the target the secondary_structure analysis of these cycle sequences using iterations and selecting at each iteration a number of random aptamers equal to of the entire pool allowed selecting aptamers containing secondary_structure motif sub sequences with an alignment score with loop consensus_sequences and clustering in three major families dominated by cl aptamer alignment score supplementary frequency and score values of the intra strand loop identified by aptani in cl suggested that the ccaugc secondary_structure motif could be essential for the binding to il_ra to test this hypothesis we generated a mutant aptamer mutcl in which the ccaugc motif was substituted by uuuccc the analysis of the putative secondary_and of mutcl using rnafold and rnacomposer confirmed that this mutation completely disrupts the intra strand loop of cl to experimentally verify the dependency of cl binding activity from the intra strand loop we evaluated cl and mutcl affinities in a binding_assay against epoxy beads loaded with recombinant il_ra as shown in while cl correctly binds to beads loaded with il_ra the mutant aptamer does not show any binding activity suggesting that the intra strand loop identified by aptani is indeed required for conferring functional activity to the aptamer sequence to access the impact of parameters on the final results we run a second analysis with lowering the number of iterations to while keeping constant the percentage of randomly picked aptamers at each cycle i e of all aptamers and the frequency threshold with this set of parameters aptani retrieved aptamers containing secondary_structure motif sub sequences with an alignment score and clustering in three major families dominated by cl aptamer whose alignment score remained we finally performed the same analysis considering the aptamer variable region with the same set of parameters used in the previous_experiments aptani retrieved from cycle different variable sequences with a frequency spanning from to and a length ranging from to nucleotides of these variable sequences presented highly populated motifs and frequencies as in theby aptani we first synthetized the cl aptamer a and a mutant cl mutcl b with the original ccaug sequence substituted by uuucc secondary_structure analysis suggests that this five nucleotides substitution completely abrogates the original intra strand loop a and b then to evaluate whether the ccaugc motif was important for the aptamer binding to il_ra cl mutcl and an irrelevant aptamer were labelled with cy and incubated with epoxybeads conjugated with recombinant il_ra binding was evaluated by facs after washing out the unbound cy labeled aptamer with pbs c as expected the cl aptamer red line binds to the cognate receptor as determined by the higher fluorescence_intensity detected on beads on the contrary the mutcl aptamer blue line shows a binding similar to the irrelevant aptamer gray used as negative control previous_experiments cl aptamer resulted the most abundant sequence and its intra strand loop among the most represented motifs
