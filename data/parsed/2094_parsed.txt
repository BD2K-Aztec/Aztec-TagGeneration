data_and goplot an r package for visually combining expression data with functional analysis despite the plethora of methods available for the functional analysis of omics_data obtaining comprehensive yet detailed understanding of the results remains_challenging this is mainly due to the lack of publicly_available tools for the visualization of this type of information here we present an r package called goplot based on ggplot for enhanced graphical_representation our package takes the output of any general enrichment_analysis and generates plots at different levels of detail from a general overview to identify the most enriched categories bar plot bubble plot to a more detailed view displaying different types of information for molecules in a given set of categories circle plot chord plot cluster plot the package provides a deeper insight into omics_data and allows scientists to generate insightful plots with only a few lines of code to easily communicate the findings availability_and the r package goplot is available via cran the comprehensive_r http cran r project org_web goplot the shiny web_application of the venn_diagram can be found at https wwalter shinyapps io venn a detailed manual of the package with sample figures can be found at https wencke github io contact fscabo cnic es or mricote cnic esomics technologies have become standard_tools in biological_research for identifying and unraveling transcriptional_networks building predictive_models and discovering candidate_biomarkers gene protein metabolomic expression data is especially challenging for investigators due to its high_dimensional nature exploratory_data techniques are used to get a first impression of the important characteristics of the dataset and to reveal its underlying_structure statistical_analyses are then performed to detect subsets of elements owing the ability to provide_valuable the underlying patterns of the investigated biological_process one common approach is to map the molecules to their associated biological annotations e g gene_ontology go terms and to further perform an enrichment_analysis although many visualization methods tools and packages have been developed none of them enables the user to combine expression data with the results of functional analysis in a way that guarantees the preservation of the power of both analyses r is commonly used by the omics community to analyze highdimensional expression data we therefore developed the r package goplot based on the implementation of the grammar of graphics goplot follows the path of deductive reasoning to allow the user to go from the most general to the most specific details of the functional analysis results the package implements novel original high_quality plots which also allow the integration of other quantitative information about molecules i e the expression levels goplot improves understanding of omics_data and aids the communication of biologically_relevant findings in publications
