gene_expression skyline an open_source document editor for creating and analyzing targeted_proteomics experiments skyline is a windows client application for targeted_proteomics method creation and quantitative data analysis it is open_source and freely_available for academic and commercial use the skyline user_interface simplifies the development of mass_spectrometer methods and the analysis of data from targeted_proteomics experiments performed using selected_reaction srm skyline supports using and creating ms_ms spectral_libraries from a wide_variety of sources to choose srm filters and verify results based on previously observed ion_trap data skyline exports transition lists to and imports the native output_files from agilent applied_biosystems thermo fisher scientific and waters triple_quadrupole instruments seamlessly connecting mass_spectrometer output back to the experimental_design document the fast and compact skyline file_format is easily shared even for experiments requiring many sample injections a rich array of graphs displays results and provides powerful_tools for inspecting data integrity as data are acquired helping instrument operators to identify problems early the skyline dynamic report designer exports tabular data from the skyline document model for in depth analysis with common statistical_tools availability single click self updating web installation is available at http proteome gs washington edu software skyline this web_site also provides access to instructional videos a support board an issues list and a link to the source_code project in recent_years the promise of targeted_proteomics has gained significant attention however the tools for its practice have been either limited and cumbersome or proprietary and specific to a particular instrument vendor supplementary text skyline was explicitly designed to accelerate targeted_proteomics experimentation and foster broad sharing of both methods and results to whom correspondence should be addressed across instrument platforms supplementary the software is developed under the open_source apache license as part of the proteowizard project an official public release is freely_available and currently in use in many proteomics labs both commercial and academic
