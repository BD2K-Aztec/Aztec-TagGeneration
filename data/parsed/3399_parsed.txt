data_and over representation of correlation_analysis orca a method for identifying associations between variable sets motivation often during the analysis of biological data it is of importance to interpret the correlation_structure that exists between variables such correlations may reveal patterns of co regulation that are indicative of biochemical_pathways or common mechanisms of response to a related set of treatments however analyses of correlations are usually conducted by either subjective interpretation of the univariate covariance_matrix or by applying multivariate modeling techniques which do not take prior_biological into account over representation analysis ora is a simple method for objectively deciding whether a set of variables of known or suspected biological_relevance such as a gene_set or pathway is more prevalent in a set of variables of interest than we expect by chance however ora is usually applied to a set of variables differentiating a single experimental variable and does not take into account correlations results over representation of correlation_analysis orca is a novel combination of ora and correlation_analysis that provides a means to test whether more associations exist between two specific groups of variables than expected by chance the method is exemplified by application to drug_sensitivity and microrna expression data from a panel of cancer_cell nci orca highlighted a previously_reported correlation between sensitivity to alkylating anticancer_agents and topoisomerase inhibitors we also used this approach to validate microrna clusters predicted by mrna correlations these observations suggest that orca has the potential to reveal novel insights from these data which are not readily apparent using classical ora availability_and the r code of the method is available at https github com orcabioinfo orcacodehigh throughput biological techniques such as gene_expression microarray or high_throughput have become a routine for most research_laboratories in life_sciences thousands of biomolecules in different conditions e g mrnas micrornas proteins or metabolites can be measured simultaneously in complex_diseases such as cancer these biomolecules in a group such as a pathway or a gene_set are often altered together two conventional but contrasting approaches for analyzing coordinated responses in molecular_profile data are correlation_analysis and pathway analysis in correlation or covariance analysis and its multivariate extensions such as principal_components and canonical_correlation there is a focus on quantitatively estimating the explanatory_power of one variable over another to infer some fundamental link between the observed biomolecules in pathway analysis however the objective is to use prior_knowledge about interacting or otherwise related sets of biomolecules and to test specific hypotheses about the relationship between a particular set of those biomolecules the pathway and a given experimental_condition a conventional approach for pathway analysis of highthroughput biological data is over representation analysis ora to perform ora firstly the biomolecules such as mrna proteins or microrna considered differentially_expressed in two or more conditions are identified secondly the number of differentially_expressed biomolecules in each pathway is determined finally for each pathway a probability value pvalue of obtaining the number of differentially_expressed biomolecules against the background list of all biomolecules measured is calculated using a hypergeometric_distribution the first implementation of ora was bywhere transcriptional_regulatory subnetworks in yeast were identified by using mrna microarray profiling most implementations of ora are used to perform pathway analysis based on pathway_information such as kyoto_encyclopedia kegg or other pathway_databases or to infer important_biological of two different conditions from biological categories such as gene_ontology go we introduce a novel method called over representation of correlation_analysis orca that seeks to combine both conventional approaches for analysis of coordinated biological_responses and provide a new means to test for an unexpectedly high prevalence of informative associations between two sets of variables which could be mrna microrna or proteins that comprise pathways groups deemed of importance a priori the method first calculates the correlation_coefficients between all the variables in the dataset in which the variables can be divided_into groups according to pre defined_criteria exclusive groupings then as an analogy to counting differentially_expressed to whom correspondence should be addressed genes in ora which might be below or above a certain threshold of p values or other metrics orca defines the number of correlation_coefficients that are above a certain threshold within each group finally the probability of association between any two group pair is calculated in a similar fashion to the calculation of over representation in the conventional ora this probability value is calculated from the number of correlation_coefficients that pass a threshold against the background number of correlation_coefficients of the two group pairs and overall correlation_coefficients by using the hypergeometric_test the correlation_coefficient threshold can be empirically chosen or calculated by a shannons entropy based threshold selection the method was applied to several biological_datasets to demonstrate the concept and implications of orca in biological data analysis orca can be used as pathway analysis tool but the research_question will be different from existing pathway or gene_set current methods identify pathways that are significantly_enriched or depleted with respect to genes associated to a biological condition while orca can identify pathways that are associated through correlations although the examples given here were not of typical pathways orca can be applied to any type of pathway or gene_set to determine pathways that are associated in terms of pathway analysis orca addresses some limitations of existing pathway analysis methods that were presented by first whereas ora does not take the actual levels of variables such as gene_expression or metabolite_levels into consideration orca can take these values into account although indirectly through the correlation_coefficient calculation which means that orca does not weigh the variables equally second by using correlation orca does not assume that the variables are independent which is usually an important assumption in typical ora implementations third classical ora only uses variables such as mrnas or micrornas that are deemed most differentially_expressed while orca uses all the data in the calculation fourth pathway analysis tools based on ora use multiple testing corrections that assume independence of each pathway orca on the other hand assumes the opposite and looks for the association between two sets of variables because our method is based on the hypergeometric_test it could be argued that orca violates the assumptions of the independence of each data point by using correlation_coefficients as the source data this may lead to inaccurate p value calculations from the test goeman and b uhlmann have shown in simulated_data that when hypergeometric_test was used in correlated datasets the calculated p values will be underestimated possible remedies for the underestimated p values could be multiple_comparisons procedures such as bonferroni_correction or benjaminihochberg fdr correction which was applied in this study a table showing the nominal alpha level for correlated data from goeman and b uhlmann can also be used to select a suitable alpha level according to a correlation threshold a limitation of this approach is that in the simulation experiment mentioned above all the data_points have the same correlation_coefficient an alternative test that could be used instead of the hypergeometric_test is the wilcoxon_rank where the comparison is between the number of correlation_coefficients in one grouppair and all other group pairs orca can be used in pathway analysis in the same way as tools based on ora however the information that will be derived from orca relates specifically to the pathway interactions for pathway or gene_set orca can calculate the correlation_coefficients between genes or metabolites and then find the pathway_pairs that have more correlation_coefficients that pass a certain threshold determined by the threshold selection method or by other means than expected our version of orca requires group_membership of variables to be mutually_exclusive therefore it cannot yet be used with pathway data where group members overlap i e variables can not belong to more than one group this is the subject of future work recently gene co function networks were used to identify cross category association between different go classes however crogo does not explicitly include gene_expression values into the analysis and therefore could miss actual association between go categories in the real biological_context in this regard orca can be a crucial downstream_analysis to crogo to highlight associations between go categories that are of greatest importance using gene_expression to complement the associations identified by crogo in conclusion orca is a new method that combines analysis of correlation with ora and has the potential to reveal otherwise obscured associations between sets of variables whether they are genes proteins metabolites or other molecular signals in a wide_variety of biological_datasets although the method has clear application in omics_data analysis orca can be profitable in any circumstance where an association_network can be constructed between variables that can be classified into meaningful sets
