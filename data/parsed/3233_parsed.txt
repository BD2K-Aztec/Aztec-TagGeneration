systems_biology network_based from complex proteomic mixtures using snipe motivation proteomics presents the opportunity to provide novel insights about the global biochemical state of a tissue however a significant problem with current methods is that shotgun_proteomics has limited success at detecting many low_abundance such as transcription_factors from complex_mixtures of cells and tissues the ability to assay for these proteins in the context of the entire proteome would be useful in many areas of experimental biology results we used network_based in an approach named snipe software for network_inference of proteomics experiments that selectively highlights proteins that are more likely to be active but are otherwise undetectable in a shotgun proteomic sample snipe integrates spectral counts from paired casecontrol samples over a network neighbourhood and assesses the statistical likelihood of enrichment by a permutation_test as an initial application snipe was able to select several proteins required for early murine tooth_development multiple lines of additional experimental_evidence confirm that snipe can uncover previously_unreported transcription_factors in this system we conclude that snipe can enhance the utility of shotgun proteomics_data to facilitate the study of poorly detected proteins in complex_mixtures availability_and an implementation for the r statistical computing environment named sniper has been made freelythe proteins expressed in a tissue are critical to determining its identity and proper_function characterizing these proteins is the goal of proteomics however current mass_spectrometer technology is largely incapable of detecting many of the low_abundance in complex_mixtures such as mammalian whole tissue lysates the common approaches to deal with this problem include enrichment assays or selective on line monitoring of specific ions or reactions the primary issue with these methods is that by design they only capture a fraction of the proteome as a result comprehensive proteome_analysis remains a difficult_task and an as yet unsolved_problem for multi_cellular eukaryotes because of this the biochemical state of a tissue must often be inferred from gene_expression data and a few select trusted antibodies leaving the vast_majority of the proteome invisible and essentially unapproachable the ability to assay the complete proteome would be desirable for fields such as developmental_biology however in addition to technical_challenges discussed previously developmental biologists often study highly complex tissues available in limited amounts also many of the key_proteins of interest including transcription_factors and signalling_molecules are present only at low_abundance and are not well detected by whole proteome_analysis gene_expression or rna_seq are used as a stand in for an effective whole proteome assay but it has been repeatedly established that quantitative_proteomic measurements correlate poorly to gene_expression levels rendering this approach problematic for assaying the proteome thus although a clear need exists for effective proteomics approaches current_technology does not meet the needs of researchers when tissue quantity or machine time is constrained a common_goal in developmental_biology is to define the mechanisms that determine the states of cells and tissues in time and space these mechanisms are carried_out by the coordinated tissue_specific action of a large number of proteins the activity of these proteins can be differentially_regulated in several ways first the proteins themselves can be expressed at different levels alternately although being expressed at the same level they can change their localization or function because of modifications these proteins do not act individually but are members of genetic_pathways in which the regulation of one member will have an impact on other pathway members thus the expression and function of other pathway members is indicative of the activity of a given protein for example the role of a transcription_factor in specific tissue or developmental time point can be evident from the differential regulation of its transcriptional_targets similarly the role of a secreted signalling molecule can be inferred from the changes in protein levels or localization of other canonical pathway members to whom correspondence should be addressed we hypothesized that the coordinated expression of associated proteins can be used to infer the identity of proteins involved in development this approach can be applied to proteomic_data where the protein of interest cannot be readily identified or quantified to test this hypothesis we have developed a wholly computational method_named snipe software for network_inference of proteomics experiments snipe integrates previous biological_knowledge encoded in a pre_existing network with the simple spectral counts obtained from any mass_spectrometry experiment to select proteins whose network neighbourhoods are enriched between samples proteins that are involved in development but otherwise undetected in the sample would be expected to have enriched surrounding subnetwork and may be thus detectable by snipe as part of an effort to use systems_biology approaches for mammalian organ engineering we focused on a mouse_model for the development of snipe the developing_mouse tooth is a premier model for organogenesis through epithelialmesenchymal interactions which comprise a fundamental principle for the development of numerous mammalian organs these interactions are characterized in all tissues including the tooth by the exchange of signalling_molecules leading to the induction of transcription_factors and other signalling_molecules that are responsible for the development of the organ as these low abundancy proteins form the core of the developmental mechanism driving the formation of many organs it is important to be able to assay them applying snipe to the study of the developing tooth would therefore be an optimal test case for the method as its performance could be judged by its ability to assay these critical but challenging to detect proteins here we report the snipe algorithm and software implementation and its ability to correctly infer the presence of proteins known to be expressed in and functionally_important in tooth_development as well as its ability to infer the presence of transcription_factors previously_undescribed in the developing tooth
