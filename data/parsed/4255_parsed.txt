simple topological_properties predict functional misannotations in a metabolic_network motivation misannotation in sequence_databases is an important obstacle for automated tools for gene function_annotation which rely extensively on comparison with sequences with known function to improve current annotations and prevent future propagation of errors sequence_independent tools are therefore needed to assist in the identification of misannotated gene_products in the case of enzymatic functions each functional assignment implies the existence of a reaction within the organisms metabolic_network a first approximation to a genome_scale model can be obtained directly from an automated genome_annotation any obvious problems in the network such as dead_end or disconnected reactions can therefore be strong indications of misannotation results we demonstrate that a machine_learning approach using only network topological_features can successfully predict the validity of enzyme annotations the predictions are tested at three different levels a random_forest using topological_features of the metabolic_network and trained on curated sets of correct and incorrect enzyme assignments was found to have an accuracy of up to in fold_cross experiments further cross_validation against unseen enzyme superfamilies indicates that this classifier can successfully extrapolate beyond the classes of enzyme present in the training data the random_forest was applied to several automated genome_annotations achieving an accuracy of in most cases when validated against recent genome_scale we also observe that when applied to draft metabolic_networks for multiple species a clear negative correlation is observed between predicted annotation_quality and phylogenetic distance to the major model_organism for biochemistry escherichia_coli for prokaryotes and homo_sapiens for eukaryotes misannotation in sequence_databases has been a recognized problem for more than a decade early studies reported the emergence of this issue and estimated that up to of proteins were misannotated in public_databases more recent_studies have confirmed that this problem is still a reality and some even suggest that it has been getting worse over time identifying overprediction and error propagation as the main sources of error as experimental_verification of gene function is expected to remain a highly time consuming process it is unlikely that it will be able to keep pace with the increasing amount of genome sequence_data being deposited in public_databases more accurate computational_methods for functional_annotation and assessment of confidence in gene_annotations are therefore increasingly necessary in the area of automated functional_annotation several approaches moving beyond basic sequence_similarity are now available some recent annotation software will classify proteins based on locally conserved sequence_patterns that are normally related with function other approaches take into account the evolutionary_relationships between proteins by integrating evidence across phylogenetic_trees or use additional information such as proteinprotein_interaction data or genomic correlations however functional_annotation is still mainly based on sequence_similarity given this fact the accuracy of existing annotations has a crucial impact on that of future annotations this dependency can lead to error propagation and a consequent increase in the number of annotation errors moreover as information on the origin of annotation is often scarce this error propagation does not have an easy solution the problem becomes even clearer when we note that the proportion of manually_annotated proteins is and continues to decrease any evidence that is independent of sequence may therefore be useful for discriminating between true and false functional_annotations the concept of gene function implies interaction with some part of the cell or the environment and almost all functions of interest are the result of interactions among several components modelling these interactions by means of networks and studying their topological_properties is therefore one way to understand the context of these molecular_functions one easily_accessible example of a well defined molecular_network derived from a set of gene_annotations is a draft metabolic_network such as those available in the kegg_database the topological_properties of these networks have been studied previously in the contexts of network evolution and drug_target for example the metabolic_networks of parasitic species are known to be distinguishable from non parasitic species on the basis of their topology intuitively any problems in such a network for example dead ends or disconnected components could be an indication of misannotation however each individual type of evidence can be relatively weak e g dead ends may also to whom correspondence should be

work we propose a supervised machine_learning methodology to assess the accuracy of assigned molecular_functions based on simple topological_properties of an organisms draft metabolic_network we show that our approach is able to separate correct annotations from incorrect ones with accuracy of up to being entirely independent of sequence properties it can be used to complement existing_approaches and hence contribute to the detection and correction of errors in functional_annotation our results have demonstrated that simple topological_features can be used to predict incorrect functional_annotations within metabolic_networks the random_forest has not only achieved high overall cross_validation accuracy but has also been shown to be informative when applied to enzymes belonging to superfamilies that were not used in training this approach is entirely independent of sequence properties hence it could be used to support automated metabolic reconstruction pipelines as well as helping to identify incorrectly annotated enzymes within public_databases subsequent improvements in the accuracy of the genome_scale obtained will be of benefit in their downstream_analysis for example using constraint based_methods such as flux_balance for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes it seems that the quality of automated metabolic reconstruction decreases with phylogenetic distance to the major model_organism for biochemistry e coli and human respectively however differences in network_topology between free living_organisms and obligate_intracellular species may make the classifier less accurate when applied to the latter group of species given a larger amount of training data it should be possible to produce separate classifiers for each of these two groups
