seqem an adaptive genotype_calling approach for next_generation studies motivation next_generation presents several statistical challenges with one of the most fundamental being determining an individuals genotype from multiple aligned short_read at a position some simple approaches for genotype_calling apply fixed filters such as calling a heterozygote if more than a specified percentage of the reads have variant nucleotide calls other genotype_calling methods such as maq and soapsnp are implementations of bayes classifiers in that they classify genotypes using posterior genotype probabilities results here we propose a novel genotype_calling algorithm that in contrast to the other methods estimates parameters underlying the posterior_probabilities in an adaptive way rather than arbitrarily specifying them a priori the algorithm which we call seqem applies the well known expectation_maximization to an appropriate likelihood for a sample of unrelated_individuals with next generation sequence_data leveraging information from the sample to estimate genotype probabilities and the nucleotide read error_rate we demonstrate using analytic calculations and simulations that seqem results in genotype call error_rates as small as or smaller than filtering approaches and maq we also apply seqem to exome_sequence in eight related individuals and compare the results to genotypes from an illumina snp_array showing that seqem behaves well in real_data that deviates from idealized assumptions conclusion seqem offers an improved robust and flexible genotype_calling approach that can be widely_applied in the next_generation studies availability_and software for seqem is freely_available from our website www hihg org under software download recent_technological in massively_parallel highthroughput dna_sequencing commonly called next_generation are producing an unprecedented volume of sequence_data the next few years are likely to see public_databases such as the short_read archive at the national center for biotechnology to whom correspondence should be addressed information filled with hundreds of thousands of terabases of human sequence_data next_generation promises to be a powerful_tool for discovery of genetic_variation contributing to risk of complex_diseases by providing rapid and complete sequencing of a set of candidate_genes the entire exome or even the whole_genome current next_generation are shotgun approaches that produce base sequences for multiple individual dna_molecules which depending upon the sequencing_technology range from to bp in average length once aligned to a reference_genome the number of reference nucleotides and the number of variant non reference nucleotides among multiple_sequences overlapping a given dna site can be counted apart from sequencing_error an individual homozygous at the site would yield either all reference or all variant nucleotides however because of random_sampling of homologous base_pairs in heterozygotes and sequencing or alignment errors the raw counts do not directly identify the genotype at that site this uncertainty requires a genotype_calling algorithm to determine the latent genotype of an individual from multiple aligned sequence_reads two primary methods are currently implemented for genotype_calling i a filtering method based on a fixed number of observed variant nucleotides and ii a probabilistic_method based on posterior genotype probabilities commercial software e g roche gsmapper clc and lasergene employs simple filters to distinguish heterozygotes from reference homozygotes by calling an individual heterozygous if more than a prespecified number or proportion of variant reads are seen at a position the difficulty with an arbitrary threshold for determining genotypes is that it does not explicitly take into account the number of aligned sequences read_depth or information about allele_frequency or nucleotideread error it also does not quantify the uncertainty of the call a related approach determines filter thresholds for genotype_calls empirically using results from known genotypes probabilistic approaches which assign genotype_calls based on the maximum posterior genotype probability given the read data have been implemented in programs such as maq and soapsnp these use fixed prior values for heterozygote probabilities and nucleotide read error probabilities which may not be representative for a given sample in calculating posterior_probabilities these approaches make genotype_calls for a single individual at a time and thus do not utilize information from additional individuals in the sample anticipating that most resequencing studies will produce data for multiple_individuals we recognized that therepage
