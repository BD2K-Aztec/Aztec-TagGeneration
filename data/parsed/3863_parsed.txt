gene_expression ramona a web_application for gene_set on multilevel omics_data decreasing costs of modern high_throughput experiments allow for the simultaneous analysis of altered gene activity on various molecular levels however these multi omics approaches lead to a large amount of data which is hard to interpret for a non bioinforma tician here we present the remotely accessible multilevel ontology analysis ramona it offers an easy to use interface for the simultaneous gene_set of combined omics_datasets and is an extension of the previously_introduced mona approach ramona is based on a bayesian enrichment method for the inference of overrepresented biological_processes among given gene_sets overrepresentation is quantified by interpretable term probabilities it is able to handle data from various molecular levels while in parallel coping with redundancies arising from gene_set overlaps and related multiple testing problems the comprehensive output of ramona is easy to interpret and thus allows for functional insight into the affected biological_processes with ramona we provide an efficient implementation of the bayesian_inference problem such that ontologies consisting of thousands of terms can be processed in the order of seconds availability_and ramona is implemented as asp net web_application and publicly_available at http icb helm holtz muenchen de decreasing costs of large_scale molecular_profiling studies such as transcriptomics or proteomics allow for the joint analysis of several molecular levels in parallel the crucial step in the analysis of such diverse data is to combine the different levels such that a comprehensive insight in the response of genes to these conditions can be assessed this in turn can be directly linked to the underlying biological_processes affecting the activity of genes on several molecular levels however these kinds of analyses are not straightforward and often the molecular levels are treated as independent to allow the use of single omics analysis techniques in practice gene response is initially determined by using statistical_methods among the resulting set of altered genes one usually searches for overrepresented biological_processes by applying common gene_set enrichment_methods that incorporate functional_annotations from databases like gene_ontology go or the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg even though there exists a multitude of easy to use web_based enrichment tools they are only capable of analyzing a single molecular level furthermore no web_tool is available that properly deals with term redundancies appearing frequently e g due to the tree_structure of go to provide a powerful method to integrate multilevel gene response data for the determination of altered biological_processes we recently_introduced the multilevel ontology analysis mona mona is a model based bayesian_method which is able to integrate datasets from multiple molecular levels by simultaneously dealing with term redundancies and related multiple testing problems however the usage of the standalone mona application can be a cumbersome process as the user has to specify the data_structure of the activated genes and their term annotations by himself herself furthermore it lacks a comprehensive visualization of the results and can be run only on windows machines as it depends on the net library here we introduce a web_based implementation of mona called remotely accessible mona ramona which is designed with the focus on practical usability for any applied researcher it offers three models to analyze most common experimental_setups the web_interface is capable of processing many given gene identifiers as well as of automatically mapping them to widely used ontologies derived from go and kegg the detailed output of ramona includes an interactive_visualization of the inferred active terms in the context of their respective pathways or ontology hierarchy this provides functional insight into the activity of biological_processes and the role of associated genes responding to the given conditions by providing relevant details on the resulting processes the integration of data from multiple molecular levels for gene_set is becoming more and more important and therefore requires appropriate methods which are easy to use for applied researchers important challenges we address with ramona include dependencies between terms with an ontology and interactions between molecular levels we provide an easy to use web_application that can be used to infer non redundant biological_processes either from multiple molecular levels or from a single molecular level
