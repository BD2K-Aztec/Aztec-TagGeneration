genome_analysis power and sample_size estimation for microbiome_studies using pairwise_distances and permanova motivation the variation in community_composition between microbiome samples termed beta diversity can be measured by pairwise distance based on either presenceabsence or quantitative species abundance data permanova a permutation_based extension of multivariate_analysis to a matrix of pairwise_distances partitions within group and between group distances to permit assessment of the effect of an exposure or intervention grouping factor upon the sampled microbiome within group distance and exposure intervention effect_size must be accurately mod eled to estimate statistical_power for a microbiome study that will be analyzed with pairwise_distances and permanova results we present a framework for permanova power estimation tailored to marker gene microbiome_studies that will be analyzed by pairwise_distances which includes i a novel method for distance_matrix simulation that permits modeling of within group pairwise_distances according to pre specified population parameters ii a method to incorporate effects of different sizes within the simulated distance_matrix iii a simulation based method for estimating permanova power from simulated distance_matrices and iv an r statistical software_package that implements the above matrices of pairwise_distances can be efficiently simulated to satisfy the triangle inequality and incorporate group level effects which are quantified by the adjusted coefficient of determination omega squared x from simulated distance_matrices available permanova power or necessary sample_size can be estimated for a planned microbiome study availability_and http github com brendankelly micropower contact microbiome_studies often compare groups of microbial_communities with different environmental_exposures or to which different interventions have been applied for example a study may evaluate the difference between the respiratory_tract microbial_communities of human subjects with exposure to different antibiotic treatments the fundamental measure in such a study is the count of community_members species or operational taxonomic unitsotus typically accomplished via sequencing a marker gene such as the s ribosomal_rna gene for bacteria pairwise distance metrics facilitate standardized comparison of community membership between individual study subjects by addressing the problems of differential the design of microbiome_studies demands consideration of statistical poweran adequate number of subjects must be recruited to ensure that the effect expected from the exposure or intervention of interest can be detected here we focus on the power of s tag sequencing studies that are analyzed using pairwise_distances specifically unifrac and jaccard distances and permanova unifrac is a distance_metric based upon the unique fraction of branch length in a phylogenetic_tree built from two sets of taxa comparison of microbiome samples can be performed via unweighted unifrac which considers strictly the presence_or of taxa or weighted unifrac which also considers relative_abundance jaccard distance a non phylogenetic measure of difference between two sample_sets is calculated as one minus the ratio of the intersection to the union it can also be calculated in unweighted binary or abundanceweighted fashion the power of permanova like the power of traditional analysis_of depends on the number of exposure or intervention groups degrees_of the number of subjects per group residual degrees_of the within group distances within group sum of squares and the size of the effect the difference between the between group sum of squares and within group sum of squares type_ii error increases and statistical_power decreases with more groups fewer subjects greater within group distance and lesser effects however the pseudo f ratio is not distributed like fishers f ratio under the null_hypothesis so standard methods of power estimation for parametric anova do not apply to the studies analyzed by permanova furthermore the relationship between microbiome community_structure and within group distances is often obscure and the effect_size to be expected from anticipated exposures or planned interventions upon the microbiome is often uncertain here we present a framework for permanova power and sample_size estimation tailored to marker gene microbiome_studies that will be analyzed with pairwise_distances we first describe a novel method for distance_matrix simulation that permits modeling within group pairwise_distances according to pre specified population parameters we then demonstrate how to incorporate effects of different sizes within the simulated distance_matrix building on the capacity to accurately model within and between group distances we present a simulation based method for estimating permanova power finally we outline an r statistical software_package the r foundation for statistical computing www r proj ect orgr core that implements the above and provide examples of its use the accurate estimation of statistical_power for planned microbiome_studies demands a detailed accounting of the steps involved in data analysis we focused on the s_rrna studies that are analyzed using pairwise_distances specifically unifrac and jaccard distances and permanova to ensure adequate_statistical for such studies one must quantify the expected withingroup variance and the effect to be expected from the planned exposure or intervention we built a framework for permanova power estimation that depends upon prior_knowledge of these two essential parameters the planned sampling_site and chosen pairwise distance_metric influence both within group variance and range of possible effect_sizes as quantified with x we analyzed datasets from the hmp and other published_studies to provide references from which the within group distance distribution and expected effect can be estimated these tools combined with the micropower r package described above permit power estimation for planned microbiome_studies since the unifrac distances depend on the phylogenetic_tree of the otus we reviewed the phylogenetic_trees generated from the hmp projects v v and v v s_rrna data and we observed that the distribution of phylogenetic_tree branchthe range of observed effect_sizes differs according to the metric of pairwise distance chosen for analysis hmp data are shown to demonstrate a large effect the degree of difference between two different human_microbiome sampling_sites and a negligible effect the degree of difference between skin sampling in the left_versus retroauricular crease lengths was approximately log normal to simulate a phylogenetic_tree for a set of simulated otu tables the simtreelist function in the micropower package we first extract all otu names from the simulated otu tables set each otu name as a tip of the tree and finally generate random branch_lengths to connect the tips with the branch_lengths specified according a log_normal the final step of random tree generation makes use of the ape packages rtree command paradis we explored other distributions of branch_lengths the distribution of the branch_lengths in the simulated phylogenetic_tree does impact the distribution of phylogenetic e g unifrac distances calculated from the simulated otu table for example simulating branch_lengths according to a normal distribution inflates the distance variance but we found that all distributions of phylogenetic_tree branch_lengths preserve the observed relationship between level of otu subsampling and mean distance as well as the observed relationship between number of otus subsampled and distance standard_deviation la rosa et_al recently_proposed another method for the detection of significant_between in microbiome data based on parametric testing of overdispersed taxonomic data against the dirichlet multinomial dm distribution and implemented their method as an r package hmp hmp allows the estimation of power or necessary sample_size for studies with microbiome outcome_measures based on the framework of hypothesis_testing at the level of the otu vectors themselves however the dm distribution must be specified via parameters representing the degree of overdispersion the number of taxa and the expected composition of taxonomic frequencies in both groups in order to detect a significant_difference under the dm model the effect_size is defined by how far apart the vector of taxa frequencies are from each other specifying the taxonomic frequencies is often difficult especially when many such taxa are considered in addition one has to specify the number of reads which can also be quite variable from sample to sample the micropower package in contrast uses the distribution of pairwise_distances to be expected from the chosen distance_metric and planned sampling_site and provides data on empirical distributions for comparison e g and by using permanova our method is non parametric by allowing for the use of different distance metrics our method allows incorporation of phylogenetic_relationships among the taxa in power calculation we have demonstrated that the choice of distance_metric may significantly influence the observed effect and that the withingroup variance depends upon both the chosen distance_metric and planned sampling_site by focusing on s rrna sequencing studies analyzed by pairwise_distances and permanova significance testing we have limited the application to power estimation for global measures of community_structure in some cases there are advantages to modeling otu vectors themselves rather than analyzing community_structure via beta diversityparticularly in cases where categorical community types and transitions between community types may match observed biological_phenomena nevertheless we believe that the presented method will prove useful given the utility of pairwise_distances to the analysis of microbiome data and the intuitive appeal of an anova type test in studies with categorical exposures interventions and microbiome outcome_measures one limitation of our method and that of lais that these methods can only perform power calculation for categorical covariates for a continuous covariate such as age or body_mass one can test its association with microbiome_composition using kernel_based regression where the kernel_matrix can be defined based on the pairwise_distances we can then perform power analysis using simulations or analytical calculation based on score test alternatively for the purpose of power calculation one can discretize the data into categories and apply our proposed method which should provide a conservative estimate of power funding b j k was supported by two national_institutes t training grants t ai and t hl r g
