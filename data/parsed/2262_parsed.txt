ibiss a versatile and interactive tool for integrated sequence and d structure analysis of large macromolecular_complexes motivation in the past_few an increasing number of crystal and cryo_electron cryo_em structures of large macromolecular_complexes such as the ribosome or the rna_polymerase have become available from various species these multi subunit complexes can be difficult to analyze at the level of amino_acid in combination with the d structural_organization of the complex therefore novel tools for simultaneous analysis of structure and sequence_information of complex assemblies are required to better understand the basis of molecular_mechanisms and their functional_implications results here we present a web_based integrative biology of sequences and structures ibiss which is designed for interactively displaying d structures and selected sequences of subunits from large macromolecular_complexes thus allowing simultaneous structure sequence_analysis such as conserved_residues involved in catalysis or protein_protein this tool comprises a graphic_user and uses a rapid access internal database containing the relevant pre aligned multiple_sequences across all species available and d structural_information these annotations are automatically retrieved and updated from uniprot and crystallographic and cryo_em data available in the protein_data pdb and electron_microscopy data bank emdb availability_and the database contains all currently available structures of ribo somes rna_polymerases nucleosomes proteasome photosystem i and ii complexes ibiss is available at http to obtain a better understanding of large macromolecular_complexes that contain multiple and variable subunits such as the ribosome the rna_polymerase or the proteasome appropriate tools are required to allow the integrated analysis of several subunit_proteins down to the level of individual_residues for example eukaryotic ribosomes contain proteins of which some are conserved across species some only share conserved domains while others are specific to either prokaryotic or eukaryotic_species in this context protein sequence_analysis greatly benefits from the available d structures and vice_versa from the perspective of integrated structural_biology it is essential to be able to visualize and handle protein_sequences and d structures in a correlated manner the present tool called integrative biology of sequences and structures ibiss provides a user_friendly interface to interactively link and analyze sequences and d structures several types of information are needed to facilitate the connection between the analysis of d structures and sequence_alignments from the level of the full complex down to individual protein subunits and residues one of the key_characteristics of ibiss is to allow the identification of a conserved amino_acid in a given sequence and have it simultaneously highlighted and localized in the d structure this allows the user to analyze its role in molecular_recognition in proteinprotein or proteinnucleic acid interfaces and interactions e g for translation and transcription_complexes in catalysis or in other functions to enlarge the potential applications of ibiss several important widely_studied macromolecular_complexes involved in transcription or translation or other key cellular_processes have been incorporated in the ibiss database these include the ribosome the nucleosome the rna_polymerase the proteasome and photosystem complexes i and ii for each complex a set of protein subunits is defined additional more specific functionalities allow the comparison of protein composition in different species and taxonomic tree grouping based on species the development tools used for the database are web based_technologies which have proven to be the most appropriate in terms of speed and ease of use indeed the database nosql allows handling very heterogeneous data as is often the case in biology web based_technologies allow the tool to be used on any operating system os without special installation requirements or compatibility problems facilitating software access and distribution the choice of the mongodb database that contains all the data provides high_speed interactivity external databases such as uniprot and pdb are used only in the context of updating but are not called directly through the interactive user_interfaces because precalculated sequence_alignments and pdb coordinates are stored in mongodb a quick and interactive access to the web_site is achieved which greatly_enhances the data access speed through the web_site the update is done automatically on a monthly basis to take into account modifications of sequence annotations and corrections not only novel sequences are added but the entire sequences are updated with the associated structures the aligned sequences are obtained from a global_alignment to minimize alignment errors by using a large number of sequences when required it is possible to extract and display just two sequences out of many while still benefiting from the better global_alignment as compared to a simple pair_wise alignment it is also possible to select a portion of the alignment for a quick taxonomic_analysis using the checkbox the results in the sequence tab or directly on the co evolution page in the following we describe practical aspects of the ibiss tool that are available to the user on the main web_page the user selects the complex of interest e g ribosome nucleosome etc next a specific protein can be chosen ibiss then produces a page that contains all sequences related to this protein and sequence_alignment and d structure tools available for each sequence the residue color code of the alignment is reported on the d structure and facilitates residue identification a jmol window allows visualizing the d structure and a jalview window shows the sequence_alignment the two windows are connected interactively jmol is integrated in jalview and serves for the d visualization if the mouse is positioned over an amino_acid of the d structure the same amino_acid in the corresponding sequence in the sequence_alignment is automatically recentered and changes color in the jalview window inversely if the mouse is over an amino_acid in the d sequence_alignment window the corresponding amino_acid becomes highlighted in the structure on the left panel a table is included with the description of each sequence and an annotation of the protein describing name species uniprot identifier tools for d visualization and correlation between sequences and structures that are displayed for each structure full information for each protein is also visible in a checkbox and by referring to a references tab that allows a complete description of the protein with active links to other databases in a manner as implemented in uniprot displaying the results for the selected sequence is achieved without leaving the web_page to avoid toggling between pages a panel on the right of the interface provides access to sequence_alignments d structures taxonomy and bibliographic references multiple_sequence can be retrieved from the ibiss webpage a portion of the alignment can be isolated to compare two or more sequences the d tab allows handling all the information relevant to the available d structures a jmol window is embedded in the web_page with an interface to access the main features the d tab provides a quick and interactive view for any of the available structures for this protein_structure of the protein alone and structure of the protein complex displaying the pdbibiss a versatile and interactive tooltext file provides a view of the comments about the structures such as the compnd record that describes the macromolecular contents of an entry the functionalities of jmol are available by right clicking in the same way as on the jmol application of the pdb website and some options are facilitated through the javascript interface e g display options of macromolecules all d functionalities including those for structure sequence correlation will automatically load the java applets the taxonomy tab allows displaying an interactive taxonomic tree summary for each species for which at least one sequence is present to analyze correlated amino_acid changes a coevolution analysis tool has been integrated in ibiss which includes the entire protein database it allows choosing a taxon for the protein of interest in a taxonomic tree and visualizes the corresponding sequence_alignments coevolutionary sequence_variability between taxa can also be observed e g if a taxon reveals a mutation in a binding_site the interacting_protein partner of the same taxon may carry a complementary or compensatory mutation to illustrate the main features of the ibiss tool we present a typical example of a ribosomal_protein s which is part of the bacterial ribosome proteins rrnas s is located on the platform region of the s ribosomal subunit close to the interface with the s subunit and the exit_site trna it is involved in the binding of mrna to the small_ribosomal using ibiss the number of sequences available for the s p protein can be visualized at a glance the sequence_alignment reveals high sequence_conservation across species with one variable_domain between prokaryotes and eukaryotes this example illustrates the powerful potential of a convenient interactive analysis linking d structure and sequence_alignment by analyzing the amino_acid conservation in the sequence_alignment a series of amino_acids can be identified that are positively_charged and highly_conserved in all species of ribosomal_protein s these residues are mainly located in the c terminal region of protein s because they do not interact with other proteins or with other ribosomal components but instead are solvent exposed it can be concluded that they are important for the binding of mrna considering that many of the conserved_residues carry positively_charged side_chains which could interact with the negatively_charged phosphate moieties of the mrna thus it is very easy to localize surface exposed residues that a concrete example of linking sequence_alignments and structure information of a ribosomal_protein as part of the multi proteinsubunit s ribosome a global view of the structure with protein s small_ribosomal s interactively linked with the sequence_alignment the mrna and trnas are indicated in red and blue respectively b in the example given ribosomal_protein s is localized on the structure window with the backbone chain residues labeled according to the residue color code in the sequence window the solvent exposed and conserved residue arg is highlighted in red as a good candidate for interactions with mrna bound in the s platform region mrna and trnas are colored in red blue and cyan respectively for simplicity ribosomal rrnas and the s ribosomal subunit are not shown example of coevolution study between ribosomal s and s proteins using ibiss a global view of the ribosome structure with the s protein interactively linked with the corresponding sequence_alignment b global view of the ribosome structure with the s protein interactively linked with the corresponding sequence_alignment c the selection of sequences of the multi sequence_alignment based on taxa reveals a coevolution at the interface between proteins s and s in protein s a phenylalanine b residue conserved in bacteria label f is replaced by a tyrosine label y conserved in fungi within a a distance in protein s an alanine a residue is replaced by a serine_residue suggesting an additional hydrogen_bond between protein s and s in fungi with the ibiss tool this analysis is quick and easy thanks to its integrated database could be involved in mrna recognition in a previous study all of this comprised a tedious manual_analysis including the retrieval of structures sequences and residue identification an additional taxonomy analysis is also possible which in this example leads to a large number of proteins because of the broad representation of protein s in prokaryotes eukaryotes or archaea the taxonomy can be used to study coevolutionary aspects from the co evolution page from the taxonomic tree one can select the protein of interest for many taxa of interest and display the corresponding alignments because several amino_acids of interest have been already identified each taxon can be displayed to more easily_identify at what point of evolution a given mutation occurred it is also possible to use multiple jalview and jmol windows simultaneously e g with multiple screens the d structure shows that protein_protein occur between protein s and proteins s and s for which the identification of amino_acids is straightforward in ibiss moreover co evolution analysis in ibiss conveniently identifies a conserved residue pair at the interface between proteins s and s inversely strictly_conserved amino_acids in proteins s and s which are involved in proteinprotein_interactions with s can be identified easily within the ribosome complex taken together ibiss provides a convenient interactive and robust tool that facilitates combined structure and sequence_analysis of complicated multi subunit macromolecular_complexes as compared to the combined usage of independent tools such as strap friend chimera and pymol ibiss represents a significant added value in that it provides an immediate interactive and structured way to access the data through an integrated database which interactively links structures pre_computed multi sequence_alignments co evolutionary and phylogeny tools the data are standardized and grouped into protein_families thus simplifying work when the same protein has several different names in the databanks all features are integrated and can be used directly without the need of plugins this is very useful for the identification of conserved amino_acids and their d localization eventually leading to design of new experiments for testing the functional_implications of a particular residue using a web_based database ibiss gives immediate access to the relevant protein sequence_alignments and available d structures for all the subunits of a given macromolecular complex an additional typical feature of ibiss is that phylogenetic_analysis and coevolutionary tools are linked to multi sequence_alignments taken together the present tool provides an easy and unified access to structure and sequence_information of large complexes and allows data_mining in an interactive and correlated manner thus facilitating the identification of conserved amino_acids in a sequence and their localization in the d structure in the example provided above residues exposed on the surface of the small_ribosomal platform can be identified much more easily than in the previously_published manual_analysis in general ibiss contributes to the development of integrative tools which are increasingly needed for integrated biology approaches the preprocessed data which are accessible online allow performing bioinformatics_analysis without requiring much data manipulation nor advanced knowledge in bioinformatics data_processing the database within ibiss currently contains a series of typical large complexes the ribosome including the latest human ribosome structure translation initiation_factors the rna_polymerases nucleosome proteasome and photosystem i and ii complexes currently the database comprises sequence entries and structure entries which are pre processed to enhance interactivity in the future it could become interesting to extend ibiss to include user_defined complexes to create their own data base within ibiss
