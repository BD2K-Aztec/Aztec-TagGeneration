systems_biology decomposing flux_distributions into elementary_flux in genome_scale motivation elementary_flux efm is a fundamental concept as well as a useful tool in metabolic_pathway one important role of efms is that every flux distribution can be decomposed into a set of efms and a number of methods to study flux_distributions originated from it yet finding such decompositions requires the complete set of efms which is intractable in genome_scale due to combinatorial explosion results in this article we proposed an algorithm to decompose flux_distributions into efms in genome_scale networks it is an iterative scheme of a mixed integer_linear unlike previous optimization models to find pathways any feasible solutions can become efms in our algorithm this advantage enables the algorithm to approximate the efm of largest contribution to an objective reaction in a flux distribution our algorithm is able to find efms of flux_distributions with complex structures closer to the realistic case in which a cell is subject to various constraints a case of escherichia_coli growth in the lysogeny broth lb medium containing various carbon_sources was studied essential metabolites and their syntheses were located information on the contribution of each carbon_source not obvious from the apparent flux distribution was also revealed our work further confirms the utility of finding efms by optimization models in genome_scale immediately after the success in genomics the next step is to fill the gap between genotypes and phenotypes to have a full picture of biological_systems the genome_scale has been playing this role and has been found useful in answering biological_questions during the past_decade various methods have been proposed to analyze metabolic_networks and the constraint_based approach is exceptionally prominent one object of particular importance and increasing interest in the approach is the elementary_flux efm efm is an important theoretical concept as well as a practical tool in metabolic_pathway theoretically it is the minimal operational unit to whom correspondence should be addressed at steady_state in metabolic_networks satisfying the thermodynamic constraint regarding the reversibility of each reaction practically efms have been applied in a variety of studies investigating network_structures like network robustness dynamic_properties of pathways pathway efficiency and modularity exploring new pathways and hence suggesting rational strain design predicting mutants behavior identifying interactions with other networks etc reviewed in an important interpretation of efms is that every flux distributioncan be decomposed as a positive sum of a subset of efms e j with the no cancelation property that all e j have a particular component being zero wherever v has that component being zero that is for all j where z v iv i is the index set for the zero components of v the no cancelation property is unique compared to other generating sets of the flux space like extreme pathways eps in many studies flux_distributions are analyzed by similar decompositions the first attempt is the spectrum to determine the range of attainable weights for each ep this approach is also applicable to efms later decomposing flux_distributions with minimum sum of weights has been proposed and applied to study yeast glycolysis decompositions with respect to other objectives have also been adopted to investigate particular cases for instances maximum number of active efms minimum relative_error maximum yield rate and maximum_entropy there are also other studies_analyzing flux_distributions by decompositions into efms e g these approaches based on decomposing flux_distributions despite the insights they have provided have their capabilities limited because the calculation always requires the complete set of efms in prior given a metabolic_network whose computation is notoriously hard due to the combinatorial explosion when the network size grows this drawback was first studied in klamt and stelling and has been mentioned in many literatures e g page we applied our algorithm to three metabolic_networks of different sizes the first is the sample network used to demonstrate regulatory fba and study spectrum the second is the core metabolic_network of e coli k mg iaf it is more realistic with a size considerably larger than the first one the two networks were used as benchmarks to validate our algorithm to highlight the usefulness of our algorithm complementary to existing_methods a computational experiment was then conducted in this article we presented an algorithm which solves milps iteratively to decompose a flux distribution into efms in genomescale metabolic_networks one advantage of the algorithm is the elementarity of solutions independent of the optimality of milps the objective_function can then be used for other purposes and we suggested approximating the largest contributing efms in flux_distributions we demonstrated the ability of the algorithm to decompose flux_distributions into efms and approximate efms with largest
