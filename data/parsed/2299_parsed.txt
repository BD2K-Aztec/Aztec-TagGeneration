sequence_analysis identification of novel phosphorylation modification_sites in human proteins that originated after the human chimpanzee divergence motivation phosphorylation modifications of specific protein residues are involved in a wide_range such as modulation of intracellular signal networks here we present the development and application of a bioinformatics procedure for systematic identification of human specific phosphorylation_sites in proteins that may have occurred after the humanchimpanzee divergence results we collected annotated human phosphorylation_sites and compared each site to orthologous mammalian_proteins across taxa including chimpanzee orangutan rhesus_macaque marmoset mouse dog cow elephant opossum and platypus we identified human specific gains of annotated phosphorylation_sites in proteins serines threonines and tyrosines the novel phosphorylation_sites are situated in highly_conserved segments of the protein proteins with novel phosphorylation_sites are involved in crucial biological_processes such as cell_division aurkb casc mki and pdcd and chromatin_remodeling hira hirip hist h t nap l and lrwd modified phosphorylatable residues produce novel target_sites for protein_kinases such as cyclin_dependent and casein kinases possibly resulting in rewiring and fine_tuning of phosphorylation regulatory_networks the potential human specific phosphorylation_sites identified in this study are useful as candidates for functional analysis to identify novel phenotypes in humans humans have many distinct phenotypic_traits compared with the other great_apes such as loss of body hair upright_posture accelerated brain expansion and more complex cognitive_abilities these traits must have originated as genetic_modifications and undergone subsequent natural_selection in the human lineage after humans diverged from their closest_living the chimpanzees the accelerated sequence substitution to whom correspondence should be addressed of proteins may be associated with the evolution of certain humanspecific traits for example genes implicated in nervous_system development were found to display significantly_higher rates of protein evolution in the human lineage the foxp protein which is known to be associated with speech and language in humans acquired two amino_acid specific to humans after the humanchimpanzee divergence the human foxp protein has been reported to differentially regulate genes involved in central_nervous development compared with the chimpanzee ortholog interestingly loss of proteins has also been implicated in the development of human specific_traits for example inactivation of the myh gene in humans may be related to the reduction of the masticatory_muscle and expansion of the brain other proteins that became inactive only in humans include base serpina and moxd phosphorylation is a fundamental post_translational ptm of proteins that acts in many important biological_processes such as cellular_signaling through the modulation of protein_function stability interaction and localization several tens_of of phosphorylation modification_sites have been characterized in human proteins using high_throughput proteomic analyses data regarding phosphorylation modification_sites in human proteins are available via databases such as uniprotkb_swiss phosida and dbptm it is likely that biologically_important phosphorylation_sites are evolutionarily_conserved identified phosphorylation_sites in human proteins that appear to be positionally conserved between human and at least one species of fly worm or yeast and proposed that these sites are involved in fundamental_cellular nevertheless the gain and loss of protein phosphorylation_sites may rewire biological_networks and be regarded as a motive force for adaptive_evolution the gain or loss of phosphorylation_sites in cdk substrates in yeasts may have facilitated the evolution of kinase signaling circuits reported that tyrosine_residues have been selectively lost through metazoan evolution to remove deleterious tyrosine phosphorylations as tyrosine_kinases have been expanded it is argued that evolutionpage we identified cases of novel phosphorylation_site gains in human proteins that likely arose after the humanchimpanzee divergence human proteins with novel phosphorylation modification_sites are involved in various biological_processes for example aurkb casc mki pdcd in the cell_cycle hira hirip hist h t nap l and lrwd are involved in chromatin_remodeling snrpa and tarbp are involved in rna biology and usp and usp are involved in protein deubiquitination the number of novel phosphorylation_sites in human proteins and the number of lost sites in chimpanzee proteins are very similar versus indicating that gain_and occurred at comparable rates in both taxa the distributions of changed residues are also similar the amino_acid of the novel human phosphorylation_sites include serines threonines and tyrosines in chimpanzee proteins serines threonines and tyrosine have been mutated to non phosphorylatable residues the conversion to or from serine is more frequent than other conversions this difference may be explained in terms of the numbers of codons in the genetic_code there are six codons for serine four for threonine and two for tyrosine if a mutation is completely random it is likely that the serine codon will appear more often than will threonine or tyrosine the distribution of the lost phosphorylatable residues may simply be due to the frequencies of the phosphorylated residues in the proteome the human protein dataset analyzed in this study contains phosphoserines phosphothreonines and phosphotyrosines because phosphoserine is more common than phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine it is expected that phosphoserine is lost more often at similar mutation_rates however we cannot rule out the possibility that there could be evolutionary_constraints regarding the gain or loss of phosphorylation_sites it is possible that the relatively small number of gain or loss of phosphotyrosine sites reflects the fact that phosphotyrosine sites are involved in more biologically_important processes than are phosphothreonine or phosphoserine sites it has been proposed that as tyrosine_kinases have been expanded during metazoan evolution tyrosine_residues have been selectively removed to minimize possibly deleterious tyrosine phosphorylations the casein_kinase ck family of protein_kinases functions as signal_transduction regulators in eukaryotic_cells and recognizes the motif s x x s t the three novel phosphorylation_sites of abcf mki serine and tarbp match the ck motif ck has been implicated in several cellular_processes including cell_cycle control and dna_repair and it recognizes the motif s t x x e where e is aspartic_acid there are six human specific phosphorylation_sites abcf adnp pdxdc serine and serine rusc and usp that match the ck motif we assume that the advent of new target_sites for the various kinases in these proteins may result in evolution of protein regulatory_networks there are four ck sites
