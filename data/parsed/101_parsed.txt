acquire an open_source comprehensive cancer biobanking system motivation the probability of effective treatment of cancer with a targeted therapeutic can be improved for patients with defined genotypes containing actionable mutations to this end many human cancer biobanks are integrating more tightly with genomic_sequencing facilities and with those creating and maintaining patient derived xenografts pdx and cell_lines to provide renewable resources for translational_research results to support the complex data management needs and workflows of several such biobanks we developed acquire it is a robust secure web_based database backed open_source system that supports all major needs of a modern cancer biobank its modules allow for i up to the minute scoreboard and graphical reporting of collections ii end_user roles and permissions iii specimen inventory through catissue suite iv shipping forms for distribution of specimens to pathology genomic analysis and pdx cell_line creation facilities v robust ad_hoc querying vi molecular and cellular quality_control metrics to track specimens progress and quality vii public researcher request viii resource_allocation committee distribution request review and oversight and ix linkage to available derivatives of specimen availability_and acquire implements standard controlled_vocabularies ontolo gies and objects from the nci cdisc and others here we describe the functionality of the system its technological stack and the processes it supports access to high_quality human cancer and matched_normal for omics experimentation is critical for developing a better understanding of these diseases to design improved diagnostics and therapeutics human tissue biorepositories or biobanks can provide tissues and associated participant pathology and specimen data to the researchers who collected them and or the scientific public biobanking standards provide guidance and best practices on how to collect store and manage tissues to better assure high_quality dna rna protein or other derivatives such as cell_lines and patient derived xenografts pdx for research e g international_society for biological and environmental biorepositories best practices http bit ly znxueu as such many commercial and some open_source solutions exist to manage daily v c the author published_by though banking protocols and processes differ slightly among institutions all must have processes for identifying potential subjects and obtaining consent collecting specimens and capturing data acquire supports the full biobanking lifecycle for specimen and data_collection including within acceptable parameters are tallied as potentially meeting tcga like criteria
