sequence_analysis rnag a new gibbs_sampler for predicting rna_secondary for unaligned sequences motivation rna_secondary plays an important role in the function of many rnas and structural_features are often key to their interaction with other cellular_components thus there has been considerable interest in the prediction of secondary_structures for rna_families in this article we present a new global structural_alignment algorithm rnag to predict consensus secondary_structures for unaligned sequences it uses a blocked gibbs_sampling algorithm which has a theoretical advantage in convergence time this algorithm iteratively samples from the conditional probability_distributions p structure alignment and p alignment structure not surprisingly there is considerable uncertainly in the high dimensional_space of this difficult problem which has so_far received_limited in this field we show how the samples drawn from this algorithm can be used to more fully characterize the posterior space and to assess the uncertainty of predictions results our analysis of three publically available datasets showed a substantial improvement in rna_structure by rnag over extant prediction_methods additionally our analysis of rna_families showed that the rnag sampled structures were generally compact around their ensemble centroids and at least families had at least two well separated clusters of predicted structures in general the distance between a reference structure and our predicted structure was large relative to the variation among structures within an ensemble availability the perl implementation of the rnag algorithm and the data necessary to reproduce the results described in sections and are available atrna secondary_structure plays_a in the function of many types of rna including structural rnas non_coding ncrna and regulatory_motifs in mrnas e g riboswitches accordingly structural_features of rna_molecules are often characterized by evolutionarily_conserved secondary_structures that are critical to their functions furthermore there are often to whom correspondence should be addressed multiple occurrences of these structural_elements within one species e g trna given the recent recognition of many important additional_roles that rnas play in cellular_functions predicting the common structural_features of a set of rna_sequences is more important than ever following we picked centroid estimators where k k k z from which to interpolate the curve on the ppvsen plane our results comparing rnag predictions to those from several additional recently published_methods show that the existing procedures yield a combination of sensitivity and ppv that is considerably below the rnag frontier some features of rnag suggest an explanation for this behavior rnag not only inherits the advantages of the sampling method but also enjoys a theoretical convergence advantage over the metropolishastings algorithm which employs local moves since rnag samples full valid secondary_structures it enjoys an advantage over iterative algorithms that sample only stems also since the two recursive steps sample from the full space of alignments and structures directly we avoid the need to use a reduced model a concession that is common to several extant procedures however since rnag is an mcmc procedure there are no means to assure that it has converged to its target distribution in this study we introduce a blocked gibbs_sampler rnag to predict secondary_structure for unaligned rna_sequences rnag confronts the high time complexity of the align fold problem by capitalizing on lius findings on blocked gibbs_sampling show that the new algorithm delivers substantial improvement as measured by ppvsen curves however as with any mcmc procedure evidence of convergence during the burn in cannot be guaranteed also in the current_implementation of this algorithm little has been done ensure fast code or an efficient stopping rule we found that the running_times of rnag are in the range of
