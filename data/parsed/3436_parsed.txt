partitioning and correlating subgroup characteristics from aligned pattern clusters motivation evolutionarily_conserved amino_acids within proteins characterize functional or structural regions conversely less conserved amino_acids within these regions are generally areas of evolutionary_divergence a priori_knowledge of biological_function and species can help interpret the amino_acid differences between sequences however this information is often erroneous or unavailable hampering discovery with supervised algorithms also most of the current unsupervised methods depend on full sequence_similarity which become inaccurate when proteins diverge e g inversions deletions insertions due to these and other shortcomings we developed a novel un supervised algorithm which discovers highly conserved_regions and uses two types of information measures i data measures computed from input_sequences and ii class measures computed using a priori class groupings in order to reveal subgroups i e classes or functional characteristics results using known and putative sequences of two proteins belonging to a relatively uncharac terized protein_family we were able to group evolutionarily_related sequences and identify conserved_regions which are strong homologous association patterns called aligned pattern clusters within individual proteins and across the members of this family an initial synthetic demonstration and in silico results reveal that i the data measures are unbiased and ii our class measures can accurately rank the quality of the evolutionarily relevant groupings furthermore combining our data and class measures allowed us to interpret the results by inferring regions of biological_importance within the binding_domain of these proteins compared to popular supervised methods our algorithm has a superior runtime and comparable accuracy as sequencing_technologies continue to improve the amount of biological_information has become more difficult to effectively analyze biologists often need to identify conserved_regions in dna or protein_sequences as these are often essential for biological_function conversely areas of low_sequence are often useful in studying evolutionary_divergence or novel function herein we develop an unsupervised aligned pattern clustering tool to facilitate the identification of areas of conservation and divergence in protein_sequences using two members of the class a scavenger_receptors whose evolutionary origin and relatedness has been previously described based on phylogenic approaches we demonstrate that our method is as effective as multiple_sequence for motif_discovery in addition our algorithm is more effective in grouping the two proteins across a wide_range of organisms including the identification of conserved and mutated amino_acids within each protein and across the family of proteins thus identifying regions of potential functional significance amongst homologs and orthologs protein_families can consist of many thousands of members and the distinction between these members becomes less clear with greater evolutionary distance in supervised_learning also known as classification the groups are predetermined as a priori_knowledge given as class_labels and the model is optimally learned to predict those labels in unsupervised_clustering the samples i e sequences are grouped or partitioned based on their similarity or common features i e amino_acid motifs with strong statistical_association usually along the entire_sequence to show the uniqueness of our approach we propose the following problem definition given a set of input_sequences in pre_existing groups i e with class_labels our algorithm discovers subsequences i e motifs regions with strong statistical_association which distinguishes subgroups within the data and in turn reveal other biologically relevant_information we can rank the quality of these discovered patterns and group their inherent characteristics using our data measures by then using our class measures we can identify whether these discovered patterns and their amino_acid partitioned subgroups match the pre_existing groups as reflected by the class_labels an example using the well known cytochrome_c protein is used to illustrate how local patterns can be related to species here the sequence_patterns caech cawch and clqch appear in the input_sequences describing three class groups namely plant mammal and fungi if these patterns were conserved amino_acid with presumed functional significance the aligned patterns could reveal similarities and or differences for associating with the species i e classes once conserved_regions and their associated patterns are localized information measures are able to partition group or class characteristics from the aligned patterns such information can then be used to describe the classes as well as to justify and assist classification in this study we observed out of the top apcs with positive ig scores that were able to partition the ca srs three of these apcs have amino_acid with an ig value of indicating that they partitioned the protein classes precisely these apcs contain amino_acid that are natural data partitions that match the class partitions some of these partitions have been observed previously and are thought to explain some of the functional differences between these proteins for example both marco and srai contain a ligand_binding scavenger_receptor cysteine_rich srcr domain marcos srcr domain contains a motif rgraevyysgt which is not shared by srai and is thought to explain some of the differences in the ligand_binding capabilities of these two receptors wemine apc correctly identifies this motif as in the th ranking apc nrgraevyy consistent with previous results this motif is only found within the marco class and not within any srai sequence additionally the ninth ranking apc wgtcddrw was also recently identified byvia fastml and is hypothesized to be important structurally given its inclusion of a conserved cysteine_residue this demonstrates that sr can reveal subclass dependency even when class_labels are unreliable or ig is in summary both of these patterns have been previously_identified with methods other than wemine apc to represent motifs of known functional_importance
