structural_bioinformatics epock rapid analysis of protein pocket dynamics the volume of an internal protein pocket is fundamental to ligand accessibility few programs that compute such volumes manage dynamic data from molecular_dynamics md_simulations limited performance often prohibits analysis of large_datasets we present epock an efficient command_line that calculates pocket volumes from md trajectories a plugin for the vmd program provides a graphical_user to facilitate input creation run epock and analyse the results availability_and epock c source_code python analysis scripts vmd tcl plugin documentation and installation_instructions are freely_available epock in drug_design the characterization of binding_pockets is a key issue often addressed using molecular_dynamics md md_simulations unveil the evolution of large and complex biomolecular systems over time with increasing computer power md generates increasingly large_datasets with more frames and particles the majority of existing programs are not optimized for such large trajectories so analysis of pocket evolution requires improved software_tools that are able to process pocket data in a reasonable time to tackle this issue we developed epock a software for efficient tracking of protein pocket volume throughout md trajectories we demonstrate epocks functionality on the ligand gated gloeobacter violaceus ion_channel glic homologue of the human nicotinic_receptor and heat_shock hsp
