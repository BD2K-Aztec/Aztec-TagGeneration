sequence_analysis contest estimating cross_contamination of human samples in next_generation data here we present contest a tool for estimating the level of cross individual contamination in next_generation data we demonstrate the accuracy of contest across a range of contamination_levels sources and read_depths using sequencing_data mixed in silico at known concentrations we applied our tool to published cancer sequencing_datasets and report their estimated contamination_levels availability_and contest is a gatk module and distributed under a bsd style license atnext generation sequencing methods are generating vast_amounts of short_sequence for the purpose of studying dna sequence_variations and identifying those that affect human disease many novel methods allow for the interrogation of the structure of the genome with unprecedented sensitivity due to the digital nature of the data rare_events present in only a fraction of the sequenced material as is the case in somatic_mutation discovery in cancer genome studies can be accurately_detected by sequencing to greater read_depth moreover genome partitioning techniques allow for even greater sensitivity at a lower cost by targeting only regions of interest however these methods can be heavily compromised by contamination three major classes of dna contamination exist cross individual within individual and cross_species crossindividual is the most critical to control as even small levels of contamination can cause many false_positives particularly in contrastive tumor versus normal cancer studies withinindividual contamination such as normal dna contamination of tumor dna in cancer studies typically leads to decreased sensitivity cross_species contamination is easily detected by aligning to unique to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as regions of potentially contaminating species in order to address the most critical need we developed contest within the gatk to accurately estimate the cross individual contamination level in next_generation data using next_generation data from the tcga ovarian publication tcga research we identified exome_capture bams with low contamination having very few reads that do not match the homozygous calls from their genotyping_arrays supplementary next we created in silico datasets by mixing a primary sample with one or more contaminants at specific contamination_levels supplementary_material reassuringly the estimate of the contamination level of the primary sample alone was contest was able to accurately_predict the level of contamination across a wide_range of conditions including more than a single contaminating sample and c in order to assess the accuracy as a function of sequencing_depth we downsampled the depth of the sequencing_data and demonstrated that contest produces accurate estimates even with average coverage applying the method to data obtained from the tcga ovarian publication supplementary indicates that low levels of physical contamination are common independent_validation of all somatic events likely ensured that this contamination did not cause false_positives in the publication however given a distribution of contamination as seen in tcga and an estimated error_rate at non dbsnp sites from contamination as shown in a typical cancer project might expect of the samples to have contamination causing errors mb per sample which is a significant fraction of the typical somatic mutation_rate of mb per sample in addition contest has proven to be essential in lab quality_control to identify and monitor sources of contamination which has helped decrease contamination at the broad institute
