data_and mrmprobs suite for metabolomics using large_scale mrm assays we developed new software environment for the metabo lome analysis of large_scale multiple_reaction mrm assays it supports the data format of four major mass_spectrometer vendors and mzml common data format this program provides a process pipeline from the raw format import to high_dimensional statistical_analyses the novel aspect is graphical_user based visualization to perform peak quantification to interpolate missing_values and to normalize peaks interactively based on quality_control samples together with the software platform the mrm standard library of metabolites with transitions is also available which contributes to the reliable peak identification by using retention time and ion abundances availability_and mrmprobs is available for windows os under the creative commons by attribution license atmany metabolomics_studies rely on the large_scale multiple_reaction mrm assay wide targeted analysis is an example mrm transitions precursorproduct ion_pairs are monitored per single run using high end machines for mrm assays we previously_reported an objective strategy for metabolite_identification from large_scale chromatographic_data this report highlights its recent features especially new algorithms for peak_detection normalization and their new graphical_user guis peak quantification is the most important and sensitive process during mrm assays there is no inherent universal algorithm that can perfectly recognize peak edges because they depend on chromatographic_conditions each research group has its own criteria for recognition for the accurate detection of peak left and peak right edges in practice multiple chromatograms must be checked and compared using a visualization_tool this process is also necessary to avoid misidentifications for this purpose we developed an interactive chromatogram viewer that can overlay multiple chromatograms in each window to visualize our peak_detection algorithm moreover it can interpolate missing_values supplementary_information and it can adjust signal changes or metabolite dependent drifts using locally weighted least square regression locally estimated smoothing function loess and cubic spline with quality_control qc samples together with these features standard mrm measurements were made available on the prime platform for riken metabolomics web_site prime psc riken jp for metabolites transitions their precursorproduct ion_pairs retention time and ion abundances are provided the retention time and ion abundances are particularly useful for the accurate identification of metabolites because these features are comparable across certain instrument types as long as the experimental_conditions are similar the algorithmic highlights are introduced below
