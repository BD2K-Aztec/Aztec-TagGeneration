a parallel and sensitive software_tool for methylation analysis on multicore platforms motivation dna_methylation analysis suffers from very long processing time as the advent of next generation sequencers has shifted the bottleneck of genomic studies from the sequencers that obtain the dna samples to the software that performs the analysis of these samples the existing software for methylation analysis does not seem to scale efficiently neither with the size of the dataset nor with the length of the reads to be analyzed as it is expected that the sequencers will provide longer and longer_reads in the near future efficient and scalable methylation software should be developed results we present a new software_tool called hpg methyl which efficiently maps bisulphite sequencing_reads on dna analyzing dna_methylation the strategy used by this software consists of leveraging the speed of the burrowswheeler_transform to map a large number of dna_fragments reads rapidly as well as the accuracy of the smithwaterman_algorithm which is exclusively employed to deal with the most ambiguous and shortest reads experimental_results on platforms with intel multicore processors show that hpg methyl significantly_outperforms in both execution time and sensitivity state of the art software such as bismark bs seeker or bsmap particularly for long bisulphite reads availability_and software in the form of c libraries and functions together with instructions to compile and execute this software available by sftp to anonymous clariano uv es password anonymous dna_methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic_regulation in development and disease it is a heritable modifiable chemical process that affects gene_transcription and it is associated with other molecular_markers e g gene_expression and phenotypes e g cancer or other diseases although many methods for dna_methylation have been developed only bisulphite sequencing gives rise to comprehensive dna_methylation maps at single_base bisulphite treatment converts unmethylated_cytosines cs into thymines which gives rise to c to t polymorphisms after subsequent polymerase_chain pcr_amplification while leaving methylated_cytosines unchanged by aligning and comparing bisulphite sequencing_reads to the genomic dna_sequence it is possible to infer dna_methylation at base_pair resolution moreover the introduction of new dna_sequencing known as next_generation ngs now makes it possible to sequence the genomic_dna in a few days as well as at a very low_cost current ngs sequencers can sequence short dna or rna_fragments of lengths usually between and nt though new sequencers with longer fragment sizes are being developed primary data produced by ngs sequencers consist of hundreds of
