databases_and mir editar a database of predicted a to i edited mirna_target motivation a to i rna_editing is an important mechanism that consists of the conversion of specific adenosines into inosines in rna_molecules its dysregulation has been associated to several human_diseases recent work has demonstrated a role for a to i editing in microrna mirna mediated gene_expression regulation in fact edited forms of mature_mirnas can target sets of genes that differ from the targets of their unedited forms the specific de amination of mrnas can generate novel binding_sites in addition to potentially altering existing ones results this work presents mir editar a database of predicted a to i edited mirna_binding the database contains predicted mirna_binding that could be affected by a to i editing and sites that could become mirna_binding as a result of a to i editing availability mir editar is freely_available online at http microrna a to i editing is an essential post_transcriptional mechanism common to all eukaryotes this form of editing is catalyzed by enzymes of the adenosine_deaminase acting on rna family and results in the conversion of single adenosines into inosines which are recognized as guanosines by various cellular machineries this can affect splicing and alter coding and non coding_sequences in rna_molecules thus contributing to the diversity of the transcriptome alterations of a to i editing have been associated to several human_diseases such as infections neurological_diseases and cancer a to i editing can also influence micro_rna mirna mediated gene_regulation several cases of a to i editing of mirna_precursors have been reported this phenomenon can suppress processing by drosha and dicer and the presence of inosines in the mature sequences can alter the recognition of their target_sites a to i editing is most abundant in the untranslated_region utr regions of the human_transcriptome this could affect the existing mirna_binding as well as generate novel binding_sites the importance of rna_editing in mirna_activity suggests the need for computational_tools to predict and analyze the effects of rna_editing on mirna mediated regulation this work presents mir editar a database of predicted a to i edited mirna_binding in this article we describe the database and suggest some plausible scenarios of the involvement of editing in mirna_activity
