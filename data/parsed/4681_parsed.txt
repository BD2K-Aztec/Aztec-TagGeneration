tissue_specific subnetworks and characteristics of publicly_available human protein interaction_databases motivation protein_protein ppi databases are widely used tools to study cellular_pathways and networks however there are several databases available that still do not account for cell_type differences here we evaluated the characteristics of six interaction_databases incorporated tissue_specific gene_expression information and finally investigated if the most popular proteins of scientific_literature are involved in good quality interactions results we found that the evaluated databases are comparable in terms of node connectivity i e proteins with few interaction_partners also have few interaction_partners in other databases but may differ in the identity of interaction_partners we also observed that the incorporation of tissue_specific expression information significantly altered the interaction landscape and finally we demonstrated that many of the most intensively_studied proteins are engaged in interactions associated with low confidence_scores in summary interaction_databases are valuable research_tools but may lead to different predictions on interactions or pathways the accuracy of predictions can be improved by incorporating datasets on organ and cell_type gene_expression and by obtaining additional interaction evidence for the most popular proteins traditionally studies that assess the cellular_metabolism disease and cancer development pathogens infections or drugprotein interaction have focused on single genes or proteins while such studies have created large_amounts of data they typically do not account for the multiple interactions that regulate cellular_networks to whom correspondence should be addressed recently high_throughput including yeast_two screens immunoprecipitation_studies followed by mass_spectrometry analysis transcriptomics and metabolomics_studies have become important research_tools to identify protein_protein ppi partners or cellular_factors that are up or downregulated in response to specific stimuli with the availability of the resulting large_datasets the challenge now lies in the generation of comprehensive and robust interactome maps ideally capturing all ppis within a cell and between cells at any given moment in time the human_proteome is estimated to encompass ppis of those only a subset has been described at this point establishing ppi databases that provide_valuable about the reactions occurring at the proteome level previous_studies analyzed and compared some of these databases however these analyses were based on the significantly_smaller datasets available at the time of the analysis and included only subsets of currently popular ppi databases therefore we analyzed the following four popular ppi databases hprd human protein reference_database mint molecular_interaction intact and biogrid biological general repository for interaction datasets in addition we also included in the comparison a recently_published database named hippie human integrated protein_protein reference http cbdm mdc berlin de tools hippie m submitted for publication it is assembled through the compilation of several ppi sources including the previously mentioned databases lastly for the sections of this study not involving network topological characteristics we also included the string database_search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes proteins a popular resource that in addition to protein interactions also contains protein associations from several pathway_databases mint hprd biogrid andintact are manually_curated and have thousands of interactions submitted by the community thus since they offer original interactions used by other databases we refer to these four databases as primary resources hippie and string are composed of interactions taken from primary databases and other sources hence we refer to hippie and string as derived databases in addition for the purpose of this study we removed all predicted functional_associations present in string here we focused on the human subset of interaction_databases and as an improvement over most current analyses we demonstrated the usefulness of organ or cell_type subnetworks we analyzed these databases for their basic_features including protein coverage number of interactions and neighborhood characteristics i e we compared the number and identity of interactions partners and asked whether proteins that are a hub in one database occupy a similar position in other databases finally using three databases that assign confidence_scores to its interactions we demonstrated that there is a lack of interaction data with high confidence_scores for many intensively_studied proteins additional experimental_evidence for those interactions either confirming or refuting would significantly increase the robustness of current ppi databases
