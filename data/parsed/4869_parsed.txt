data_and visualization and phospholipid identification valid online integrated search_engine capable of identifying and visualizing glycerophospholipids with given mass motivation establishing phospholipid identities in large lipidomic data_sets is a labour_intensive process where genomics and proteomics capitalize on sequence_based signatures glycerophospholipids lack easily definable molecular fingerprints carbon_chain degree of unsaturation linkage and polar_head identity must be calculated from mass to charge m z ratios under defined mass spectrom etry ms conditions given increasing ms sensitivity many m z values are not represented in existing prediction engines to address this need visualization and phospholipid identification is a web_based application that returns all theoretically possible phospholipids for any m z value and ms condition visualization algorithms produce multiple chemical_structure files for each species curated lipids detected by the canadian institutes of health research training_program in neu rodegenerative lipidomics are provided as high_resolution structures the past_years have seen remarkable advances in high_performance electrospray_ionization ms coupled with careful biochemistry enabling the separation of membranes and in some cases membrane_microdomains adaptation of these technologies to the study of lipids is permitting comprehensive phospholipid profiling at the molecular level the emerging field of lipidomics faces three main analytical challenges i a paucity of bioinformatic_tools for spectral_analysis ii the need for accurate lipid prediction_algorithms before experimenters can proceed to empirical validation iii a requirement for visual tools capable of displaying all theoretically possible lipid conformations in d and d the most comprehensive tool kit has been developed by the lipid maps consortium representing lipid_species the majority of their curated ms data has been generated using mouse leukemic monocyte_macrophage cells and while extensive does not yet represent all biological lipids to our knowledge none of the existing open_access web_based engines have capacity to predict identity of every m z value detected in different ms spectra supplementary visualization and phospholipid identification valid is a comprehensive simple to use resource enabling rapid prediction of these tissue_specific lipid unknowns valid is a web_based application linking a convenient search_engine a phospholipid database and multiple visualization features for identification and dissemination of large_scale lipidomic datasets valid returns all theoretically possible species based on m z and user_defined ms conditions the user is cautioned that valid includes lipids and isomeric bond configurations that may not be biologically_relevant investigators are encouraged to mine these lists for species most relevant to their specific biological system for subsequent validation to assist in decision_making a best guess feature is available to focus on lipids predicted to be common based on the prevalence of the fatty_acid chains in mammalian_cells every theoretical conformation in cis configuration for each species can be viewed in d and d curated species can also be downloaded in multiple high_resolution representations for further visualization and model production
