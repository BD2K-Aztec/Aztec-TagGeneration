genome_analysis association screening of common and rare genetic_variants by penalized_regression motivation this article extends our recent research on penalized estimation methods in genome_wide to the realm of rare_variants results the new strategy is tested on both simulated_and our findings on breast_cancer data replicate previous results and shed light on variant effects within genes availability rare_variant discovery by group penalized_regression is now implemented in the free program mendel atgenome wide association studies gwass have enjoyed varying_degrees of success in the past_decade the failure of single_nucleotide snp based studies to explain a substantial fraction of trait variation is hardly surprising given the tendency of selection to drive even weakly deleterious_mutations to extinction there are several candidates for the missing dark_matter of genetic_epidemiology among these are i copy_number cnvs ii polygenes of small effect iii interactions between genes and between genes and environment iv epigenetic_effects and v rare_variants rare_variants are currently attracting the most attention cnvs are subject to the same selective forces as snps the sole benefit of discovering polygenes of small effect is the insight these provide into biochemical_pathways and genetic_networks detecting interactions is problematic unless they are large or sample_sizes are very large epigenetic_effects and parent of origin effects are clearly important in certain settings and deserve more study in view of the recent striking advances in large_scale sequencing the search for rare_variants is apt to be the most promising route to disease_gene statistical_methods must evolve to meet the challenges of sequence_data most current analysis methods are predicated on the common disease common_variant cdcv hypothesis which to whom correspondence should be addressed postulates that common diseases are caused by common_variants of small to modest effect the competing common disease rare_variant cdrv hypothesis postulates that common diseases are caused collectively by multiple rare_variants of moderate to large effect macular_degeneration is cited as an example supporting the cdcv hypothesis because macular_degeneration onset is typically late in life it has a small impact on darwinian fitness the cdrv hypothesis receives support from traits such as low plasma_levels of hdl_cholesterol cystic_fibrosis colorectal_adenomas familial breast_cancer and schizophrenia the distinction between the two hypotheses is less sharp than proponents might suggest in the heat of argument there is a spectrum of deleterious allele_frequencies within many disease genes and special circumstances of human history may favor one hypothesis over the other depending on the diseases and populations studied it makes good statistical sense to consider all predictors snp variants and environmental covariates in concert because rare_disease predisposing alleles may be present in only a handful of patients the traditional variant by variant approach is doomed to low power a remedy is to group variants by gene or pathway membership once this is done the strongest marginal signal is assessed by a weighted_sum test or by a groupwise test exploiting the multivariate and collapsing strategies of li and leal multiple testing remains_a the current article extends our recent research on penalized estimation methods in gwas to the realm of rare_variants this approach to association_mapping has several advantages i it applies to both ordinary and logistic_regression ii it is parsimonious and very fast iii it offers a principled approach to model_selection when the number of predictors exceeds the number of study participants and iv it handles interactions gracefully our current software relies on lasso penalties and forms part of the mendel package here we discuss how to incorporate group penalties that make it easier for related predictors to enter a model once one of the predictors does for example one could group all snps within a single gene or within several genes in the same pathway we will argue that a mixture of group penalties and single predictor penalties tends to work best in practice and constitutes a good alternative to forced collapsing when we pass to penalized estimation model_selection is emphasized over hypothesis_testing the lasso penalty is one of the best continuous variable_selection mechanisms known for highdimensional models the term lasso stands for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator unfortunately the lasso is too stringent for rare_variants shifting some of the lasso action to a group euclidean penalty makes it easier for weak or low_frequency predictors to enter a model retention of a partial lasso penalty still discourages inclusion of neutral mutations within disease susceptibility_genes the mixed penalty tactic is apt to be most successful when a disease gene harbors a borderline rare_variant with substantial risk note that there is no reason to omit common_variants in the model_selection framework hence a strength of mixed penalties is that they can be applied without choosing between the cdcv and cdrv hypotheses once the model_selection perspective assumes center stage multiple testing problems recede they reappear in replication but in a more benign form because the number of genes and snps of interest drop dramatically this niche at the intersection between statistics and genetics is undergoing_rapid evolution our prior experiences applying lassopenalized ordinary regression to microarray_data and lasso penalized logistic_regression to gwas data were very encouraging since we embarked on the current rare_variant research important work has appeared by a number of authors the recent technical report ofintroduces a mixture of group and lasso penalties in ordinary regression earlierconsidered logistic_regression with a pure group penalty both of these papers fall outside the arena of gwas the latter paper also employs different algorithms for optimization croiseau and cordell applied logistic_regression with a pure group penalty to a north_american rheumatoid_arthritis consortium dataset however they treat each snp as a separate group whereas we group snps by gene or pathway to our knowledge there have been no published_papers on generalized_linear with mixed group and lasso penalties certainly none focused on association_mapping and rare_variants the remainder of the article is organized as follows section_describes our statistical_approach and optimization algorithms it introduces the lasso and group euclidean penalties and shows how they can be implemented in linear_and the coordinate descent algorithms covered are exceptionally quick and permit optimal tuning of the penalty constant by cross_validation section also presents an efficient method for simulating samples under the cdrv model section applies the mixed penalty method to two simulation examples section analyzes a breast_cancer dataset that is small enough to allow comparison to traditional model_selection the discussion highlights some strengths_and of model_selection with mixed penalties and suggests potentially helpful extensions the results of this article suggest that mixed group and lasso penalties outperform lasso penalties alone especially when both common and rare_variants are present our simulated examples clearly demonstrate this fact our analysis of the breast_cancer data is more ambiguous because we do not know the truth that nature hides in our view the focus in genetic_epidemiology should be on both snp and gene_discovery the connections between penalized_regression and bayesian_analysis are obvious one could argue the case for passing to a full bayesian assault on association testing this has already been accomplished for marginal analysis of snps wellcome_trust although it is tempting to construct multi predictor bayesian_methods the computational costs are apt to be high penalized estimation and model_selection achieve many of the same goals at a fraction of the computational_cost mixed penalties help us sort through the confusion of causal_genes and neutral variants within them even though mixed penalties improve both false_positive we are not suggesting that mixed penalties are a panacea however the gradual accumulation of incremental improvements in statistical_methods will make a substantial_difference the statistical_tools showcased here form part of the next release of the mendel statistical genetics package mendel is available for free in linux macos and windows versions at http www genetics ucla edu software it takes s on a standard desktop computer to complete all single snp analyses and lasso estimation on the family cancer_registry data our companion_paper zhou h et_al unpublished_data discusses mendel syntax and output conventions geneticists and statisticians wanting to judge for themselves the virtues of mixed penalties are welcome to use mendel on their own data
