gene_expression estimation of fluorescence tagged rna_numbers from spot intensities motivation present research on gene_expression using live_cell and fluorescent_proteins or tagged rna requires accurate automated methods of quantification of these molecules from the images here we propose a novel automated method for classifying pixel intensities of fluorescent spots to rna_numbers results the method relies on a new model of intensity distributions of tagged rnas for which we estimated parameter_values in maximum_likelihood sense from measurement data and constructed a maximum a posteriori classifier to estimate rna_numbers in fluorescent rna spots we applied the method to estimate the number of tagged rnas in individual live escherichia_coli cells containing a gene coding for an rna with ms gfp binding_sites we tested the method using two constructs coding for either or binding_sites and obtained similar distributions of rna_numbers showing that the method is adaptive we further show that the results agree with a method that uses time series data and with quantitative poly merase chain reaction measurements lastly using simulated_data we show that the method is accurate in realistic parameter ranges this method should in general be applicable to live single_cell measurements of low copy_number fluorescence tagged molecules availability_and matlab extensions written in c for parameter_estimation and finding decision boundaries are available under mozilla public license atthe processes of production and degradation of rna and protein numbers are stochastic which causes these numbers to differ between individuals and to vary over time in individual cells even under optimal stable conditions present measurement techniques to study these processes in live cells rely on the usage of fluorescent_proteins and consequently on fluorescent_microscopy and image_processing methods to extract the relevant statistical data one of the most accurate techniques to quantify gene_expression dynamics in vivo consists of tagging target rna_molecules with multiple ms d gfp proteins which makes the target rna_transcripts visible as bright spots as soon as these are transcribed the present method of quantifying the rna_numbers in cells or in the fluorescent rna spots relies on a manual selection of the intensity of a single tagged rna using the histogram of fluorescence_intensities following this selection this method assumes that the peaks of spots intensities are concentrated at multiples of the expected intensity of a single rna so as to quantify the number of rna_molecules in spots of varying fluorescence_intensities this method of quantification is not optimal for several reasons first it relies on human intervention and the manual selection can have a major effect in the results of the process of counting the rna_molecules this hampers comparison between results because the selection of the intensity of the first peak varies between users second the distribution of the number of rna_molecules composing the spots is not uniform and thus the optimal quantification of these numbers is not achieved by simple rounding third the variance in intensities of the spots is expected to increase with the number of tagged rnas composing the spot fourth the tagged rna_molecules tend to accumulate at the poles of the cells and one cannot rely on spatial separation between them lastly for large_datasets manually assisted quantification can be excessively laborious here we propose an automatic method that improves on the rna quantification from fluorescence_images for this we establish a mathematical_model of the intensities which is free from any assumption on the shape of the distribution of the rnas as this distribution is the subject of the study also we propose methods to estimate the parameters of the model and construct a classifier we then exemplify the usage of the method in determining the number of rnas in clusters of ms gfptagged rna_molecules in escherichia_coli under various conditions in particular we compare results of analyzing cells with one of two target_rna constructs that differ in the number of binding_sites for ms gfp proteins in addition the results are compared with a method that uses temporal_information for the rna quantification and results from cells subject to different to whom correspondence should be addressed levels of induction of target_rna are compared with quantitative_polymerase qpcr measurements lastly we study the performance of the classifier on simulated_data whose ground_truth is known and compare it with that of the previous method
