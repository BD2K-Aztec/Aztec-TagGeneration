romulus robust multi state identification of transcription_factor from dnase_seq data motivation computational_prediction of transcription_factor tf_binding in the genome remains_a here we present romulus a novel computational_method for identifying individual tf_binding from genome_sequence and cell typespecific experimental_data such as dnase_seq it combines the strengths of previous_approaches and improves robust ness by reducing the number of free_parameters in the model by an order of magnitude results we show that romulus significantly_outperforms existing_methods across three sources of dnase_seq data by assessing the performance of these tools against chip_seq profiles the difference was particularly significant when applied to binding_site for low information content motifs our method is capable of inferring multiple binding_modes for a single tf which differ in their dnase_i cut profile finally using the model learned by romulus and chip_seq we introduce binding in closed chromatin bcc as a quantitative measure of tf pioneer factor activity uniquely our measure quantifies a defining feature of pioneer factors namely their ability to bind closed chromatin availability_and romulus is freely_available as an r package at http github com ajank romulus eukaryotic transcription is an extremely_complex process controlled by transcription_factor tf_binding to regulatory_elements in multiple_locations in the genome the traditional method of analyzing individual active regulatory_elements in the genome involves the digestion by dnase_i and subsequent identification of regions where tfs are bound to the dna_fragment and protect the dna from degradation by the enzyme these protected sites or tf footprints can be identified on a large_scale by a more recent protocol dnase_i digestion followed by high_throughput dnase_seq centipede was the first algorithm aimed at combining sequence_information with chromatin_state data to identify the sites where a particular tf was bound in the genome this method relied on the presence of a dna sequence_motif at candidate binding_sites a logistic regression_model allowed for multiple types of prior information to be incorporated e g position_weight pwm score distance to the nearest transcription_start and sequence evolutionary_conservation the posterior component consisted of a combination of negative_binomial and multinomial positional models for each type of experimental_data such as dnase_seq or histone_modification chip_seq overall the main strength of v c the author published_by in this study we comprehensively compared the predictive_performance of three tools aimed at predicting tf_binding from dnase_seq data two of them centipede and wellington used completely different approaches to address this problem in our method proposed here romulus we combined the benefits of both of the two other tools and showed that romulus significantly_outperformed centipede and wellington regardless of the dnase_seq protocol used single hit or double hit the advantage of romulus was observed especially when applied to binding_site for low information content motifs it is likely that romulus gained in robustness and predictive_power by limiting the number of free_parameters in the multinomial component to motif width in contrast centipede used motif width free_parameters in the multinomial component and wellington does not estimate any model_parameters from the data
