fast sl an efficient algorithm to identify synthetic_lethal sets in metabolic_networks motivation synthetic_lethal sets are sets of reactions genes where only the simultaneous removal of all reactions genes in the set abolishes growth of an organism previous_approaches to identify synthetic_lethal genes in genome_scale have built on the framework of flux_balance fba extending it either to exhaustively analyze all possible combinations of genes or formulate the problem as a bi level mixed_integer milp problem we here propose an algorithm fast sl which surmounts the computational_complexity of previous_approaches by iteratively reducing the search_space for synthetic lethals resulting in a substantial reduction in running time even for higher_order synthetic lethals results we performed synthetic reaction and gene lethality analysis using fast sl for genome_scale of escherichia_coli salmonella_enterica typhimurium and mycobacterium_tuberculosis fast sl also rigorously identifies synthetic_lethal gene_deletions uncovering synthetic_lethal triplets that were not reported_previously we confirm that the triple lethal gene_sets obtained for the three organisms have a precise match with the results obtained through exhaustive enumer ation of lethals performed on a computer cluster we also parallelized our algorithm enabling the identification of synthetic_lethal gene quadruplets for all three organisms in under h overall fast sl enables an efficient enumeration of higher_order synthetic lethals in metabolic_networks which may help uncover previously_unknown genetic_interactions and combinatorial drug_targets availability_and the matlab_implementation of the algorithm compatible with cobra toolbox v is available at https github com ramanlab fastslin the recent_years genome_scale have been reconstructed for many organisms these networks have been studied using tools such as flux_balance fba for the identification of drug_targets targets for metabolic_engineering and to understand the robustness of organisms through systematic experimental evaluation of gene_knockouts another important aspect of analyzing these reconstructed metabolic_networks is the identification of combinations of genes which when simultaneously deleted abolish growth in silico these sets termed synthetic lethals reveal complex interactions in metabolic_networks synthetic lethals have been analyzed in the past for prediction of novel genetic_interactions and analyzing the extent of robustness of biological_networks prediction of phenotypic behavior on genetic perturbationshas also been studied in many reconstructions for model validation fba has been proven to accurately_predict phenotypes following various genetic_perturbations previous_reports also suggest that fba can reliably_predict synthetic_lethal genes in metabolic_networks of organisms such as saccharomyces_cerevisiae the identification of synthetic_lethal genes in metabolic_networks also finds application in combinatorial therapy as combinatorial deletion strategies are more difficult for the organism to resist since the systematic evaluation of these targets in vivo is challenging computational_approaches have been of great interest to overcome this difficulty exhaustive enumeration of synthetic lethals of higher orders was previously performed by parallelizing the deletions on a cluster of computers however exhaustive enumeration is computationally very expensive and even prohibitive in case of larger metabolic_networks another algorithm for identifying synthetic_lethal reactions and genes is sl finder published by maranas and co workers sl finder elegantly poses the identification of synthetic lethals as a bilevel mixed_integer milp problem the algorithm has been applied for the identification of synthetic_lethal doublets and triplets in escherichia_coli reaction essentiality has been previously inferred using elementary modes and minimal_cut even though there are efficient algorithms to analyze minimal_cut in a metabolic_network the milp formulation is fundamentally np_hard and is prohibitive in case of large_networks other methods also suggest_ways for reduction of metabolic_networks and alternate formulations to enumerate minimal_cut for the identification of synthetic_lethal sets we here propose an alternative algorithm fast sl which circumvents the computational_complexity of both exhaustive enumeration and bi level milp through an iterative reduction of the search_space for higher_order synthetic_lethal sets we also present an efficient method to rigorously identify lethal gene_sets identifying upto quadruple lethal gene_sets that were not previously_identified fast sl formulation for gene_deletions also compares_favorably with logical transformation of model ltm approach which transforms the stoichiometric matrix such that lethal gene_deletion sets can be identified by merely identifying lethal reaction sets applying the fast sl algorithm on the transformed matrix using the pre print of an earlier version of this paper available at arxiv org fast sl provides a rapid way to gain insights into the genetic robustness of organisms by identifying synthetic_lethal sets even up to the order of four we performed gene and reaction deletions up to the order of four using fast sl for the genome_scale of e coli iaf and two important pathogenic_organisms salmonella_enterica typhimurium lt stm v and mycobacterium_tuberculosis inj in this study we describe a new algorithm to rapidly_identify synthetic_lethal reaction gene_sets in genome_scale the identification of synthetic lethals in organisms can be used to understand complex genetic_interactions between genes and identify drug_targets for combinatorial therapy we build on the popular framework of fba extending it to identify synthetic lethals our algorithm exploits the structure of the metabolic_network better than previous_algorithms to eliminate combinations of reactions genes that are guaranteed not to produce a lethal phenotype under the conditions considered importantly our algorithm also identifies synthetic_lethal gene_sets rigorously by carefully considering the gpr associations in the metabolic model fast sl therefore manages to identify new lethal gene triplets in e coli which were not identified by a previous study indicated in supplementary_file s further we confirmed that our algorithm does not miss out on any synthetic_lethal gene_sets by cross checking with an exhaustive analysis of triple gene_deletions on a computer cluster our algorithm for finding synthetic_lethal gene_sets also outperforms the ltm method which increases the problem size in the case of e coli from to for the same model our approach avoids this transformation and consequently solves far fewer lps thereby computing the lethal sets in much less time fast sl utilizes the flux corresponding to norm minimization which can be easily formulated as an lp it is important to note that there may be multiple j nz sets corresponding to the minimum sum of absolute_values of fluxes i e minimized norm solution and these j nz sets may also vary in terms of their sizes it does not matter which j nz set one may begin the algorithm with because in all the j nz sets the arguments that j sl is completely contained in j nz and at least one of i or j of a lethal pair i j belongs to j nz and so on always hold true however smaller the size of the set j nz in each step faster the algorithm would be more importantly minimization of the norm of the flux vector may not always converge to the sparsest possible solution which is often denoted as the norm solution here it is also important to note that fast sl does not require the sparsest solution to work a reasonably sparse solution already achieves a significant search_space reduction while circumventing the complexity of the norm milp formulation our work does have its limitations as with any other metabolic network_analysis technique our method suffers from any inadequacies present in the model nevertheless our algorithm can identify a list of lethal and non lethal phenotypes which can be used to refine the metabolic model based on disagreements with experimental_results further the synthetic lethals predicted by our algorithm are valid only in a particular environment growth_medium it is however straightforward to identify lethal sets for other environments by altering the constraints suitably in sum we see three main contributions of our method first fast sl achieves a massive reduction in the search_space and obviates the need for performing an exhaustive analysis of combinatorial gene reaction deletions this can facilitate the identification of combinatorial drug_targets in organisms even up to the order of four which was previously nearly intractable second fast sl also compares_favorably with the mcsenumerator algorithm eliminating the need to solve complex milps finally fastsl also rigorously identifies lethal gene_sets uncovering lethal gene_sets not previously_identified by other algorithms overall fast sl enables a rapid evaluation of combinatorial gene and reaction deletions in genome_scale which may help identify previously_unknown genetic_interactions and combinatorial drug_targets
