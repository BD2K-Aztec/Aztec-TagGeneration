bioinformatics_discovery systems_biology exploring the role of human mirnas in virus_host using systematic overlap analysis motivation human mirnas have recently been found to have important roles in viral_replication understanding the patterns and details of human mirna interactions during virushost interactions may help uncover novel antiviral therapies based on the abundance of knowledge available regarding proteinprotein_interactions ppi virushost protein interactions experimentally_validated human mirna_target pairs and transcriptional_regulation of human mirnas it is possible to explore the complex regulatory_network that exists between viral_proteins and human mirnas at the system level results by integrating current data regarding the virushuman inter actome and human mirna_target pairs the overlap between targets of viral_proteins and human mirnas was identified and found to represent topologically important proteins e g hubs or bottlenecks at the global center of the human ppi_network viral_proteins and human mirnas were also found to significantly target human ppi pairs furthermore an overlap analysis of virus targets and transcription_factors tfs of human mirnas revealed that viral_proteins preferentially target human mirna tfs representing a new pattern of virushost interactions potential feedback_loops formed by viruses human mirnas and mirna tfs were also identified and these may be exploited by viruses resulting in greater virulence and more effective replication strategies contact mirnas are key_regulators of various biological_processes in addition recent_studies that human mirnas also have diverse roles in mediating virushuman interactions see survey by for example viruses are able to regulate infection associated host_factors by manipulating human mirnas to facilitate the infection process mirnas can also interfere with the virus_infection process by exploring the role of human mirnas in viral pathogenesis our understanding of the complex virushuman interactions will be further increased viruses may selectively take advantage of human mirnas to increase their ability to infect or replicate within hosts for example wang et_al found that cytomegalovirus induced changes in mirna_expression ho et_al also found that enterovirus induced mir targeted cap dependent translation_initiation eif e resulting in termination of host protein_synthesis conversely human mirnas can also interfere with viral_infections for example santhakumar et_al found that a subset of human mirnas regulated signal_transduction including pi_k and erk_mapk signaling_pathways as well as oxidative_stress signaling and prostaglandin_synthesis moreover these mirnas were able to confer broad inhibitory_potential against multiple viruses in addition lagos et_al further confirmed that human mirnas can regulate innate_immune to viral_infections human mirnas can also directly target viral_genomes for example lecellier et_al confirmed that the open_reading of human foamy virus was targeted by human mir resulting in effective inhibition of human foamy virus_replication similarly overexpression of human mir a inhibited replication of the hepatitis_c hcv_genome in cells infected with hcv b or hcv a replicons however it remains_unclear whether human mirnas that directly target viruses confer resistance to viral_infections or if they are used by viruses to establish infection the growing availability of experimental_data regarding the human protein interactome virushost protein interactions and human mirna_target pairs has provided a valuable opportunity to study the role of human mirnas at the systems level therefore in this study a potential regulatory_network was generated using host targets of viral_proteins human mirnas and putative mirna tfs specifically four typical_patterns of human mirna mediated virushuman interactions the topological characteristics of host target_proteins and human mirna_targets described in the human proteinprotein_interaction ppin are included the discovery that human mirnas play crucial roles in viral pathogenesis provides valuable insight into new patterns of virushost interactions based on the systematic overlap analysis performed using data from virushost protein interactions previously_identified human mirna_target pairs and known human mirna tfs it appears that human mirnas have important and wide_ranging effects on virushost interactions the existence of a large proportion of shared target_proteins and protein pairs between viral_proteins and human mirnas indicates that human mirna regulation subnetworks and viral_infections are significantly interwoven in host_cell networks correspondingly analysis of topological characteristics associated with the ppin reveals that overlapping proteins were preferentially topologically important e g hubs and bottlenecks and tended to occupy the global center of the ppin it is possible that the special position of the overlapping targets in the ppin facilitates the ability of viruses and human mirnas to efficiently take control of the ppin the functional analysis of overlapping targets also demonstrates that these genes take part in basic_cellular such as cell communication and apoptosis which also suggests that human mirnas play_key the process of virus_infection and replication the significant_overlap between host targets for viruses and possible human mirna tfs also reveals a new pattern of virus_host therefore targeting human mirna tfs may be an effective way for a virus to gain_control of a host_cell especially because mirnas can regulate a large number of host_proteins interestingly we also find that the host targets of viral_proteins may form feedback_loops with human mirnas these negative_feedback may be exploited by viruses to finetune their pathogenesis and to complete their replication cycle therefore interfering with these regulatory_circuits may provide new approaches for developing antiviral therapies certainly stronger experimental and computational evidence will be needed to further define the existence and universality of the described virushost interaction_patterns in this article rules_governing virushost interactions were systematically_analyzed using a high_quality dataset because of the complexity of virushost interactions all the possible virus host interaction_patterns could not be explored and only several typical virushost interaction_patterns involving the role of human mirnas were described and there are reports of the roles of host epigenetic_regulators there are many other patterns involving virushost interactions that need to be further investigated for example human mirnas can directly target viral_genomes for defense and viral_proteins were also found to regulate expression of human mirnas that targeted host chromatin_remodeling proteins
