drug_repositioning by integrating target information through a heterogeneous network model motivation the emergence of network medicine not only offers more opportunities for better and more complete understanding of the molecular complexities of diseases but also serves as a promising tool for identifying new drug_targets and establishing new relationships among diseases that enable drug_repositioning computational_approaches for drug_repositioning by integrating information from multiple sources and multiple levels have the potential to provide great insights to the complex relationships among drugs targets disease genes and diseases at a system level results in this article we have proposed a computational framework based on a heterogeneous network model and applied the approach on drug_repositioning by using existing omics_data about diseases drugs and drug_targets the novelty of the framework lies in the fact that the strength between a diseasedrug pair is calculated through an iterative algorithm on the heterogeneous graph that also incorporates drug_target information comprehensive experimental_results show that the proposed approach significantly_outperforms several recent_approaches case studies further illustrate its practical usefulness availability_and traditionally drug_discovery and drug_development mainly rely on cell based or target based screening of chemical_compounds to identify a small subset of hits properties of which are then studied to further increase their affinity efficacy and selectivity before moving_forward to animal_tests and clinical_trials even with advance in technology and knowledge about the molecular_bases of diseases the whole process of drug_development is still lengthy expensive and with high failure_rates it is estimated that the cost for developing a new drug is billion dollars and the average time is years drug_repositioning which aims to identify new indications of existing_drugs offers a promising alternative to reduce the total time and cost because of existing safety toleration and efficacy data on known drugs several successfully repositioned drugs e g sildenafil have generated significant revenues for their patent holders companies the generation of large_scale genomic transcriptomic proteomic_data and their integration with signaling and metabolimic data in a network framework have provided new insights of molecular basis of complex_diseases and have enabled a network based view of drug_discovery the emergence of network medicine not only offers more opportunities for better and more complete understanding of molecular complexities of diseases but also serves as a promising tool for identifying new drug_targets and establishing new relationships among diseases that enable drug_repositioning since these earlier works many computational_approaches have been proposed either for target prediction or drug_repositioning many of which have used network based_algorithms in many of these studies drug_target prediction and drug_repositioning were treated as two separate tasks we argue that by incorporating target information directly into drug_repositioning we can potentially make more meaningful predictions the underlying assumption is based on the principle of rational_drug therapeutic_effect of chemical_compounds on diseases is through their binding to biological_targets that are relevant to diseases themselves although it is not feasible to fully adopt the rational_drug strategy in large_scale systematic_assessment of relationships among all drugs and all diseases it is a promising direction to include target information in drug_repositioning this principle has been recognized by many researchers e g what is lacking is a systematic approach to automatically integrate drugtarget information into drug_repositioning in this article we propose a novel heterogeneous network model that seamlessly integrates drug_repositioning and target prediction into one unified_framework the full heterogeneous graph_model consists of three different types of nodes diseases drugs and drug_targets diseasedrug relationships and drugtarget relationships are constructed based on prior_knowledge from existing databases such as drugbank diseasedisease drugdrug and targettarget relationships are constructed based on their similarities the drug to whom correspondence should be addressed repositioning is thus formulated as a missing edge prediction_problem on this heterogeneous graph an iterative updating algorithm that propagates information across the network is then developed to solve the missing edge prediction_problem our approach is based on the guilt by association principle that has been validated repeatedly in many studies including studies on drug_repositioning a unique characteristic of our framework is that it automatically incorporates drug_target information into drugdisease association prediction although the primary goal of this article is to investigate the drug_repositioning problem it is also worth noting that by using the newly_proposed heterogeneous model and the iterative updating algorithm new drugtarget relationships will also be automatically constructed simultaneously when only diseases and drugs are considered or only drugs and targets are considered the triple layer model is reduced to a two layer model the two layer model using drugs and targets for target prediction was investigated by our group in a recent paper and its iterative updating algorithm was termed heterogeneous graph based_inference hgbi the same algorithm can also be used for the two layer model consisting of diseases and drugs for drug_repositioning however it cannot be directly extended to the tree layer model which will be the focus of this study to evaluate the newly_proposed three layer model termed tl hgbi for triple layer heterogeneous graph based_inference for drug_repositioning we will compare its performance with the performance of the two layer model consisting of only diseases and drugs by using the hgbi algorithm originally developed for drug_target prediction the evaluation is mainly based on leave_one loocv experiments on large_scale omics_data from existing databases e g drugbank omim three additional stateof the art approaches namely gba blm and nbi are also included in the comparison although blm and nbi hgbi as well were originally developed for drugtarget association prediction the algorithms have been used on drug disease association prediction and can naturally be applied on drug_repositioning experimental_results show that tl hgbi performs the best with highest auc area_under i e roc_curve in particular when focusing on the top predicted drugdisease associations tl hgbi successfully retrieves interactions of true diseasedrug interactions whereas hgbi blm and nbi retrieve and such interactions furthermore in a case study of five different diseases many of the top_ranked drugs are strongly supported by recent_literature knowledge of which was not included in the experiment in this article we have proposed a three layer heterogeneous graph_model that captures inter and intrarelationships among diseases drugs and targets with the purpose of novel drug_usage prediction based on this framework we have developed an iterative algorithm to obtain final proximity scores between diseases and drugs which can be used to rank candidate_drugs for each disease experimental_results on diseases with and without known drugs have shown that tl hgbi outperforms other three popular_methods as well as the two layer model proposed earlier by our group in particular tl hgbi is more useful in practice than other approaches tested here because of its topranked drugs consisting of many true drugdisease relationships a case study on five diseases using all existing data indicates that results obtained by tl hgbi can be of high importance supported by existing_literature one should notice that there exist many other types of data e g side effect information of drugs gene_expression data that can also be used to predict drugdisease drugtarget associations e g some existing_methods e g predict by have used different datasets in predicting diseasedrug associations which makes it impractical to directly compare their performance with the performance of the proposed approach in addition to datasets there are different ways in defining relationships among nodes of the same type for example connections between targets can be defined based on proteinprotein_interaction data or based on protein structural_information e g focusing on binding_domains disease relationships can be defined based on ontology the relative_merits using different metrics are worth further investigations nevertheless valuable information has been lost for approaches not considering relationships among nodes of the same type we plan to address both issues in our future work by extending the proposed_framework in several possible directions to include more diverse datasets of different types other than the three discussed here one direct extension is to add more layers and more links to the system the key is then how to generalize the iterative updating algorithm to the new multi_layer model in the case where additional datasets can actually be treated as properties of one of the three entities another possible extension is to represent drugs diseases proteins using feature_vectors the elements of which will be defined based on those additional datasets for example to incorporate drug side effect information each drug will be presented by a feature_vector which may include drug compound structure drug side effect information and some other properties for each drug pair one score is calculated for each feature scores of all features will be converted into percentile based scores in a similar way as we did in an earlier study for gene_prioritization based on multiple data_sources drugdrug relationships can then be defined based on the most significant score similarly gene_expression information and protein interaction information can be incorporated into the protein target layer essentially the relationships between the same types of nodes are redefined based on more data_sources another possible direction is to incorporate semantics finally both diseases and targets can be separated into different subclasses based on their mechanisms it will be interesting to see how the performance will change when we only include subsets of data with the same mechanism eventually wet_lab experimental_testing is a necessary step to validate the proposed approach which cannot be done without collaborations with investigators with expertise in biochemistry and drug_development
