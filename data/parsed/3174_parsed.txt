multivariate multi way analysis of multi source data motivation analysis_of anova type methods are the default tool for the analysis of data with multiple covariates these tools have been generalized to the multivariate_analysis of high_throughput biological_datasets where the main_challenge is the problem of small_sample and high_dimensionality however the existing multi way analysis methods are not designed for the currently increasingly important experiments where data is obtained from multiple sources common examples of such settings include integrated analysis of metabolic and gene_expression or metabolic_profiles from several tissues in our case in a controlled multi way experimental_setup where disease status medical_treatment gender and time series are usual covariates results we extend the applicability area of multivariate multi way anova type methods to multi source cases by introducing a novel bayesian_model the method is capable of finding covariate related dependencies between the sources it assumes the measurements consist of groups of similarly behaving variables and estimates the multivariate covariate_effects and their interaction effects for the discovered groups of variables in particular the method partitions the effects to those shared between the sources and to source specific ones the method is specifically_designed for datasets with small_sample and high_dimensionality we apply the method to a lipidomics dataset from a lung_cancer study with two way experimental_setup where measurements from several tissues with mostly distinct lipids have been taken the method is also directly applicable to gene_expression and proteomics availability an r implementation is available atdata from experiments with multiple covariates are usually analyzed with multi way analysis_of anova type methods a typical one way analysis setup in experiments looking for potential biomarkers for disease is the diseasedhealthy differential analysis biological_experiments often contain additional covariates such as drug treatment groups gender or time series resulting in a multi way experimental_setup the traditional_methods for multi way analysis are univariate multi way anova and its multivariate generalization manova in the two way case to explain the covariate related variation of the to whom correspondence should be addressed data in one data source say x the following linear_model is usually assumed here the a and b a a and b b are the two independent covariates and the main effects x a and x b and the interaction effect x ab model the variation from the baseline level grand mean x the is a noise term a recurring problem in omics measurements in particular in gene_expression and metabolomics is the small number of samples versus high_dimensionality the traditional multivariate_methods break down due to the singularity of the covariance_matrix a further disadvantage of manova is that it gives only a p value describing the statistical_significance of the effects and the location which variables and direction up down of the effects have to be deduced afterwards separately by other methods such as t tests the latter holds for anova as well dealing with the small_sample problem is currently an active research_topic and has already led to working solutions multi way multivariate anova type analysis can be done in the small_sample cases with simple two step approaches relying on a prior principal_component pca dimension_reduction another approach is forming sparse latent_factors where some of the variables but not all are associated with each factor in this approach covariate information is used for factor regression and the model has been extended with univariate anova models with a joint sparsity prior we have recently_introduced a unified bayesian machine_learning model especially designed for metabolomic experiments with a two way setup and small_sample this approach assumes similarly behaving correlated groups of variables a valid assumption for metabolites and models the multi way covariate related variation for the groups the model is an extension of a factor analyzer and models the statistical_significance of multivariate covariate_effects on the low_dimensional factor space representing the discovered clusters of variables however the multi way data analysis problem becomes complicated when heterogeneous data with multiple covariates are integrated from multiple sources different data_sources usually have distinct unmatched variable spaces with different dimensionalities this becomes evident when considering integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics_data or metabolic_profiles from different tissues which usually have different metabolites if the variable spaces were the same one might want to consider the source as an additional covariate in a standard anova type analysis however this is usually impossible since variable spacespage i i i we first demonstrate the functioning of the method on simulated_data focusing on how the generated effects are found when the sample_size is small we then apply the method to a lung_cancer study where lipidomic profiles have been measured from several tissues of model mouse samples under a two way experimental_setup disease and treatment different tissues have distinct lipids finally the method is compared with a standard one source manova approach including dimension_reduction with pca we have generalized anova type multi way analysis to cases where measurements from multiple sources are available for samples having a multi way experimental_setup furthermore the method is able to decompose the covariate_effects to shared and sourcespecific effects unlike any existing_methods the problem is solved by a hierarchical latent_variable model that extends the generative_model of bayesian cca to model multi way covariate information of samples by assigning population specific priors on the shared latent_variable of cca the method is designed for cases with high_dimensionality and small_sample common in bioinformatics applications
