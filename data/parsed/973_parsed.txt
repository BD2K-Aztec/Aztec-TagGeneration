genome_analysis chromozoom a flexible fluid web_based genome_browser current web_based genome_browsers require repetitious user input to scroll over long_distances alter the drawing density of elements or zoom through multiple orders_of generally either the server or the client is responsible for the majority of data_processing resulting in either servers having to receive and handle data relevant only to one user or clients redundantly processing widely viewed data chromozoom pre renders and caches general use tracks into tiled images on the server and serves them in an interactive web_interface with inertial scrolling and precise fluent zooming via the mouse wheel or trackpad custom tracks in several formats can be rendered by client side code alongside the pre rendered tracks minimizing server load because of user specific rendering and eliminating the need to transmit private data chromozoom thereby enables rapid and simultaneous exploration of curated experimental and personal genomic_datasets availability human and yeast_genome researchers may browse recent assemblies within chromozoom atgenome browsers have become an essential tool for experimental and computational_biologists among well known web_based browsers the ucsc_genome has gained popularity for its ready_availability comprehensive library of genomes and curated_data and the ability to display custom data uploaded by researchers overlaying experimental_data e g sequence_variation onto curated tracks e g gene predictions allows for the formulation and verification of biological_hypotheses researchers unfamiliar with a newly encountered locus can inspect it within a genome_browser to determine the gene layout or potential regulatory_elements and design polymerase_chain or other experiments although many researchers have become familiar with the ucsc browser and others like gbrowse ensembl and the ncbi map viewer these tools originated before the advent of modern web interfaces that use less page transitions and more data dynamically loaded using asynchronous javascript and extensible mark up language ajax and html techniques some have attempted to incorporate aspects of the rich internet application experience into their interfacesfor example each of the aforementioned browsers now allow the user to drag the track to move the current viewbut none had a user_interface allowing smooth navigation equivalent to google maps for example animated transitions while zooming and the absence of loading interruptions throughout all navigational operations in response next generation browsers like annoj http www annoj org jbrowse and abrowse have been built to take advantage of modern web technologies adding more seamless interactions that preserve the users sense of location while traversing the massive landscape of a genome annoj and jbrowse render most genomic_data on the browser side the former drawing pixels on html canvas elements and the latter manipulating standard html elements however both require preprocessing of custom data by an administrator before it can be rendered within the browser neither accept flat files via the web_interface in the manner of the ucsc browser abrowse renders all data to tiled images but cannot zoom smoothly and requires custom data to be fully uploaded to the serverwhich can be prohibitive for large_datasets finally none of the browsers features inertial scrolling a feature popularized by ios and google maps whereby a scrollable surface can be thrown with a finger or the cursor to move across long_distances
