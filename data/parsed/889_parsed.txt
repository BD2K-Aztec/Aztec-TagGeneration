ccsvm correcting support_vector for confounding_factors in biological data classification motivation classifying biological data into different groups is a central task of bioinformatics for instance to predict the function of a gene or protein the disease_state of a patient or the phenotype of an individual based on its genotype support_vector are a wide_spread approach for classifying biological data due to their high_accuracy their ability to deal with structured data such as strings and the ease to integrate various types of data however it is unclear how to correct for confounding_factors such as population_structure age or gender or experimental_conditions in support_vector classification results in this article we present a support_vector classifier that can correct the prediction for observed confounding_factors this is achieved by minimizing the statistical dependence between the classifier and the confounding_factors we prove that this formulation can be transformed into a standard support_vector with rescaled input_data in our experiments our confounder correcting svm ccsvm improves tumor diagnosis based on samples from different labs tuberculosis diagnosis in patients of varying age ethnicity and gender and phenotype prediction in the presence of population_structure and outperforms state of the art methods in terms of prediction_accuracy availability a ccsvm implementation in matlab is available fromseveral of the most intensively_studied problems in computational_biology are classification tasks for instance predicting the function of a gene the disease_state of a patient the reaction of a patient to a therapy and the phenotype of an individual based on its genotype the abstract task is to predict the class y of an biological subject based on its features x emerging and existing high_throughput allow us to measure the features of genes proteins and individuals at an unprecedented_resolution and scale and the hope is that this rich knowledge will lead to ever more accurate data classification one of the most prominent and most successful classification algorithms are support_vector svms they are based on the idea to separate objects from two classes by means of a hyperplane new test_objects are then predicted to belong to one of these two classes depending on which half space they are to whom correspondence should be addressed located in their popularity is due to several reasons first svms have shown excellent prediction_accuracy in many studies second svms can be directly applied to structured data such as strings or graphs which are abundant in bioinformatics third svms allow for straightforward data_integration of several data types however svms suffer from one limitation it is unclear how to correct for confounding_variables in svm predictions according to meinert a confounder is defined as a variable which is related to two factors of interest and which falsely obscures or accentuates the relationship between them in this article we present an svm which can correct for observed confounding_variables the detrimental_effects of confounders are observable in many classification tasks in molecular_biology as illustrated by the following two examples one may want to predict the phenotypes of plants based on their genotype typically represented by single_nucleotide that represent sequence_variation in an individual in this task population_structure that is systematic ancestry differences between plants with different phenotypes may have a confounding_effect on the prediction for instance if there is a correlation between population_structure and phenotype the classifier may rely on snps that correlate with population_structure and subsequently its predictions may be wrong on datasets from different geographic origins where the phenotypepopulation correlation is less pronounced or not present another example is drug treatment response in patients from gene_expression confounding_factors may be the age the gender or the ethnicity of the patients each of which may correlate with the treatment response and the expression levels of certain genes when predicting on patients with different age sex or ethnic_background the learnt classifier may poorly generalize our goal in this article is to define a confounder correcting support_vector ccsvm that removes the confounding side information to the largest extent possible to achieve this we strive to make the classifier base its prediction on features that do not correlate with the confounding variable the remainder of this article is structured as follows in section we present the ccsvm section and the classifier section and the statistical dependence measure section it is based upon we prove that the ccsvm can be computed highly efficiently with existing software_packages in section in section we show that our method improves upon several state of the art classifiers in tumor diagnosis section tuberculosis diagnosis section page i i i
