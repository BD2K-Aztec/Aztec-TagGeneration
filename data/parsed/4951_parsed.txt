zerone a chip_seq discretizer for multiple replicates with built in quality_control motivation chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq is the standard method to investigate chromatin protein composition as the number of community available chip_seq profiles increases it becomes more common to use data from different sources which makes joint analysis challenging issues such as lack of reproducibility heterogeneous quality and conflicts between replicates become evident when comparing datasets especially when they are produced by different laboratories results here we present zerone a chip_seq discretizer with built in quality_control zerone is powered by a hidden_markov with zero inflated negative multinomial emissions which allows it to merge several replicates into a single discretized profile to identify low quality or irreproducible data we trained a support_vector and integrated it as part of the discretization process the result is a classifier reaching accuracy in detecting low quality profiles we also introduce a graphical_representation to compare discretization quality and we show that zerone achieves outstanding accuracy finally on current hardware zerone discretizes a chip_seq experiment on mammalian_genomes in about min using less than mb of memory availability_and zerone is available as a command_line and as an r package the c source_code and r scripts can be downloaded from https github com nanakiksc zerone the information to reproduce the benchmark and the figures is stored in a public docker image that can be downloaded from https hub docker com r nanakiksc zerone one of the major challenges of biology is to understand how transcription_factors and chromatin proteins coordinate transcription replication and repair in front of this colossal task the community invests massive research_efforts into collecting protein genome interaction data chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq has become the standard method to identify the targets of a transcription_factor or a histone_modification in a cell_population however chip is not fully understood and artifacts are still discovered more than years after its adoption as a standard besides the constant improvement of sequencing_technologies makes analysis of chip_seq profiles difficult to standardize there is thus a need to continuously develop and improve computational_tools to analyze chip_seq one of the most common analyses performed on chip_seq profiles is to discretize the signal i e identify the loci where the transcription_factor or other feature is present this makes the signal simpler to interpret it removes part of the experimental_noise it simplifies downstream_analyses and it allows comparing or combining profiles of different natures this raises a challenge at the computational level because discretization has to be carried_out uniformly for signals that may be very different for instance lamins bind in megabase scale domains covering of the genome whereas transcription_factors may bind as few as bp with a coverage below large consortia such as encode have brought to light severe issues related to the quality of chip_seq conflicts between replicates are common and sometimes laboratory effects are clearly detectable in the data even when experimentalists use the same material and follow the same protocol our unpublished observations the most popular remedy is to use a metric called idr irreproducible discovery rate which allows weeding out poorly reproducible signal this approach is a significant step_forward but the idr is undefined when more than two replicates are available besides keeping only the reproducible chip_seq is not always the best option if one of the replicates is mislabelled for instance it is more appropriate to reject the dataset than to keep the common_peaks in summary how to integrate chip_seq from different sources and with variable qualities is still an open_problem here we propose an approach to discretize chip_seq where conflict_resolution and quality_control are integrated in a tool that we called zerone pronounced ziroun or zi ron i e as inserting ear in zone the key idea of zerone is to combine an arbitrary number of chip_seq replicates in a single discretized profile where conflicts are resolved by maximizing the likelihood of the underlying statistical_model following discretization zerone controls the quality of its output in order to detect potential anomalies and when applicable rejects the output as a whole internally the first step implements a hidden_markov hmm with zero inflated negative multinomial zinm emissions and the second implements a support_vector svm trained using encode chip_seq hmm_based discretization is agnostic about the shape of the signal broad domains or sharp peaks and the zinm distribution captures the essential features of the read_count distribution in chip_seq zerone is designed for large_volume pipelines aiming to combine many chip_seq profiles with little human intervention to this end it is compatible with the standard bed sam bam and gem formats it produces congruent window based outputs and it can process hundreds of experiments per day on average hardware we benchmarked zerone against macs bayespeak and jamm on the core task of discretizing chip_seq profiles of ctcf and h_k our results show that zerone is competitive in terms of speed and accuracy
