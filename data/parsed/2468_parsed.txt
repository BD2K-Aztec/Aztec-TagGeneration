inferring the perturbation time from biological time course data motivation time course data are often used to study the changes to a biological_process after perturbation statistical_methods have been developed to determine_whether such a perturbation induces changes over time e g comparing a perturbed and unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences however existing_methods do not provide a principled statistical_approach to identify the specific time when the two time course datasets first begin to diverge after a perturbation we call this the perturbation time estimation of the perturbation time for different variables in a biological_process allows us to identify the sequence of events following a perturbation and therefore provides valuable insights into likely causal_relationships results we propose a bayesian_method to infer the perturbation time given time course data from a wild_type and perturbed system we use a non parametric approach based on gaussian_process we derive a probabilistic_model of noise corrupted and replicated time course data coming from the same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the perturbation time the likelihood_function can be worked out exactly for this model and the posterior_distribution of the perturbation time is obtained by a simple histogram approach without recourse to complex approximate inference algorithms we validate the method on simulated_data and apply it to study the transcriptional change occurring in arabidopsis following inoculation with pseudomonas syrin gae pv tomato dc versus the disarmed strain dc hrpa gene_expression time profiles can reveal important information about cellular function and gene_regulation see e g a common experimental_design is to perturb a biological system either before or during a time course experiment in this case a fundamental problem is to identify the precise perturbation time when a genes time profile is first altered in this paper we present an exactly tractable bayesian_inference procedure to infer the perturbation time by comparing perturbed and wild_type gene_expression ordering genes by their perturbation time gives valuable insight into the likely causal sequence of events following a perturbation we demonstrate the applicability of our method by studying the timing of transcriptional changes in arabidopsis_thaliana leaves following inoculation with the v c the author published_by we have introduced a fully bayesian_approach to infer the initial point where two gene_expression time profiles diverge using a novel gp regression_approach we model the data as noise corrupted samples coming from a shared function prior to some perturbation time after which it splits into two conditionally independent functions the full posterior_distribution of the perturbation point is obtained through a simple histogram approach providing a straightforward method to infer the divergence time between two gene_expression time profiles under different conditions the proposed method is applied to a study of the timing of transcriptional changes in a thaliana under a bacterial_challenge with a wild_type and disarmed strain analysis of differences in the gene_expression between strains is shown to be informative about the immune_response many transcriptional perturbation experiments are focused on a single perturbation however multiple perturbations occurring at different times or a single perturbation targeting many conditions will be needed to unmask complex gene regulatory strategies an interesting future line of research would be the development of gp covariance structures to uncover the ordering of events under these more general scenarios
