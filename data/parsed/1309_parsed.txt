delly structural variant discovery by integrated paired_end and split_read analysis motivation the discovery of genomic structural_variants svs at high_sensitivity is an essential requirement for characterizing naturally_occurring variation and for understanding pathological somatic rearrangements in personal genome sequencing_data of particular interest are integrated methods that accurately identify simple and complex rearrangements in heterogeneous sequencing_datasets at single_nucleotide as an optimal basis for investigating the formation mechanisms and functional consequences of svs results we have developed an sv discovery method called delly that integrates short insert paired ends long_range mate_pairs and split read_alignments to accurately delineate genomic_rearrangements at single_nucleotide delly is suitable for detecting copy_number variable deletion and tandem duplication_events as well as balanced rearrangements such as inversions or reciprocal translocations delly thus enables to ascertain the full spectrum of genomic_rearrangements including complex events on simulated_data delly compares_favorably to other sv prediction_methods across a wide_range of sequencing parameters on real_data delly reliably uncovers svs from the genomes_project and cancer_genomes and validation experiments of randomly_selected deletion loci show a high_specificity genomic structural_variants svs including gains_and of dna_segments and balanced rearrangements are a major form of variation in the human_genome polymorphic svs are a major contributor to common traits including common diseases whereas rare svs present in the germline are the cause of many rare genomic disorders furthermore somatic structural_rearrangements often highly complex play_a in the development of aggressive cancers a critical first step in associating svs with phenotypes is the discovery and precise mapping of these dna sequence_variants to whom correspondence should be addressed the introduction of massively_parallel mps technologies has led to considerable advances in the discovery and genotyping of structural_variants in the germline and in somatic_cells several complementary approaches have been developed to leverage mps data for sv discovery these include methods using the analysis of abnormally mapping pairs of mps fragments socalled paired_end methods read_depth analysis that detects svs by analyzing the read_depth of coverage split_read analysis that evaluates gapped sequence_alignments to detect svs and sequence_assembly that enables the discovery of novel sequence insertions a recent survey of svs in human_genomes by the genomes projects gp sv analysis group reported over svs based on these four sv discovery approaches in the gp pilot_phase paired_end made the comparably largest contribution to this list of reported svs however only approaches that combined two complementary signatures for sv discovery by integrating paired_end and read_depth analysis met the prespecified specificity threshold of a false_discovery fdr recently the parameters at which genomes are sequenced by mps have considerably changed although most reads in the gp pilot_phase had a length of bp the average read_length used in the projects main phase and in current cancer genome_projects has increased by fold bp at the same time the number of reads is reduced by fold to yield comparable sequence_coverage furthermore several large_scale genome studies have begun to generate paired_end libraries with two different insert_sizes one library is usually smaller than bp and the other commonly referred to as a mate_pair library is typically larger than kb and up to kb to facilitate sensitive sv_detection across a widened sv size spectrum and in repetitive areas of the genome these changes in sequencing parameters and strategy significantly affect sv discovery splitread analysis methods should benefit from relatively long_reads whereas read counting_methods are expected to suffer from a fold reduction in the number of sequenced_reads compared to readdepth and paired_end analysis split_read analysis has so_far been limited to the detection of small svs as well as svs in unique genomic_regions devoid of repeats and segmental_duplications most importantly certain classesof svs including tandem_duplications inversions translocations and particularly highly complex events are not yet sensitively ascertained in split_read based analyses herein we report a new integrative approach called delly that combines short range and long_range paired_end and splitread analysis for the discoveryat single nucleotide resolutionof balanced and unbalanced forms of structural_variation i e deletions tandem_duplications inversions and translocations achieving_high sensitivity_and throughout the genome and for svs falling into a wide size spectrum thereby delly has been specifically geared towards enabling sv calling in the presence of different paired_end libraries with distinct insert_sizes to our knowledge no single sv_detection approach presently offers such integrative sv calling at nucleotide_resolution in mps data which is of relevance for assessing the origin and functional impact of svs in individual genome sequencing_efforts focused on germline or somatic genome_variation
