quality_control and preprocessing of metagenomic_datasets here we present prinseq for easy and rapid quality_control and data preprocessing of genomic and metagenomic_datasets summary_statistics of fasta and qual or fastq_files are generated in tabular and graphical form and sequences can be filtered reformatted and trimmed by a variety of options to improve downstream_analysis availability_and this open_source application was implemented in perl and can be used as a stand alone version or accessed online through a_user the source_code user help and additional information are available athigh throughput sequencing has revolutionized microbiology and accelerated genomic and metagenomic analyses however downstream sequence_analysis is compromised by low quality sequences sequence artifacts and sequence contamination eventually leading to misassembly and erroneous_conclusions these problems necessitate better tools for quality_control and preprocessing of all sequence_datasets for most next generation sequence_datasets the quality_control should include the investigation of length gc_content quality_score and sequence complexity distributions sequence duplication contamination artifacts and number of ambiguous bases in the preprocessing_step the sequence ends should be trimmed and unwanted sequences should be filtered here we describe an application able to provide graphical guidance and to perform filtering reformatting and trimming on fasta and qual or fastq_files the program is publicly_available through a_user and as a stand alone version the web_interface allows online analysis and data export for subsequent analysis prinseq allows scientists to efficiently check and prepare their datasets prior to downstream_analysis the web_interface is simple and user_friendly and the stand alone version allows offline analysis and integration into existing data_processing pipelines the results reveal whether the sequencing_experiment has succeeded whether the correct sample was sequenced and whether the sample contains any contamination from dna preparation or host the tool provides a computational resource able to handle the amount of data that nextgeneration sequencers are capable of generating and can place the process more within reach of the average research lab
