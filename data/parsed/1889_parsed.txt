from sets to graphs towards a realistic enrichment_analysis of transcriptomic systems motivation current gene_set approaches do not take interactions and associations between set members into account mutual activation and inhibition causing positive_and correlation among set members are thus neglected as a consequence inconsistent regulations and contextless expression changes are reported and thus the biological_interpretation of the result is impeded transcriptomic studies measure gene_expression in different conditions striking genes which are differentially_regulated between the conditions are of primary interest and investigated for common features and membership in group of genes which have the same function or belong to the same biochemical_pathway to whom correspondence should be addressed a first impression of similar behavior of genes can be achieved via clustering of genes the usually more effective overrepresentation analysis ora tests the overlap of a predefined group of genes and the set_of assuming the hypergeometrical distribution under the null_hypothesis the method is widely_accepted and has been subject to modifications of diverse visual and model related features see for an overview though the basic statistical principle remained_unchanged however criticize that the sampling procedure of ora is statistically invalid and leads to a hazardous interpretation of the resulting p value furthermore the concentration on the usually small group of significantly_differentially compared with the set of all the other usually thousands of genes analysed in the study that are ignored is not suitable for an investigation on a global scale both points of criticism are resolved in gene_set gsea as it uses a valid sampling procedure and computes over the whole scope of genes a kolmogorovsmirnov test_statistic is applied to test whether the ranks of the p values of the genes in the gene_set can be a sample from a uniform_distribution several modifications of gsea have been published see for an overview though ora and gsea are convenient in the analysis of genes that are independently expressed a serious problem arises when these methods are applied to gene_set definitions extracted from regulatory_networks and metabolic_pathways the assumption of independence among set members does not hold anymore genes are found to be correlated due to mechanisms of co regulation and co expression initial steps to deal with that problem include implicit accounting for the correlation_structure e g and integration of network_topology of undirected interaction networks e g based on these first efforts have proposed gene network enrichment_analysis gnea that uses ora to test for overrepresentation of gene_sets in transcriptionally affected subnetworks of a global interaction_network as the sign of gene_expression changes and the direction of regulatory_interactions are so_far not taken into account substantial features of the data are still ignored and the dynamics of the transcriptomic system are not realistically reflected activation and inhibition are essential regulatory_mechanisms in the transcriptional_machinery of the cell and are causes for up and down_regulation of particular genes although processes like post_translational and combinatorial_effects between regulatory proteinsin this work we presented gene graph enrichment_analysis ggea a novel algorithmic framework to detect increased agreement between positively and negatively_correlated expression_patterns of genes connected by activating and inhibiting edges in signed and directed transcriptional_networks the method exploits directed regulatory relations represented as fuzzy_logic rules to assess and identify graphs which maximize the consistency between the regulatory_network and the expression data ggea is a major improvement to current gene_set strategies as we found experimentally_validated regulatory_interactions not to be consistent per se with the expression data in top_ranked and statistically_significant result sets of these methods that was validated in a large_scale consistency study of e coli chips using the e coli regulondb currently the best curated regulatory_network for the investigation of consistency as set enrichment strategies ignore mutual regulation among set members we observed that activations and inhibitions are only average consistent with the gene_expression in these result sets even strong causal signals i e a regulator with differential_expression of high statistical_significance in pairwise directed regulations were frequently not properly reflected inhibitions were more seriously neglected than activations this is partly due to a data bias as there are more activations than inhibitions in the database hence more genes and thus also more significant genes are involved in activations just by chance as gene_set mainly computes upon the leading_edge of the ranked p value vector of genewise differential_expression see gene_sets with a majority of activating genes are more likely to be reported on the other hand we found activitations clearly better conserved than inhibitions across all experiments stored in the m d database for ggea we observed under consideration of this bias that activations were nearly optimally consistent and inhibitions were preserved in a large fraction of regulations ggea achieved the highest concordance between the regulation direction and the expression behaviour of the incorporated regulator and regulated target_gene it should be emphasized that ggea consistently aligned weak only moderately differentially_expressed signals which are usually not taken into account by set enrichment_methods that improved_sensitivity enables preference of weak but coherent regulations over strong but contextless signals this is expected to better reflect the nature of key cellular regulators as ggea exploits the consistency for the computation of its score we additionally carried_out a more independent benchmark to investigate how well statistically_significant expression changes of single genes can be explained by other set members as a measure of explainability we used the number of additional genes which were needed to connect significant members of a set to a regulatory_network we found this evaluation of particular interest as it tries to approximate the process of the human interpretation for all set enrichment_methods only a small amount of genes could be explained by other set members in a significant result and we observed frequently that several additional genes were needed implied is that set enrichment indeed indicates that there is something striking happening in a certain result set however conclusions whether observed expression changes are coherent and in context with the surrounding regulators cannot be drawn this is resolved by ggea it systematically reports more easily explainable sets than all other methods and the fraction of explainable sets with a single additional gene is increased by over in comparison with the best set enrichment method furthermore we applied ggea in two pilot case studies of human neuronal tumours using regulatory_interactions of signalling_pathways though incorporated proteinprotein regulations cannot be measured at the transcriptional level nonetheless we again hypothesize that genes annotated to be associated in a pathway should show higher correlation patterns than arbitrary genes which are not on the other hand we argue that signal cascades normally target altered gene_regulation on the glioma dataset ggea discovered throughout specific and disease related pathways induced by increasing specificity the fraction of false_positives decreases unspecific and inconsistent pathways are replaced by more appropriate pathways an example is the detection of the neurotrophin signalling_pathway that modulates i we showed in three independent and differently designed studies that ggea consistently aligns regulation and expression and yields result sets where statistically_significant expression changes can be explained by regulators within the set moreover ggea eases the biological_interpretation of reported gene_sets as they are more coherent than sets reported by set enrichment_methods this means many more of their relevant_genes are connected or can be connected by a minimum number of additional factors in summary our new method ggea is an intuitive enrichment method which uses gene regulatory information to improve consistency and coherence of detected enriched_gene and thus substantially reduces the fraction of false_positive classifications of relevant gene_sets ggea significantly_improves the detection of gene_sets where measured positively or negatively_correlated expression_patterns coincide with directed inducing or repressing relationships between the respective pairs of genes hence gene_set regulators such as transcription_factors can explain a significant portion of the observed expression changes as ggea is as fast and easy to apply to experimental_data as state of the art set enrichment_analysis methods it provides an alternative for interpreting gene_expression and for deriving first insights into the relevant processes the advantages of ggea will increase in the future with the availabilty of better grns and better models for regulatory relations in these grns
