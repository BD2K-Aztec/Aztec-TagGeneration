structural_bioinformatics prediction of contact matrix for protein_protein motivation prediction of proteinprotein_interaction has become an important part of systems_biology in reverse_engineering the biological_networks for better understanding the molecular_biology of the cell although significant progress has been made in terms of prediction_accuracy most computational_methods only predict whether two proteins interact but not their interacting residuesthe information that can be very valuable for understanding the interaction mechanisms and designing modulation of the interaction in this work we developed a computational_method to predict the interacting residue pairscontact matrix for interacting protein_domains whose rows and columns correspond to the residues in the two interacting domains respectively and whose values or indicate whether the corresponding residues do or do not interact results our method is based on supervised_learning using support_vector for each domain involved in a given domaindomain interaction ddi an interaction profile hidden_markov iphmm is first built for the domain_family and then each residue position for a member domain sequence is represented as a dimension vector of fisher scores characterizing how similar it is as compared with the family profile at that position each element of the contact matrix for a sequence pair is now represented by a feature_vector from concate nating the vectors of the two corresponding residues and the task is to predict the element value or from the feature_vector a support_vector is trained for a given ddi using either a consensus contact matrix or contact matrices for individual sequence pairs and is tested by leave_one the performance averaged over a set of ddis collected from the did database shows significant_improvement sensitivity up to and specificity up to as compared with a multiple_sequence based method sensitivity and specificity previously_reported in the literature contact proteinprotein_interaction ppi plays_a in cellular_functions and the prediction of ppi has become an important part of systems_biology in reverse_engineering the biological_networks for better understanding the molecular_biology of the cell the cost and time of experimental_approaches to determining ppi remain_high and thus have motivated development of computational_methods despite significant progress in prediction_accuracy most computational_methods only predict whether two proteins interact but do not tell which amino_acids on these two proteins actually interactthe very information that can be extremely_valuable for further understanding the interaction mechanisms and hence for designing modulation of the interaction via mutagenesis it is therefore desirable to develop computational_methods that can predict the contact matrix for interacting protein_domains to indicate which residue pairs interact ppi requires some compatibility between the interacting_partners in terms of structure electrostatics and other properties which shall be conserved during evolution due to the selection_pressure and ultimately manifest themselves to certain degrees in the amino_acid of the domain_sequences that make up the interaction interface it is such compatibility that most computational_methods are trying to establish by looking at features in protein_sequences and structures to predict the ppi the conservation of interface sequences leads to the use of interacting domains as surrogate of ppi although ppi can not always be reliably predicted just based on interacting domainsbecause for instance in the presence of multi domains combination of domains may block interactions that would be otherwise implicated if solely based on individual domain interactions nevertheless domaindomain interaction ddi provides a useful perspective to studying ppi and is adequate for our purpose here which is to predict the contact matrix for proteins that are known to interact via certain domains specifically pairs of interacting_proteins will be organized in groups of domain domain interacting ddi families each member of such a family is an interacting_protein pair whose interaction_occurs through the association of a pair of domains an interface that is common to all the members of the family even though substantial variance might exist between the whole protein_complexes to which the protein pairs belong such as their folded_state cellular function etc these ddis form a relatively large and stable interface of on average identifying residues from the domain_sequences that reside on the interface would provide the training data needed for developing a computational_method with predictive_power several groups have published work in organizing and standardizing known ddis the did database is among the most successful and widely used ones this database identifies all cases of ddis of known three_dimensional structure by first assigning pfam domains to each individual protein in the protein_data pdb next the atomic contacts between domains in the same structure are computed where a pair of interacting residues are defined by requiring one or more of hydrogen_bonds no distances salt_bridges no distances or van_de waals interactions cc distances a ddi is called when at least five of these contacts exist between a pair of domains as of march did collected a total of distinct ddi families where each family has on average different pdb complexes in which the corresponding ddi was observed shows a graphical_representation of the contact matrix for a ddi family in the top left panel there are four protein_complexes each with a pair of interacting sequence chains the complexes are not in general homogeneous but in the interface region all of them do exhibit a similar shape this is because for each one of the protein pairs the interaction_occurs through domain a in the sequences marked red and through domain b in the sequences marked green therefore since in the domain a region of all the red sequences there is high sequence_conservation they can be aligned in a multiple_sequence msa a and the same happens to the domain b region of the green sequences msa b the matrix in the bottom right panel is the contact matrix of the ddi family the black dots in the matrix show those positions in the three_dimensional complexes where physical interactions_occur between the protein pairs note that these residueresidue interactions do not necessarily occur in all the complexes in the family for instance i is observed only in complexes and i only happens in complex whereas i happens in all the four complexes such a representation of a ddi had previously been used into predict specificity of sh proteins binding to their ligands where the domain b would correspond to the sh_domain and the domain a to the binding ligand peptide as an intermediate step toward inferring the binding for a new sequence pair each sequence will be aligned to the corresponding msa and a consensus contact matrix will be used to determine the contacting residues although this method seems to be reasonable and straightforward to implement and had worked well in enhancing the inference of the sh_domain specificity its performance as a predictor for protein contact matrix is poor as shown in the results when applied to the did data primarily due to its rigid reliance on the multiple_sequence proposed a method to construct the consensus contact matrix for a large number of homologue pairs without using structural_information but only sequence_variations as measured by the so_called direct information which is computed by maximum_entropy with constraints of matching the observed occurrence frequencies of amino_acids being able to differentiate direct couplings of amino_acids from transitive couplings the method shows remarkable improvement in specificity as compared with similar method of using the mutual_information based on observed occurrence frequencies yet being unsupervised the method does not address particularly how to predict the contact matrix for a give pair of sequences other than having them as members in the msas and then use the consensus contact matrix as the predicted contact matrix in this work we developed a computational_method to predict more accurately the contact matrix for interacting protein_domains by i incorporating the structural_information of the interface with interaction profile_hidden iphmms over msas ii tapping into the more subtle features present in the domain sequence with the use of fisher scores over a simple alignment and iii using support_vector for a supervised_learning over the use of a family consensus contact matrix which is often dependent on the initial multiple_sequence and the voting mechanism used to get the consensus the performance from the leave oneout cross_validation averaged over ddis for both methods shows significant_improvement as compared with a multiple_sequence based method previously_reported in the literature we have shown in this work that the contact matrix for a pair of interacting_proteins can be predicted with high_accuracy by combining sequence structural and evolutionary_information in an integrative manner as captured in the iphmms for the two protein_domain of these interacting_proteins by devising fisher score vectors to represent amino_acids at the interacting domains our method is capable of extracting characteristic_features without constraining the residues in the rigid multiple_sequence used in the previous methods this enables our method to handle residues corresponding to delete and insert states and allows for a supervised_learning on individual contact points eliminating the need of a consensus contact matrix for the domain families which has been a main source for false predictions while designed for predicting contact points between interacting protein_domains the method may be useful as a module in protein_folding and docking in which a recent_study that the co evolution couplings distinguished from the noise set of observed correlation using maximum_entropy provide an excellent indicator for residueresidue proximity in folded structures as future work we will investigate how to adapt the maximum_entropy model into the framework of iphmm fisher svm for further improvement in accuracy
