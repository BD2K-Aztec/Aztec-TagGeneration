sequence_analysis readscan a fast and scalable pathogen discovery program with accurate genome relative_abundance estimation kingdom_of readscan is a highly scalable parallel program to identify non host sequences of potential pathogen origin and estimate their genome relative_abundance in high_throughput sequence_datasets readscan accurately classified human and viral_sequences on a million_reads simulated dataset in min using a small beowulf compute cluster with nodes supplementary_material the idea of computational subtraction of human_host sequences to identify microbial sequences was first implemented on amazon ec elastic compute cloud environment in the form of software pathseq an alternative open_source workflow available on desktop computers was recently provided by rapid identification of non human sequences rins more recently a platform called capsid to store and visualize the identified non human sequences was described we present readscan a highly scalable and efficient tool to analyze ultra high volume of data produced by the latest sequencers like illumina_hiseq http www illumina com systems hiseq systems ilmn that can produce billion short_reads in a single run readscan uses the data parallelism in the sequenced_reads and effectively distributes the processing on multiple central_processing cpu s readscans core alignment procedure on multiple known references is based on smalt h postingl personal communication http www sanger ac uk resources software smalt a fast and accurate short read_mapper that works for a range of sequencing_platforms e g illumina roche applied_biosystems solid readscan is highly portable to work on a dual core laptop computer with as small as gb_memory to a large beowulf cluster with s of compute nodes readscan reports the genome relative_abundance gra of those identified non host microbial sequences implemented based on a proven finite mixture_model and expectation_maximization the results are ranked in the order of most to least abundant species grouped by national_center ncbi taxonomical tree the software performs an alignment based assembly to report the length of the region covered by the reads and weighted mean length of such contigs produced as a result this serves as a useful metric in assessing the truepositive results and also eliminates the need for an assembly program for microbial sequences with known reference_genomes
