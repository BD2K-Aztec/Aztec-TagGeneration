starcode sequence_clustering based on all pairs search motivation the increasing throughput of sequencing_technologies offers new applications and challenges for computational_biology in many of those applications sequencing_errors need to be corrected this is particularly important when sequencing_reads from an unknown reference such as random dna_barcodes in this case error_correction can be done by performing a pairwise_comparison of all the barcodes which is a computationally complex problem results here we address this challenge and describe an exact algorithm to determine which pairs of sequences lie within a given levenshtein distance for error_correction or redundancy reduction purposes matched_pairs are then merged into clusters of similar sequences the efficiency of star code is attributable to the poucet search a novel implementation of the needlemanwunsch algorithm performed on the nodes of a trie on the task of matching random barcodes starcode outper forms sequence clustering_algorithms in both speed and precision availability_and the c source_code is available atall sequencing_technologies have a certain degree of imprecision for instance the illumina_platform has a error_rate consisting of substitutions and the pacbio platform has a error_rate consisting of insertions_and the enormous throughput of such technologies has recently created additional needs for developing_efficient error_correction algorithms sequencing_errors can be discovered by comparing the reads to a reference_genome however such a reference is not always available when the sequences are random or taken from an unknown source clustering is the main strategy to correct the errors for instance this situation arises when using random barcodes to track cells or transcripts sequencing_errors will create erroneous nonexistent barcodes that have to be removed sequence_clustering can be viewed as a community detection problem on graphs where nodes represent sequences and edges represent matches between related sequences the process consists of a matching phase the most computationally_intensive where the graph is constructed and a clustering phase where communities are identified here we describe a sequence clustering_algorithm called starcode in reference to clusters of random barcodes which typically have a star shape starcode is based on all pairs search i e all the pairs of sequences below a given levenshtein distance are identified during the graph construction phase matching is carried_out by lossless filtration followed by an exhaustive_search on the branches of a prefix trie the novelty of the algorithm is the poucet strategy which uses the redundancy of alphabetically sorted sequences to avoid_unnecessary recomputations and gain speed in this article we present and benchmark starcode we show that on real_biological starcode is orders_of than existing sequence_clustering software even though starcode was designed for error_correction we also show that it can be
