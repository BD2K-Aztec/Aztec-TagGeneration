genome_analysis miss a non linear methodology based on mutual_information for genetic_association in both population and sib pairs analysis motivation finding association between genetic_variants and phenotypes related to disease has become an important vehicle for the study of complex_disorders in this context multi loci genetic_association might unravel additional information when compared with single loci search the main goal of this work is to propose a non linear methodology based on information_theory for finding combinatorial association between multi snps and a given phenotype results the proposed methodology called miss mutual_information statistical_significance has been integrated jointly with a feature selection_algorithm and has been tested on a synthetic dataset with a controlled phenotype and in the particular case of the f gene the miss methodology has been contrasted with a multiple_linear mlr method used for genetic_association in both a population_based study and a sib pairs analysis and with the maximum_entropy conditional_probability modelling mecpm method which searches for predictive multi_locus interactions several sets of snps within the f gene region have been found to show a significant correlation with the fvii levels in blood the proposed multi_site approach unveils combinations of snps that explain more significant information of the phenotype than their individual polymorphisms miss is able to find more correlations between snps and the phenotype than mlr and mecpm most of the marked snps appear in the literature as functional_variants with real effect on the protein fvii levels in blood availability the code is available atone of the main challenges of current genetic research is to study the association between genotypes and phenotypes and in to whom correspondence should be addressed particular to identify genetic_factors responsible for the heritability of complex_traits the two principal strategies for finding genetic_variants related to diseases are linkage_analysis and association studies linkage occurs when multiple_loci are physically related and are inherited together jointly with the disease linkage analyses take profit of this effect through measuring the cosegregation of the polymorphisms and a phenotype through a family or set of families genetic_association looks for correlations between two investigated factors typically a dna sequence_variability a genotype and a trait a phenotype in the last decades technological_advances in human_genetics have allowed association studies to work with large_numbers of genetic_markers association studies may be affected by the structure or homogeneity of the population under study in particular common genetic_information between relatives may introduce a bias in the data the main goal of family studies is to explore this dependence in order to extract additional information one of the first approaches for family association studies was the analysis of sib pairs that present more homogeneity of age and environment than other pairs of relatives and are relatively easy to ascertain however these methods have been extended to small pedigree nuclear families analysis and later on to extended families the genetic_variability represents around of the dna_sequence the genetic_variants are responsible for differences between individuals such as physical_appearance susceptibility to disease or response to medical_treatments among the different types of genetic_variants single_nucleotide snps are the most common type of genetic_variation used for the study of genetic_diseases snps are defined as single nucleotide positions in the genome where there is a mutation i e the substitution of one base by another which is observed in of the population it is assumed that at most one mutation could have occurred at a given locus in the short human evolution consequently only two of the four common nucleotides may be found in a given snp position the ancestral one a and the mutated one a some variations in the dna may be responsible for the development of diseases traditional genetic techniques have
