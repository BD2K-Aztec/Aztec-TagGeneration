computational discovery of pathway level genetic vulnerabilities in non_small motivation novel approaches are needed for discovery of targeted_therapies for non_small nsclc that are specific to certain patients whole_genome rnai screening of lung_cancer cell_lines provides an ideal source for determining candidate drug_targets results unsupervised_learning algorithms uncovered patterns of differential vulnerability across lung_cancer cell_lines to loss of functionally_related such genetic vulnerabilities represent candidate targets for therapy and are found to be involved in splicing translation and protein_folding in particular many nsclc_cell were especially sensitive to the loss of components of the lsm protein complex or the cct tric chaperonin different vulnerabilities were also found for different cell_line subgroups furthermore the predicted vulnerability of a single adenocarcinoma cell_line to loss of the wnt_pathway was experimentally_validated with screening of small_molecule wnt inhibitors against an extensive cell_line panel availability_and the clustering_algorithm is implemented in python and is freely_available at https bitbucket org youngjh nsclc paper contact non_small nsclc remains a significant healthcare burden despite recent_progress in drug_discovery recent fda_approved targeted_therapies are only intended for appropriate subpopulations of patients the drug xalkori crizotinib is highly_effective but only for of lung_cancer patients similarly iressa gefitinib and other egfr inhibitors target mutations found only in a portion of patients while the majority have the wild_type version compared with cytotoxic_chemotherapy targeted_therapy has the advantage of greater specificity however discovery and development of such agents requires the identification of druggable targets inhibitors of certain characteristic mutations such as kras g c and g d are still under extensive development for clinical use the heterogeneity of nsclc is another barrier confronting drug_discovery a number of v c the author published_by from a whole_genome rnai screen of nsclc_cell we identified candidate drug_targets in the form of genetic vulnerabilities specific to cell_line subgroups a couple of factors were considered when determining genetic vulnerabilities first given the heterogeneity of nsclc gene_deletions that are almost universally toxic across the cell_line panel would likely be toxic to other normal human cells as well in addition it is desirable to specifically target lung cancer_cells but not normal cells yet only one cell_line in the panel was from a non cancerous normal lineage this suggests that in the interest of specificity the number of cell_lines constituting a genetic_vulnerability should not be too large on the other hand a vulnerability consisting of a single cell_line may be less likely to generalize to an appreciable number of patients therefore the challenge stems from identifying groups of genes to which some but not all nsclc_cell are especially dependent ideally these cell_lines would represent a particular patient subpopulation another challenge was to avoid a combinatorially intractable problem of having to examine all possible combinations of cell_lines against all possible combinations of genes novel applications of unsupervised_learning algorithms were developed to overcome these challenges to prioritize potential nsclc targets from rnai sensitivities the general workflow of this study is outlined in from the whole_genome rnai screen on nsclc_cell and one normal epithelial line we extracted knockdown sensitivity_profiles for selected gene_sets each gene_set was clustered scored and computational discovery of pathway level genetic vulnerabilities in nsclcranked by statistical_significance the clustering score measures the degree to which the cell_lines segregate into sensitive and resistant groups upon knockdown of genes in the set gene_sets with a clear segregation of sensitive and resistant lines are termed bimodal it is imperative that our scoring_scheme prioritizes such bimodal sets over other patterns of rnai sensitivity that would be less desirable as a candidate drug_target for example gene_sets that are all toxic or half toxic are undesirable due to predicted toxicity beyond those in our cell_line panel in addition gene_sets that are largely resistant or having a random_pattern of sensitivity clearly would not be desired as well collectively the protein_complexes we discovered to be nsclc genetic vulnerabilities span various cellular_processes including splicing translation and protein_folding it is natural to ask how they fit in with currently established cancer_therapies and whether known drugs could be repurposed for these complexes clearly they contrast with hormonal_therapy or the usual mitotic targets of cytotoxic_chemotherapy it turns out that some of the strongest genetic vulnerabilities are known targets of small_molecules arsenic_trioxide as o targets the tric cct complex and has been used to treat_acute promyelocytic_leukemia in patients who did not respond well to other types of chemotherapy as o can perhaps be repurposed for nsclc particularly for patients whose tumors bear similarity to the sensitive cell_line subgroups identified from the means clustering analysis several studies have evaluated the effect of as o in human lung primary_fibroblasts and in the lung_cancer cell_lines a and h collectively they suggest that h is markedly more sensitive to as o than lung_fibroblasts consistent with the cct complex vulnerability we observed we also identified the proteasome as a candidate nsclc drug_target and recently proteasome_inhibitors have been investigated as anti_cancer one such inhibitor is velcade bortezomib which has been fda_approved for multiple_myeloma bortezomib has shown to be effective in combination with other chemotherapy_agents for nsclc and has been evaluated in clinical_trials for nsclc as well this also suggests that newer and more specific proteasome_inhibitors such as kyprolis carfilzomib could be efficacious for patients with nsclc in addition translation and splicing emerged as strong genetic vulnerabilities from the means analysis previously translation has been proposed as a potential target in cancer moreover eif is known to be overexpressed in lung_cancers and ectopic expression of five eif subunits has been shown to transform immortalized fibroblasts into malignant_cells notably in our study we found that knockdown of four of those five subunits strongly sensitizes six of the nsclc_cell in our panel while an immortalized epithelial line is comparatively unaffected the splicing apparatus has been suggested as a cancer target as well of the splicing associated protein_complexes discovered from the means analysis the sf b component of u snrnp is known to be targeted by a number of small_molecule compounds both the pladienolides and meayamycin target sf b and the latter has been shown to be more deleterious in human_lung than normal lung_fibroblasts some of the nsclc genetic vulnerabilities that were found by our computational_analysis include protein_complexes that may appear to be entirely essential it is perhaps surprising that certain cell_lines are largely resistant to knockdown of many of these genes one explanation may simply be a result of the strict thresholding of the rnai data to produce binary readings of cell_line viability which could be affected by the sensitivity of the assay another explanation may be provided by essential gene moonlighting and flipping of protein complex essentiality between distantly_related it was shown that certain protein_complexes almost completely flip essentiality between saccharomyces_cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces_pombe a similar phenomenon may be occurring among our nsclc cell_line panel although the cell_lines are not necessarily distantly_related they likely differ sufficiently due to different mutational compositions different yeast_species flip protein complex essentiality as a result of adaptations to differing needs and environments a phenomenon likely common to cancer_cells as well moreover particular nsclc_cell are largely resistant to loss of most but not all members of certain protein_complexes those genes that are mostly essential in both sensitive and insensitive cell_line subgroups could exhibit moonlighting behavior by having multiple functions in both essential and nonessential processes the nsclc genetic vulnerabilities uncovered by the computational_analysis described here extends an earlier study in uncovering additional potential targets for therapy that were not previously_reported while our study shares the general aim of identifying genetic vulnerabilities we exclusively focus on identification of biological_systems such as protein_complexes that certain lung_cancers are especially dependent upon our results also present a complementary viewpoint to the project achilles effort in analyzing whole_genome rnai knockdown of cancer_cells one goal from project achilles was to discover genes that simultaneously had partial copy_number loss and were essential to cancer_cells interestingly the results from that analysis found single gene vulnerabilities in splicing translation and the proteasome as well one such vulnerability was lsm which is a part of the lsm complex a key difference is that the nsclc vulnerabilities presented here are from the viewpoint of looking not only at single genes but biological_systems such as protein_complexes in contrast with previous_analyses we obtain cell_line subgroups that may represent particular patient populations along with candidate targets for each of those subgroups
