comparison of approaches for parameter identifiability analysis of biological_systems motivation modeling of dynamical_systems using ordinary_differential is a popular_approach in the field of systems_biology the amount of experimental_data that are used to build and calibrate these models is often limited in this setting the model_parameters may not be uniquely determinable structural or a priori identifiability is a property of the system equations that indicates whether in principle the unknown model_parameters can be determined from the available data results we performed a case study using three current approaches for structural identifiability analysis for an application from cell_biology the approaches are conceptually different and are developed independently the results of the three approaches are in agreement we discuss strength and weaknesses of each of them and illustrate how they can be applied to real_world problems availability_and for application of the approaches to further applications code representations daisy mathematica and matlab for benchmark model and data are provided on the authors webpage the dynamics of cellular_processes such as signal_transduction can be described by models consisting of ordinary_differential odes we used a model of il induced jak_stat to present a comprehensive comparison of three approaches for structural identifiability analysis mathematically such dynamical_models can be characterized by the ode xt fxt ut h with x x gh in this case the vector of state_variables xt describes the dynamics of molecular_components involved in the jak_stat for details see equation the function ut represents possibly time dependent experimental_treatments in this case it represents a constant treatment with the cytokine il the vector h contains all parameters of the dynamical_model such as the reaction rate_constants for a specific cell_type or biological_context the parameters h are often not available from literature and have to be estimated from experimental_data the initial_concentrations x can be known or unknown in the latter case they have to be estimated from experimental_data as well each possible measurement is mathematically represented by a functional_mapping yt hxt ut h that might include additional parameters and thus increase the dimension of h such as scaling parameter for relative data obtained by immunoblotting in our case the inference problem of concern is the determination of the model_parameters h from the measurements y and inputs u described by equation in general this may not be possible structural or a priori identifiability bellman and a stromstrom is a property of the systems and that guarantees that the unknown model_parameters can in principle be determined from generic input and output functions of the model provided they satisfy certain minimal conditions called persistence of excitation for a broad introduction and classical approaches structural identifiability is a prerequisite and necessary condition for any estimation procedure to render the recovery of h from inputoutput measurements as a well posed problem and to return meaningful_results about h well known approaches to structural identifiability analysis often have problems with the realistically sized models but there are approaches that can handle them let us consider a simple model for the illustration of structural identifiability the model describes a transition between two componentswe assume that x and x and only the measurement y t x t are available in this case we can solve for to whom correspondence should be addressed shows that and are structurally non identifiable and only the product of and are structurally identifiable such redundant parameterization can be detected directly for very simple examples for analysis of realistic models one has to resort to more sophisticated approaches we compared three current conceptually different approaches for identifiability analysis using the model and data of raia et_al we present results on the identifiability for the benchmark model using the three approaches described in the section thethe results of all three approaches are in good agreement for the benchmark application considered here five of parameters are consistently classified as structurally non identifiable the procedure to reproduce and interpret the results obtained by each of the three approaches was presented and can serve as reference for further application the strength of the daisy approach is to check for global identifiability i e it checks the uniqueness of the parameter solution thus it is able to distinguish between global and local identifiability being based on differential algebra methods daisy can directly deal only with polynomial or rational functions f and h however the method can be generalized to deal with some non polynomial functions e g exponential functions although the program is usually very fast in the order of few seconds for complex models the algorithm may not successfullyterminate because of a lack of memory of the system in most cases however it is possible to simplify the calculations required by the algorithm by eliminating redundant model equations by hand this was done for the benchmark application considered here the main advantage of the ear approach is that it is fast and can handle large and complex systems the system analyzed in this article is considered small and simple for this approach systems on the scale of states and parameters can be handled one limitation of the ear approach is that it requires the vector valued functions f g and h to be rational functions of their arguments this limitation is not as restrictive as it may first sound however as it can be shown that any function which in itself is the solution to an equation such as can be handled through an extended state_space approach even if statements can be closely_approximated using rational functions the strength of the pl approach is that it does not pose any restrictions on the algebraic form of the model equations even non algebraic constructs such as if statements or constraints on the parameters or model dynamics can be handled it also allows for statements on practical identifiability and confidence_intervals besides the structurally non identifiable parameters six parameters are practically non identifiable considering the data available from however owing to the underlying parameter_estimation problem issues such as local_minima have to be handled with care in such case it might be necessary to repeat profile calculations for multiple minima detected in the objective_function to enhance robustness of the results likelihood profiles for all model_parameters the parameters are allowed to vary between and on a log scale the mle point is indicated by asterisks the red dashed_line corresponds to a threshold that indicates a confidence_level the points of pass over of profile and threshold determine likelihood_based confidence_intervals perfectly flat profiles reveal five structural non identifiable parameters cd mrna production socs accumulation socs mrna production scale cd mrna obs and scale socs mrna obs in addition profiles that have a unique minimum but do not cross the confidence threshold reveal six practically non identifiable parameters decoyr binding socs degradation socs translation prec degradation prec intern and scale pil ra obs the remaining parameters are both structurally and practically identifiable and have finite confidence intervalsthe presented approaches allow for comparable and reliable conclusions about structural identifiability and can readily be used in systems_biology applications software implementation of all approaches is freely_available it is important and good practice to double check results with different but comparable approaches here we provide a case study that can serve as reference and hand on guide to apply and interpret the results of three current approaches to structural identifiability analysis the results of identifiability analysis can be helpful to provide guidelines on how to simplify the model structure or design additional experiments that enhance the predictive_power of a mathematical_model all three approaches examined in this paper are useful for real application examples in many cases all three approaches work equally well but in some cases one of the three is preferred if the system is very large and or if the analysis must be fast then ear is the preferred approach if it is of importance to get truly global identifiability daisy is the preferred approach if practical identifiability is important or if the equations include nonrational expressions like if statements then pl should be used using combinations of approaches can sometimes give the strengths of all approaches to the analysis
