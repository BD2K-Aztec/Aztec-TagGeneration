systems_biology inverse perturbation for optimal intervention in gene_regulatory motivation analysis and intervention in the dynamics of gene_regulatory is at the heart of emerging efforts in the development of modern treatment of numerous ailments including cancer the ultimate_goal is to develop methods to intervene in the function of living_organisms in order to drive cells away from a malignant state into a benign form a serious limitation of much of the previous work in cancer network_analysis is the use of external control which requires intervention at each time step for an indefinite time interval this is in sharp_contrast to the proposed approach which relies on the solution of an inverse perturbation problem to introduce a one time intervention in the structure of regulatory_networks this isolated intervention transforms the steady_state distribution of the dynamic system to the desired steady_state distribution results we formulate the optimal intervention problem in gene_regulatory as a minimal perturbation of the network in order to force it to converge to a desired steady_state distribution of gene_regulation we cast optimal intervention in gene_regulation as a convex_optimization thus providing a globally optimal_solution which can be efficiently computed using standard toolboxes for convex_optimization the criteria adopted for optimality is chosen to minimize potential adverse_effects as a consequence of the intervention_strategy we consider a perturbation that minimizes i the overall energy of change between the original and controlled networks and ii the time needed to reach the desired steady_state distribution of gene_regulation furthermore we show that there is an inherent trade_off between minimizing the energy of the perturbation and the convergence_rate to the desired distribution we apply the proposed control to the human melanoma gene_regulatory availability the matlab_code for optimal intervention in gene_regulatory can be found online http syen ualr edu nxbouaynaya bioinformatics html the cell maintains its function via an elaborate network of interconnecting positive_and of genes and proteins that send different signals to a large number of pathways and molecules understanding the dynamic_behavior of gene_regulatory is essential to advance_our of disease develop modern therapeutic methods and identify targets in the cell needed to reach a desired goal in classical biological_experiments cell function is ascertained based on rough phenotypical and genetic behavior on the other hand the use of dynamical system models allows one to analytically explore biological_hypotheses within this context investigators have sought to discover preferable stationary states the effect of distinct perturbations on gene dynamics and the dynamical function of genes the complexity of biological_systems and the noisy nature of the sampled data suggest the use of probabilistic methods for system modeling analysis and intervention markov_chain models have been shown to accurately emulate the dynamics of gene_regulatory in particular the dynamics of probabilistic boolean_networks pbns and dynamic_bayesian can be studied using markov_chains the long_run behavior of a dynamic_network is characterized by the steady_state distributions of the corresponding markov_chain it has been argued that steadystate distributions determine the phenotype or the state of the cell development such as cell_proliferation the long_run dynamic_properties of pbns and their sensitivity with respect to network perturbations were investigated in several manuscripts the ultimate objective of gene_regulatory modeling and analysis is to use the network to design effective intervention_strategies for affecting the network_dynamics in such a way as to avoid undesirable cellular_states as futuristic gene therapeutic_interventions various control strategies have been proposed to alter gene_regulatory dynamics in a desirable way biologically such alterations may be possible by the introduction of a factor or drug that alters the extant behavior of the cell current control strategies can be grouped into three main approaches i reboot the network by resetting its initial condition ii introduce external control variablesin this article we introduced a novel method for optimal intervention in gene_regulatory posed as an inverse perturbation problem the optimal perturbation has been derived such that theconverge toward the desired steady_state distribution d whereas q s converges toward d only for s a and b the parameterized family of perturbed matrices p s in equation results in a faster convergence toward the desired steady_state d at the expense of a higher norm energy of the perturbation matrix on the other hand the family of perturbed matrices q s in equation leads to a perturbation matrix with norm energy as small as desired but at the expense of not converging toward the desired steady_state for small s the distance between the steady_state of q s and the desired steady_state as a function of s is shown in c
