structural_bioinformatics fast accessibility based prediction of rna_rna motivation currently the best rnarna_interaction prediction_tools are based on approaches that consider both the inter and intramolecular interactions of hybridizing rnas while accurate these methods are too slow and memory hungry to be employed in genome_wide rna target scans alternative_methods neglecting intramolecular structures are fast enough for genome wide_applications but are too inaccurate to be of much practical use results a new approach for rnarna_interaction was developed with a prediction_accuracy that is similar to that of algorithms that explicitly consider intramolecular structures but running at least three orders_of than rnaup this is achieved by using a combination of precomputed accessibility profiles with an approximate energy_model this approach is implemented in the new version of rnaplex the software also provides a variant using multiple_sequences alignments as input resulting in a further increase in specificity the status of rna in molecular_biology has changed dramatically over the last decade instead of taking on a rather marginal role as messenger of genomic_information they are now considered as key regulatory_elements in a wide_spectrum of cellular_processes as of the number of known non coding rna_sequences reached an overwhelming million grouped into distinct families non_coding ncrnas frequently function by binding to other rnas for example snornas mediate pseudouridylation and methylation of rrnas and snrnas and can influence the splicing of pre mrnas ncrnas are also involved in the editing of other rna_sequences benne to whom correspondence should be addressed transcription and translation control sirna mirna strna or plasmid replication control while sirnas are often fully complementary to their targets most other ncrnas interact in a more intricate manner which does not involve perfect hybridization for example in escherichia_coli oxys which is involved in oxidative stress_response interacts with its target_mrna fhla through formation of a two sites kissing complex although there is statistical_evidence that a plethora of ncrnas interacts with other rnas the athanasius f targets remain_unknown for most of them the prediction of rnarna_interactions therefore has become an important field in computational_biology rnarna_interactions are primarily governed by the same types of hydrogen_bonds and stacking_interactions as rna secondary_structure the problem can therefore be tackled by similar algorithmic approaches and the same parametrization of the interaction_energies we may distinguish two distinct ways of addressing the rnarna_interaction problem the most straightforward way consists in concatenating both sequences and subsequently folding them as a pseudo single_sequence the precision of this kind of approach depends greatly on how the concatenation is handled the crudest approaches use linker sequences to connect both rna strands this can lead to erroneous structure_prediction as the linker may interfere with the interacting sequences alternatively a small modification of the folding algorithm keeps track of the concatenation point s and uses adjusted energy parameters for the loops in which the junctions occur a combinatorially different model known as rnarna_interaction problem rip covers a larger set of possible structures the second type of approaches conceptually decomposes the rna_hybridization process into two stages i the unfolding of the interacting regions of the two partners and ii the direct interaction of the exposed binding_sites in practice one first computes the probability of being unpaired for each region sequence interval in both sequences these probabilities are equivalent to the free_energy necessary to expose the regions in the second step the interaction_energy between each combinations of regions is evaluated this approach was of the ompamica hybrids predicted with and without considering intramolecular structures a hybrid structure predicted with rnaplex without considering the intramolecular structures of the rna_sequences the hybrid extends over and nucleotides on ompa and mica respectively and has an hybridization energy of kcal_mol still the energy needed to unfold both binding regions on ompa and mica amounts kcal_mol larger than the energy gained through binding b ompamica interaction predicted by rnaup ompamica hybrid is shown on the right hand side with the mica sequence represented by a bold line even though the hybrid is much smaller than the interaction in a it has a lower total interaction_energy ddg of kcal_mol due to the fact that the interacting regions are less structured in particular applied successfully to srnamrna interactions in bacteria while both types of algorithms proved useful in predicting the correct interaction structure of a ncrna with its known target they are computationally_expensive requiring at least o n m operations where n and m are the size of the target and query_sequences respectively and hence are impractical for genome_wide target predictions a drastic_reduction in computational_complexity can be achieved by omitting the computation of secondary_structures within the monomers as demonstrated by rnahybrid which runs in o mnl when restricting the maximum loop length to l rnaplex a conceptually very similar approach further reduces the time complexity to o mn by using a modified energy_model neglecting the internal_structure of the interacting sequences leads to a drastic decrease in specificity however see this issue is roughly addressed by rnaplex in that it mimics the effect of the competition between intra and intermolecular_interactions by adding a fixed per nucleotide penalty currently one therefore has to choose between precise but impractically slow methods or fast but imprecise methods for ncrna target search a situation that is quite unsatisfactory in this contribution we extend the rnaplex approach tafer and hofacker to tackle this problem we mimic the effect of the competition between intra and intermolecular_interactions by adding a position dependent per nucleotide penalty instead of a fixed penalty this penalty is derived from precomputed accessibility profiles produced by rnaplfold or rnaup more explicitly these profiles contain the probabilities that any subsequence of arbitrary length is unpaired in thermodynamic_equilibrium these probabilities are converted to free_energies that then enter as position dependent penalties in the computation of the interaction_energies preserving rnaplex o mn run time the main advantage is that the accessibility profiles can be precomputed and stored making this approach particularly attractive for largescale screening studies in addition we extended rnaplex so that it can also handle multiple_alignment this inclusion of comparative information into the target prediction process leads to a substantial increase in specificity as an application example we consider the genome_wide prediction of srna targets in e coli as a reference_set we use the experimentally confirmed interactions published by we expect that for a given srna the number of predicted interactions with other false_positive targets should decrease when accessibility of the target_mrna in included ideally it should reach the low levels observed for rnaup for each srna the amount of false_positives was estimated by counting genome_wide the number of srna target interactions that are more stable than the experimentally reported srna target duplex for each e coli genes a mrna of length nt including nt upstream and nt downstream of the start_codon were defined accessibility profiles were computed with rnaplfold with a folding windows option w of nt and a maximal base_pair distance of option l an interaction was reported if the corresponding srnamrna interaction_energy is smaller than the experimentally confirmed interaction and if it occurs in region encompassing nt nt upstream and nt downstream of the start_codon the inclusion of the accessibility profiles in the new version of rnaplex leads to a substantial improvement as can be seen from all native interaction sites are among the predictions and the detailed target_site localization is improved most importantly the number of predictions with better interaction_energies i e the false_positives is reduced to a level similar to that of rnaup in order to better assess the number_of the same method was applied on the dinucleotide shuffled srnas and mrnas to this end we compared the interaction_energy of the non shuffled experimentally confirmed interactions to the energy_distribution of the shuffled sequences interestingly in seven out of nine cases the number_of is smaller see_supplementary in the shuffled case than in the non shuffled one this can be explained by the fact that in various bacteria the region around the ribosomal entry site which is also the preferred region of srna binding is more accessible than the rest of the mrna see_supplementary this in turn implies that compared with shuffled sequences srnas have a greater chance to bind to the region around the start_codon in non shuffled mrnas depending on the ncrnas one can expect between false_positives per nucleotide for micc and false_positives for gcvb see_supplementary we presented a new version of rnaplex a tool designed to rapidly and reliably_predict rnarna_interactions compared with the previously_published version rnaplex now considers target_site accessibility by using accessibility profiles generated by rnaplfold to approximate the energy of removing a nucleotide from all intramolecular interactions the introduction of positionspecific structure dependent extension cost allows to greatly improve the specificity of rnaplex bringing it close to that of rnaup without modifying the linear run time of the original rnaplex clearly the main_feature of rnaplex is its run time efficiency on a dataset of ncrnas and target_mrnas on length rnaplex runs faster than rnaup without noticeably loss of specificity thus making ncrnas target searches more affordable in its present implementation rnaplex can be used not only to predict ncrna targets in small_genomes but can also be used to find mirna_targets and sirna off targets in large mammalian_genomes and transcriptomes and it can be applied to microarray probes design in contrast to rnaup or rnahybrid rnaplex can return suboptimal solutions efficiently on the fly without the need of recomputing the full recursion matrix the ability of rnaplex to perform comparative target search allows to discard poorly conserved interaction and to lend further credibility to interactions showing compensatory mutations based on a dataset of experimentally confirmed interactions we show that rnaplex in its present form is an useful tool to predict new srna targets we further show that suboptimal predictions from rnaplex may actually be real targets application of the comparative version
