hlaffy estimating peptide affinities for class hla molecules by learning position specific pair potentials motivation t cell epitopes serve as molecular keys to initiate adaptive_immune identification of t cell epitopes is also a key_step in rational vaccine_design most available methods are driven by informatics and are critically dependent on experimentally_obtained training data analysis of a training_set from immune epitope database iedb for several alleles indicates that the sampling of the peptide space is extremely sparse covering a tiny fraction of the possible non amer space and also heavily skewed thus restricting the range of epitope_prediction results we present a new epitope_prediction method that has four distinct computational modules i structural modelling estimating statistical pair potentials and constraint derivation ii implicit modelling and interaction profiling iii feature representation and binding_affinity prediction and iv use of graphical_models to extract peptide_sequence signatures to predict epitopes for hla_class conclusions hlaffy is a novel and efficient epitope_prediction method that predicts epitopes for any class hla allele by estimating the binding strengths of peptide hla complexes which is achieved through learning pair potentials important for peptide binding it relies on the strength of the mechanistic_understanding of peptide hla recognition and provides an estimate of the total ligand space for each allele the performance of hlaffy is seen to be superior to the currently available methods availability_and the method is made accessible through a webserver http pro line biochem iisc ernet in hlaffy recognition of short_peptides by hla molecules is a fundamental requirement for triggering t cell responses hla genes are highly_polymorphic forming hundreds of different alleles the alleles understandably have a common scaffold and exhibit variations in their peptide binding_pockets so that each allele preferentially_binds a distinct subset of peptides in an individual cells_expressing up to six different alleles are present each capable of recognizing a large number of peptides such multi specificity enables them to recognize a wide_array of the number of possible nonameric peptides that are theoretically possible is as high as billion experimental identification of such a large repertoire of epitopes for each allele is virtually_impossible making it important to have reliable and accurate methods for predicting epitopes for different alleles the need for powerful_methods to predict potential epitopes has become even more important as hundreds of bacterial and viral_genomes have been sequenced increasing the need for understanding their antigenicity profiles a number of methods have been developed for predicting t cell epitopes over the last two decades they can be broadly divided_into four classes as methods based on i sequence motif_detection ii empirical scoring_matrices and profiles implicitly encoding more complex sequence_patterns iii machine_learning applied to experimentally_determined data and iv structure based_methods the motif methods are the first to be developed among all the prediction_methods and are based on the identification of preferred amino_acid at different positions some positions which were identified as heavily contributing to recognition were termed anchor residues in the nonameric peptides the motifs or patterns describing the positions of the anchors and the residue preferences were derived for different alleles anchor motifs have been used to search for antigenic regions in sequences of infectious viruses bacteria and parasites the amino_acid preferences in these motifs however turn out to be an insufficient criteria for recognition leading to prediction_accuracies of only about although anchor residues contribute significantly to the hla_peptide large_scale analysis of experimental_data have shown that other residue positions on binder peptides contribute equally in stabilizing the peptide hla complex consequently new scoring_matrices were derived by analyzing experimentally_measured binding_affinities for hundreds of different peptides to each allele however these methods assume that the contribution of different residues were independent of each other and most models were additive in nature data_driven methods were developed to utilize available largescale experimental_data one such approach is regression_analysis that estimates the response function which in this case is binding_affinity from a given set of data and response variables generally using a polynomial function regression_analysis based_methods were used to obtain quantitative_prediction in terms of half_lives of dissociation of b microglobulin from the hla complex other machine_learning and qsar approaches that have been attempted include artificial_neural and hidden_markov that correlate measurable properties of different peptides with their binding_potential approaches that use explicit structural_information in general are believed to provide detailed insights into the process of peptide recognition thereby resulting in more accurate_predictions however progress in this direction has been very slow primarily because structural modelling is a computationally_intensive process rendering it feasible only on a small_scale more recently a method based on molecular_dynamics simulations and estimation of free_energy of binding between peptide and hla molecules has been attempted the applicability of this method is seen to be limited due to the amount of time each simulation requires methods that indirectly capture structural_information have also been used which show reasonable prediction_accuracies this work introduces a new method hlaffy for prediction of peptide hla binding_affinity the method stands on the strength of a mechanistic_model of peptide hla recognition distinct advantages of this method are i it uses structural_information explicitly ii it samples the naturally_occurring peptide space in bacteria and viruses systematically and hence is not restricted by available experimental_data iii it assigns weights to different interactions and through that it identifies important pair potentials and iv it uses a graphical_model to represent the epitope pool efficiently the method is implemented on a webserver made accessible at http pro line biochem iisc ernet in hlaffy in this study we present a new method hlaffy for predicting peptide ligands for hla class molecules based on a multi modulehlaffy peptide hla affinity predictionworkflow hlaffy first obtains a mechanistic_understanding of the recognition specificity and is capable of explaining experimentally_observed binding_affinities for a large dataset of peptides it then identifies the highest contributing pair potentials and learns crossresidue influences through graphical_models the implicit structural modelling is a new contribution towards understanding peptide recognition by hla molecules and estimating their binding strengths this leads to a phenomenal increase in coverage of the peptide space another novel aspect of this study is to obtain a high correlation of observed ic_values with interactions which has been possible because of weighting different interactions and estimating their relative_contributions through feature representation a high correlation implies that the ic_values can be rationalized from the structures of peptide hla complexes sequence_logos used widely in literature as a representation of the sequence_patterns of epitopes is an elegant method to identify individual residue preferences but are not directly useful for identifying inter residue dependencies besides these another contribution from the study is a novel design_strategy for constructing a representative peptide library the graphical_model used in this study is capable of capturing such dependencies systematically hlaffy with its ability to sample the peptide space more comprehensively opens up new possibilities to explore the repertoire of epitopes that can be recognized by a given allele providing estimates of the total epitope pool sizes for each allele the importance of predicting epitopes for hla molecules is well recognized in the field since it can be applied in diverse areas such as vaccine discovery understanding disease susceptibilities autoimmune_disorders and in estimating success of organ_transplants
