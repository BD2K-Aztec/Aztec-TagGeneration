genetics_and gwatoolbox an r package for fast quality_control and handling of genome_wide meta_analysis data the gwatoolbox is an r package that standardizes and accelerates the handling of data from genome_wide gwas particularly in the context of large_scale gwas meta_analyses a key feature of gwatoolbox is its ability to perform quality_control qc of any number of files in a matter of minutes the implemented workflow has been structured to check three particular data_quality aspects i data formatting ii quality of the gwas results and iii data consistency across studies output consists of an extensive list of quality statistics and plots which allow inspection of individual files and between study comparison to identify systematic_bias meta_analyses of genome_wide gwas have proven to be powerful_tools to uncover novel loci associated with a variety of complex_traits current gwas meta_analyses often involve large_numbers of studies from dozens to in large collaborative_efforts such as those based on the metabochip typically each study provides summary_statistics on the association between the study phenotype and to million single_nucleotide snps depending on whether hapmap or genomes_project data are used as reference sets as a result analysts dealing with gwas metaanalyses need to process many files each of size mb even when only minimal information is shared given that gwas involved in such meta_analyses may differ by study_design population_structure data management and statistical_methods the assessment of post gwas data_quality is important to uncover study specific problems available meta_analysis software such as metal plink and gwama address some of these issues e g p value inflation snp filtering during the meta_analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as process however these tools perform only basic sanity checks before meta analyzing the data and do not allow extensive qc of gwas result files for an extensive comparison of popular tools see supplementary therefore in depth qc and handling of gwas result files are frequently performed using in house scripts these scripts are often not very efficient in handling dozens of large files and issues may be addressed in a non systematic way in the absence of a rigorous and efficient qc undetected bias at the individual study level can introduce spurious heterogeneity which in turn can increase the false_positive and decrease power of the meta_analysis here we introduce the gwatoolbox an r package that standardizes and accelerates the handling and qc of post gwas data its purposes are to make data_handling easier to support a more systematic qc and to facilitate the inspection of data_quality prior to use of the gwas result files in a meta_analysis supplementary
