genome_analysis snpsea an algorithm to identify cell_types tissues and pathways affected by risk_loci we created a fast robust and general c implementation of a single_nucleotide snp set enrichment algorithm to identify cell_types tissues and pathways affected by risk_loci it tests trait associated genomic_loci for enrichment of specificity to conditions cell_types tissues and pathways we use a non paramet ric statistical_approach to compute empirical p values by comparison with null snp sets as a proof_of we present novel applications of our method to four sets of genome_wide significant snps associated with red_blood multiple_sclerosis celiac_disease and hdl_cholesterol availability_and as genome_wide gwas continue to find disease alleles investigators seek to identify the set of pathways and tissue_types affected by these alleles and the physiological_conditions under which they act for example we have previously presented statistical_methods to identify immune_cell for further functional investigation by finding cell_type expression of genes in linkage_disequilibrium ld with autoimmune diseaseassociated single_nucleotide snps presumably alleles influence disease risk through pathways specific to these cell_types we sought a general implementation of these methods to leverage data from high_throughput functional_assays that assess genome_wide transcription protein binding epigenetic_modifications and other functional parameters across diverse cellular conditions and tissue_types each of these diverse data types can be represented as a continuous matrix of genes and conditions e g cell_types tissues pathways experimental_conditions databases such as gene_ontology go offer expert defined pathways and complementary gene_annotations that can be represented as binary values investigators have already described strategies to assess enrichment of gwa results for pathways or gene_sets but not for condition specificity in contrast to these methods we do not require genotypes p values a priori gene_sets or pathways or a priori definitions of genesnp associations we require only a list of snp identifiers use ld structures to identify plausibly influential genes and use a simple sampling_approach to identify the conditions they influence snpsea is a general algorithm to identify the conditions relevant to a trait by assessing the genes within associated loci for enrichment of condition specificity
