data_and fun l gene_prioritization for rnai screens motivation most biological_processes remain only partially_characterized with many components still to be identified given that a whole_genome can usually not be tested in a functional assay identifying the genes most likely to be of interest is of critical importance to avoid wasting resources results given a set of known functionally_related and using a state of the art approach to data_integration and mining our functional lists fun l method provides a ranked_list of candidate_genes for testing validation of predictions from fun l with independent rnai screens confirms that fun l produced lists are enriched in genes with the expected phenotypes in this article we describe a website front end to fun l availability_and the website is freely_available to use at http an ever increasing volume of biological data provides insights into cellular biological_processes however how best to leverage the data to generate experimentally testable_hypotheses is an open issue a case in point is rnai screening where assay complexity cost and available resources can limit capacity to conduct a large screen when an exhaustive discovery of all genes involved in a biological_process is not required genome_wide screens are not necessary and a screen focused on candidate_genes should be preferred a key to the success of such screens resides in selecting genes with a high_probability of being involved in the desired biological_process with the large amount and diversity of information now available finding likely candidates has become non trivial currently target_selection for experiments is typically guided by experimentalists selecting a few candidates after manual database_searches and extensively trawling the literature this manual approach has the advantage of the experimentalists ability to filter the quality of the data however this risks ignoring relevant experimental_data provided by indirect_evidence and from high_throughput experiments therefore we developed functional lists fun l to help in selecting target_genes for experiments a practical use of fun l is in building focussed rnai libraries the fun l website provides an easy to use interface to a validated biological_process prediction algorithm fun l provides a systematic integrated reproducible and fast tool for target prioritisation that is regularly updated it compares favourably in performance with other applications providing an independent parameter free method furthermore it integrates extra unique information to aid in functional analysis of the proposed candidate list we will develop these tools further in the near future to provide improved ability to interpret and filter the results all data will be updated every months to ensure results provided are up to date we anticipate fun l to be a useful tool in designing small libraries of interfering rnas targeting a biological_function of interest for cases where genome_scale screening is not affordable or possible importantly the fun l method has been validated on independent data and has also been experimentally tested in human cells
