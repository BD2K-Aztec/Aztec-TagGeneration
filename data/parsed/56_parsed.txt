accurate prediction of rna nucleotide interactions with backbone k tree model motivation given the importance of non_coding to cellular regulatory_functions it would be highly_desirable to have accurate computational_prediction of rna d structure a task which remains_challenging even for a short rna_sequence the space of tertiary conformations is immense existing_methods to identify native like conformations mostly resort to random_sampling of conformations to achieve computational feasibility however native conformations may not be examined and prediction_accuracy may be compromised due to sampling state of the art methods have yet to deliver satisfactory predictions for rnas of length beyond nucleotides results this paper_presents a method to tackle a key_step in the rna d structure prediction_problem the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired d structure the research is based on a novel graph_model called a backbone k tree to tightly constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships considered for rna d structures it is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions including the non canonical interactions in all recently revealed families from the query_sequence along with known or predicted canonical basepairs the preliminary_results indicate that in most cases the new method can predict with a high_accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the d structure of the query_sequence it thus provides a useful tool for the accurate prediction of rna d structure availability_and the source package for bktree is available at http rna informatics in the past_decade there have been many revelations of the importance of non_coding to cellular regulatory_functions and thus a growing interest in the computational_prediction of rna d structure nevertheless rna d structure_prediction from a single rna_sequence is a significant challenge one major unresolved issue is the immense space of tertiary conformations even for a short rna_sequence existing_methods usually employ random_sampling algorithms for computation feasibility which assemble sampled tertiary motifs into native like structures to reduce the chance to miss native structures the assembly algorithms have mostly been guided with constraining structural_models for example mc fold mc sym de_novo assembles d structure from a database of nt tertiary fragments other methods follow samplings that preserve the secondary_structure however these constraining models do not necessarily ensure that native conformations are examined the state of the art methods have yet to deliver the desired prediction_accuracy for rna_sequences of lengths beyond nucleotides in this work we introduce a novel method to predict nucleotide interactions from known or predicted canonical basepairs as a key_step toward accurate prediction of d structure accurate_knowledge of the nucleotide interactions is crucial to predicting the d structure of an rna and subsequently predicting its functional_roles to predict nucleotide interactions our method is guided by a novel graph_model called a backbone k tree for small integer k to globally constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships nirs that constitute the d structure in such a k tree graph nucleotides are organized into groups of size k such that nirs are permitted only for nucleotides belonging to the same group and groups are connected to each other with a tree_topology see section this model was inspired by our recent_discovery of the small treewidth of the nir graphs for more than rna chains extracted from rnas whose structures have been resolved where the treewidth of each nir graph is computed by an approximation algorithm treewidth is a graph metric which indicates how much a graph is tree like we have been able to develop dynamic_programming dp algorithms with on k time and space complexities efficient for small k to compute the optimal backbone k tree spanning over the nucleotides on the query_sequence given a scoring_function to ensure that the computed optimal k tree can actually yield the set of nucleotide interactions that constitutes the native d structure our method proposes to identify detailed patterns of nucleotide interactions for every group of k nucleotides found in known rna d structures and to score every such pattern we consider nucleotide interactions from the established geometric nomenclatures and families including basebase basephosphate baseribose basestacking interactions as well as the phosphodiester bonds between two neighbouring nucleotides on the backbone to test our method we adopted an improved tree model and pre_computed candidates of interaction_patterns for every group of given nucleotides see supplementaryin the supplementary_material these annotated atom level interaction_patterns have been extracted from resolved d structures of rnas in the rna_structure atlas to avoid_overfitting only nucleotide interactions from rnas of length nucleotides were selected to score such patterns we trained artificial_neural anns to compute the confidence of every admissible nucleotide interaction pattern for every group of given nucleotides we filtered out unlikely interaction_patterns and kept only those with high confidences with this tree model our algorithm efficiently predicts an optimal set of nucleotide interactions from the query_sequence along with canonical base_pairs within computational time on we have implemented the algorithm into a program called bktree as a part of a d structure_prediction framework supplementaryin the supplementary_material we evaluated our methods through testing bktree on two sets of data first the performance of nucleotide interaction prediction was measured on a set of rnas of lengths ranging from to nucleotides a benchmark used by the survey of state of the art d structure_prediction the resolved atom level interactions of these high_resolution rnas were extracted with fr d sensitivities sty positive_predictive ppv and matthews correlation_coefficients mcc of the nucleotide interactions predicted by bktree were calculated for these rnas the overall performance was also compared with previous programs mc rosetta and nast second performance of nucleotide interaction prediction was also evaluated by testing bktree on a set of single rna chains from pdb of lengths between and nucleotides whose nucleotide interaction_patterns have not been extracted for the construction of anns to evaluate the significance of our method to d structure_prediction we modeled d conformations from predicted nucleotide interactions for all rnas both root_mean rmsd values and deviation index di values were calculated from the modeled d conformations rmsd comparisons on about a dozen representative rnas were also made with previous methods mc rosetta nast and rnamoip these evaluations show that bktree predicted nucleotide interactions with high accuracies across the tested rnas including rnas whose interaction_patterns were not used for training our method also impressively outperformed the other methods on the overwhelming_majority of the tested rnas and showed a great_potential for handling rnas beyond short lengths
