popgev a web_based large_scale population genome_browser motivation the development of high_throughput has made it possible for more and more researchers to use population sequencing_data to mine genes associated with specific_traits however the massive_amounts of sequencing_data have also brought new challenges to the researchers the question of how to browse population genomic_data in an easy and intuitive manner must be addressed web_based genome_browsers allow user to conveniently view the results of genomic_analyses but heavy usage can reduce the response speed of the webpage which limits its usefulness in the display of large_scale genome data indexeddb technology is a good solution to this problem it supports web_browsers and so creates local databases in this way data can be read from the local storage achieving a smooth display of population genomic_data results popgev has the following characteristics first it uses a new encoding method for compression of population snp and indel data indexeddb technology is used to download the results to local storage so that users can browse the results smoothly even when the network traffic is heavy second popgev identify similar genomic_regions between two individuals based on snp data population_diversity indexes are calculated when comparing two populations third user_defined annotation_information can be integrated for user_friendly mining of gene_functions simulation shows that popgev can smoothly display analysis results of population genome containing over individuals with millions snp data the development of high_throughput has decreased the cost of sequencing sharply and more and more researchers are using population resequencing technology to study gene function and the evolution of species increases in the quantity of data collected in genomic studies have also posed great challenges to biomedical_researchers first powerful computing_resources and efficient algorithms are needed to extract meaningful_results from population sequencing_data second user_friendly visualization_tools for the results of genomic analysis would be of great use to biology researchers currently several different genome visualization_tools have been developed to address different specific needs such as stand alone program as the quantity of genomic_data collected in studies increases population genome_analysis tools are becoming more and more important considering the computation capacity more and more users have chosen to perform data analysis on the cloud server and the results of analysis can be returned in html format this suggests web_based visualization_tools may become even more popular in the future when using web_based browsers to display the results of population genome analyses two issues must be resolved first the large amount of data transmitted will produce corresponding delays second web_browsers are not as flexible as stand alone programs in terms of user_interaction here html technology was used to develop a visualization_tools for population genome_analysis canvas and svg scalable_vector are used as the primary display technology svg is a way to achieve vector image display making the visualization clearer than ever and improving the interactive performance the indexeddb local database technology reduces the number of interactions between the webpage and the server so that the users can smoothly browse the analysis results simulation shows that this software can display genomic_variants of more than soybean genomes smoothly in terms of software features in addition to basic_functions such as displaying the snp and indel variation in each individual popgev also identify recombination_sites within the population and analyze the genetic_relationships between individuals population_diversity indexes such as fst tajimas d are calculated and these can be used to show difference between two populations the rapid_growth of the amount of sequencing_data produced by genomic studies has raised challenges for data analysis and visualization_techniques popgev uses the html indexdb technology to store data locally in this way it exploits the convenience of a web_browser and prevents frequent network communications producing a smooth display of massive quantities of genetic data this software
