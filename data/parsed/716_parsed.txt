data_and beyond accuracy creating interoperable and scalable text_mining web_services the biomedical_literature is a knowledge rich resource and an important foundation for future_research with over million articles in pubmed and an increasing growth_rate research in automated text processing is becoming increasingly important we report here our recently_developed web_based text_mining services for biomedical concept recognition and normalization unlike most text_mining software_tools our web_services integrate several state of the art entity tagging systems dnorm gnormplus sr gn tmchem and tmvar and offer a batch processing mode able to process arbitrary text input e g scholarly publications patents and medical_records in multiple formats e g bioc we support multiple standards to make our service interoperable and allow simpler integration with other text processing pipelines to maximize scalability we have preprocessed all pubmed articles and use a computer cluster for processing large requests of arbitrary text availability_and our text_mining web_service is freely_available www ncbi nlm nih gov cbbresearch lu demo tmtools curl contact zhiyong lu nih govmanaging the rapid_growth of biomedical knowledge buried in text such as literature medical_records and patents makes the development of automated text_mining technology increasingly important for instance the biomedical_literature contains the latest reports of scientific_discoveries but is represented in a highly unstructured format many text_mining systems have thus been developed in recent_years to help unlock this information both for information_retrieval and for novel computational_analyses text_mining approaches to automatically recognize and extract key biological_concepts are of particular interest as this task is often considered to be a building_block for many integrated and sophisticated information_extraction and retrieval solutions over the years a number of biomedical named_entity ner tools have been developed the entities targeted include genes proteins chemical drug disease sequence_variation and species taxonomy to use these tools and in particular integrate them into existing pipelines one has to install the software and address many issues including lack of modularity operating system incompatibility tool configuration complexity and lack of standardization of interprocess communications web_based text_mining services provide an alternative_solution where the details of the tool are hidden from users and no system installation or maintenance is required although one can access text_mining applications like reflect and myminer through web_page visits we are only aware of a few that offer programmatic web apis and can therefore be integrated easily whatizit becas cocoa http npjoint com and acromine in comparison to these tools our web_services are unique in several aspects i the entity taggers used offer highly competitive_performance in benchmarks for both mention and concept level results typically via hybrid_systems as opposed to use dictionaries in the previous systems ii for system scalability our method allows immediately with a unique session id which can be used to check the processing status once finished the user can use the same session id to retrieve the result as shown in the text_mining output can be directly visualized using pubtator as shown inwhere computer tagged entities are highlighted in various colors throughout the document to improve system interoperability we support multiple formats including bioc xml pubtator txt and pubannotation json by doing so our service becomes interoperable for different applications to simplify programmatic_access to our web_services we also provide sample client code in perl python and java
