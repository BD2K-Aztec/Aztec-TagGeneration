b solana an approach for the analysis of two base encoding bisulfite sequencing_data bisulfite_sequencing a combination of bisulfite_treatment and high_throughput has proved to be a valuable method for measuring dna_methylation at single_base here we present b solana an approach for the analysis of two base encoding colorspace bisulfite sequencing_data on the solid platform of life technologies it includes the alignment of bisulfite sequences and the determination of methylation_levels in cpg as well as non cpg sequence contexts b solana enables a fast and accurate analysis of large raw sequence_datasets availability_and the source_code released under the gnu gplv licence is freely_available atmethylation at position of cytosines is a major epigenetic_modification which has an important impact on transcriptional and regulatory_processes of dna it is a stable modification of the genome which can be inherited from one generation to the next even though it can also be dynamically changed by environmental_influences there are several methods based on high_throughput such as methylated_dna immunoprecipitation sequencing medip_seq methylated_dna capture by affinity_purification methylcap seq and bs_seq which can provide good quality genome_wide data methods that currently provide genome_wide patterns at single_base make use of bisulfite_conversion and high_throughput the treatment of dna with sodium_bisulfite has no effect on methylated_cytosines but it specifically converts unmethylated_cytosines to uracils which are converted to thymines during subsequent polymerase_chain as a result of bisulfite_conversion the watson and crick strands of bisulfite treated dna are no longer complementary to each other they become essentially different genomes this fact to whom correspondence should be addressed leads to an enlarged alignment reference space the prevalence of ts that have replaced cs leads to reduced complexity in bisulfite sequences which increases the bioinformatics challenge of bsseq analysis bioinformatics_tools for bs_seq have generally fallen into two categories i methylation aware alignment tools which consider cytosines and thymines as potential matches to genomic cytosine positions and ii tools which convert any residual cytosines in bisulfite sequences and all cytosines of the reference_genomes into thymines dinucleotides whereas the percentage of methylated chg and chh is always lower the approach of b solana reduces the number of bisulfite induced mismatches by considering the prevalence of methylated_cytosines in their different sequence contexts in order to identify cpg and non cpg methylation_sites b solana aligns bisulfite sequences to two in silico conversions of the reference_genome supplementary in the first modified reference_genome all cytosines in a non cpg context are converted to thymines conversion i in the second all cytosines irrespective of their sequence_context are converted to thymines conversion ii after alignment to these converted genomes b solana determines the best alignment for each bisulfite sequence in the following way bisulfite sequences that are aligned to different genomic positions in conversions i and ii are assigned to the position with the lowest number of mismatches reads with the same number of mismatches at different positions are ignored in its final step b solana determines methylation_levels b solana is compatible with bp directional single_end libraries and allows a simple adjustment for the upcoming read_lengths b solana was designed to generate accurate results for methylomes with a low percentage of methylation in non cpg_sites this includes most eukaryotic_organisms with mammalian_genomes typically having methylation_levels of in chg and in chh context a detailed test of b solana was performed for genomic_dna extracted from a human lymphoma_cell the library was prepared using a protocol for single_end solid bs_seq and sequencing of the bisulfite_converted was performed using solid versions plus and this generated billion bisulfite reads of which were mapped uniquely genome build hg ncbi the methylation results obtained by b solana were then compared to the illumina_infinium k assay an established methylation analysis method as a quality_control supplementary we observed high concordance between the results of the two independent methods of k sites were also represented in the b solana results and the methylation_levels of cytosines which were assayed by both methods displayed a very high correlation pearson_correlation r as a proof_of we also generated different simulated_datasets reflecting varying cpg and non cpg methylation_levels encouragingly the results generated by b solana closely match the expected methylation degrees supplementary a further approach for the analysis of colorspace bs_seq was published with the tool methylcoder methylcoder applies a conversion of any residual bisulfite read cytosines into thymines which leads to erroneous alignments as discussed above therefore we compared b solana and methylcoder one mismatch allowed by analyzing solid bs_seq reads bp taken from srr hansen we found a high concordance between methylation calls of hansen et_al analyzed by their yet unpublished and unavailable approach and b solana moreover b solana turns out to have a significantly_higher mapping efficiency as a platform independent benchmark we demonstrate that the analysis of colorspace bs_seq data of the fibroblast_cell imr is comparable to methylome data published by who used a bs_seq approach on the illumina_platform supplementary_information
