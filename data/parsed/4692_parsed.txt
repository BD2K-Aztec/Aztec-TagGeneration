topogsa network topological gene_set topogsa topology based gene_set is a web_application dedicated to the computation and visualization of network topological_properties for gene and protein_sets in molecular_interaction different topological characteristics such as the centrality of nodes in the network or their tendency to form_clusters can be computed and compared with those of known cellular_pathways and processes functional genomic experiments provide researchers with a wealth of information delineating gene_sets of biological interest to interpret these lists of genes common steps in a functional gene_set include the search for enrichment patterns for a review see e g to identify significant signalling_pathways or protein_domains and text_mining in the literature see review by another approach for the functional_interpretation of gene_sets is the analysis of molecular_interactions in which the genes or their corresponding proteins are involved in particular proteinprotein_interactions in this context some existing bioinformatics_tools already allow users to map genes onto networks of interacting or functionally associated molecules to identify related genes and proteins however to the best of the authors knowledge so_far these tools do not take into account topological_properties in interaction networks to analyse and compare gene_sets in this article we introduce topogsa topology based gene_set a web_tool to visualize and compare network topological_properties of gene or protein_sets mapped onto interaction networks
