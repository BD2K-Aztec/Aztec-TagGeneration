sequence_analysis comotif a mixture framework for identifying transcription_factor and a coregulator motif in chip_seq motivation chip_seq are enriched in binding_sites for the protein immunoprecipitated some sequences may also contain binding_sites for a coregulator biologists are interested in knowing which coregulatory factor motifs may be present in the sequences bound by the protein chiped results we present a finite_mixture framework with an expectation_maximization that considers two motifs jointly and simultaneously determines which sequences contain both motifs either one or neither of them tested on simulated chip_seq our method performed better than repeated application of meme in predicting sequences containing both motifs when applied to a mouse_liver foxa chip_seq dataset involving bp sequences comotif identified co occurrence of foxa with hnf a cebpa e box ap maf or sp motifs in of these sequences these motifs are either known as liver specific transcription_factors or have an important role in liver_function availability freely_available www niehs nih gov research resources software comotif a chip_seq experiment profiles the genome_wide binding of one transcription_factor because transcription_factors may work together to regulate_gene biologists are interested in knowing which putative coregulatory factor motifs may also be present in the sequences peaks that were bound by the protein immunoprecipitated with the primary factor and one coregulatory factor identifying which sequences contain both motifs either one or neither of them should provide useful information about gene_regulation over the years many computational_tools for motif_discovery have been developed most of them employ local_search techniques typically such as gibbs_sampling expectationmaximization em or related strategies the gibbs sample strategy first described for sequence_analysis byand refined by has been implemented in many motif_discovery tools such to whom correspondence should be addressed as alignace bioprospector motif sampler glam nestedmica a glam bayesmd gimsan info gibbs and hms the em_algorithm first applied to motif_discovery by lawrence and reilly also has many implementations including the widely used meme as well as greedyem the discriminative pssm approach fdrmotif and gadem the performance of some of these tools has been assessed stormo recently reviewed motif_discovery using em and gibbs sampling_techniques these motif_discovery are univariate in that they identify one motif one at a time although a tool may run its algorithm repeatedly and output several motifs from a single run after sequentially masking motifs already identified application of such univariate motif_discovery tools that require sequential masking to the identification of both the primary and cofactors of immunoprecipitated proteins can be problematic especially if the two motifs are similar the order in which the motifs are masked can have a major effect on the result for example a univariate approach would have trouble distinguishing a full site motif from its half_site counterpart furthermore a univariate approach would need to combine results for two individual motifs to obtain a composite picture of which motifs appear on which sequences methods that consider the joint_distribution of multiple motifs in the sequences include gibbs recursive sampler cismodule and emcmodule in contrast to the univariate approaches those methods simultaneously search for the binding_sites for k different motifs represented by k position_weight pwms where k can be either predefined or unknown those methods aim to identify clusters of binding_sites that are close to each other e g in a or bp window such a cluster is often referred to as a cis module multiple copies of the same motif are allowed to coexist in a cis module those methods are well suited for promoter_sequences of coexpressed genes on which multiple transcription_factor tend to colocalize they may not be ideal for sequences as chip_seq that are expected to lack the well structured cis modules of promoter_sequences existing_tools are not specifically_designed for simultaneously identifying the motifs for both the primary factor and a coregulatory factor in large_scale chip_seq consequently we developed a finite_mixture framework not only to determine simultaneouslypage
