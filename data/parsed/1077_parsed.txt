genome_analysis compasss complex pattern of sequence_search software a simple and effective tool for mining complex motifs in whole genomes motivation the complete sequencing of the human_genome shows that only of the entire genome_encodes for proteins the major part of the genome is made up of non coding_dna regulatory_elements and junk dna transcriptional_regulation plays_a in a multitude of critical cellular_processes and responses and it is a central force in the development and differentiation of multicellular_organisms identifying regulatory_elements is one of the major tasks in this challenge to accomplish this task we developed a solid and simple suite that allows direct access to genomic database and immediate result check we introduce compasss complex pattern of sequence_search software a simple and effective tool for motif search in entire genomes motifs can be partially degenerated and interrupted by spacers of variable_length results we demonstrate through real_biological data_mining the simplicity and robustness of this tool the test was performed on two well known protein_domains and a highly_variable cis_acting compasss successfully identifies both protein_domains and cis_acting semi conserved elements understanding the significance of unannotated dna_sequences from genome_projects is one of the major challenges nowadays interpretation of the genetic_code allowed to discover over protein_coding in the human_genome international human however the major part of the genomes is not made up of genes_encoding for proteins the genetic_code can be transcribed in non coding rna or it can be constituted of cis_acting regulatory_sequences such as promoters enhancers and other elements that affect_gene and alternative_splicing moreover most of the genomes are constituted by intergenic sequences that may have a regulatory_role but are defined as junk dna because we are unable to understand its function yet nowadays the availability of a wide_range of genome_sequences has greatly accelerated research to decipher the genomic regulatory code to clarify the cryptic nature of the human_genome the encode the encyclopedia of dna elements research consortium has been launched functional_elements in the human_genome will be shared in a public database the pilot_phase of the project tested and compared existing_methods to analyze a small portion of the human_genome now the project has been scaled to the entire_human in silico motif search within dna_sequences is one of the most challenging problems in molecular_biology and computer science and there is a large body of work done in developing search algorithms however each of these approaches has its own strengths_and while the quality of the detected motifs may vary from case to case in this work we propose a simple and effective tool named compasss complex pattern of sequence_search software that allows mining whole genomes for the presence of complex elements the tool is user_friendly flexible not resource_intensive and capable of browse whole genomes in minutes compasss applies the well known wu manber multiple pattern matching algorithm to exhaustively search for motifs in the entire_sequence input elements can be simple conserved_sequences as in blast engine partially or highly degenerated sequences or even multiple degenerated sequences joined by poorly conserved variable_length spacers we successfully tested compasss against three experimentally_validated complex patterns providing evidences that the tool successfully identifies both protein_domains as well as cis_acting semi conserved elements to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm tests were performed on actual biological data in particular we focused our attention on two semi conserved protein_domains and a cis_acting the human globin gene_family the mammalian pou domain transcription_factors and the tp responsive_elements in order to define the signature of each input motif clustalw algorithm was run and a multiple_alignment of known target_regions was obtained thus conserved and degenerated bases were identified and input motif was defined the human globin gene_family input motif was composed of three degenerated sequences separated by two conserved spacers ctgcacks gtggaycc ggtg and designed to recognize the second exon of the alpha_and locus the software successfully identifies both the alpha_and globin_genes the pou domain motif consists of a bipartite motif on the c terminal region of the pouh domain the two degenerated sequences of the pou motif are separated by a spacer of a fixed_length of bp the input motif was mgngtbtggttytgyaa gvcarr a search against the entire homo_sapiens genome results in a complete list of all known members of the pou domain_family plus two genes with high_affinity and homology with the pou domain_family the tetrameric p protein binds to two repeats of a consensus dna_sequence composed by two conserved pairs each arranged as inverted complement elements separated by a variable spacer region with the compasss suite we searched for all p regulatory motives throughout the entire_human using the input_data rrrcwwgyyy nrrcwwgyyn the software identified most of the experimentally_validated p responsive_elements detailed results can be found in supplementary_material
