gene_expression a new statistic for identifying batch_effects in high_throughput that uses guided principal_component motivation batch_effects are due to probe specific systematic_variation between groups of samples batches resulting from experimental features that are not of biological interest principal_component pca is commonly used as a visual tool to determine_whether batch_effects exist after applying a global normalization method however pca yields linear_combinations of the variables that contribute maximum variance and thus will not necessarily detect batch_effects if they are not the largest source of variability in the data results we present an extension of pca to quantify the existence of batch_effects called guided pca gpca we describe a test_statistic that uses gpca to test whether a batch_effect exists we apply our proposed test_statistic derived using gpca to simulated_data and to two copy_number case studies the first study consisted of samples from a breast_cancer family study using illumina human bead chip arrays whereas the second case study consisted of samples from a family blood_pressure study that used affymetrix snp_array we demonstrate that our statistic has good statistical_properties and is able to identify significant batch_effects in two copy_number case studies conclusion we developed a new statistic that uses gpca to identify whether batch_effects exist in high_throughput gpca can be used to identify batch_effects in large and messy data such as expression cnv and methylation data by computing the svd while taking batch into account principal component plots are a standard method of looking for batch_effects in high_throughput data here we show how gpca can be used both to visualize batch_effects and to formally test whether batch_effects are present in the data from our simulation_studies the type_i of our statistic is close to nominal level and power is reasonably good when an adequate proportion of the features are affected by batch additionally when the proportion of features affected by batch is high between and the estimated power is supplementary the y matrix in the gpca analysis can be formed by considering any combination of variables we note that with the y matrix coding multiple variables the variance ascribed to the first principal component of the gpca may incorporate multiple sources which would be difficult to disentangle to estimate the variance attributed to multiple sources gpca could be used to examine each one by defining y in separate analyses note that gpca is dependent on knowing how to define potential batch_effects if this is not known this statistic should not be used if batch is misspecified by the investigator provided the misspecified batch_effect indicator matrix has no relationship to the experimental_design then the test will likely not reject the null_hypothesis because type_i was close to the nominal level in the case of microarray_data scaling of the batch identifier matrix y is not in general useful for balanced experiments however when some batches have far more samples than others scaling of y is a useful tool to correct for the imbalance in the case of the genemam data while plates and had half as many or fewer samples than the rest of the plates the effect of scaling y was minimal although it did have an effect for microarray_data we do not want to scale the data matrix x as all the variables probes in our case are already on the same scale and scaling x would only serve to adjust the variance if the variances are smoothed then we may miss an important difference between variables or batches gpca can be used on other problems and types of data as well including b allele_frequency data and expression data because pre_processing of microarrays is time consuming expensive and with abundant systematic errors the ability to discover and adjust for these errors is important our test_statistic that uses gpca allows one to find the sources of systematic errors or batch_effects in all types of microarray_data and adjust for it during analysis in summary herein we present a novel statistic to test for the presence of batch_effects the test is particularly useful to test whether batch_effects exist after applying a global normalization procedure such as quantile or loess normalization although these global normalization procedures correct for batch_effects that affect all probes similarly they do not correct for probespecific batch_effects furthermore our test_statistic is useful for determining whether a batch correction_method has adequately removed observed batch_effects note batch mean centering was used for batch_effect correction
