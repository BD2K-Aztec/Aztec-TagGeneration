data_and impact of normalization_methods on high_throughput data with high hit_rates and drug testing with dose_response motivation most data analysis tools for high_throughput hts seek to uncover interesting hits for further analysis they typically assume a low hit_rate per plate hit_rates can be dramatically higher in secondary screening rnai screening and in drug_sensitivity testing using biologically active_drugs in particular drug_sensitivity testing on primary cells is often based on doseresponse experiments which pose a more stringent requirement for data_quality and for intra_and plate variation here we compared common plate normalization and noise_reduction methods including the b score and the loess a local polynomial fit method under high hit_rate scenarios of drug_sensitivity testing we generated simulated well plate hts datasets each with plates having a range of to hits per plate with controls placed either at the edge of the plates or in a scattered configuration results we identified as the critical hit_rate after which the normalizations started to perform poorly results from real drug testing experiments supported this estimation in particular the b score resulted in incorrect normalization of high hit_rate plates leading to poor data_quality which could be attributed to its dependency on the median polish algorithm we conclude that a combination of a scattered layout of controls per plate and normalization using a polynomial least_squares fit method such as loess helps to reduce column row and edge_effects in hts experiments with high hit_rates and is optimal for generating accurate doseresponse curves high_throughput drug testing is increasingly_being on e g established cancer_cell drug_resistant cancer cell models primary cancer_cells ips and other stem_cell models of disease this facilitates investigation of the functional effect of a spectrum of drugs on representative cell models and may be developed as a tool for cancer_diagnostics and personalized_medicine in the future for example we have developed drug_sensitivity and resistance_testing for primary ex_vivo cancer_cells from leukemia patients using serial_dilutions of a comprehensive drug panel previously containing but now preclinical and clinical cancer drugs as opposed to high_throughput v c the author published_by
