cdvist a webserver for identification and visualization of conserved domains in protein_sequences identification of domains in protein_sequences allows their assigning to biological_functions several webservers exist for identification of protein_domains using similarity_searches against various databases of protein domain models however none of them provides comprehensive domain coverage while allowing bulk querying and their visualization schemes can be improved to address_these we developed cdvist a comprehensive domain visualization_tool which combines the best available search algorithms and databases into a user_friendly framework first a given protein_sequence is matched to domain models using high_specificity tools and only then unmatched segments are subjected to more sensitive algorithms resulting in a best possible comprehensive coverage bulk querying and rich visualization and download options provide improved functionality to domain_architecture analysis availability_and freely_available on the web at http cdvist the identification of protein_domains is a key feature of protein sequence_analysis several databases notably pfam simple modular_architecture research tool smart clusters_of cog conserved_domain cdd and others develop and maintain domain models searching tools such as rps blast hmmer and hhpred hhsearch are used to match sequences to domain models present in a given database the size of the protein_sequence database grows dramatically whereas its coverage by pre_computed domain models increases very slowly consequently sensitive domain searches of sequences in bulk are necessary to improve computational coverage of the current and future protein sequence_space despite the overwhelming success of the current state of the art domain searching resources three areas require further improvements i combining tools with high_specificity and tools with high_sensitivity in a single framework ii multiple query searches using highly_sensitive e g profile to profile methods iii visualization of most relevant_information in a responsive and interactive way to address_these we have developed the comprehensive domain visualization_tool cdvist a domain searching webserver specialized in maximizing domain coverage of multidomain protein_sequences with emphasis on visualization
