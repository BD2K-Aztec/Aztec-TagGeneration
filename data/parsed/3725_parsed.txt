prognostic transcriptional association networks a new supervised approach based on regression trees motivation the application of information_encoded in molecular_networks for prognostic purposes is a crucial objective of systems biomedicine this approach has not been widely investigated in the cardiovascular research area within this area the prediction of clinical_outcomes after suffering a heart_attack would represent a significant step_forward we developed a new quantitative_prediction based method for this prognostic problem based on the discovery of clinically_relevant transcriptional association networks this method integrates regression trees and clinical class specific networks and can be applied to other clinical domains results before analyzing our cardiovascular_disease dataset we tested the usefulness of our approach on a benchmark_dataset with control and disease patients we also compared it to several algorithms to infer transcriptional association networks and classification_models comparative results provided evidence of the prediction power of our approach next we discovered new models for predicting good and bad outcomes after myocardial_infarction using blood derived gene_expression data our models reported areas under_the above our model could also outperform different techniques based on co expressed gene_modules we also predicted processes that may represent novel therapeutic_targets for heart_disease such as the synthesis of leucine and isoleucine availability the saturno software is freely_available at
