systems_biology sign ssm open_source parallel software for estimating gene_networks with state_space models sign ssm is an open_source gene network estimation software able to run in parallel on pcs and massively_parallel supercomputers the software estimates a state_space model ssm that is a statistical dynamic_model suitable for analyzing short time and or replicated time series gene_expression sign ssm implements a novel parameter constraint effective to stabilize the estimated models also by using a supercomputer it is able to determine the gene network_structure by a statistical permutation_test in a practical time sign ssm is applicable not only to analyzing temporal regulatory dependencies between genes but also to extracting the differentially_regulated from time series expression_profiles availability sign ssm is distributed under gnu affero general public licence gnu agpl version and can be downloaded at http sign hgc jp signssm the pre compiled binaries for some architectures are available in addition to the source_code the pre installed binaries are also available on the human_genome center supercomputer system the online manual and the supplementary_information of sign ssm is available on our web_site analyzing the dynamical regulatory_mechanisms of gene_expressions in a cellular system is a challenging_problem in systems_biology to this end many computational_methods have been proposed to estimate dynamical_systems of regulatory dependencies between gene_expressions from temporal gene_expression the major_difficulty of these studies comes from insufficient data time points as opposed to the number of variables genes in a computational_model a state_space model ssm is to whom correspondence should be addressed a statistical_model that is applicable to small time point temporal datasets because it can reduce the number of parameters to be estimated the ssm decomposes the temporal gene_expressions into a dynamical system of modules called the system model or state_space and a mapping from the modules to the particular genes called the observation model there are a number of gene network studies using the ssm sign ssm is a re implemented new version of the previously released one called trans mnet in addition to trans mnet sign ssm has the following improvements i it implements a novel constraint on the model_parameters effective to stabilize the estimated models for the short time series data with irregular time intervals ii runs in parallel as a multithreaded program exploiting multicore cpus as a bulk array job through a job dispatching system such as sun oracle grid engine sge on pc cluster systems and a multi process mpi message_passing application on massively_parallel supercomputers iii is an open_source so that everyone can freely access the source_code and improve modify and distribute it and iv implements a statistical permutation_test to determine a gene network_structure as proposed inand differentially_regulated gene extraction presented inon the human_genome center hgc supercomputer system sign ssm is a highly scalable open_source implementation of an ssm estimation algorithm the newly_proposed constraint on the parameters can significantly stabilize the estimation of the parameters for the very short time point temporal data with irregular time intervals users can analyze their time series expression datasets using sign ssm and the estimated model can be applied to other data to extract differentially_expressed
