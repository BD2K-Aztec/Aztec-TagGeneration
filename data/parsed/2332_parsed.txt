identifying proteins controlling key disease signaling_pathways motivation several types of studies including genome_wide and rna_interference screens strive to link genes to diseases although these approaches have had some success genetic_variants are often only present in a small subset of the population and screens are noisy with low overlap between experiments in different labs neither provides a mechanistic_model explaining how identified genes impact the disease of interest or the dynamics of the pathways those genes regulate such mechanistic_models could be used to accurately_predict downstream_effects of knocking_down pathway members and allow comprehensive exploration of the effects of targeting pairs or higher_order combinations of genes results we developed methods to model the activation of signaling and dynamic regulatory_networks involved in disease_progression our model sdrem integrates static and time series data to link proteins and the pathways they regulate in these networks sdrem uses prior information about proteins likelihood of involvement in a disease e g from screens to improve the quality of the predicted signaling_pathways we used our algorithms to study the human immune_response to h n influenza_infection the resulting networks correctly_identified many of the known pathways and transcriptional_regulators of this disease furthermore they accurately_predict rna interference_effects and can be used to infer genetic_interactions greatly improving over other methods suggested for this task applying our method to the more pathogenic h n influenza allowed us to identify several strain specific targets of this infection availability sdrem is available froma wide_variety of experimental and computational_approaches have been used over the past_few to screen for genes that play_important in human disease these include rna_interference rnai screens which knock_down human genes to quantify the phenotypic_effects in diseases such as hiv and influenza_infection and genomewide_association gwas a powerful approach for uncovering strong connections between genetic_variations such as single_nucleotide snps and disease traits although these and similar sequencing based_methods have been widely_applied and were able to identify many relevant_genes they also suffer from important drawbacks that limit their effectiveness rnai screen hits are often not reproducible among different labs and experimental_settings for example the overlap among hits in hiv screens is low three genome_wide screens identified genes that impact hiv_replication but only three genes were common to all screens similar low overlap is observed for other diseases as well interpretability of screen hits remains a challenge as the screens cannot explain why a gene impacts a disease similarly interpretation of gwas hits is not straightforward as they oftentimes lie outside of coding_regions of the genome even those variants lying within a coding_region only explain a small fraction of affected_individuals for several diseases and conditions these observations motivated methods that integrate gwas or perturbation information with functional_annotations and other types of genomic_data most notably gene_expression and protein interaction data for example pathway based gwas maps snp p values to proximal genes and links pathways to diseases by testing whether any predefined pathways are enriched for genes that flank significant snps however this and similar strategies are dependent on the quality of the annotated pathways preventing their use for important diseases that are poorly represented in public pathway_databases a variety of gene_prioritization algorithms which have been extensively reviewed and benchmarked use known disease genes from literature curation gwas or other sources as seeds to search for similar genes that are likely to be related to the same disease the evidence used to define gene similarity includes text_mining pathway membership functional_annotations protein properties sequence co expression and proximity in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks however these methods do not attempt to mechanistically model the pathways that are activated during disease_progression and response and thus do not provide a model to explain the various observations instead they use a black_box approach they take seed genes as input and produce a ranked_list of candidate_genes without explaining the predicted relationship to the disease which may impair further analysis other algorithms use perturbation and genetic data to link proteins to diseases while at the same time using other genomic_datasets and interaction networks to suggest how these proteins may be involved in disease response however these methods have only used static models so_far in such models the phenotypic outcomes of the network perturbations or genetic_variants are typically differentially_expressed the algorithms then to whom correspondence should be addressed pathogens infecting cells provide a clear set of sources that initiate the subsequent signaling and transcriptional_response in particular many viruses encode only a small number of proteins allowing us to generate specific models for the host response that is triggered by host_proteins that detect viral_rna or interact with viral_proteins to test sdrems application to such responses we focus on influenza a viruses because of the rich datasets available and their importance to global_health the swine origin h n virus outbreak received great public attention and was declared a global pandemic in june of that year more recently research concerning mutations of avian h n influenza that could allow it to be transmitted among mammals via aerosols has sparked immense controversy i a gitter and z bar joseph highlighting the threat influenza a viruses pose and the need to better understand their interaction with the human immune system sdrem is unique in that it combines time series and static data to model both signaling and dynamic regulatory_networks this allows it to infer more confidently the tfs that are at the end_points of signaling_cascades and control human disease response to manage the complexity of human interaction networks we extended sdrem to leverage gene priors from rnai screens in its objective_function and incorporated several algorithmic improvements as we have shown for influenza_infection by reconstructing disease response networks we can accurately identify key_signaling and nodes proteins sdrem can be applied successfully in many different settings even when the ppi data node priors or gene_expression time points are sparse supplementary_information supplementary tables s and s note n a indicates that the gene was not included in the sdrem h n model given the predicted directed signaling_pathways we can estimate the phenotypic_effects of knocking_down genes by assessing how strongly the downstream tfs are affected these techniques can be used to infer putative drug_targets for hard to study conditions such as h n infection and for combination of targets which can lead to more robust treatments successfully predicting the effects of pairwise and higher_order gene knockdowns can guide targeted experimental_validation a major_contribution because exhaustive pairwise rnai screening is currently infeasible and signaling_pathway redundancy can limit the effectiveness of drugs that target individual genes owing to this pathway redundancy and false_negatives in the existing rnai screens the precision we calculate for sdrems rnai effect predictions is conservative many proteins predicted by sdrem for example stat rela nfkb and several irf tfs are not screen hits but are known to be important to the immune_response an important advantage of sdrem over previous rnai screen and hostpathogen ppi studies is the ability to infer new pathways from general interaction data previous_studies for example and pathway based gwas often rely on known curated pathways that are incomplete and not always relevant to the disease studied in contrast using condition specific time series data and sources sdrem can predict which candidate_proteins are involved in the signaling_pathways and which are not unlike the gene scores from endeavour pinta and other gene_prioritization algorithms that are only defined for single genes sdrem predicts functional disease genes by modeling the impact of removing a gene from the disease specific signaling_pathways this simulated phenotype can be naturally extended to pairs of genes allowing sdrem to predict genetic_interactions analogously to experimental_approaches existing genetic_interaction prediction_algorithms require a partial set of known genetic_interactions which prevents their application in human furthermore sdrems genetic_interaction predictions are condition specific our influenza analysis focused on data from human cell_lines but some of sdrems most exciting future applications will involve data from individual patients we would like to use the extensions presented in this article to enable gwas data to be used as node priors one possible approach we intend to explore is to map snp p values to gene scores as in pathway based gwas in addition snps in non coding_regions with potential regulatory_functions could be used to suggest which tfs binding is disrupted providing priors for both the network orientation and the temporal expression analysis
