genome_analysis a cautionary note for retrocopy identification dna based duplication of intron containing genes significantly contributes to the origination of single_exon genes motivation retrocopies are important genes in the genomes of almost all higher_eukaryotes however the annotation of such genes is a non trivial task intronless genes have often been considered to be retroposed copies of intron containing paralogs such categorization relies on the implicit premise that alignable regions of the duplicates should be long enough to cover exon exon_junctions of the intron containing genes and thus intron loss events can be inferred here we examined the alternative possibility that intronless genes could be generated by partial dna based duplication of intron containing genes in the fruitfly genome results by building pairwise protein transcript and genome level dna alignments between intronless genes and their corresponding intron containing paralogs we found that alignments do not cover exonexon junctions in of cases and thus no intron loss could be inferred for these cases the candidate parental proteins tend to be partially duplicated and intergenic sequences or neighboring genes are included in the intronless paralog moreover we observed that it is significantly less likely for these paralogs to show inter chromosomal duplication and testis dominant transcription compared to the remaining of cases with evidence of clear intron loss retrogenes these lines of analysis reveal that dna based duplication contributes significantly to the of cases of single_exon gene_duplication finally we performed an analogous survey in the human_genome and the result is similar wherein of the cases do not cover exonexon junctions thus genome_annotation for retrogene identification should discard candidates without clear evidence of intron loss mechanisms that generate new gene duplicates can be roughly divided_into two categories dna based mechanisms and retroposition unlike dna based duplicates retrogenes have less evolutionary constraint given that they lose the cis regulator elements of their parental loci and thus might more often undergo neofunctionalization the empirical data confirming this hypothesis are that retrogenes are more often fast evolving relative to dnabased duplicates thus because dnaand rna based duplications likely have different functional and evolutionary consequences it is necessary to disentangle the origination mechanisms of duplicated_genes since retroposition uses mature mrna as the template instead of intron containing pre_mrna the signature of intron loss has been proposed as a hallmark to differentiate these two duplication mechanisms for a derived duplicate with an intron containing parental gene it is standard annotation practice to perform an all against all protein alignment to search paralogous gene_pairs if one copy has at least one intron while the other copy is intronless the latter is defined as a retrogene with the assumption that the alignment should be long enough to cover exon exon_junctions thus allowing intron loss to be inferred a more conservative method is to check the actual alignments and discard cases where the alignment is too short and no parental introns are covered it is difficult to compare the performance of these two strategies since it remains_unknown how many alignments between single_exon new genes and intron containing parents do not cover introns and whether dna based duplication contributes to many of these cases here we performed a computational survey of intronless genes with intron containing paralogs in the genomes of both fruitfly and human the purpose of our work is fold first we attempted to provide an evaluation of how we classify retrogene and dnabased duplicates the directionality of intron loss can be used to define parental daughter gene relationships in the case of the retroposition based copying mechanism if there is actually no evidence for intron loss it is difficult to define which paralog is the derived copy and which is the ancestral copy such information is critical for the study of evolutionary novelty contributed by
