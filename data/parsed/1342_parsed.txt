sequence_analysis detecting clustering and ordering binding_patterns among transcription_factors via point_process models_motivation recent development in chip_seq technology has generated binding data for many transcription_factors tfs in various cell_types and cellular conditions this opens great opportunities for studying combinatorial binding_patterns among a set of tfs active in a particular cellular condition which is a key_component for understanding the interaction between tfs in gene_regulation results as a first step to the identification of combinatorial binding_patterns we develop statistical_methods to detect clustering and ordering patterns among binding_sites bss of a pair of tfs testing procedures based on ripleys k function and its generalizations are developed to identify binding_patterns from large collections of bss in chip_seq we have applied our methods to the chip_seq of pairs of tfs in mouse_embryonic our methods have detected clustering binding_patterns between most tf pairs which is consistent with the findings in the literature and have identified significant ordering preferences relative to the direction of target gene_transcription among the bss of seven tfs more interestingly our results demonstrate that the identified clustering and ordering binding_patterns between tfs are associated with the expression of the target_genes these findings provide new insights into co regulation between tfs availability_and see www stat ucla edu zhou tfkfunctions for source_code gene_expression in high organisms is regulated by the combinatorial binding of multiple transcription_factors tfs to the dna_sequence in upstream or other regulatory_regions of the gene a set of interactive tfs often shows complex binding_patterns clusters of multiple tf_binding tfbss co localized in a short dna region form the so_called cis_regulatory crms more complicated patterns such as ordering preference among binding_sites bss of different tfs in a regulatory_region may exist and encode hidden regulatory_signals detecting combinatorial binding_patterns and crms is thus an important step toward a comprehensive understanding of cis regulation consequently computational_methods have been developed for this purpose based on different types of genomic_data early methods build probabilistic_models for tfbss and their occurrences in crms to identify clusters of tfbss from dna sequence_data for a recent review of these methods see hardison and taylor when the tfs involved in a particular cellular condition are known methods have been developed to detect clusters of motif matches appearing more frequently than expected given a background model for the dna_sequence there are also de_novo methods for the discovery of crms such as for a few examples essentially this group of methods finds clusters of tfbss based on the enrichment of motif matches compared against a simple background model because motif signals are usually weak in high organisms sophisticated binding_patterns such as the ordering and other location preferences among tfbss cannot be reliably detected from sequence_data alone and thus are often not incorporated in these methods recently chip_seq technology has been applied to generate genome_wide binding data for tfs in various cellular conditions the accumulation of such binding data for multiple_tfs in the same condition makes it possible to explore the relation among the binding of these tfs for example more than tfs have available chip_seq in mouse_embryonic escs one may want to find out whether the binding of two tfs is independent of each other and if not identify specific binding_patterns suggested by the data such results may indicate how two or more tfs work together to regulate the expression of target_genes and help detect novel regulatory_signals however those motif enrichment_methods reviewed above are not directly applicable owing to the different data type and their simplified model_assumptions on the other hand ad_hoc methods have been used to define and detect clusters of bss or chip_seq in recent_studies defined multiple tf_binding loci by peaks within bp lee and zhou identified context dependent co regulators from co bound regions constructed by chip_seq of two tfs with distance bp determined whether binding regions have a clustering tendency based on the empirical distribution of peak to peak distances found clusters of bss by iteratively merging peaks within bp and then constructed some test using poisson approximation identified inter site spacing bias for some fixed range between and bp by a fishers_exact on the to whom correspondence should be addressed contingency_table of site pair counts within or outside the range one sees an arbitrary use of distance thresholds and simple empirical tests in finding clusters of bss or peaks in existing work without any consideration of ordering preference among tfbss or the individual location distribution for bss of a tf clearly there is a pressing need for new statistical_methods to infer combinatorial binding_patterns from chip_seq in this work we develop statistical_methods to detect clustering and ordering patterns between bss of two tfs from their chip_seq we assume that under the null_model the locations of bss of a tf follow an inhomogeneous poisson point_process test_statistics for clustering and ordering binding_patterns are constructed based on ripleys k function a widely used method for detecting point patterns in spatial statistics and its generalizations to pairwise tf_binding data our approach does not rely on a pre specified distance threshold for the detection of clusters of bss and can automatically find the distance level at which the clustering pattern if exists is most significant we make use of the large number of bss in chip_seq and demonstrate that the null distributions of the test_statistics can be accurately approximated by largesample theory this eliminates the need for computationally_intensive simulations and allows for efficient large_scale analysis in this work we study binding_patterns in chip_seq generated from mouse_escs escs are pluripotent_stem derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst an early_stage embryo they are known to have two distinctive properties pluripotency and the ability to replicate indefinitely which make escs especially important in clinical research it is expected that many complex_diseases might be treated by transplanting cells generated from escs there has been a substantial amount of recent work on the gene_regulatory in mouse_escs which involves the combinatorial regulation by a number of tfs for example oct is known as a master_regulator of pluripotency and a valid amount of oct is needed for dedifferentiation and for sustaining esc self_renewal four tfs oct sox cmyc and klf can reprogram somatic_cells back to esc like cells having the characteristics of self_renewal and pluripotency genome_wide chipseq data have provided the binding regions of tfs that play key regulatory_roles in mouse_escs computational_analyses have been performed to identify the sequence_motifs of these core tfs and to detect other co regulators that may regulate genes by working with these tfs however except for some ad_hoc analysis on the co occurrence between binding peaks it appears that no principled approaches have been applied to detect combinatorial binding_patterns from this rich collection of data in this analysis we apply our methods to tfs with available chip_seq from three recent_publications and systematically identify clustering and ordering binding_patterns between all tf pairs the tfs are oct sox smad stat nanog esrrb tcfcp l tcf nr a e f nmyc cmyc zfx and klf we also suggest potential regulatory_roles of the identified combinatorial binding_patterns by examining the expression_profiles and functional_annotations of their target_genes we first verified via a simulation_study that the normal approximations to the null distributions of the test_statistics z c and z o are accurate for the data analyzed in this work one key feature that distinguishes our methods from other ad_hoc methods is the use of inhomogeneous poisson processes in modeling bs locations which takes_into the location preference of tfbss in upstream regions in the simulation_study we also compared our approach against a simple method that ignores the location preference in detecting clustering the simple method produced substantially more false_discoveries this shows that modeling the marginal binding distribution of a tf is a critical component for the detection of significant binding_patterns see
