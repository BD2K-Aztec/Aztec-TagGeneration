breakfusion targeted assembly based identification of gene_fusions in whole transcriptome paired_end sequencing_data despite recent_progress computational_tools that identify gene_fusions from next generation whole transcriptome sequencing_data are often limited in accuracy and scalability here we present a software_package breakfusion that combines the strength of reference alignment followed by read_pair analysis and de_novo to achieve a good balance in sensitivity specificity and computational_efficiency availability http bioinformatics mdanderson org main breakfusiondespite recent_progress bioinformatics_tools that analyze rna_seq are often limited in accuracy and scalability alignment based tools typically predict such large_numbers of candidates that further examination of the data is impractical furthermore many findings are artifacts derived from a large number of erroneous short_reads produced by the next_generation ngs instruments or are read misalignments produced by the sequence aligners assembly based_approaches martin and can potentially achieve_higher because they leverage dependency among reads and are less sensitive to errors in individual_reads with sufficient coverage longer and higher quality sequences can be assembled from short_reads resulting in improved specificity however existing assembly based_approaches potentially lack sensitivity to rare_events such as gene_fusions because they are designed to reconstruct entire transcriptomes rather than focus on novel sequences we reason that a targeted transcriptome_assembly strategy that focuses on assembling novel junction sequences can potentially achieve a better balance in sensitivity specificity and computational_efficiency to whom correspondence should be addressed to test breakfusions performance we compared it with tophatfusion and defuse using four publicly_available rna_seq a prostate_cancer cell_line ncih and a matched lymphoblastoid_cell gm a breast_cancer and a chronic_myelogenous cell_line k breakfusion achieved better sensitivity_and tradeoff in these tests supplementary data it also used substantially less cpu time we further applied breakfusion to analyze rna_seq for acute_myeloid aml samples as part of the cancer_genome tcga project this dataset was also analyzed by the genome sciences centre at the bc cancer agency bcca using tran abyss which resulted in instances of experimentally_validated fusions breakfusion was able to rediscover all these fusions and additionally predicted eight new instances of fusions which were subsequently confirmed by the bcca group supplementary data to the best of our knowledge breakfusion is the first approach that performs targeted assembly on rna_seq for fusion identification the results of our experiments indicate that breakfusion has achieved sensitivity_and comparable or better than other tools and is clearly more computationally_efficient this in our view represents a methodology improvement that will benefit many projects that utilize ngs rna sequencing_data besides fusion discovery in principle breakfusion can be applied to identify novel alternative_splicing the component programs of breakfusion are efficiently implemented in c and perl it finished analyzing tcga aml bam_files in h using cpus with gb ram each breakfusion is freely_available for academic use at http bioinformatics mdanderson org main breakfusion
