genome_analysis identification of deleterious synonymous variants in human_genomes motivation the prioritization and identification of disease_causing is one of the most significant challenges in medical gen omics currently available methods address this problem for non_synonymous variants snvs and variation in promoters enhancers however recent research has implicated synonymous silent exonic mutations in a number of disorders results we have curated such variants from literature and developed the silent variant analyzer silva a machine_learning approach to separate these from among a large set of rare polymorph isms we evaluate silvas performance on in silico infection experiments in which we implant known disease_causing into a human_genome and show that for of disorders we rank the implanted mutation among the top five most deleterious ones furthermore we apply the silva method to two additional datasets synonymous variants associated with meckel syndrome and a collection of silent variants clinically observed and stratified by a molecular_diagnostics laboratory and show that silva is able to accurately_predict the harmfulness of silent variants in these datasets availability silva is open_source and is freely_available from the prothe realization of the medical advantages of the personal genome remains_limited by our inability to identify the diseasecausing variation from the millions of non functional neutral single nucleotide structural and copy_number which are present in each individuals genome despite the successes of using genome_sequencing to identify disease_causing in individuals with mendelian_disorders and cohorts of individuals with more common genetic_disorders such as autism o the prioritization of variants based on their involvement in disorders remains_a methods for the identification of disease_causing typically use one of two complementary approaches statistical_association between a variant and a disorder or the prioritization of all genomic_variants found in a genome based on their possible functional effect in the statistical_association approach individuals with the disorder cases are genotyped in parallel with matched_controls and statistical_tests are then used to identify variants that are overrepresented in cases as compared with controls although such tests have shown promise for identifying genes involved in some common disorders including autism and type_diabetes these tests are not applicable to rare_genetic where unrelated_individuals may all be affected because of different personal variants within the same gene or pathway approaches like the cohort allelic sums test cast and combined multivariate and collapsing cmc method aggregate the rare_variants seen within a gene or a pathway to mitigate this but the applicability of association based_methods remains extremely limited for small cohorts the alternative approach of prioritizing disease_causing single_nucleotide snvs based on their population frequency conservation and the type of change radical versus conservative amino_acid change introduction of a stop_codon etc has been extremely_effective at identifying causal non synonymous mutations in a number of mendelian_disorders including charcot marietooth neuropathy hajducheney syndrome and miller syndrome in this approach the variants identified in the genome are filtered to those with low allele_frequencies common_variants are unlikely to cause rare_disorders and are sorted based on a harmfulness score generated by tools such as polyphen sift or panther although some of these functional_variants may not be harmful functionality is typically used as a proxy for harmfulness within such tools and we use the terms interchangeably most recently the snv prioritization and association based_approaches have been combined within the vaast method to whom correspondence should be addressed tools for the prioritization of harmful non synonymous variants typically consider multiple features that may affect the functioning of the protein including the level of conservation of the changed residue the severity of the amino_acid change a change from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic residue is more likely to be harmful than a change within one of these groups the location of the variant relative to functional_regions of the protein such as active_sites and the likelihood that the mutation would affect protein secondary or tertiary_structure these features are then combined using either heuristic weights or more rigorous machine_learning frameworks to identify snvs likely to have functional effects all of the features can contribute to the overall success of the prioritization however the conservation of the amino_acid across evolution clearly has the strongest_effect and some argue it may be sufficient on its own although tools have been developed for the prioritization of non synonymous snvs and to a lesser extent copy_number currently there are no methodologies for prioritizing functional synonymous snvs most pipelines for identification of disease_causing filter out synonymous snvs at the earliest_stages concentrating on amino_acid altering and regulatory variation however there is growing evidence that synonymous snvs affect protein_splicing expression and ultimately function and some of these snvs contribute to disease see reviews a synonymous snv may contribute to a phenotype in several ways including by changing the splicing pattern the folding energy and the structure of the pre_mrna and the ultimate fold of the protein by altering translation dynamics splice changes are perhaps the best studied effect of functional synonymous snvs the creation or modification of a splice donor or acceptor site or the binding_site of a splicing enhancer silencer or regulator can lead to intron inclusion or alternative_splicing of the exon and a drastically different protein product synonymous_substitutions that change a common codon to a rare one or vice_versa can also result in a different protein by affecting translational_efficiency as is the case with a mutation in the cftr gene associated with cystic_fibrosis additionally synonymous mutations have been shown to change the expression and function of proteins in escherichia_coli and play a role in substrate_specificity and cancer outcomes in humans though the later claim has been controversial several previous computational_approaches have looked at variation that does not alter the coding_sequence including methods that evaluate the changes in rna_folding energies and ensembles and studies that aim to identify alternative_splicing genome_wide by analyzing exonic splicing enhancers and silencers however to our knowledge no current method combines multiple genomic_features to identify silent genetic_variants with functional effects toward this end we developed the silent variant analyzer silva a random_forest based prioritization method for synonymous variants in the human_genome our method considers multiple features based on sequence_conservation splice factor motifs splice donor acceptor_sites rna_folding energy codon_usage and cpg content we use a custom curated dataset of rare synonymous disease_causing to train and evaluate the overall efficacy of silva as well as two additional datasets for independent_validation showing that silva is able to accurately_predict the harmfulness of silent variants in these datasets current_technologies are able to sequence a human_genome relatively cheaply and quickly but the key bottleneck is the interpretation of the variants to identify those that are most likely to be related to an observed phenotype or a disorder the automated prioritization of deleterious variants is an important step toward the realization of genomic medicine although methods for this task have been designed for non synonymous coding variation many other types of variants are currently not prioritized and are typically ignored in genome analysis_pipelines the growing evidence that some of the silent variation has important functional_roles implies that effective prioritization is necessary to explore such variation in medical sequencing studies in this article we present the first method for the prioritization of disease_causing synonymous snvs based on a number of features including sequence_conservation splice_sites splice regulatory_motifs codon frequency cpg content and rna_secondary energy we have curated such disease related variants and evaluated several machine_learning for prioritizing these from among a set of rare putatively neutral snvs our results indicate that splicing information and sequence_conservation are currently the two most informative features for identifying deleterious synonymous variants and the performance degrades without either of these features the random_forest method outperforms other statistical_learning methods at prioritizing disease_causing snvs and yields variant scores that are significantly_higher in known harmful variants than in control variants when a deleterious snv is added to a human_genome this method ranks the deleterious snv among the top five candidates for of the diseases and is able to identify harmful variants in independent_validation sets together these findings indicate that automated methods for identification of deleterious synonymous snvs can be useful in parallel with methods that prioritize other types of genomic_variation for the analysis of full human_genomes our methods performance is currently limited by the small number of training examples but as more examples of pathogenic synonymous variants are found the model_predictions will only improve additional features can also be developed to better address the mechanisms by which synonymous mutations can effect change such as better measures of exon strength the effect on rna_folding ensembles and the significance of changes to exon splicing enhancer and suppressor motifs as approaches for the stratification of different types of variants are developed one natural extension of the current article and the work on non synonymous variation would be to design an approach that would consider both types of variants and attempt to classify deleterious synonymous and non synonymous variants together
