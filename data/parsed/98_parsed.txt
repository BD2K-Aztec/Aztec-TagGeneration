a context sensitive framework for the analysis of human signalling_pathways in molecular_interaction motivation a major_challenge in systems_biology is to reveal the cellular_pathways that give rise to specific phenotypes and behaviours current_techniques often rely on a network representation of molecular_interactions where each node represents a protein or a gene and each interaction is assigned a single static score however the use of single interaction scores fails to capture the tendency of proteins to favour different partners under distinct_cellular conditions results here we propose a novel context sensitive network model in which genes and protein nodes are assigned multiple contexts based on their gene_ontology and their interactions are associated with multiple context sensitive scores using this model we developed a new approach and a corresponding tool contextnet based on a dynamic_programming for identifying signalling paths linking proteins to their downstream_target contextnet finds high_ranking context sensitive paths in the interactome thereby revealing the intermediate proteins in the path and their path specific_contexts we validated the model using manually_curated cellular paths derived from the spike database we next applied our framework to elucidate the responses of human primary lung cells to influenza_infection top ranking paths were much more likely to contain infection related proteins and this likelihood was highly_correlated with path score moreover the contexts assigned by the algorithm pointed to putative as well as previously known responses to viral_infection thus context sensitivity is an important extension to current network biology models and can be efficiently used to elucidate cellular response mechanisms availability contextnet is publicly_available at http netbio bgu ac complex_diseases and viral_infections are among the major problems in human_health today in an effort to broaden our understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases they are increasingly interrogated using a variety of large_scale experimental_techniques major techniques_include sequencing_efforts to reveal disease related mutations mrna profiling to reveal genes that are differentially_expressed during disease and sirna screens to reveal disease_related e g thereby revealing distinct subsets of the genes and proteins involved recent_studies demonstrate the strength of integrative approaches in broadening our understanding of disease processes reviewed in central to many integrative approaches is the molecular_interaction interactome paradigm where interactome nodes represent proteins or genes and interactome edges represent their physical and regulatory_interactions interactomes provide a convenient framework for exploring the context within which disease genes operate and they were successfully used to illuminate new disease genes e g and their functions as recently reviewed by because of the importance of signalling paths in health and disease several computational efforts exploited the interactome framework for their elucidation by connecting mutated proteins with their downstream differentially_expressed targets identified intermediate proteins in the paths and assigned directionality to undirected proteinprotein_interactions ppis later studies identified interactome sub networks relating the results of high_throughput genetic_screening and mrna profiling and yet another set of studies computed putative signalling paths by connecting membrane_proteins to transcription_factors while limiting the types and relative order of the proteins on the path although based on different computational_techniques each of these studies relied on a typical network representation where each edge is assigned a single score based on its estimated reliability e g or relevance to a specific cellular_process e g yet single edge scores fail to capture the complexity of biological_systems where the activation of a specific protein may lead to multiple responses depending on the current cellular condition we illustrate this phenomenon using the human protein grb an epidermal_growth binding_protein that is known to mediate several cellular signalling_cascades although grb physically interacts with many different proteins recent experimental analysis of its physical_interactions has shown that its sub network remodels itself dramatically in response to different stimuli for example in the context of viral_infection grb tends to interact with interferon_regulatory irf whereas in the context of insulin_signalling it tends to interact with the insulin_receptor irs thus examining grb physical_interactions regardless of cellular_context will

framework that aims to capture the context dependence of molecular_interactions there are several methods that search for paths or transitions between functional contexts in interactomes e g in contrast the novelty of our approach is not in the consideration of context but rather in the proposed computational_model that allows for the consideration of multiple candidate context pairs for each molecular_interaction we provide a context sensitive algorithm that scores context specific paths leading from a source protein to a differentially_expressed gene the algorithm selects a single context pair per interaction based on the context selected for the preceding interaction in the path paths are then scored according to the selected context pairs and high_scoring paths are reported context dependence has often been associated with tissues or cell_types and with different biological_states such as cell_cycle or response to stimuli in this study we demonstrate our context sensitive framework by using gene_ontology go terms as the biological_context we first show the validity of the proposed model by using a set of manually_curated human pathways we then demonstrate the ability of the framework to identify relevant interaction paths by analysing the response of human primary lung cells to influenza_infection notably a significant fraction of the proteins that the algorithm predicted were indeed found to affect the infection process and the success_rate of the prediction was significantly correlated with the path score we implemented our proposed_framework as a tool contextnet which is publicly_available at http netbio bgu ac il contextnet our results include the proposed context sensitive framework its implementation as a tool a statistical assertion that known cellular_pathways in human are indeed context sensitive and finally the application of our framework to identify and interpret the proteins and pathways underlying the response of human cells to viral_infection a well known limitation of current computational_models of ppi_networks is the weak handling of interaction context ppi_network models are typically constructed by combining interactions from various measurements regardless of the biological_context in which they were measured such as specific stimuli tissues cellular_components and disease_states previous context sensitive approaches to network interpretation limited molecular_interaction pathways to a single context such as a single tissue or cell_type or followed a predefined context transition template e g defining a flow from membrane to nucleus here we presented a novel framework that assigns biological_context to molecular_interaction pathways while allowing for context variations and switches that may not be obvious to the outside observer before our analysis our framework also computes a context sensitivity score for the context annotated pathway which can be used to prioritize pathways to capture the dynamic context of molecular_interaction we added another dimension to the ppi_network model which takes_into for each node a set of labels corresponding to its potential functions we also added edges to connect these labels and set the weights of these edges to reflect the probability of transitions between the connected labels the weights of these transitions were inferred from known human pathways our model is also flexible enough to provide some support for poorly_annotated proteins by leaning on the labels assigned to their upstream and downstream neighbours this is achieved via special skip edges thus enabling the inclusion and interpretation of the of the interacting_proteins that are not yet annotated the proposed_framework can be generalized to handle various contexts in this study we used go terms as context labels and known human pathways as guides for constructing the labeltransitionscoring matrix our analysis of spike maps revealed that proteins in known pathways were mostly associated with go biological_process terms and not with molecular_function or cellular_component go terms therefore we focused our analysis on go biological_process terms which we further filtered to remove high entropy lowinformationcontent terms the remaining terms were associated with a relatively small number of genes median of genes per term including genes associated with descendent terms indicating the high_specificity of these terms we validated our framework using thousands of known human pathways we found that of the known paths of lengths three to five edges were indeed context sensitive we proved the use of our framework by applying it to reveal the molecular_interaction paths involved in viral_infection using our method we successfully identified biologically_relevant contextsensitive paths connecting viral_proteins with the downstream human transcriptional_response we implemented our framework as an interactive internet tool and made it publicly_available in http netbio bgu ac il contextnet we have shown the value of introducing go context to the analysis of signalling_pathways future work could include optimization variants of this problem that will be applicable to longer paths and to a wider scope of context for example the current algorithm selects the context of an interaction based on the context selected for the preceding interaction in the path important extensions would be to reflect longer contextual histories that go beyond the first order neighbourhoods and to extend the sought context units from linear paths to networks another extension would be to integrate additional context schemes such as pathway context enrichment network schemas semantic_similarity tissue associations or protein_localization and to enhance them with interaction confidence_scores the new framework we presented and its extensions may be applied to a variety of network related problems where context sensitive relationships are meaningful consisting of pairs of consecutive labels annotated by their frequencies we observed that some labels in p are non specific for example transcription_factor activity which always appears as the target node in every edge pointing to a transcription_factor therefore we applied an entropy measurement criterion to filter out non specific labels from f i e labels with high entropy for this we calculated for every ordered pair x y f the forward conditional_probability py j x occurrences of y after x total occurrences of x as well as the backward conditional_probability px j y occurrences of x prior to y total occurrences of y it is important to note that px j y and py j x are not necessarily the same therefore for each label x we computed its forward individual entropy hy j x across all occurrences of consecutive label pairs x y f as hy j x p y y py j xlogpy j x note that in the aforementioned formulation x is a specific label thus denoted by a lowercase letter and y is a random variable thus denoted by an uppercase letter all pairs x y f such that the forward individual entropy of label x was found to exceed a threshold were filtered out from f similarly we calculated the backward individual entropy hx j y p x x px j tlogpx j t for each label y and filtered out all pairs x y f such that the backward individual entropy of label y was found to exceed a threshold in between filtration steps both individual and pairwise label frequencies were re calculated based on the remaining labels in f finally we set mx y log py j x for all x y f we used terms covering genes which constitute of the interactome these terms were then filtered based on their entropy leaving terms covering genes which are of the interactome to examine the level within the go hierarchy of terms that is useful for context definition we computed the size of each go term appearing in m the size of a go term was defined as the number of genes associated with it including the genes associated with its descendant go terms we found that the go terms in the entropy filtered m had a median size of genes this indicates that go terms that have a small_size and therefore are low_level are more informative than high_level non specific terms that are associated with many genes the go terms participating in m their entropy and the number of genes they cover are provided in the
