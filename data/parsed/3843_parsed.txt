quantitative visualization of alternative exon expression from rna_seq motivation analysis of rna_sequencing rna_seq revealed that the vast_majority of human genes express multiple mrna isoforms produced by alternative pre_mrna and other mechanisms and that most alternative isoforms vary in expression between human tissues as rna_seq grow in size it remains_challenging to visualize isoform_expression across multiple samples results to help address this problem we present sashimi plots a quantitative visualization of aligned rna_seq that enables quantitative_comparison of exon usage across samples or experimental_conditions sashimi plots can be made using the broad integrated genome viewer or with a stand alone command_line program availability_and software code and documentation freely_available here to visualize exon_inclusion levels we developed sashimi plots given an input annotation of transcripts and spliced alignments of reads from a sample a region of interest is visualized in a sashimi plot using the following rules i alignments in exons are represented as read densities optionally normalized by length of genomic_region and coverage and ii splice_junction reads are drawn as arcs connecting a pair of exons where arc width is drawn proportional to the number of reads aligning to the junction or to the log of this number sashimi plots take as input spliced alignments in bam format and gene model annotations in gff format available from databases such as ensembl or custom made by user two implementations of sashimi plots are available i stand alone command_line implementation for making customizable publicationquality figures and ii an implementation built into the integrated genome viewer igv browser igv sashimi which enables dynamic creation of sashimi plots for any genomic_region of interest suitable for exploratory_analysis of isoform usage across experiments isoform_expression estimates generated by the miso algorithm are optionally plotted in sashimi plots sashimi plots can visualize alternative_splicing for use in figures or for rapid surveying of genomic_regions for differential isoform usage across multiple samples a sashimi plot generated by the stand alone program for four rna_seq samples is shown in samples are color_coded by condition with rna_seq samples from wild_type in red and mouse heart_tissues depleted for the splicing_factor muscleblind heartkoa heartkob in orange read densities across exons are normalized to obtain a measure of expression like rpkm or similar measures that incorporate library size and length of transcripts single_end junction reads are plotted as arcs that are optionally annotated with the raw number of junction reads present in each sample alternative isoforms from the input annotation are shown at bottom the plot inhighlights the differential splicing of the middle exon which appears to be predominantly included in the wild_type samples but mostly excluded in the knockout samples this difference is confirmed by the miso estimates for the inclusion of the exon which indicate that inclusion levels for the exon quantified as percent spliced in or w as in is in wild_type samples and only in the knockout samples users can customize the scales colours labels and other features of the plot through a text settings file for comparison ucsc visualization of the same data used to generate the sashimi inis shown in supplementary using dense and squish views while the dense view is compact supplementary it does not present a quantitative measure of exon_inclusion levels the squish view by contrast is too detailed for the task as each read is plotted supplementary finally tracks corresponding to samples with more coverage get allocated more space in the squish view making it challenging to visualize multiple samples an igv sashimi plot for the genomic_region containing the same alternative exon is shown ind with one wild_type heart sample shown in red and one knockout heart sample in blue the gff annotation of the alternatively_spliced exon is shown in the lower panel and refseq canonical transcripts for the gene are shown above the boundaries of the sashimi plot are determined by the region of interest shown in the igv browser window and can be altered to include more or fewer exons using the zoom in out feature of the browser the raw junction read_counts are shown on top of each junction arc in igv sashimi combines the compactness of a sashimi plot with the versatility of a genome_browser genomic_features apart from expression can be integrated into sashimi plots either programmatically or as tracks through the igv browser the sashimi plot code is freely_available accessible via github and can be used to combine isoform and exon expression levels with other genomic_data this code was recently extended to display splicing quantitative_trait sqtl alongside genotypic information the advent of significantly_longer high_throughput rna_seq can enable exact identification of some isoforms sashimi plots may then be used to display other features related to exon junction usage such as sqtls while extensible sashimi plots can become cluttered or hard to interpret in cases of complex alternative_splicing for genes that have tens or hundreds of expressed isoforms it remains a challenge for future work to distill rna_seq from such genes into quantitative and interpretable visualizations
