structural_bioinformatics evaluation of drug human_serum binding_interactions with support_vector aided online automated docking motivation human_serum hsa the most abundant plasma protein is well known for its extraordinary binding_capacity for both endogenous and exogenous substances including a wide_range of drugs interaction with the two principal binding_sites of hsa in subdomain iia site and in subdomain iiia site controls the free active concentration of a drug provides a reservoir for a long_duration of action and ultimately affects the adme absorption distribution metabolism and excretion profile due to the continuous demand to investigate hsa binding_properties of novel drugs drug_candidates and drug like compounds a support_vector svm model was developed that efficiently predicts albumin_binding our svm model was integrated to a free web_based prediction platform http albumin althotas com automated molecular docking_calculations for prediction of complex geometry are also integrated into the web_service the platform enables the users i to predict if albumin binds the query ligand ii to determine the probable ligand_binding site or site iii to select the albumin x_ray structure which is complexed with the most similar ligand and iv to calculate complex geometry using molecular docking_calculations our svm model and the potential offered by the combined use of in silico calculation_methods and experimental binding data is illustrated human_serum hsa a highly_soluble negatively_charged protein greatly augments the transport capacity of blood_plasma where it is present at a high concentration mm its effect is exerted by reversible_binding of a vast_array of chemically diverse exogenous and endogenous compounds this astonishing binding_capacity which often seriously impacts pharmacokinetic_properties of therapeutic_drugs is encoded in the secondary_structure of hsa to whom correspondence should be addressed namely the protein is composed of helix random coils with no sheets which gives the protein a high degree of conformational_flexibility the kda single polypeptide_chain of hsa consists of amino_acids and the individual helices are connected by disulfide_bonds to form structural loops each residue domain labeled i ii and iii from the n terminus contains helices connected by turns and are structurally very similar to one another the three homologous domains can be further divided_into six helix and four helix subdomains termed a and b which have a common four antiparallel helix core competitive displacement studies of sudlow et_al using fluorescent molecular_probes enabled the identification of two specific drug binding_sites termed in the literature as site subdomain iia and sitepage of the drug binding_site of hsa in subdomain iia being involved in forming ionic h bonding interactions with ligand_molecules prepared using the bxd pdb_file of the warfarinhsa complex side chain atoms are colored by atom_type carbon purple or pink nitrogen blue oxygen red note the two hydrophilic clusters of residues around the entrance lys lys arg arg and at the middle end tyr his arg of the binding_pocket some apolar residues are also shown b polar key_residues interacting with ligands bound at drug binding_site of hsa in subdomain iiia prepared using the bxg pdb_file of the ibuprofenhsa complex and iiia residues from subdomain ib close off the top of the site which has an extension toward the interdomain cleft stabilized by residues from subdomain iib val leu and iiia leu respectively the binding_pocket can be accessed through an open entrance of in diameter between helices h and h which faces subdomain iiia and thus is partially shielded from bulk_solvent the opening is surrounded by four basic_residues lys lys arg arg although the interior of the binding crevice is mainly apolar there is an additional cluster of polar_residues toward the middle end of the pocket tyr his arg the main volume of the pocket is separated by ile into two hydrophobic sub chambers just inside the hydrophilic entrance there is a third chamber formed by phe trp ala arg and leu trp is an important structural_element of site since rotation of its indole_ring enables certain ligands to be accommodated at the binding_site and to form stacking_interactions the large central_compartment of site is typically occupied by planar aromatic heterocyclic rings of the ligands which are inserted snugly between the ceiling and floor of the pocket represented by ala and leu respectively the enclosure of the guest_molecules within the pocket is driven by formation of multiple hydrophobic contacts with nonpolar site residues on the other hand acidic or electronegative peripherial groups of the ligands are oriented in the sub chamber formed around trp or toward the solvent accessible mouth of the cavity where they can form intermolecular h bonds with the basic_residues the additional basic patch on the middle opposite side of the pocket tyr his arg also enables hbond formation with ligand substituents x_ray data of compounds crystallized with hsa show in most cases h bonding with the phenolic oh of tyr suggesting the important contribution of this residue in ligand_binding at site appropriately sized molecules possessing two anionic functions on opposite ends such as l thyroxine and the uremic toxin carboxy methyl propyl furanpropanoic acid cmpf can form multiple h bonds at both sides of the pocket resulting high_affinity the site has ample binding room so that most compounds examined to date by x_ray method do not fill it completely due to this fact site is able to accommodate multiple_ligands simultaneously as has been demonstrated by crystal_structures of hsa with co binding pairs of azapropazone phenylbutazone azapropazone indomethacin and indomethacin myristic_acid fatty_acid fa binding induced conformational changes of hsa alter the structure of the site in the sense that it diverts tyr and to a lesser extent arg out of the pocket the carboxylate head of fas bound in the long and narrow channel located between subdomains ia and iia fa site forms h bonds with tyr arg and ser so these residues will be no longer available to interact with site ligands except for oxyphenbutazone however these changes have only a minor impact on the location and orientation of the bound ligands the site itself can also anchor a fatty_acid molecule but due to its low_affinity binding drug ligands of the site displace the lipid molecule site in subdomain iiia indole benzodiazepin site is topologically similar to site in a sense that both are composed of six helices of the corresponding subdomains which are arranged to form largely apolar cavities with defined polar features in contrast to site the entrance to site is exposed to solvent and its inner cavity is smaller and more rigid which features account for the pronounced stereoselectivity observed for bound compounds e g l tryptophan shows a fold_greater hsa affinity than the d enantiomer benzodiazepines exhibit conformational selectivity page the goal of the current work was to develop a model that accurately_predicts hsa binding_site of a ligand and the resulting complexgeometry a web_service has been established that utilizes the combined method for prediction of hsa binding a d structure of a ligand is used as input and hsa binding_characteristics are predicted a number of studies utilize different in silico methods for hsa binding prediction while both previous and our study are aimed at in silico prediction of albumin_binding there is a significant_difference between our and the previously_published models which makes direct comparisons impossible namely the published models have limited global applicability in contrast to our model because of the followings i the published models do not distinguish between site and site ligands this is a major_drawback of these studies as valid qsar calculations should be based on structurally related_molecules binding at the same site of the protein ii the models were designed to quantitatively predict the binding_affinity of compounds which bind to hsa while our method is capable to classify nonalbumin and albumin ligands iii the applied experimental methods binding_constant calculated from the retention time in a hplc column with immobilized hsa in are not accurate and the experimental_conditions using acetonitril in the eluent thus ligand_binding is investigated in a partly organic buffer do not reflect the real physiological_environment of albumin
