databases_and rbiopaxparser an r package to parse modify and visualize biopax data motivation biological_pathway data stored in structured databases is a useful source of knowledge for a wide_range of bioinformatics algorithms and tools the biological_pathway exchange biopax language has been established as a standard to store and annotate pathway_information however use of these data within statistical_analyses can be tedious on the other hand the statistical computing environment r has become the standard for bioinformatics_analysis of large_scale genomics data with this package we hope to enable r users to work with biopax data and make use of the always increasing amount of biological pathway_knowledge within data analysis methods results rbiopaxparser is a software_package that provides a comprehensive set of functions for parsing viewing and modifying biopax pathway data within r these functions enable the user to access and modify specific parts of the biopax model furthermore it allows to generate and layout regulatory graphs of controlling interactions and to visualize biopax pathways availability rbiopaxparser is an open_source r package and has been submitted to bioconductor the past_years have seen an enormous increase in biological_knowledge about cellular signalling and regulatory_pathways which is stored in numerous databases however the fragmentation of the available pathway data led to the need for a standardized language to ease the knowledge exchange between scientists the biological_pathway exchange biopax language is an ontology that models biological_pathway concepts and their relationships implemented in the web_ontology owl an rdf xml_based format it allows the user to encode pathway_knowledge in a well documented and standardized way the integration of biological_knowledge stored in these databases into high_level analysis methods for genomics experiments is a fundamental issue bioinformaticians can integrate pathway_knowledge collected and curated by the scientific_community into statistical_analysis as previous_knowledge examples for methods for high_level data analysis that require previous pathway_knowledge are gene_set specialized classification algorithms for personalized_medicine or network_reconstruction algorithms many of these algorithms are implemented using the r project for statistical computing although the packages ncigraph kegggraph and graphite on bioconductor offer exports of signalling_networks from specific databases no packages exist that allow the user to conveniently work with biopax data in r we created the r package rbiopaxparser to ease use and integration of pathway data in the biopax format within r furthermore the use of r scripts allows reproducible handling and manipulation of pathway data as well as the integration of these data into high_level statistical_analysis routines the rbiopaxparser is a freely_available r package that allows the user to parse modify and visualize biopax models regulatory graphs can be extracted and used for further analyses with this r package we also hope to enable users to apply newly_developed algorithms to the always increasing amount of knowledge about biological_pathways by implementing a biopax parser we offer a tool for r users to ease the task of integrating existing pathway resources in statistical_analyses and encourage the use of a standardized way to encode pathway_knowledge
