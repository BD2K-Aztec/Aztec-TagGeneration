genome_analysis acgh spline an r package for acgh dye bias normalization motivation the careful normalization of array_based acgh data is of critical importance for the accurate detection of copy_number changes the difference in labelling affinity between the two fluorophores used in acghusually cy and cy can be observed as a bias within the intensity distributions if left unchecked this bias is likely to skew data interpretation during downstream_analysis and lead to an increased number of false_discoveries results in this study we have developed acgh spline a natural cubic spline interpolation method followed by linear_interpolation of outlier values which is able to remove a large portion of the dye bias from large acgh datasets in a quick and efficient manner conclusions we have shown that removing this bias and reducing the experimental_noise has a strong positive impact on the ability to detect accurately both copy_number cnv and copy_number cna recent advancements in array_based acgh technology enable entire genomes to be scanned for copy_number changes using high_resolution oligonucleotide tiling arrays in particular it is now possible to design the content of arrays with a high degree of flexibility as a number of companies offer rapid custom array generation as a standard service due to the particular needs of specific experimental questions microarrays frequently contain oligonucleotide_probes displaying variable performance particularly when designs are targeted towards regions of the genome with complex architecture for example regions containing repetitive_sequences are important for studies of both copy_number cnv and copy_number cna and often need to be included in array designs replication hot_spots contain large_numbers of repetitive structures and often underlie the mechanisms for copy_number break_point formation which include non allelic homologous_recombination nahr non_homologous nhej and fork_stalling to whom correspondence should be addressed and template switching fostes mechanisms probe performance in and around replication hot_spots in repetitive_regions is often poor and characterized by heterogeneous probe response this variable probe response increases the general noise and number of outliers seen across an array which in turn can cause problems during normalization with ever increasing array resolution and complexity the need for a consistent efficient universal normalization method has become of greater_importance it is well established that a bias exists between the two fluorophores cy and cy due to differential efficiency in enzymatic labelling this bias manifests as a difference between the two resulting intensity distributions and if left uncorrected is highly likely to skew the ratio calculated during downstream_analysis over the years there have been a number of different approaches taken for dye bias removal including both linear_and methods these methods were primarily developed for the normalization of expression microarrays and have more recently been applied to acgh microarrays the most commonly used and widely trusted dye bias normalization_methods tend to be based on lowess locally weighted regression techniques however standard regression techniques can be sensitive to outliers which are common features of acgh data as a result lowess based dye bias normalization approaches normally use robust regression techniques becoming computationally_intensive and severely limiting if applied to microarrays comprising probes normalization_methods based on fitting smoothing spline functions have most often been seen in relation to between chip quantile normalization of microarrays and although promising work has been carried_out previously have thus far seldom been applied to two colour acgh microarray_data one possible explanation for this is that when fitting a spline curve only a subset of data is used and without appropriate action can lead to inaccurate data adjustment when applied to complex datasets here we describe an efficient robust normalization method using natural cubic spline interpolation acgh spline which consistently removes in a computationally_efficient manner the dye biases seen across a large range of acgh data in this study we have shown that acgh spline enables efficient dye bias removal on acgh profiles giving similar if not superior results to several approaches available within the r programming environment interestingly acgh spline not only increases data_quality by reducing the experimental_noise but also decreases the fdr and in the majority of situations removing a large portion of the dye bias reduces the inherent noise of acgh profiles and decreases the magnitude of falsely elevated or lowered log_ratio values estimating experimental variability can be difficult with highly rearranged or aneuploid samples where the majority of data_points respond to an altered copy_number state thus falsely increasing noise estimations we chose to use two different estimations of the systematic noise in acgh profiles i the rp th_percentile of the absolute log ratiovalues which gives an accurate estimation of the spread of the noise within the centralized log_ratio distribution ii the dlrs that measure the probe to probe noise across the array although both of these measures are to some degree insensitive to outliers using a combination of the two is necessary for accurate quality_control of acgh data indeed by using the dlrs value alone as a quality_control qc metric it is possible to miss subtle artefacts within the dataset for example the auto correlation or wave profile often seen in acgh data will not be well reflected by a dlrs value additionally by using only the rp value as a qc measure the noise estimation of highly_variable datasets e g annioploid samples can be compromised as the use of ultra_high microarrays becomes a standard for acgh analysis it is important to be aware of the potential for increased fdrs using a custom microarray comprising million probes in our hands leads to the detection of cnvs with a fdr of which is usually considered as an acceptable cut_off this analysis would include false_discoveries decreasing fdrs is of great_importance for the identification of cnvs associated with disease or evolution and for avoiding_unnecessary and wasteful validation of results acgh spline is efficient for the normalization of arrays with million data_points and performs consistently over a range of data complexities and this method is particularly useful for the processing of large_numbers of ultra_high microarray_datasets although all of the results presented here have been generated using agilent acgh arrays the method can be applied to any dual colour microarray_data the acgh spline r package contains various functions for the reading and writing of standard microarray data_formats including the complex feature_extraction data format from agilent the generation of qc statistics and the plotting of data the package is deliberately distributed with mild default_parameters see acgh spline documentation in supplementary_material and aims to include only data_points that are representative of the dye bias within the spline fit this reduces page
