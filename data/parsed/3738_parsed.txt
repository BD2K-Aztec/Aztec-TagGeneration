protannot an app for integrated genome_browser to display how alternative_splicing and transcription affect proteins one gene can produce multiple transcript variants encoding proteins with different functions to facilitate visual_analysis of transcript variants we developed protannot which shows protein annotations in the context of genomic_sequence protannot searches interpro and displays profile matches protein annotations alongside gene models exposing how alternative promoters splicing and end_processing add remove or remodel functional_motifs to draw attention to these effects protannot color codes exons by frame and displays a cityscape graphic summarizing exonic sequence at each position these techniques make visual_analysis of alternative transcripts faster and more convenient for biologists availability_and protannot is a plug in app for integrated genome_browser an open_source desktop genome_browser available from http www bioviz org many genes produce multiple transcript variants due to alternative_splicing alternative promoters and alternative end_processing often these transcript variants encode_proteins with different amino_acid and thus different functions we and other groups have often used protein annotation methods to detect when this occurs for example we used blocks interpro and tm hmm to show that alternative transcription frequently remodels or deletes conserved_regions and trans membrane spans in human and mouse proteins however even now it is difficult for biologists to perform similar analysis using web_tools biologists can identify conserved_regions in proteins encoded by different splice_variants but mapping those regions back onto gene structures is time consuming and error_prone to address this we developed protannot as a new plug in extension for the integrated genome_browser igb igb is a highly interactive desktop genome_browser that helps biologists explore and analyze experimental_data from genomics especially rna_seq using protannot together with igb users can achieve deeper insight into how alternative transcription affects protein_sequence and function protannot enables fast efficient visual_analysis of the impact of alternative transcription on proteins by extending standard genome_browser iconography in which linked blocks represent transcript structures and block thickness indicate translated regions protannot improves on this in three ways first it uses exon fill colors to show the frame of translation revealing frame shifts across transcript variants by comparing exon colors between transcripts a user can quickly determine if they encode the same protein without having to zoom in to see the amino_acid protannot benefits users by exposing how gene structures affect protein_sequence and function as such protannot complements the mi bundle another igb extension that links genomic_features to protein interaction and structure viewers like mi bundle protannot highlights relationships between the language of dna exons introns codons and the more structure oriented
