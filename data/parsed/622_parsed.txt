structural_bioinformatics automatic rebuilding and optimization of crystallographic structures in the protein_data motivation macromolecular crystal_structures in the protein_data pdb are a key source of structural insight into biological_processes these structures some years old were constructed with methods of their era with pdb redo we aim to automatically optimize these structures to better fit their corresponding experimental_data passing the benefits of new methods in crystallography on to a wide base of non crystallographer structure users results we developed new algorithms to allow automatic rebuilding and remodeling of main_chain peptide_bonds and side_chains in crystallographic electron_density and incorporated these and further enhancements in the pdb redo procedure applying the updated pdb redo to the oldest but also to some of the newest models in the pdb corrects existing modeling errors and brings these models to a higher quality as judged by standard validation methods availability_and the pdb redo database and links to all software are available at http www cmbi ru nl pdb redo the protein_data makes experimentally_derived models of proteins and other macromolecules available to a multidisciplinary community all the way from structural biologists bioinformaticians and molecular_biologists of all flavors to high_school teachers and even the general public the vast_majority of macromolecular models in the pdb are derived by x_ray over decades a diverse community of crystallographers has optimized these models to fit the experimental_data using the software and computers available at their time building an initial model in the electron_density ed map has been automated to a significant extent with software like arp warp resolve buccaneer and others but the final steps in model_building and refinement are typically left to the user due to lack of attention and time and also sometimes because of simple ignorance or even incompetence some models that are submitted in the pdb are of lower_quality than what could be expected given the advent of crystallographic methods and the outstanding tools that are available at the same time older structure models start to lag behind in structure quality since the current software was not available at the time of their deposition to overcome these effects we built the pdb redo pipeline which employing the structure refinement software refmac can automatically optimize most of the existing structures to derive improved up to date structure models based on the original experimental_data that were deposited with the atomic_coordinates in the pdb the first version of the pdb redo pipeline merely optimized coordinates b factors and other model_parameters within the convergence radius of the refmac refinement engine but would not correct modeling errors which would typically require human intervention a wealth of validation algorithms e g in procheck what check molprobity or coot exists all using in various ways our increasing_knowledge of macromolecular structure to extract quality_criteria which enable to pinpoint likely errors in macromolecular models the pdbreport databank for example shows that there exist unusual peptide_bond conformations and unusual side chain rotamers all these algorithms suggest that many features of models already in the pdb are likely wrong but no automated mechanism currently exists to decide if a better modeling of specific areas would be better consistent with the validation criteria correct these errors where applicable and make the new corrected models available to the user community granted the task of a well trained crystallographer correcting such errors with the help of interactive graphics programs such as coot and o guided by the model validation software is rather trivial however no matter how trivial correcting these errors might be it is extremely unlikely that the authors of the tens_of of models in the pdb keep correcting them as better validation building and refinement methods are developed at the same time providing the same tools to current day practicing crystallographers can help correcting errors prior to deposition the new automated software we introduce implements wellestablished crystallographic practices peptide flips and building side chain rotamers the emphasis and novelty in these algorithms is in decision_making and in full automation eliminating the need for any user decision and bringing uniformity to the process of creating the final molecular_models that are based on x_ray crystallographic data
