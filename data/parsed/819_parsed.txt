sequence_analysis branch boosting rna_seq assemblies with partial or related genomic_sequences motivation de_novo transcriptome_assemblies of rna_seq are important for genomics applications of unsequenced organisms owing to the complexity and often incomplete representation of transcripts in sequencing libraries the assembly of high_quality transcrip tomes can be challenging however with the rapidly_growing number of sequenced_genomes it is now feasible to improve rna_seq assemblies by guiding them with genomic_sequences results this study introduces branch an algorithm designed for improving de_novo transcriptome_assemblies by using genomic_information that can be partial_or genome_sequences from the same or a related organism its input includes assembled rna reads transfrags genomic_sequences e g contigs and the rna reads themselves it uses a customized version of blat to align the trans frags and rna reads to the genomic_sequences after identifying exons from the alignments it defines a directed_acyclic and maps the transfrags to paths on the graph it then joins and extends the transfrags by applying an algorithm that solves a combinatorial_optimization called the minimum weight minimum path cover with given paths in performance tests on real_data from caenorhabditis_elegans and saccharomyces_cerevisiae assisted by genomic contigs from the same species branch improved the sensitivity and precision of transfrags generated by velvet oases or trinity by and respectively these improvements added complete transcripts and proteins to the initial assembly similar improvements were achieved when guiding the branch processing of a transcriptome_assembly from a more complex organism mouse with genomic_sequences from a related species rat recent_advances ngs_technologies have transformed de_novo sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes into routine tasks that are not only feasible for large sequencing centers anymore but also for individual research groups the main factors_driving this development are reduced ngs run costs and improvements of sequence volume and read_length although it is now relatively straightforward to obtain a draft shotgun sequence of a new genome fragmented into thousands of contigs and scaffolds the finishing and annotation steps of a complete_genome are still very time consuming tasks transcriptome_sequencing can be often a much more targeted alternative especially when working with large_genomes or projects where the expressed gene sequences are the main features of interest to gain insight into the functionally_relevant regions e g proteins encoded in a genome for an unsequenced organism this includes the sequencing and assembly of rna samples where most of the genes of interest are expressed followed by functional_annotation routines of the assembled transcripts using sequence_similarity against protein reference_databases subsequently one can perform rna_seq gene_expression experiments where the assembled transcripts serve as reference in the read_mapping step challenges related to transcriptome_sequencing and assembly include the following i abundance differences of rna_sequences make it difficult to obtain rna samples_representing most of the expressed genes of an organism and ii secondary_structures as well as instability of rna_molecules can result in uneven read_coverage of the underlying rna_sequences as a result transcriptome_assemblies will usually only represent a subpopulation of genes in a genome and the assembled rna_sequences are often fragmented or incomplete with respect to their full_length this study proposes a new method named branch for improving the completeness of de_novo transcriptome_assemblies by making use of partial_or genomic sequence_information from the same or closely_related it involves the initial de_novo of the rna_seq to transfrags and dna_reads to genomic contigs using existing ngs assembly software for both types of data for instance the genomic reads can be assembled with velvet abyss allpaths soapdenovo or idba whereas the rna reads can be assembled with de_novo transcriptome assemblers like velvet oases trinity trans abyss soapdenovo trans or t idba in a downstream transcriptome_assembly enhancement step the genomic contig information is used to identify novel exons extend incomplete transfrags and join fragmented ones using the branch algorithm introduced in this study this hybrid_approach of guiding transcriptome_assemblies with preliminary genomic_sequencing information is a practical and cost_effective possibility as one can sequence nowadays a genomic sample of a gb genome of interest at coverage with the read output from only flow cell lanes of a modern ngs instrument technically the collection and sequencing of a genomic sample is also very straightforward and stability issues or abundance variations of sequences are less a concern with genomic_dna than rna alternatively the genome contigs can be substituted by an existing genome_sequence from a related species with high enough dna sequence_identity usually to the rna_seq sample this option eliminates the need for generating the genomic contig dataset the genomic_sequences provide an additional backbone of evidence for improving de_novo transcriptome_assemblies by minimizing their typical errors and limitations such as incomplete transfrags e g missing exons fragmented transfrags chimeric transfrags and so forth owing to low read_coverage and base_calling errors when aligning the transfrags and rna_seq against given genomic contigs one can extend and correct many of these fragmented or incomplete transfrags for instance two transfrags aligned next to each other on the same contig can be joined if a sufficient number of rna reads can be aligned to support this merger similarly a transfrag can be extended if the rna read_coverage along the corresponding region of the genomic_sequences indicates a truncated transcript_sequence because genomic contigs also contain errors it is important to allow in this process only those transfrag modifications that are supported by high_quality alignments branch contains features that intersect in parts with reference based splice_variant assembly tools sometimes referred to as ab_initio assemblers such as the identification of splice_variants from rna sequence_alignments against a reference what makes branch distinct from these tools is that it is designed to maximize the number and completeness of exons contained in preassembled transfrags guided by partial_or genome_sequences from the same or a closely_related organism it does this even for sequence_regions with low rna read_coverage this functionality is novel and relevant for de_novo transcriptome_assembly projects of unsequenced or only partially sequenced_genomes because the additional exonic sequence_information will contribute to the functional annotatability of the coding_regions of rna_sequences in downstream protein similarity_searches
