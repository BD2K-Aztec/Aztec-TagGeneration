structural_bioinformatics accessibility of microrna binding_sites in metastable rna_secondary in the presence of snps motivation we study microrna mirna bindings to metastable rna_secondary close to minimum_free conformations in the context of single_nucleotide snps and messenger_rna mrna concentration levels i e whether features of mirna bindings to metastable conformations could provide_additional supporting the differences in expression levels of the two sequences defined by a snp in our study the instances mrna utr snp mirna were selected based on strong expression_level analyses snp locations within binding regions and the computationally_feasible identification of metastable conformations results we identified basic cases mrna snp mirna of utr lengths ranging from up to nt reported in recent_literature and we analyzed the number structure and mirna binding to metastable conformations within an energy offset e above mfe conformations for each of the instances the mirna binding_characteristics are determined by the corresponding starmir output among the different parameters we introduced and analyzed we found that three of them related to the average depth

levels of micrornas mirnas and their putative messenger_rna mrna_targets has become a major topic in mirna research experimentally_evaluated a parameterized analytical expression that estimates the number of genes g having t transcripts present in a single_cell the parameters are adjusted based on microarray_data for a large_number extracted from single embryonic mouse neural_stem where the actual aim is the comparison of transcript numbers in phenotypically identical cells the authors conclude from observed data for genes that the typical number of gene_copies lies between with of genes having copies in a single_cell although the analysis is carried_out for a specific cell_type the authors expect similar distribution results for a wide_range provide experimental_evidence that short rnas mirnas and sirnas having a higher number of target_transcripts within a single_cell will downregulate each individual target_gene to a lesser extent than those with a lower number of targets which implies that the competition between target_genes for a limited number of small_rnas may determine the degree of downregulation see alsofor the concept of competing mrnas associated with the number and distribution of multiple binding_sites provide data supporting the assumption that endogenous mirnas preferentially target_mrnas with long utrs the authors also discussamong other featuresthe interaction between exogenous and endogenous mirnas and critically_assess the value of microarray_data in the context of mirna_target the sequencing method developed bysupports the assertion that only the most abundant mirnas mediate target suppression for example deep_sequencing of monocyte cells revealed the presence of mirnas with only of the mirnas showing suppressing_activity for of the targets the corresponding mirna was expressed reads million for the mirna_target prediction_tool targetscan demonstrate how predictions may improve if target abundance is accounted for in binding scores the impact of the life_cycle of mrnas on sirna and mirna efficacy is studied in the authors draw the conclusion that mirna_target could be improved if data about mrna turnover_rates are incorporated into prediction_tools althoughwhere x m and x s are the mrna and sirna concentrations k m is the mrna transcription_rate d m the basal mrna degradation_rate and x m x s is the sirna induced mrna degradation_rate the models differ in the assumption about x m x s and are fitted to experimental_data obtained for a single sirna targeting the coding_region of the egfp mrna the authors obtain the best fit for x m x s px m x h s q h x h s with h p min and q pmol within a similar to whom correspondence should be addressed framework study the so_called mirnamediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription_factor regulates an mirna together with a set of target_genes and the mathematical_models studied byadditionally account for the concentration level of the argonaute protein complex study analytically the impact of multiple small_non on the regulation of a single target_mrna and subsequently the dynamics of protein production combine the concept of mirna binding_site accessibility with mirna and mrna concentration levels for t anddenoting the equilibrium final concentrations of the mirna target_mrna and of the hybridized structure respectively the authors use the equilibrium condition st st expg c where g is the energy score that accounts for making the binding_site accessible and the free_energy of the hybridized structure the constant c stands for the product of the gas constant and the temperature combining the equilibrium condition with conservation of mass equations for initial_concentrations s and t eventually leads to an analytical expression forin terms of s t and g where the latter is calculated for a particular binding_site marin and vanio ek introduce a new accessibility based algorithm that uses a statistical_analysis of all putative_binding for a given mirna utr pair among the top target predictions for fruit_fly mirnas the algorithm finds more than twice as many validated targets compared with other accessibility based target prediction_methods reviews of existing mirna_target prediction_tools and information about latest_developments can be found in the target prediction_tool cometa designed byoperates on the assumption that targets of a given mirna are coexpressed with each other the target prediction score is based on the evaluation of thousands of publicly_available microarray_data for the human mirnas analyzed in the study of the validated targets fall within the first of predicted targets which however could be a large number in a similar way the tool mirror designed bycombines scores produced by an ensemble of established mirna_target prediction_tools with rankings obtained from gene_expression and hits_clip data consider the problem of selecting an antisense sequence that is able to effectively bind to a target_mrna and block protein_synthesis one of the key features of the authors method is the presuppositions that mrna secondary_structures are in a constant state of flux and are assuming different suboptimal states which also determines the approach taken in the present article johnson and srivastava designed a tool that generates and compares suboptimal secondary_structures of a given mrna sequence the comparison aims at identifying regions that are least similar among the set of folded structures which indicates volatility in intramolecular hydrogen_bonding such regions are seen as candidates for antisense binding the method is evaluated on six mrna_sequences and compared with results produced by the soligo application of sfold in our article we study mirna bindings to sets of metastable secondary_structures induced by utrs and their mutated counterparts where the single_nucleotide snps are located within the mirna binding_site briefly mention the analysis of mirna bindings to metastable conformations the authors compare the prediction_performance over samples of secondary_structures without constraints to samples of metastable conformations they report the sample of conformations is more favourable in our approach we discriminate between metastable conformations with regard to depth and average opening energies the impact of snps on minimum_free mrna conformations has been comprehensively studied in the authors analyzed a total number of snps in genes the minimum_free conformations were calculated by using rnafold the authors provide a great variety of data about the distribution of snps within mrna_transcripts and their effect on minimum_free values of secondary_structures as well as on the profile of the ensemble of suboptimal structures and structures with highin the utr of the human ftl gene in conjunction with associated snps that restore the overall wild_type ensemble of secondary_structures thus leading to the notion of structure stabilizing haplotypes the authors also analyzed the stabilizing_effect of multiple structure stabilizing haplotypes on binding_sites of mirnas and rna_binding nine cases of utrs and one case of utr as pointed_out by the authors the findings_suggest that certain snp_pairs are conserved in the human population because they stabilize ensembles of mrna conformations recently databases have become available that report snp data in the context of mirna bindings for example mirdsnp polymirts microsniper and the related tool rnasnp sethupathy and collins critically_assess several genetic_association related mirna bindings and the potential impact of snps in bindings regions the authors highlight the importance of follow_up functional experiments for a deeper_understanding of the real effect mirna target_site variations may have on the development of various human_diseases consequently we researched for our analysis the recent_literature for studies on the impact of snps on mirna bindings meeting the following four conditions i the expression levels of both alleles involved are analyzed experimentally by snp_genotyping for some instances a combination of clinical association studies and strong in silico results or related methods involving pcr experiments ii the underlying allele information can be extracted as consistent data from the ncbi_database the dbsnp database and the ensembl_database utr transcripts iii the mirna bindings are predicted by the latest_version of starmir at least for the allele with the stronger inhibitory_effect with the snp position being inside the binding region and iv identifying all metastable conformations within an energy offset e above mfe conformations is computationally_feasible utr length nt meeting all four conditions at least to a certain extent reduced the number of case studies we found to a small set of rna instances when executing step a we applied the standard settings of rnasubopt and barriers where isolated base_pairings are not permitted and free_energy values are discriminated with an accuracy of kcal_mol the setting of e depends on the length of the utr and was selected in such a way that a sufficiently_large number of metastable conformations is available for analyzing ms k with k along with the energy offset e we tried to restrict metastable_states to deep local_minima the parameter d indicates the depth of a local minimum or escape height from a local minimum which is taken from the barrier tree as the distance to the nearest saddle_point by jsecstruc w s j short for both cases of jsecstruc weak j and jsecstruc strong j we denote the number of secondary_structures returned by rnasubopt for an offset e above the mfe conformation where the index w indicates the allele with the weaker and s with the stronger mirna inhibitory_effect binding predictionfor orai rs mir a p analogously jms w s j is the number of local_minima within the e range with an escape height larger or equal to d of the instances we analyzed instances are sensitive to the parameters g ind g asc n r n and d n open we introduced in equation until equations for rap a l slightly larger values of e did not create differences between basic_parameters for both alleles and eventually led to an unmanageable size of data for standard desktop computer configurations the absence of experimental_data about copy_numbers of mrna_transcripts considered in the present study prevents the selection of a particular value of d n open or of the other two highlighted parameters which is why we considered three representative values of n simultaneously without calculating p values the upper_bound of n is motivated by the data provided in seethere the data provided inindicate that g mfe g tot g n not necessarily contribute to a deeper insight into mirna binding_patterns to different alleles see also the discussion of instances in section in particular g tot and g n are related only to free_energy values of metastable structures which is why a further discrimination by the depth of metastable conformations and the opening energy of binding regions was introduced consequently we focus in the summary of findings presented inon the values_calculated for g asc n r n and d n open in the row starmirtotal indicates by that

not available for the mrna_transcripts we consider in the present study to avoid the inclusion of irrelevant data by averaging or thresholding we consider a best case scenario for each instance we select a value of n in such a way that the support of the mirna binding to the allele identified in the underlying literature source s case is maximized in case of multiple n values for instances same
