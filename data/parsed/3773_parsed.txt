prsice polygenic risk_score software a polygenic risk_score prs is a sum of trait associated alleles across many genetic_loci typically weighted by effect_sizes estimated from a genome_wide the application of prs has grown in recent_years as their utility for detecting shared_genetic aetiology among traits has become appreciated prs can also be used to establish the presence of a genetic signal in under powered studies to infer the genetic_architecture of a trait for screening in clinical_trials and can act as a biomarker for a phenotype here we present the first dedicated prs software prsice precise for calculating applying evaluating and plotting the results of prs prsice can calculate prs at a large number of thresholds high_resolution to provide the best fit prs as well as provide results calculated at broad p value thresholds can thin single_nucleotide snps according to linkage_disequilibrium and p value or use all snps handles genotyped and imputed data can calculate and incorporate ancestry informative variables and can apply prs across multiple_traits in a single run we exemplify the use of prsice via application to data on schizophrenia major depres sive disorder and smoking illustrate the importance of identifying the best fit prs and estimate a p value significance threshold for high_resolution prs studies availability_and prsice is written in r including wrappers for bash data management scripts and plink to minimize computational time prsice runs as a command_line program with a variety of user options and is freely_available for download from http prsice info contact the polygenic model of human phenotypes has long been hypothesized but only in recent_years have the results from genomewide association study gwas revealed that much of the genetic_basis for most complex_traits comprises small effects of hundreds or even thousands of variants for clinical_outcomes this polygenic effect can be considered a genetic_liability to disease risk while prediction of phenotype from an individuals genetic_profile is compromised by this polygenicity the application of polygenic risk scores prs has shown that prediction is sufficiently accurate for a number of applications a prs for an individual is a summation of their genotypes at variants genome_wide weighted by effect_sizes on a trait of interest effect_sizes are typically estimated from published gwas results and only variants exceeding a p value threshold p t are included since even large gwas achieve only marginal evidence for association for many causal_variants prs are usually calculated at a set of p value thresholds e g p t with no effect and using effect_size estimates from published gwas can provide a reliable_indicator of genetic_liability this has motivated several other applications including polygenic mendelian randomisation where causality of potential intermediate phenotypes in a disease pathway can be tested use of prs as biomarkers and the enrolment of clinical trial_participants according to risk here we describe the first dedicated and fully_automated software_package for the application of prs prsice prsice has a high_resolution option that returns the best fit prs has a flexible set of user options intended to capture current standard practices in prs studies and the different applications of prs and produces plots for inspection of results we also perform a simulation_study to estimate a p value significance threshold for high_resolution prs studies here we illustrate the use of prsice to test for shared_genetic aetiology between traits we first investigate the genetic_relationship between schizophrenia scz and major_depressive mdd both known to be complex and comorbid we apply prsice to replicate the finding bythat scz prs can predict mdd status using the radiant uk mdd case control data_set supplementary note s applying prsice we remove snps in linkage_disequilibrium and include principal_components to control for population_structure we find significant evidence that scz prs predict mdd status and under the approach of only testing prs at several broad p value thresholds find the most predictive threshold at p t next we repeat the analysis using high_resolution prs supplementary note s and find the most predictive prs at p t the prs at p t explains of the variation in mdd nagelkerke r p whereas the high_resolution best fit prs explains p and is based on fewer snps rather than next we apply prsice to two tobacco related_phenotypes from the tag consortium and the radiantuk mdd data these analyses reveal for the first time shared_genetic aetiology between the dichotomous trait ever smoked and mdd but not between smoking consumption as a quantitative_trait and mdd supplementary in the former high_resolution scoring again produces a substantially different best fit prs than that from broad p t in terms of model_fit significance and number of snps included supplementary under high_resolution prs in particular multiple tests are performed and so the p value of the best fit prs will be inflated therefore we perform a permutation study utilizing the scz and mdd data described above and estimate an adjusted significance threshold for the best fit prs of p supplementary note s prior to a more extensive study we suggest a more conservative significance threshold of p if using the best fit prs for association testing in prs studies here we have described our prsice software illustrating its use with three prs studies we have illustrated the potential benefit of obtaining the best fit prs and have estimated a corresponding significance threshold there is great_potential for the future_application of prs in genetics for gaining insights into the genetic_architecture of a trait by comparing observed prs with theoretical expectations across a range of p t for assessing the genetic overlap of a trait s across populations for use as biomarkers as instrumental_variables or even to provide evolutionary insights the prs approach and prsice software could be extended to test the effects of copy_number epigenetic markers and more we believe bar plot from prsice showing results at broad p value thresholds for schizophrenia prs predicting mdd status a bar for the best fit prs from the high_resolution run is also included high_resolution prsice plot for scz predicting mdd status the thick line connects points at the broad p value thresholds ofprsicethat prsice can simplify prs studies greatly expand the application of prs and aid the implementation of best practice in prs studies
