systems_biology pathway activity profiling papi from the metabolite profile to the metabolic_pathway activity motivation metabolomics is one of the most recent omics_technologies and uses robust analytical_techniques to screen low_molecular metabolites in biological_samples it has evolved very quickly during the last decade however metabolomics datasets are considered highly complex when used to relate metabolite_levels to metabolic_pathway activity despite recent_developments in bioinformatics which have improved the quality of metabolomics_data there is still no straightforward method capable of correlating metabolite level to the activity of different metabolic_pathways operating within the cells thus this kind of analysis still depends on extremely laborious and time consuming processes results here we present a new algorithm pathway activity profiling papi with which we are able to compare metabolic_pathway activities from metabolite profiles the applicability and potential of papi was demonstrated using a previously published_data from the yeast_saccharomyces papi was able to support the biological interpretations of the previously_published observations and in addition generated new hypotheses in a straightforward manner however papi is time consuming to perform manually thus we also present here a new r software_package papi which implements the papi algorithm and facilitates its usage to quickly compare metabolic_pathways activities between different experimental_conditions using the identified metabolites and their respective abundances as input the papi package calculates pathways activity scores which represents the potential metabolic_pathways activities and allows their comparison between conditions papi also performs principal_components and analysis_of or t test to investigate differences in activity level between experimental_conditions in addition papi generates comparative graphs highlighting up and down_regulated pathway activity availability these datasets are available inmetabolomics is one of the newest omics_technologies and has been evolving rapidly during recent_years combined with robust analytical_methods metabolomics is capable of screening large_numbers of low_molecular metabolites in biological_samples metabolites are intermediates of biochemical_reactions and are essential in linking different pathways within a biological system however metabolites are synthesized and modified by enzymes that are products of gene_transcription thus metabolite level is determined by a complex network of reactions in which many regulatory_processes involving metabolites enzymes mrnas and genes play an important part for this reason metabolomics has been considered essential for the validation of datasets generated by other omics_technologies and has been largely applied as a functional_genomics tool and as part of systems_biology studies however the convoluted nature of cell_metabolism where the same metabolite can participate in many different pathways makes the pathway activity analysis in particular the most difficult omics_data to interpret in addition as with any other post genomic technology metabolomics generates large_datasets requiring sophisticated bioinformatics_tools for their processing and analysis despite the analytical aspects of metabolomics e g quenching of metabolism metabolite extraction and data_acquisition being well advanced the correlation between metabolite level and metabolic_pathway activity is still considered a complex task to achieve consequently the biological_interpretation of metabolomics_data remains major bottlenecks in metabolome analysis as a result to assist with postgenomic data analysis of cell_metabolism a great number of proprietary and open_source software_packages have been developed during the last years by different companies e g analyzerpro for gc_ms and lc_ms data_mining by spectralworks ltd markerview tm for metabolomics and protein peptide biomarker profiling by applied_biosystems mass profiler professional by agilent technology and institutions e g bioconductor in addition many web_based databases are now available and provide_important metabolite diversity metabolic_pathways biochemical_reactions enzymes and genes among these the kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes kegg is one of the most popular databases and it is freely_available through http www genome jp kegg in addition kegg has application programming interfaces api that allow its use by external software consequently several computational toolsthe total number of metabolites associated with each pathway is recorded and the pathways are then ranked according to the number of metabolites with which they are associated the percentage of detected metabolic intermediates is then calculated for each listed pathway d finally we sum over the scores for each pathway to obtain the total pathway score s a e and normalize it by dividing by the proportion of metabolites detected from its respective pathway have been created to automatically access extract and manipulate the information contained in these databases http www genome jp kegg soap r an open_source environment developed for statistical computing www r project org is among those with hundreds of available packages developed for different purposes in particular keggsoap kegg db and keggorth which enable access to and therefore use of data from the kegg_database in a flexible way these significant advances in bioinformatics_tools have improved the quality of both the data generated by omics studies and the subsequent biological interpretations however when relating metabolite level to pathway activity there are only few tools available e g metpa pathway hunter tool ingenuity_pathway gene_set gsea and metabolite set enrichment_analysis msea and most of them require extensive data pre_processing and demand great knowledge about cellular metabolisms which increases the time spent and decreases the accessibility to the biological_interpretation here we present a new algorithm pathway activity profiling papi that using the metabolite profile and kegg_database compares the activity of metabolic_pathways between different experimental_conditions for this we defined a new measure for pathway activity which we called activity score as calculated for each pathway the as is based on the number of metabolites identified from each pathway and their relative_abundances as a result the as represents the likelihood that a metabolic_pathway is active inside the cell and consequently allows the comparison of metabolic_pathway activities however papi is considered time consuming if performed_manually thus we developed an r package papi which implements our new algorithm and facilitates its usage papi uses the data extracted from metabolomics experiments together with the kegg_database to generate relative ass papi includes functions to perform principal_component pca and either a ttest or analysis_of anova on the ass and to generate graphical summaries of the results the functions also enable the use of optional pop up dialog boxes making them more accessible to new r users we introduced and validated here a new algorithm papi and an r package papi able to correlate metabolomics datasets and metabolic_pathways activities in a high_throughput way doing so we are able to compare the activity of metabolic_pathways under different conditions which provides great support for hypothesis_generation and facilitates the biological_interpretation furthermore as kegg_database also supports enquires using protein and gene transcription_levels papi has the potential to combine data from different omics in one unique framework further simplifying the biological_interpretation of the data
