sequence_analysis art a next_generation read simulator art is a set of simulation tools that generate synthetic next_generation reads this functionality is essential for testing and benchmarking tools for next_generation data analysis including read_alignment de_novo and genetic_variation discovery art generates simulated sequencing_reads by emulating the sequencing_process with built in technology specific read error models and base_quality value profiles parameterized empirically in large sequencing_datasets we currently support all three major commercial next_generation roches illuminas solexa and applied_biosystems solid art also allows the flexibility to use customized read error model_parameters and quality profiles availability both source and binary software_packages are available at http www niehs nih gov research resources software art contact in the past_few high_throughput next_generation have effectively replaced earlier data types for genomewide studies measuring gene_expression changes and discovering genomic epigenetic variations and many tools were developed for analyzing such datasets simulated_data is indispensable for guiding tool development and evaluating tool performance and therefore it is essential to develop simulation software that can produce next_generation reads that captures the most essential characteristics of real_data currently available read simulation programs include wgsim from the samtools package for generating illumina sequencing_reads metasim for simulating metagenomic_data mason http seqan de projects mason html for both illumina and reads simseq https github com jstjohn simseq for illumina_reads and flowsim for reads although these programs work well in their domain there is a need for a read simulation program that can deal with all major sequencing_platforms and generate sequence_reads with both substitution and insertion_deletion indel_errors as appropriate for the error modes of each specific platform to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address department of biological_sciences rochester institute of technology rochester ny usa as a general simulator our art software was initially_developed for simulation_studies helping to design data_collection modalities of the genomes_project art has been subsequently used by many users worldwide to facilitate sequencing software_development art takes a set of dna_sequences representing e g a reference_genome and generates synthetic sequencing_reads in a way that mimics the technologyspecific sequencing_process art comes with a set of technologyspecific read error profiles but it can also take user supplied profiles to generate sequencing_data with customized read_length and error characteristics art can report simulated reads in the standard sam alignment format and ucsc bed files
