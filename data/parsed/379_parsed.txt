a novel algorithm for calling mrna m a peaks by modeling biological variances in merip_seq data motivation n methyl adenosine m a is the most prevalent mrna methylation but precise prediction of its mrna location is important for understanding its function a recent sequencing_technology known as methylated rna immunoprecipitation sequencing_technology merip_seq has been developed for transcriptome_wide profiling of m a we previously_developed a peak_calling algorithm called exomepeak however exomepeak oversimplifies data characteristics and ignores the reads variances among replicates or reads dependency across a site region to further improve the performance new model is needed to address these important issues of merip_seq data results we propose a novel graphical_model based peak_calling method metpeak for transcriptome_wide detection of m a sites from merip_seq data metpeak explicitly_models read_count of an m a site and introduces a hierarchical layer of beta variables to capture the variances and a hidden_markov to characterize the reads dependency across a site in addition we developed a constrained newtons method and designed a log barrier_function to compute analytically intractable positively constrained beta parameters we applied our algorithm to simulated and real_biological and demonstrated_significant in detection performance and robustness over exomepeak prediction results on publicly_available merip_seq datasets are also validated and shown to be able to recapitulate the known patterns of m a further validating the improved_performance of metpeak availability_and the package metpeak is implemented in r and c and additional details are available at https github com compgenomics metpeak contact compared with dna_methylation which is a well established and extensively_studied epigenetic phenomenon m a methylation in mrna is still largely an uncharted territory recent surge of interest comes mainly as a result of two groundbreaking studies that show high abundancy of m a in of transcripts in human and mouse cells a number of subsequent studies have provided significant insights into the mechanism as well as the functions of mrna m a methylation it is known now that the m a methyltransferase complex or the m a writer consists of wilms_tumor associating protein wtap methyltransferase like mettl and methyltransferase like mettl different from dna_methylation m a methylation is reversible and v c the author published_by we presented metpeak a novel graphical_model based peak_calling method for detecting m a sites from merip_seq data we formulated the m a peak_calling problem as an inference of the mixture of binomial distributions by introducing a hierarchical layer of beta_distribution to model the variances among m a sites in replicates we also used hmm_model to capture the reads dependency among the bins to find the solution to the inference problem we proposed a constrained newtons method for estimating the beta parameters and developed a fast inference mothed for estimating the m a peaks the method is suitable for processing merip_seq data with replicates and high variance which are common cases in merip_seq data we have compared metpeak with exomepeak both on simulated and real merip_seq datasets and the results showed that metpeak is highly_robust against the data variances and outliers and making far less fps than exomepeak finally prediction of metpeak on real merip_seq datasets have suggested that it precisely recapitulates the motif and distribution of m a sites as well as correctly predicting the methylation differences among these methyltransferases demonstrating the validity of metpeak
