sequence_analysis cassis and smips promoter based prediction of secondary metabolite gene_clusters in eukaryotic_genomes motivation secondary_metabolites sm are structurally_diverse natural_products of high pharmaceutical importance genes involved in their biosynthesis are often organized in clusters i e are co localized and co expressed in silico cluster prediction in eukaryotic_genomes remains problematic mainly due to the high variability of the clusters content and lack of other distinguishing sequence_features results we present cluster assignment by islands of sites cassis a method for sm cluster prediction in eukaryotic_genomes and secondary_metabolites by interproscan smips a tool for gen ome wide detection of sm key enzymes anchor genes polyketide_synthases non_ribosomal and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases unlike other tools based on protein similarity cassis exploits the idea of co regulation of the cluster genes which assumes the existence of common regulatory_patterns in the cluster promoters the method searches for islands of enriched cluster specific motifs in the vicinity of anchor genes it was validated in a series of cross_validation experiments and showed high_sensitivity availability_and cassis and smips are freely_available at https sbi hki jena de secondary_metabolites sm also often referred as natural_products are substances with outstanding diversity of biological_activities including pharmaceutically important ones e g antibiotic toxic immunosuppressant they are produced primarily by microorganisms fungi bacteria algae genes responsible for sm biosynthesis and also for modifications transport regulation etc are often organized in clusters here we define clusters as sets of co localized and co regulated_genes the products of which are presumably functionally connected in fungi sm clusters typically have modest sizes normally up to genes are characterized by tight co localization of successive genes and are often regulated by a cluster specific transcription_factor cstf which can be a part of the respective cluster in many cases also not cstf can regulate sm clusters recently an example of cross cluster regulation was described in fungi activation of the cstf of a cluster led to upregulation of another cluster on a different chromosome in addition to the own cluster in this example elucidation of the cluster specific motif helped to understand the mode of regulation of the second cluster two sm classes of particular importance are synthesized by multimodular megasynthases polyketide_synthases pks and nonribosomal_peptide nrps or pksnrps hybrids in eukaryotes in particular in fungi these enzymes are characterized by specific multidomain structure and large size which makes them easy to detect in the genomes the other cluster members however are more difficult to identify since the clusters content varies_greatly and there are no stable cluster markers i e genes that would always accompany a megasynthase this constitutes the first challenge for computational_prediction of clusters the second challenge is the scarcity of the experimental_data the main_body of experimental_evidence for sms and their biosynthetic_pathways comes from bacteria and is not always applicable to eukaryotes for instance amino_acid specificity of adenylation domains is quite well predictable from nrps structure in bacteria but the same models do not work for fungi fungal data are rather scanty in total clusters are fully described so_far collected in this study see supplementary most cluster prediction_tools developed heretofore depend on domain homology e g antismash smurf clusean or clustscan these tools rely on collections of protein_domains found in known clusters and predict new clusters by searching for these domains this approach works well for similar clusters but has difficulties when encountering new cluster members i e the proteins with new functions with domains unknown to the system besides it is known that not all successive genes in a cluster_region belong to the cluster e g at least four genes within the aflatoxin cluster are gap genes that are not conserved and not assigned to the aflatoxin or sterigmatocystin biosynthesis consideration of domains of the gap genes leads to erroneous predictions all these problems together with the limited number of eukaryotic template clusters make similarity based_methods errorprone and tending to overestimate the clusters lengths when applied to eukaryotes homology limitations might be bypassed by applying other approaches such as window averaged dna curvature profiles or methods relying on expression data like microarrays etc but these methods are limited in their applications the former is restricted to laea like regulated clusters the latter require expression data which can be problematic because most fungal clusters are silent under laboratory conditions and their induction is a challenging_task of all existing cluster predicting tools antismash is the most prominent reliable and very much recommendable to use nonetheless there is one type of useful information that is ignored by the similarity approach that is utilized by antismash the information about common tf_binding that characterize the clusters since the cluster genes are co regulated their promoters should share the transcription_factor tfbs for the common regulator taking_into this additional layer of information can improve the cluster prediction and supply with additional useful characteristics such as the shared regulatory pattern and the nature of the regulating cstf recently we suggested an approach to detect eukaryotic gene_clusters by estimating the density of binding_motifs for cstf the density must be higher within the clusters and lower although not completely_abolished in other parts of the genome the method and the tool based on the method is called motif density method mdm mdm showed high_specificity and was able to solve difficult_problems like distinguishing closely located clusters separated by just several genes the task unsolvable for similarity based tools after having solved the main problemthe usage of promoter information for cluster predictionwe wanted to improve the method making the algorithm more transparent and the tool easier to handle here we present cluster assignment by islands of sites cassis the further development and improvement of mdm we made several changes most importantly in the prediction algorithm which are described in detail in the methods section in short instead of estimating the motifs density in a sliding_window we applied a set of rules to identify the borders of the motif islands around the anchor gene the introduced changes improved the performance and made the algorithm simpler and more straightforward the cassis method is implemented in a tool with the same name an online version as well as downloads for windows and linux is available besides we added a small tool called secondary_metabolites by interproscan smips for the fast and easy genomewide detection of sm anchor genes e g pks nrps and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases dmats smips results can be directly sent to the cassis tool or used separately to describe the sm biosynthetic potential of a species clustering of genes implies their co localization co regulation and assignment to the same process in the case of sm this is a biosynthetic_pathway and or further processing of the product most of the approaches developed for the genome_wide cluster prediction rely on protein domain similarity thus they use the first and last properties of the clusters but ignore the co expression or co regulation our approach is in this sense complementary as it ignores the functional features of the proteins but considers the promoter information this constitutes both an advantage and a disadvantage of the approach the advantage is the consideration of a new yet unused layer of information promoters motifs sites which is moreover the key feature of the cluster definition the disadvantage is the neglect of the remaining information but this can be seen as a specialization indeed the similarity based tools exist and at least one of them antismash gives very good although not perfect predictions our aim is not to compete with antismash or to substitute it we suppose that the optimal predictions can be achieved by application of both tools simultaneously antismash is more sensitive but cassis is more precise and each of them supplies with specific information about the discovered clusters see supplementary motifs that are shared by the cluster genes and form in this way the basis of the cluster prediction have their own value as the potential tfbs of the clusters presumable regulator cassis provides the option to retrieve the motifs corresponding to the detected clusters moreover as the motifs occurrences are scanned genome_wide it is possible to find sub clusters also called super clusters which are groups of genes regulated by the same tf simultaneously with the main cluster but located in another part of the genome if a subcluster is large enough more than three genes it can be detected quite easily in the next versions of cassis we plan to implement such a feature like mdm cassis is not restricted to the prediction of sm clusters other types of gene_clusters can be represented by different anchor genes depending on the pathway or process for which the genes are clustered as cassis does not consider the properties of genes the nature of the anchor gene does not matter being based on the de_novo motif_discovery cassis is quite sensitive to the quality of the genome_assembly two features are important the length of contigs scaffolds and the information quality of the sequence the former feature is actually important for any cluster prediction_tool since clusters are lengthy stretches of genomic_sequence which should be preferably uninterrupted the information quality becomes important for genomes with low complexity at rich regions since it is hard to predict significant motifs in such sequences
