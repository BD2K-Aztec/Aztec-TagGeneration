data_and meltdb advances of the metabolomics software system motivation the research area metabolomics achieved tremendous popularity and development in the last couple of years owing to its unique interdisciplinarity it requires to combine knowledge from various scientific_disciplines advances in the high_throughput technology and the consequently growing quality and quantity of data put new demands on applied analytical and computational_methods exploration of finally generated and analyzed datasets furthermore relies on powerful_tools for data_mining and visualization results to cover and keep up with these requirements we have created meltdb a next generation web_application addressing storage sharing standardization integration and analysis of metabo lomics experiments new features improve both efficiency and effect ivity of the entire processing pipeline of chromatographic raw_data from pre_processing to the derivation of new biological_knowledge first the generation of high_quality metabolic datasets has been vastly simplified second the new statistics tool box allows to investigate these datasets according to a wide_spectrum of scientific and explorative questions availability the system is publicly_available at https meltdb cebitec uni bielefeld de a login is required but freely_available metabolomics research covers all aspects of the investigation of small_molecule metabolite compositions resulting from cellular_processes and constitutes an integrated part of systems_biology like transcriptomics and proteomics metabolomics is capable of measuring extrinsically initiated changes in organisms the metabolome the entity of all small_molecules in a cell organism or tissue is considered to be the closest to the phenotype of all omes compared with other molecular levels or omics methods metabolomics is challenging in its high degree of interdisciplinarity interlinking experts from research_fields as diverse as engineering physics chemistry and biology and from cheminformatics over bioinformatics to statistics data_mining and finally visualization both sample acquisition and subsequent analysis are automated in high_throughput instruments which has continuously posed challenges on the systematic storage and computational processing of the gathered experimental_datasets starting in the early s the increasing number and quality of measurements not only raised the generated data volume but also allowed to address more complex biological_questions within conducted experiments to comprehensively address these demands bioinformatics internet applications were developed meltdb a software platform for the analysis and integration of data from metabolomics experiments has been published byreleased metaboanalyst a comprehensive tool suite for metabolomic_data analysis published the metabolomeexpress web_server as a public place to process interpret and share gc_ms metabolomics datasets since around we have observed that the requirements to comprehensive metabolomics software platforms have changed the general growth of the field of metabolomics and the increasing number of collaborations diversified the user community of researchers and their individual scientific goals it is obvious that the success of a metabolomics study depends on an efficient and effective collaboration of this interdisciplinary research_community thus not only the availability and sharing of the data is important but also special functions have to be significantly extended with specific features to consider all researchers demands and perspectives in addition the ever increasing throughput and the constant lack of time makes it immensely important that automated pre_processing methods are reliable and that analyses and manual intervention are fast and easy since metabolomics approaches are applied to more and more scientific objectives a powerful set of statistical_methods is mandatory ranging from hypothesis driven statistical_tests to less specified and untargeted data_mining methods such as clustering and dimension_reduction finally the wealth of generated data poses a necessity for exploratory_data tools and information_visualization to tackle these new challenges systematically a next generation of bioinformatics_tools needed to be developed covering all of the aforementioned aspects of metabolome data analysis ranging from processing raw_data rd to finishing and finally the derivation of biological_knowledge during the stages of that process one can identify four successive data categories that represent different levels of data classification and annotation as well as different levels of abstraction first rd stored and organized in meaningful groups build the basis then pre processed data pd is computed where peaks and their to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com quantities have been detected it follows integrated data id where peaks that putatively originate from the same compound are consistently annotated over chromatograms of an experiment and thus become comparable last derivative data dd is achieved by statistical_analyses of metabolite quantities in an experiment and then visualized to allow effective exploration and to draw_conclusions in this manuscript we present meltdb which offers novel tools to challenge the rising wealth of data_quality and quantity and support the analysis of all four categories rd pd id and dd and includes a multitude of updates new and improved preprocessing methods underpin the reliability of automatically created annotations at the same time straightforward tools for manual peak annotation simplify the curation even of large experiments to help answering_questions of different scientific objectives the set of statistical_analyses and data_mining tools has been strongly enriched to finally nail down the quintessence of an experiments outcome data exploration is supported by new interactive and telling information visualizations
