systems_biology metab an r package for high_throughput analysis of metabolomics_data generated by gc_ms motivation the automated mass_spectral deconvolution and identification system amdis is freeware extensively applied in metabolomics however datasets processed by amdis require extensive data correction filtering and reshaping to create reliable datasets for further downstream_analysis performed_manually these processes are laborious and extremely time consuming furthermore manual corrections increase the chance of human_error and can introduce additional technical variability to the data thus an automated pipeline for curating gc_ms data is urgently_needed results we present the metab r package designed to automate the pipeline for analysis of metabolomics gc_ms datasets processed by amdis availability the metab package the amdis library and the reference ion library are available at www metabolomics auckland ac nz index php downloads contactmetabolomics has grown extraordinarily quickly in the last decade and its laboratorial and analytical aspects are now considerably well advanced however the same cannot be said for the data_mining and analysis techniques needed to process the raw_data generated by gas chromatograpymass spectrometry gc_ms in preparation for downstream_analyses while freely_available web_based software_tools e g meltdb and metap are available they generally perform only a subset of the necessary data preprocessing_steps these partially processed data must therefore be further analyzed using other software s most of these tools do not however allow users to create their own pipeline flux automated mass_spectral deconvolution and identification system amdis is the most commonly used freeware for deconvoluting chromatograms generated by gc_ms and for identifying and quantifying metabolites in biological_samples however it has three major limitations selection of different mass fragments for quantification of the same compound assignment of multiple compounds to the same retention time and results generated in a layout that does not make the data amenable to further preprocessing and analysis we have introduced a new r package metab which automates the tasks commonly required for the analysis of metabolomics gc_ms datasets metab substantially increases throughput by substantially reducing the time normally required to perform these tasks manually and provides protection against human_error furthermore our interactive functions allow its usage by users with little knowledge of the r language
