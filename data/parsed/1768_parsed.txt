fast filtering for rna homology_search motivation homology_search for rnas can use secondary_structure information to increase power by modeling base_pairs as in covariance models but the resulting computational costs are high typical acceleration strategies rely on at least one filtering stage using sequence only search results here we present the multi segment cyk mscyk filter which implements a heuristic of ungapped structural_alignment for rna homology_search compared to gapped_alignment this approximation has lower computation time requirements o n reduced to o n and space requirements o n reduced to o n a vector parallel implementation of this method gives up to fold speed up vector parallel implementations of standard gapped_alignment at two levels of precision give and fold speed ups these approaches are combined to create a filtering pipeline that scores rna_secondary at all stages with results that are synergistic with existing_methods a covariance model cm is a probabilistic profile model of one or more structural rnas with a consensus secondary_structure cms are used for database_search and for multiple_alignment and form the basis for the rfam database of known structural rnas explicitly modeling the secondary_structure allows the model to capture information about an rna when the base_pairs are preserved even if the sequence changes a cm includes states that can describe a base_pair as a single unit so that the score can favor good combinations rather than only single_residue conservation the states are arranged in a branching tree_structure that reflects the shared consensus fold of the rna inclusion of secondary_structure increases the sensitivity_and of homology_searches for rna compared to sequence_profile methods cms do neglect some higher_order features of rna_structure such as pseudoknots but this is generally acceptable for homology_search a large obstacle to the application of cms is one of the computational costs both memory and time requirements have worse scaling behavior than their sequence only counterparts many different approaches have been used for increasing the speed of cm search and alignment acceleration methods generally fall into three classes direct hardware acceleration of the base to whom correspondence should be addressed method heuristic filters that reduce the number of sequences to be searched and heuristic bands that reduce the number of possible alignments per sequence filtering and banding techniques for rna search can be based on sequenceonly or sequence and structure models but one common approach is a sequence only filter such as the blast filter used in the rfam database pipeline recent work in filtering_methods has focused on the automatic design of profile_hmms and on models that include small amounts of structural_information structure description languages and heuristic rna structural search_methods stand on their own but can also be used as structure based filters for cm search a recent example in this area also focuses on automatic rather than manual creation of filters banding approaches for cm search include hmm bands and structure derived bands and similar methods are used in other types of rna algorithms such as combined alignment and folding the infernal software_package includes an accelerated search pipeline that incorporates several of these ideas this pipeline begins with maximum_likelihood hmm filters derived from the cm followed by hmm banded structural_alignment these results are further passed to alignment using structure based query dependent banding qdb the final scoring is done by the inside algorithm which integrates over all possible alignments rather than only considering the single best alignment the use of filters does decrease sensitivity somewhat but it provides fold speed improvements the version of the hmmer software_package for profile_hidden http hmmer janelia org also includes an acceleration pipeline for searches but its approach is conceptually quite different hmmer begins with ungapped alignment under a model that produces short alignment segments with positionspecific scores and no indels and also includes a loop that allows the detection and combined scoring of a set of these hits interspersed with unaligned sequence this is called the multi segment viterbi msv algorithm a second stage performs more typical viterbi alignment including gaps before a final filter that calculates the forward score the total likelihood of the sequence integrating over all possible alignments sequences that pass all three filter stages are subjected to some additional processing before being displayed in the results in addition to this tiered_approach moving from simpler to more complex models hmmer uses simd vector parallelization at each filter stage to decrease the time requirements the first stage msv calculation runs with foldpage mscyk is a heuristic designed for search acceleration we expect that its speed comes with a loss of sensitivity but we want the loss to be minimal to quantify this performance trade_off we evaluated the mscyk pipeline using the rmark benchmark used in earlier
