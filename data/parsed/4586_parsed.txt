genome_analysis the code structure of the p dna_binding and the prognosis of breast_cancer patients motivation the tumor_suppressor tp mutations are diverse in the central_region encoding the dna_binding it has not been clear whether the prognostic_significance for survival in breast_cancer patients is the same for all types of mutations are there specific types of mutations carrying a worse_prognosis to understand the correlation between the mutations in the gene_encoding the dna_binding and the prognosis of breast_cancer we studied the code structure of the dna_binding of breast_cancer patients by using various artificial codes in information_transmission results we indicated that the prognostic_significance of all types of mutations in the dna_binding is not the same and that the dna_binding having a certain code structure is important for estimating the prognosis of breast_cancer patients breast_cancer is the most common cancer among women approximately million people around the world are diagnosed with breast_cancer each year and people die from this disease according to the report of international agency for research on cancer the tumor_suppressor tp is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer including breast_cancer the protein p encoded by the tp_gene is a dna_sequence specific transcription_factor involved in the induction of diverse effects such as cell_cycle apoptosis repair of dna lesions senescence and angiogenesis mutant p not only loses the wild_type function but also gains new abilities to promote tumorigenesis most studies have reported that mutations in the tp_gene confer a worse overall survival and disease_free in breast_cancer cases and this effect is independent of other risk_factors have reported that the breast_cancer death_rate for patients with tp mutations is four to five times_higher than that for those without mutations tp mutations are mostly missense point_mutations and concentrate in the central_region encoding the dna_binding several studies have shown that mutations in the dna_binding including l and l loops are associated with poor disease_free on the other hand have indicated that the survival of patients with mutations in the l l loops is not significantly different to the survival of patients with mutations outside of these domains andhave indicated that there is no significant_difference in the overall survival_rates between patients with mutant and wild_type p tumors there are many patterns for p mutations in breast_cancer various mutations in the tp_gene cause single amino_acid changes at many different positions it is not clear whether the prognostic_significance is the same for all types of mutations are there specific types of mutations carrying a worse_prognosis we need further work to understand the significance concerning the different mutations in breast cancer_prognosis in information_theory the concept of information has two aspects one of which expresses the amount of complexity of the whole system such as a sequence itself and the other concerns the structure of the system such as the rule stored in the order of sequence concerning the first concept of information according to shannons philosophy if a system has larger complexity then the system carries larger information expressed through the entropy here the idea of kolmogorov the complexity of sequences might be used concerning the second concept of information one looks for the structure of sequences in genome for this purpose coding theory might be useful for the sequence_analysis the code structure of tp_gene is studied by applying artificial codes in coding theory the aim of this study is to investigate whether the gene_encoding the dna_binding in breast_cancer case can be characterized by the artificial codes in information_transmission and to understand the correlation between various mutations in the gene and breast cancer_prognosis the kaplanmeier plots of breast_cancer patients stratified by mutation status in the l loop are shown_inand c there was a statistically_significant in the overall survival between the breast_cancer patients with mutation in the l loop and those with wild_type year overall survival versus in contrast there was no significant_difference in recurrence_free between two cases mentioned previously p for the wilcoxon_test p for the log_rank the kaplanmeier plots of breast_cancer patients stratified by the rc values in the l loop are shown_inand d the overall survival and recurrence_free were statistically significantly_worse in patients with the l loop that is close to the bch code than patients with the l loop that is far from that code year overall survival versus year recurrence_free versus in this analysis we made a correspondence between the four bases and the elements in gf as a c g a and t a a and c and the rc values in the l loop right panels b and d are shown a overall survival of patients with mutation in the l loop versus those with wild_type b overall survival of patients with the l loop that is close to the bch code versus those with the l loop that is far from that code c relapse_free of patients with mutation in the l loop versus those with wild_type d relapse_free of patients with the l loop that is close to the bch code versus those with the l loop that is far from that code loop are shown in there was no_statistically in overall survival and recurrence_free between the patients with mutation in the l loop and those with wild_type p for the log_rank p for the wilcoxon_test p for the log_rank in contrast there was a significant_difference in the overall survival between the patients with the l loop that is close to the bch code and the patients with the l loop that is far from that code year overall survival versus the generator polynomial of the bch code was gx x x x x provided that the four bases were t g a a and c a in addition there was a statistically_significant in the recurrence_free between the patients with the l loop that is close to the bch code and the patients with the l loop that is far from that code year overall survival versus the generator polynomial of the bch code was gx x provided that the four bases were g a t a and c a the tumor_suppressor tp mutations are diverse in the central_region encoding the dna_binding it has not been clear whether the prognostic_significance for survival in breast_cancer patients is the same for all types of mutations are there specific types of mutations carrying a worse_prognosis we studied the code structure of the dna_binding of breast_cancer patients by using various artificial codes in information_transmission in this study we found a significant relation between the code structure of the dna_binding and the breast cancer_prognosis various types of mutations in the dna_binding were classified by the code structure we indicated that the prognostic_significance of all types of mutations in the dnabinding domain is not the same and that the dna_binding having a certain code structure is important for estimating the prognosis of breast_cancer patients we are convinced that the classification according to the code structure of the dna_binding is useful for predicting patients who have a high_mortality although novel tp mutations are continuously reported the biological_function is incompletely_understood for many mutant p proteins our classification may be also useful for establishing effect of individual mutation on protein properties such as
