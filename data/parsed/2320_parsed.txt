identifying discriminative classification based motifs in biological_sequences motivation identification of conserved_motifs in biological_sequences is crucial to unveil common shared functions many tools exist for motif identification including some that allow degenerate positions with multiple possible nucleotides_or most efficient methods available today search conserved_motifs in a set of sequences but do not check for their specificity regarding to a set of negative sequences results we present a tool to identify degenerate motifs based on a given classification of amino_acids according to their physico_chemical it returns the top k motifs that are most frequent in a positive set of sequences involved in a biological_process of interest and absent from a negative set thus our method discovers discriminative motifs in biological_sequences that may be used to identify new sequences involved in the same process we used this tool to identify candidate effector_proteins secreted into plant_tissues by the root knot nematode meloidogyne incognita our tool identified a series of motifs specifically present in a positive set of known effectors while totally absent from a negative set of evolutionarily_conserved housekeeping proteins scanning the proteome of m incognita we detected proteins that contain these specific motifs and can be considered as new putative effectors availability_and the motif_discovery tool and the proteins used in the experiments are available atconserved motifs in biological_sequences reflect functionally_important shared_features in genome_sequences conserved_motifs can point to promoters or regulatory_elements regions of splice_junctions between protein coding_exons or regions affecting the shape of the chromatin in protein_sequences such conserved_motifs can highlight signals that are important for controlling the cellular_localization e g nucleus cytoplasm extracellular compartment to whom correspondence should be addressed regions shared between proteins that interact with a same partner or regions important for the biochemical function itself physico_chemical and d structures of proteins are more conserved than the suite of amino_acids itself thus at a given position in a protein_sequence different amino_acids may have similar structural or physico_chemical roles degenerate motifs allowing multiple possible amino_acids at one position are necessary to comply with this variability several methods allow for discovery of degenerate motifs but few of them take into account similarity in terms of physicochemical_properties of amino_acids at a given position when the purpose of the obtained motifs is to scan large_datasets e g genomes proteomes in order to find new sequences potentially involved in the same biological_process another relevant point in the motif_discovery is the specificity of the identified motifs regarding the biological_process some systems make use of statistics to attach a measure of significance to each of the discovered patterns as deduced from a model based on the input_sequences or a public sequence database for many biological_applications however a negative set of sequences not involved in the process of interest can be compiled and this set can be used as a more direct way to evaluate the relevance of the motifs while several motif_discovery processes take into consideration a negative sequence set this set is often used to guide the search toward motifs overrepresented in the positive sequences rather than discriminating motifs in this article we propose a method that identifies motifs consisting of specific amino_acids and physico_chemical that can be used as discriminators to identify new sequences involved in a biological_process of interest to our knowledge no motif_discovery method exists that combines these two features our method outputs the top k motifs that are most frequent in a positive set of proteins and are absent from a negative set of proteins we applied this method to find motifs in root knot nematode effectors root knot nematodes are the most damaging plantparasitic animals to the agriculture worldwide causing billions of euro losses every year they have sophisticated interactions with plants that include penetration of root_tissue and establishment of a feeding site a set of effector_proteins that are secreted by the nematode into plant_tissue is believed to be crucial for these processes most known effectors to date are expressed in nematode secretory glands and delivered to plant_tissue through aaliphatic a g i l v neutral s t n q sulfur containing c m acidic d e aromatic f y w basic r h k cyclic p syringe like stylet with the availability of two annotated genome_sequences for root knot nematodes identifying the whole set of candidate secreted effectors can now be envisioned although many effectors possess a signal_peptide for secretion others clearly present in secretory glands and or nematode secretions have no predicted signal_peptide similarly many rootknot nematode proteins bearing a signal_peptide are not delivered to the plant but have conserved functions in different species hence the presence of a signal_peptide cannot be used as a discriminator to identify new effectors and no reliable motif to predict secretion of a nematode protein in plants is currently available we constructed a positive set of proteins known to be secreted by root knot nematodes into plant_tissue and a negative set of evolutionarily_conserved proteins in order to identify specific motifs in positive proteins using these datasets our method identified a set of effector specific motifs at the n_terminal region of the positive proteins we propose an algorithm for the de_novo identification of protein motifs specific to a set of proteins the motifs are not restricted to a sequence of specific amino_acids but can involve physico_chemical amino_acid the algorithm combines a variety of existing and new algorithmic contributions into a practical tool that is freely_available and is able to include user_defined amino_acid we provide additional software to scan sequence_databases for the occurrence of the identified motifs to our knowledge no method is currently available to identify discriminative motifs that are degenerated according to a classification_scheme our tool was used to discover motifs specific to root knot nematode proteins that are secreted into plant_tissues we showed that by allowing properties in the motifs we are able to find motifs with a higher frequency in a positive set of proteins while still being absent from a negative set using a set of four identified motifs as discriminators we detected a total of proteins in the proteome of m incognita that can be considered as new putative effectors we have compared the motifs discovered by our tool to the result of four other tools that find degenerate motifs we conclude that our tool is the only one that finds a set of motifs using predefined amino_acid classes that is completely_absent from the negative set while we have focused on finding protein motifs the tool can be used on any kind of sequence_dataset with any kind of research_question for which a positive_and set can be defined
