data_and mtide an integrated tool for the identification of mirna_target interaction in plants motivation small_rna and degradome sequencing also known as parallel analysis of rna ends have provided rich_information on the microrna mirna and its cleaved mrna_targets on a genome_wide scale in plants but no computational_tools have been developed to effectively and conveniently deconvolute the mirnatarget interaction mti results a freely_available package mtide was developed by combining modified mirdeep and cleaveland with some other useful scripts to explore mti in a comprehensive way by searching for targets of a complete mirnas we can facilitate large_scale identification of mirna_targets allowing us to discover regulatory interaction networks availability_and http bis zju edu cn mtidemicrornas mirnas are a kind of small endogenous noncoding_rnas that negatively control gene_expression at the post_transcriptional level by degrading target_mrnas in plants to make the functions of mirna totally clear it is essential to exactly identify the conserved and species specific_mirnas and their target_genes small_rna and degradome sequencing have been widely used in plants to identify_mirnas and target_genes on a genome_wide scale many tools have been developed to handle small_rna and degradome data separately but no specialized tool exists for a one stop survey of this kind of interaction mirnas are cleaved from stem_loop structured precursors called pre mirnas by dicer like maturation of mirnas releases rna_fragments derived from different parts of pre mirnas with asymmetric abundance mirdeep a new version of mirdeep uses the position and frequency of sequenced_reads along with the secondary_structure of pre mirnas and uses a probabilistic_model of mirna_biogenesis in animals to score the possible mirna sequence compared with animals mirna_precursors are much longer with more variable lengths and more mirnas belong to paralogous families with multiple members in plants therefore it cannot be applied to the plant systems straightforward cleaveland was developed specifically to analyze degradome data however because of the algorithms implemented in it it is impractical to analyze all possible mirnatarget interactions mtis in a reasonable timescale for mirnas identified from small_rna sequencing_data moreover it only reports targets cleaved between the th and th nucleotides but cleavages between th and th or th and th nt have also been reported here we present mtide an integrated tool for exploring mti in plants it consists of a modified mirdeep with plant specific parameters a modified cleaveland with more targets reports and some other useful scripts to control the running timescale in a low_level we add multiple threads support for mirdeep cleaveland and other time consuming parts
