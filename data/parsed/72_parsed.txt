genome_analysis acne a summarization method to estimate allele specific copy_numbers for affymetrix snp_arrays motivation current_algorithms for estimating dna_copy cns borrow concepts from gene_expression analysis methods however single_nucleotide snp_arrays have special_characteristics that if taken into account can improve the overall performance for example cross_hybridization between alleles occurs in snp probe pairs in addition most of the current cn methods are focused on total cns while it has been shown that allele specific cns are of paramount_importance for some studies therefore we have developed a summarization method that estimates high_quality allele specific cns results the proposed method estimates the allele specific dna cns for all affymetrix snp_arrays dealing directly with the cross_hybridization between probes within snp probesets this algorithm outperforms or at least it performs as well as other state of the art algorithms for computing dna cns it better discerns an aberration from a normal state and it also gives more precise allele specific cns availability the method is available in the open_source r package acne which also includes an add on to the aroma affymetrix framework http www aroma project org genomic_aberrations are involved in the pathogenesis of different diseases especially cancer these genomic abnormalities may contribute to a cell becoming cancerous especially if tumor_suppressor or oncogenes are affected dna_copy cnas are genomic_aberrations that involve amplifications or deletions of a part of the genome a whole chromosome an arm or a segment the dna_copy cns in a cna may be larger amplifications or smaller deletions and homozygous_deletions than the normal state cn equals to two loss_of loh is another genomic aberration that occurs in a segment of the genome that lacks one of the two parental chromosomes for each snp in an loh zone one of the alleles has cn equals to zero cn for a zone with loh may be one loss of one of the parental chromosomes two copy neutral to whom correspondence should be addressed loh or even larger than two in the latter two cases the additional copies of the region with loh have been regenerated by the cell using the present copy the single_nucleotide snp_arrays can be used to study the cnas and also the loh cases although the initial application of these arrays was genotyping they can also be utilized for estimating the number of copies at the locus where the interrogated snp is located there are also genomic_aberrations that do not affect total cns or genotypes e g translocations and reversions such aberrations cannot be identified using snp_arrays several companies have developed this type of arrays but we will focus in the affymetrix platform affymetrix has a family of snp_arrays starting from the k arrays which interrogates snps afterward they developed the k and k chip sets both using two different restriction_enzymes the more recent genome_wide human snp_array gws and genome_wide human snp_array gws arrays also use two enzymes but they differ from their predecessors in various characteristics the gws arrays have non polymorphic probes in addition to snp probes which are used for studying the dna cn variations cnvs and cover parts of the genome where there are no snps the gws has the same number of snps as the k as well as non polymorphic probes while gws has around snps and a bit less than non polymorphic probes the probes in each chip are grouped in probesets corresponding to single snps probes complementary to both alleles a and b in the same snp are known as probe pairs there are probes in the array that are complementary to both strands of the snp the length of each probe is nt the probesets from the k arrays are formed by perfect match pm and mismatch probes mms where the mms differ from the pms in the central nucleotide to give space for more pms the gws arrays do not have mms several processing methods have been proposed to obtain the dna cn information from snp_arrays the first algorithms used were directly inherited from gene_expression analysis as dchip and rma there also exist more recent ones that are specific to the cn data e g cnag plasq italics crma cn and crma v the whole pipeline to treat snp_arrays consist of several low_level methods namely background removal normalization to equalize the signal levels for several arrays summarization to extract a signal proportional to the cn of each of the alleles genomic post_processing to deal with signal bias related to size and otherpage to show the accuracy of the results we have compared acne with crma v affymetrixs cn and dchip we divided the evaluation into two parts first total cns are assessed then ascns for ascn we compare acne with allele specific versions of crma v and dchip cn has not been included in this comparison because it needs paired_samples in order to estimate ascns
