systems_biology bic a web_server for calculating bimodality of coexpression between gene and protein networks bimodal patterns of expression have recently been shown to be useful not only in prioritizing genes that distinguish phenotypes but also in prioritizing network models that correlate with proteomic evidence in particular subgroups of strongly coexpressed gene_pairs result in an increased variance of the correlation distribution this variance a measure of association between sets of genes or proteins can be summarized as the bimodality of coexpression bic we developed an online tool to calculate the bic for user_defined gene_lists and associated mrna_expression data recently a number of techniques have emerged to identify subsets of genes_exhibiting bimodal patterns of gene_expression as these distinguishing_features are highly_suggestive of molecular_switches while many of these approaches attempt to identify the modes of expression represented by a single gene with respect to two phenotypes the modes of expression among sets of genes can also be informative and can be evidenced by bimodal patterns of coexpression bimodal coexpression patterns arise among biologically related gene_sets whose members have stronger mrna correlations with each other than with unrelated genes as these highly related gene_sets will have both large positive and large negative_values of their correlation pattern has greater variance than the correlation distribution of unrelated gene_sets which is centered around andtook advantage of this fact to calculate a property which they call the bimodality of coexpression bic using a non parametric approach they have previously shown that the bic can be useful in evaluating the strength of association between a hypothetical signaling_network and an experimentally_observed set of proteomic targets in this context a high degree of coexpression also suggests which genes
