gene_expression integrative_analysis of histone chip_seq and transcription data using bayesian mixture models_motivation histone_modifications are a key epigenetic_mechanism to activate or repress the transcription of genes datasets of matched transcription data and histone_modification data obtained by chip_seq exist but methods for integrative_analysis of both data types are still rare here we present a novel bioinformatics_approach to detect genes that show different transcript_abundances between two conditions putatively caused by alterations in histone_modification results we introduce a correlation measure for integrative_analysis of chip_seq and gene_transcription data measured by rna_sequencing or microarrays and demonstrate that a proper normalization of chip_seq is crucial we suggest applying bayesian mixture_models of different types of distributions to further study the distribution of the correlation measure the implicit classification of the mixture_models is used to detect genes with differences between two conditions in both gene_transcription and histone_modification the method is applied to different datasets and its superiority to a naive separate analysis of both data types is demonstrated availability_and r bioconductor packagemodifications of histone_proteins are an epigenetic_mechanism to regulate gene_transcription and are fundamental to stem_cell as well as to the genesis of cancer histone_modifications can be localized genome_wide using chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq recently several studies used this technique to explore the role of different chromatin_states in transcriptional_regulation especially when chip_seq are restricted to genomic_regions like genes mixture_models have been used in many ways to cluster or classify genes recent_applications include integrative analyses of various data types including gene_transcription together with either dna_copy van wieringen and van dna_methylation or transcription_factor binding activity as well as assessing concordance between chip_chip platforms models may consider a fixed number of components or allow for a flexible and even infinite number of components the standard techniques for fitting such mixture_models are em algorithms in frequentist statistics van wieringen and van and markov_chain mcmc algorithms for bayesian mixture_models implying a prior_distribution on the mixture input measures for mixture_models are case specific such as different log_ratio intensity_measurements or transformed p values in traditional clustering using mixture_models each cluster is represented by one gaussian component the number of clusters is determined by an external criterion or especially in a bayesian context estimated within the model however often clusters are poorly fitted by a single component as a remedy models involving a mixture of mixtures have been introduced in which each cluster is represented by a mixture itself see for frequentist and bayesian approaches respectively in this work we present a model involving a mixture of mixtures that circumvents overfitting and identifiability problems both by considering a fixed number of clusters suggested by the biological task and by fitting a fixed number of components corresponding to different types of distributions the latter reduces the number of necessary mixture components and is beneficial for interpretation although a similar approach has been applied on chipseq data by our innovation lies in using a bayesian_framework that compared with the expectationmaximization em_algorithm holds several benefits such as the possibility of assessing the uncertainty through credible_intervals and less dependence on initial_values furthermore we apply our model on data obtained from integrating gene_transcription and chip_seq we demonstrate the advantages of our method over the em approach and over a separate analysis of both datasets on simulated_data as well as on actual biological data in section we first describe our data matching and integration approach and subsequently present our bayesian mixture_model section gives a description of results obtained on two different datasets and a simulation_study a discussion follows in section and final conclusions in section the presented results are consistent with the literature with respect to the association between gene_transcription and histone_modifications results from the simulated dataset and from comparing two biological_replicates from the cebpa dataset give evidence for a high_specificity when detecting transcripts with differences in both datasets furthermore the simulation_study indicates that a reasonable sensitivity may be achieved this is substantiated by the good reproducibility of the classification results when splitting the cebpa dataset into two datasets of sample_size one using distributions of different types is beneficial for classifying transcripts in our bayesian mixture_model approach in combination with a small fixed number of components it helps to avoid label switching problems that often occur for mixture_models with a large number of normal components of which a considerable proportion often remains empty in preliminary analyses a mixture_model using exclusively normal components had to use components to achieve both a good overall fit and three contiguous classes where the proposed new model only needs six one tail of the z distribution to contain considerably more probability mass than the other one when larger_sample are available uncertainty could be modeled across samples for each locus introducing an additional model layer an adapted measure z could be defined similarly as was done in schaferin a frequentist context focusing on the summands in an externally centered correlation_coefficient which could be assigned an e g normal distribution we propose quantile normalization for chip_seq and a novel bayesian mixture approach involving a mixture of mixtures and distributions of different type normal and exponential to classify transcripts based on a new measure for the correlation between histone_modifications and gene_transcription this integrative_analysis was able to detect transcripts for which alterations in transcript_abundances and histone_modification exist between two different conditions in several datasets including different histone_modification and transcription data from either microarrays or rna_seq we assessed the sensitivity_and of our approach based on simulated_data and on biological_replicates and showed its superiority toward naive separate analyses given the fact that modern studies are often not limited to one type of omics_data the presented method is a useful and important tool for the integrated analysis of epigenetic and transcription data
