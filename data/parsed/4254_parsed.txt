simple sequence_based kernels do not predict protein_protein motivation a number of methods have been reported that predict proteinprotein_interactions ppis with high_accuracy using only simple sequence_based features such as amino_acid mer content this is surprising given that many protein interactions have high_specificity that depends on detailed atomic recognition between physiochemically complementary surfaces are the reported high accuracies realistic results we find that the reported accuracies of the predictions are significantly overestimated and strongly_dependent the structure of the training and testing datasets used the choice of which protein pairs are deemed as non interactions in the training data has a variable impact on the accuracy estimates and the accuracies can be artificially inflated by a bias towards dominant samples in the positive data which result from the presence of hub proteins in the protein_interaction to address this bias we propose a positive set specific method to create a balanced negative set maintaining the degree_distribution for each protein leading to the conclusion that simple sequence_based features contain insufficient_information to be useful for predicting ppis but that protein domain based features have some predictive value availability our method named brs nonint is available atproteinprotein interactions ppis are responsible for many critical_functions and processes in biology and are highly_relevant to disease_states while experimental_measurements are able to discover protein interactions at high_throughput they can be biased to specific types of interaction or unlikely to discover all interactions and cannot be applied to all relevant species as a result a number to whom correspondence should be addressed of researchers have studied how well machine_learning are able to predict ppis from protein_sequence alone ben they have reported impressive performance using a variety of simple sequence_features such as counts of mers of neighbouring residues and developed sophisticated pairwise kernels to allow classification using support_vector svms the performance_measures reported are much better than one would expect and we have found that they are very sensitive to the content of the datasets used in training and cross_validation in particular the presence of hub proteins that interact with many other proteins in the positive dataset leads to a strong bias that invalidates most performance_estimates recently park has benchmarked four methods on yeast and human data found significant performance differences and highlighted some effects of training and testing data on performance_estimates however the datasets used in this benchmark still suffer from bias of dataset content reported here in this work we present a method to remove this bias and demonstrate the effect on predicting ppis from simple sequence_features that simple sequence_based kernels do not predict ppis we now summarize some approaches taken to predict ppis from sequence_data all of which should be reinterpreted following our findings benused a svm method with a pairwise kernel and evaluated a number of sequence_features including the spectrum kernel where the protein_sequences are represented by the counts of mers of neighbouring residues this leads to a fixed_length n feature_vector for each protein regardless of the sequence_length the pairwise kernel allows comparison of pairs of proteins avoiding any problems that may be introduced by concatenating feature_vectors for each protein and on a yeast dataset performance of the svm gives a receiver_operator roc area_under auc score of similarlyused symmetric mers n and a pairwise kernel giving accuracy of on human data and for yeast accuracy of was reported to be achieved byon human ppi data using mers of residues grouped into seven categories n and an s kernel similar in function to the previous pairwise kernels the structures of the various datasets are illustrated in which clearly shows the hub proteins in the positive set reflecting the well known power_law distribution of vertex degrees and how this is replicated in the negative set generated by the method of balanced random_sampling but not simple_random the high_accuracy reported in the literature for predicting ppis from simple sequence_features appears to be an artefact of the datasets used to train and validate methods in simple terms if datasets are used where some proteins hubs appear many more times in the positive set than the negative set then a machine_learning will learn this predict positive interactions preferentially for these proteins and seem to be highly_accurate the sequence feature_vectors used are of high_dimension and allow machine_learning to identify such specific proteins the accuracies are unrealistic because the intended application is finding interactors for a specific protein from the entire proteome of which even hub proteins only interact with a small fraction it seems in fact that simple sequence_features are little better than random in predicting protein interactions when the task is to distinguish positive_and interactions that occur in equal number for each protein in balanced positive_and datasets it is clear that the choice of negative data is critical in training and performance evaluation for machine_learning in particular there must be no systematic_differences between positive_and datasets used in training and evaluation that are not present in the datasets of intended application while it is clear that the negatome dataset will be useful in method development it is also probable that this set will have its own biases for instance towards well studied proteins in the literature and proteins that appear in the structural database it will therefore have to be used with care in prediction method development while simple sequence_features are not strongly predictive of interactions the presence of conserved domains does contain some predictive_information but even then accuracy is only moderate given that the a priori probability of interaction of a protein and a partner chosen randomly from the entire proteome is quite low any of these methods will be susceptible to a high rate of false_positive protein interactions depend exquisitely on the three_dimensional atomic_structures of the proteins concerned and their detailed spatial and temporal_pattern of expressions in the cell our ability to predict these interactions from information only in the sequence is at present too poor to be useful
