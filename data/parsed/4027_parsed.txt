gene_expression rna express annotates novel transcript features in rna_seq next_generation is rapidly becoming the approach of choice for transcriptional analysis experiments substantial advances have been achieved in computational_approaches to support these technologies these approaches typically rely on existing transcript annotations introducing a bias towards known genes require specific experimental_design and computational_resources or focus only on identification of splice_variants ignoring other biologically_relevant transcribed features contained within the data that may be important for downstream_analysis biologically_relevant transcribed features also include large and small non coding rna new transcription_start alternative promoters rna_editing and processing of coding transcripts also many existing solutions lack accessible interfaces required for wide scale adoption we present a user_friendly rapid and computation efficient feature annotation framework rna express that enables identification of transcripts and other genomic and transcriptional features independently of current annotations rna express accepts mapped_reads in the standard binary alignment bam format and produces a study specific feature annotation in gtf format comparison statistics sequence extraction and feature counts the framework is designed to be easily_accessible while allowing advanced users to integrate new feature identification algorithms through simple class extension thus facilitating expansion to novel feature_types or identification of study specific feature_types availability_and rna express software source_code user manuals supporting tutorials developer guides and example data are available at http www rnaexpress org recent_advances ngs_technology have revolutionized many aspects of biology applications range from genomic and metagenomic_projects through to wide scale condition specific whole transcriptome sequence within the field of whole transcriptome_sequencing the primary benefit over traditional microarray is the capacity to read all expressed transcripts yielding unbiased highly_sensitive measurements without the dependence on prior_knowledge to specify probes this capacity facilitates the discovery and quantification of novel genes splice_variants and non_coding in addition to known features the present challenge lies in extracting all biologically meaningful_information from the vast_amounts of data produced by ngs in a time and resource efficient manner the assignment of biological_significance relies on identification of transcriptional features their analysis and quantitation of induced changes in expression many ngs studies reveal expressed features that are not annotated in the reference_genomes either because they are novel genes transcripts or splice_variants or because they are composed of reads from precursor transcripts or intronic_regions whole transcriptome_analysis initially relies upon either prior_knowledge of the genome for direct mapping or computationally and sequencing intensive de_novo transcript assembly using tools such as tranabyss and oases although comprehensive these transcript reconstruction techniques are dependent on specific experimental_designs thus limiting application current genome guided techniques for feature identification range from considering only gene_annotation databases through to transcript assembly based on novel gene and splice_variant identification directly from read information such as performed with scripture and cufflinks although these features may identify novel splice_variants other transcribed features such as upstream transcribed regions introns downstream utr regions and unprocessed rna may not be considered although understanding the transcriptional_response of protein_coding is critical identifying and understanding the additional transcribed features can also provide significant insights into the regulatory controls and networks induced in the condition of study although present in many ngs_datasets this information is not widely analysed thus excluding potentially important biologically relevant_information in this light we developed rna express a user_friendly computationally_efficient analysis approach to perform flexible feature annotation comparison sequence extraction and read counting using ngs_data from any experimental_condition
