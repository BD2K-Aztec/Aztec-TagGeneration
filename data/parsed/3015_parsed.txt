mixupmapper correcting sample mix_ups in genome_wide datasets increases power to detect small genetic effects motivation sample mix_ups can arise during sample_collection handling genotyping or data management it is unclear how often sample mix_ups occur in genome_wide studies as there currently are no post_hoc methods that can identify these mix_ups in unrelated samples we have therefore developed an algorithm mixupmapper that can both detect and correct sample mix_ups in genome_wide studies that study gene_expression levels results we applied mixupmapper to five publicly_available human genetical genomics datasets on average of all analyzed samples had been assigned incorrect expression phenotypes in one of the datasets of the samples had incorrect expression phenotypes the consequences of sample mix_ups are substantial when we corrected these sample mix_ups we identified on average more significant cis expression_quantitative cis eqtls in one dataset we identified three times as many significant cis eqtls after correction furthermore we show through simulations that sample mix_ups can lead to an underestimation of the explained heritability of complex_traits in genome_wide association datasets genome_wide studies have identified many disease associated variants for a wide plethora of complex human_diseases such as celiac_disease type_diabetes and type_diabetes crohns_disease and complex continuous phenotypes such as lipid_levels body_mass bmi and height many of these studies also assess the effect of the identified genetic_variants on gene_expression variation i e genetical genomics by mapping expression_quantitative eqtl as such these studies involve many steps before actual analysis of the data during each of which samples could be accidentally swapped since these studies are pushing toward larger_sample in order to be able to identify ever smaller effects the presence of sample mix_ups becomes almost unavoidable it is known from simulations that sample mix_ups can have an effect on the power to detect genetic_associations in genome_wide studies which may present a problem to detect_variants with small effects however it is unclear how often such sample mix_ups actually occur in studies_investigating gene_expression the common method to detect sample mix_ups in genome_wide gwas is to check for heterozygous genotypes for x chromosomal markers in males however this procedure will not identify sample mix_ups between samples of identical gender while it is also possible to use multiple_phenotypes that can be well predicted based on genetic_markers such as eye color and hair color and abo_blood we are not aware of any study where this has been applied to identify sample mix_ups in gwas it is obvious that if there would be a considerable number of such phenotypes available identification of nearly all sample mix_ups should become feasible another method to prevent sample mixups that is commonly used in gwa studies involves the genotyping of a small number of variants prior to hybridization to the chip post_hoc concordance analysis then allows to resolve mixed up samples although this method does not resolve mix_ups that might have been introduced during phenotyping although these methods are tailored for gwas they are also applicable to genetical genomics datasets this however does not apply to gene_expression data for which to our knowledge no methods to detect sample mix_ups currently exist our method mixupmapper uses gene_expression levels for genes which are influenced by genetic_variation located near these genes cis eqtls on the basis of such cis eqtl effects ourwe have identified sample mix_ups in four out of five genetical genomics studies by applying a novel method mixupmapper on average of all samples were mixed up after correction for these sample mix_ups by our method we detected on average more cis eqtls correcting mix_ups in one dataset in which of the samples were incorrect led to three times as many significant cis eqtls being detected the consequences of only page sample mix_ups on the heritable fraction that can be explained by significantly associated variants can also be substantial for some simulated complex_traits with a moderate to high_heritability the explained heritability of the genome_wide significant variants increased fold when these sample mix_ups could be detected and corrected a considerable proportion of the heritability of complex_diseases is currently missing there is debate on whether the missing_heritability problem is caused by rare_variants with a large effect by many more common_variants each with a very small effect_size by overestimation of the heritability_estimates or through other means as current genome_wide studies are pushing toward associating ever smaller effect_sizes sample_sizes have to increase substantially to discover loci with smaller effect_sizes our results indicate that especially for these small effect_size loci sample mix_ups could have consequences on the power to detect such loci for both genetical genomics studies as well as gwas as such a proportion of the missing_heritability could possibly be explained by the presence of sample mix_ups in genome_wide datasets however it remains a question whether the frequency of sample mix_ups we observed in genetical genomics samples is a realistic estimate for other types of genome_wide datasets different types of genome_wide datasets require many different handling steps and therefore their frequencies for the presence of sample mixups may differ for example for casecontrol gwas the cases and controls are often collected and processed separately from each other therefore the frequency and hence the consequence of sample mix_ups in such casecontrol_studies might be lower compared to the studies presented here as such gwas in general might contain fewer sample mix_ups in the case of genetical genomics datasets more cis eqtls could be detected in each of the datasets after correction although the number of included samples had actually decreased for three of these datasets this effectively demonstrates that increasing the sample_size is not the only way of increasing statistical_power for determining complex_traits increasing the phenotypic accuracy can be equally helpful in addition to the method described here phenotypic accuracy may be increased by for example including relevant co variates in gwas or by using principal_components although these methods are helpful in increasing the phenotypic accuracy they do not help to identify or overcome sample mix_ups one possible problem with mixupmapper is that it depends on an initial set of cis eqtls that can be detected in the data although our method generally shows high_sensitivity when large_proportions of samples are mixed up in an extreme scenario where all genotyped samples are randomly_assigned to the gene_expression samples the mix_ups cannot be resolved since no ciseqtls will be initially detectable however if a set of cis eqtls has been independently identified in another set of samples for the particular expression platform used it is also be possible to resolve these problems data not shown we feel it is important to emphasize that the sample mix_ups that we detected in the five public datasets do not in any way discredit these studies to our knowledge we are the first to describe a method to identify mix_ups for these kinds of datasets if the authors had been aware of the existence of these mix_ups they would have certainly corrected them as their goal was to find as many eqtls as possible since we observed a substantial overlap of detected cis eqtls in the three hapmap populations before correction of sample mix_ups we assume the detected cis eqtls in these datasets are still valid we are convinced that the results and conclusions drawn from these datasets remain appropriate although our method is intended for genetical genomics datasets it can also be applied to other types of genome_wide datasets as long as there are sufficient numbers of different phenotypes available per individual that are each strongly determined by genetic_variants or combinations of variants this requirement will likely be met with the growing interest in population_based cohort_studies in which hundreds of phenotypes are collected from the participants as a consequence identifying sample mix_ups will then become possible for these datasets as well our results clearly indicate that sample mix_ups occur in many laboratories including ours although a great_deal of quality_control is conducted in gwas it is very difficult to prevent the accidental mislabeling of some samples this is particularly problematic in studies of unrelated_individuals where inheritance patterns cannot be investigated nevertheless these accidental human mistakes or experimental problems can sometimes have farreaching consequences we therefore recommend rigorous quality_control of the laboratory and administrative processes in order to prevent sample mix_ups from happening we conclude that fewer sample mix_ups will increase the power to detect significant genetic_associations substantially and might resolve a part of the missing_heritability
