genome_analysis archtex accurate extraction and visualization of next generation sequence_data motivation the extension of mapped sequence_tags is a common step in the analysis of single_end next_generation ngs_data from protein_localization and chromatin studies the optimal extension can vary depending on experimental and technical conditions improper extension of sequence_tags can obscure or mislead the interpretation of ngs results we present an algorithm archtex architectural tag extender which identifies the optimal extension of sequence_tags based on the maximum correlation between forward and reverse tags and extracts and visualizes sites of interest using the predicted extension availability_and archtex requires java or newer source_code and the compiled program are freely_available sourceforge net_projects archtex next_generation ngs is now being used with great success in conjunction with laboratory_techniques such as chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip micrococcal_nuclease mnase digestion and faire a standard high_throughput ngs run can typically produce several million short_read sequence_tags the number and length of the sequence_tags varies depending on the particular experiment and the platform on which it was run a standard run on a single lane of the illumina_hiseq platform produces upwards of million tags ranging anywhere from to bp in length these tags are then typically aligned to a reference_genome using a short_read tag alignment algorithm such as eland or bowtie further analysis is often dependent on the nature of the experiment and the personal preferences of the investigator the use of sequence tag extension in ngs_analysis is used to adjust for the length of dna that was sequenced and to smooth data at portions of the genome which may have been poorly to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as sampled tag extensions are justified by the relatively short sequence tag lengths produced by the majority of high_throughput platforms the short sequence tag represents the end of a larger dna_strand that was sequenced the length of the extension should reflect the true length of the dna population that was sequenced these extended tags are then typically overlaid on top of each other in a genome_wide tag frequency map regions of interest can then be examined independently or as an average across multiple similarly classified regions currently researchers will extend their mapped sequence_tags based on known biology such as bp extensions in the case of a mononucleosome sequencing run or an extension based on the estimated length of the dna during the pre sequencing library_preparation protocol this article_describes an algorithm archtex architectural tag extender which identifies the average length of the dna_fragments that were sequenced using cross_correlation of single_read sequencing archtex also provides a method for quick extraction and visualization of individual sites of interest using the optimal tag extension as predicted by cross_correlation archtex can output the results in a format readable by other ngs_analysis packages clustering software and can be uploaded to ucsc_genome the accuracy of archtex was confirmed for chip_seq and mnaseseq datasets by comparing archtexs extended data from singleend reads to the actual sequenced fragments from paired_end experiments supplementary the problems of improper extensions such as peak shifting and bi modal peak formation may be avoided using the predicted extension provided by archtex supplementary although these problems may persist if the length of dna in the experiment is highly_variable archtex provides immediate visualization of the tag distribution at individual regions of interest this will be helpful in analysis of a variety of different ngs experiments including but not limited to chip_seq mnase seq and faire seq
