sequence_analysis a visual framework for sequence_analysis using n grams and spectral rearrangement motivation protein_sequences are often composed of regions that have distinct evolutionary_histories as a consequence of domain shuffling recombination or gene_conversion new approaches are required to discover visualize and analyze these sequence_regions and thus enable a better understanding of protein evolution results here we have developed an alignment_free and visual approach to analyze sequence relationships we use the number of shared n grams between sequences as a measure of sequence_similarity and rearrange the resulting affinity matrix applying a spectral technique heat maps of the affinity matrix are employed to identify and visualize clusters of related sequences or outliers while n gram based dot plots and conservation profiles allow detailed analysis of similarities among selected sequences using this approach we have identified signatures of domain shuffling in an otherwise poorly_characterized family and homology clusters in another we conclude that this approach may be generally useful as a framework to analyze related but highly_divergent protein_sequences it is particularly useful as a fast method to study sequence relationships prior to much more time consuming multiple_sequence and phylogenetic_analysis availability a software implementation mosaic of the framework described here can be downloaded fromeukaryotic proteins often evolve in a modular fashion acquiring protein_domains from related or unrelated sequences via domain shuffling and non homologous_recombination in this way protein_families can gain or lose protein_domains over time domain shuffling is a prominent feature of eukaryotic genomeswe present here a framework to analyze sequence relationships that consists of three basic elements n gram based sequence_similarity measurement spectral decomposition and affinity matrix reordering these elements in combination yield distinctive advantages for identifying composite evolutionary_histories in protein_sequences in comparison to traditional_methods such as hierarchical_clustering based on blast scores we have presented a framework that can be applied to a broad range of sequence_data types and that consistently utilizes n grams instead of alignment_based for the visual_analysis of sequence relationships consisting of n gram based dot plots conservation profiles and sequence_similarity heat maps we provide the software application mosaic an implementation of this framework that allows to interactively navigate and study sequence relationships although the mosaic software makes no quantitative statements we found it to be very useful for the qualitative_analysis of protein_families applying our approach to three families which present severe challenges to traditional phylogenetic_analysis we identified signatures of domain shuffling in one of the families and delineated homology clusters in the other family while we were able to recapitulate known cases of gene_conversion in the third while understanding sequence relationships is useful in its own right it also forms the basis for more informed phylogenetic_analysis for example in the presence of domain shuffling sequences can be split into relevant subsequences before phylogenetic_analysis similarly exclusion of outlying or non homologous_sequences will avoid problems with erroneous inference of multiple_sequence more generally gene_conversion non allelic homologous_recombination domain shuffling and other reticulate events are increasingly_recognized as having shaped the evolution of many protein_families and there is hence a need to develop new frameworks for analyzing and visualizing the relationships between sequences in such families the method presented here provides a general framework for exploring sequence relationships and can be easily extended or adjusted for application to specific types of sequence_comparisons
