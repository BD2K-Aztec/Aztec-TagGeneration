plasmidspades assembling plasmids from whole_genome sequencing_data plasmids are stably_maintained extra chromosomal genetic_elements that replicate independently from the host_cells chromosomes although plasmids harbor biomedically important genes such as genes involved in virulence and antibiotics resistance there is a shortage of specialized software_tools for extracting and assembling plasmid data from whole_genome sequencing_projects results we present the plasmidspades algorithm and software_tool for assembling plasmids from whole_genome sequencing_data and benchmark its performance on a diverse set of bacterial_genomes availability_and plasmidspades is publicly_available atplasmids are common in bacteria and archaea but have been detected in eukaryotes as well the cells often have multiple plasmids of varying sizes existing together in different numbers of copies per cell plasmids are important genetic_engineering tools and the vectors of horizontal_gene that may harbor genes involved in virulence and antibiotic_resistance thus studies of plasmids are important for understanding the evolution of these traits and for tracing the proliferation of drug_resistant bacteria since plasmids are difficult to study using whole_genome wgs_data biologists often use special biochemical_methods for extracting and isolating plasmid molecules for further plasmidome sequencing in the case of wgs when a genome of a bacterial_species is assembled its plasmids often remain unidentified obtaining_information about plasmids from thousands of genome_sequencing without preliminary plasmid isolation is difficult since it is not clear which contigs in the genome_assembly have arisen from plasmids since the proliferation of plasmids_carrying antimicrobial_resistance and virulence_genes leads to the proliferation of drug resistantbacterial strains it is important to understand the epidemiology of plasmids and to develop plasmid typing systems developed plasmidfinder software for detecting and classifying variants of known plasmids based on their similarity with plasmids present in plasmid databases however plasmidfinder is unable to identify novel plasmids that have no significant similarities to known plasmids developed the plasmid constellation network placnet tool for assembling plasmids from wgs_data and applied it for analyzing plasmid diversity and adaptation placnet uses three types of information to identify plasmids i information about scaffold links and coverage in the wgs assembly ii comparison to reference plasmid sequences and iii plasmid diagnostic sequence_features such as replication initiator proteins placnet combines these three types of data and outputs a network that needs to be further pruned by expert analysis to eliminate confounding data while combining all three types of data for plasmid sequencing is important the focus of this paper is only on using wgs assembly for plasmid reconstruction in a fully_automatic fashion we argue that while the analysis of scaffolds inis important there is a wealth of additional information about plasmids encoded in the structure of the de_bruijn constructed from k_mers in reads thatdo not consider recently demonstrated how to use the de_bruijn constructed by the spades assembler to significantly improve the plasmid assembly focusing on data generated using plasmid isolation techniques as well as reconstruction of plasmid sequences from metagenomics datasets below we describe a novel tool plasmidspades aimed at assembling plasmids from the wgs_data recently this problem was addressed in the case of long smrt_reads but it remains_open for datasets containing short illumina_reads which represent the lions share of bacterial sequencing_projects we show that plasmidspades has the potential to massively increase the throughput of plasmid sequencing and to provide information about plasmids in thousands of sequenced bacterial_genomes by re assembling their genomes identifying their plasmids and supplementing the corresponding genbank entries with the plasmid annotations such plasmid sequencing_efforts are important since many questions about plasmid function and evolution remain_unanswered for example recently found a striking example of a bacterium aureimonas sp au that harbors the rrna_operon on a plasmid rather than on the chromosome thus re sequencing s of bacterial_genomes with the goal to reassemble their plasmids will help to answer important questions about plasmid evolution we illustrate how plasmidspades contributes to plasmid discovery by analyzing the citrobacter_freundii cfnih genome with wellannotated plasmids and identifying a new previously overlooked plasmid in this genome we also show how plasmidspades was used to discover eight new plasmids in ten randomly_chosen shotgun datasets derived from bacterial_genomes and deposited in the short_reads archive we further benchmark various tools for plasmid sequencing and provide the first analysis of accuracy of existing plasmid sequencing tools across diverse bacterial_genomes we described a novel plasmidspades algorithm for assembling plasmids from whole_genome sequencing_data since plasmidspades does not require any specialized sample_preparation to isolate plasmids it has a potential to increase the throughput of plasmid discovery it thus complements a recently_published approach mainly aimed at analyzing plasmids after plasmid isolation asillustrates plasmidspades identifies eight plasmids in ten randomly_selected sra dataset three of them are not similar to any previously_identified plasmids we thus expect that s of new plasmids will be identified when plasmidspades runs on all bacterial and achaeal sra genome datasets
