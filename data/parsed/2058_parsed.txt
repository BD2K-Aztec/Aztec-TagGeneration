systems_biology gim e condition specific models of cellular_metabolism developed from metabolomics and expression data motivation genome_scale have been used extensively to investigate alterations in cellular_metabolism the accuracy of these models to represent cellular_metabolism in specific conditions has been improved by constraining the model with omics data_sources however few practical methods for integrating metabolo mics data with other omics data_sources into genome_scale models of metabolism have been developed results gim e gene_inactivation moderated by metabolism metabolomics and expression is an algorithm that enables the development of condition specific models based on an objective_function transcriptomics and cellular metabolomics_data gim e establishes metabolite use requirements with metabolomics_data uses model paired transcriptomics_data to find experimentally supported solutions and provides calculations of the turnover production consumption flux of metabolites gim e was used to investigate the effects of integrating additional omics_datasets to create increasingly constrained solution spaces of salmonella_typhimurium metabolism during growth in both rich and virulence media this integration proved to be informative and resulted in a requirement of additional active reactions in each case or metabolites or respectively the addition of constraints from transcriptomics also impacted the allowed solution_space and the cellular_metabolites with turnover fluxes that were necessarily altered by the change in conditions increased from to of availability gim e has been implemented in python and requires a cobrapy x the algorithm and sample data described here are freely_available at http opencobra sourceforge net contacts the extraction and integration of biological_knowledge from large omics_datasets is an active area of research genome_scale gems provide a context for content for metabolic information and facilitate interpreting large_datasets in terms of the resulting functional state of the network as opposed to an inference based analysis of omics_datasets gems enable the calculation of the flux through network reactions however sufficient information to uniquely determine all of the fluxes for network reactions is generally not available constraint_based approaches are useful for calculating network states at the genome_scale establishing bounds of allowed operation of the network from available information omics_datasets can be used to better constrain the allowed operations of a metabolic_network model and improve the accuracy of flux predictions especially when the regulatory logic of the network is not fully known the value of model guided analysis of omics_data is evident from its application in a variety of contexts in systems_biology research for example constraint_based have been used to assess the impact of alternate conditions on growth_rate biofilm_formation and other functions that pathogens require to effectively implement a virulence program in the context of mammalian metabolism constraintbased models have been used to study metabolic_alterations in diseases of interest to medical_research and drug_development algorithms have been developed and used to automatically constrain gems by using a variety of data types especially transcriptomics and proteomics metabolomics has also been used to develop model constraints and infer altered reactions from gems when isotopically_labeled metabolic substrates are used for cellular_uptake gems facilitate the calculation of metabolic_fluxes directly from metabolomics_data in addition gems can be used with transcriptomics_data to infer transcriptional_control of cellular_metabolites metabolomics_data can also be used to develop model flux constraints but using measures of cellular metabolite_concentrations to develop model reaction flux constraints requires_additional information for example reaction directionality can be bound by the calculated gibbs_free of a reaction from metabolite_concentrations or more precisely activity however the free_energy to whom correspondence should be addressed change for all reactions in the model often is not available and must be estimated from group contribution theory also free_energy varies as a function of cellular ph which might be unknown furthermore the concentration of all reaction participants may not be known finally available metabolomics_data may be qualitative or semi_quantitative and may not give the absolute_concentration of detected metabolites here we present an algorithm to enable the integrated functional analysis of intracellular metabolomics_data and gene_expression microarray_data guided by a gem the algorithm gim e gene_inactivation moderated by metabolism metabolomics and expression uses metabolomics_data to ensure that the detected species are used in the calculated network operating states transcriptomics_data are used in gim e to further constrain the model fluxes the models created with the gim e algorithm report the modeled rate of creation or consumption turnover of metabolites gim e can also be implemented with metabolomics_data that report the identity of detected metabolites and does not require their absolute concentrations we developed and used gim e during an investigation of alterations in s typhimurium metabolism in rich and virulence media specifically to combine the broad semi_quantitative metabolomics dataset we developed for this infectious microbe with transcriptomics_data our purpose was to better constrain the model and perform an investigation of alterations in the network that was focused on metabolite turnover unexpectedly we discovered alterations in metabolites with previously postulated immunomodulatory roles and a preferential maintenance of cellular_pathways implicated in virulence however we did not provide a detailed_description of the steps in the algorithm or perform a holistic investigation of the impact of transcriptomic and metabolomic constraints on the conclusions drawn to better validate gim e therefore we expand on our previous analysis detail gim e and elucidate the impact of additional omics data_sources on the model guided interpretation of metabolism the gim e algorithm uses metabolomics and transcriptomics_data to develop constraints for a gem gim e requires a cellular objective and condition matched omics_datasets preferably transcriptomics_data with good coverage of model genes and metabolomics_data that may be qualitative or semi_quantitative in nature in our previous_investigation we illustrated the utility of gim e to develop biological_insights into the cellular_metabolism of s typhimurium in both rich and virulence media here we also demonstrate that omics_data integrated into the model with gim e also yields insight into metabolites and reactions that must be active to be in agreement with model constraints but that are not necessarily detected in the metabolomics experiments metabolomics and transcriptomics yielded distinct constraints on the solution_space the calculation of metabolite turnover is an additional benefit of using the gim e algorithm and omics derived constraints impacted the allowed metabolite turnover flux ranges model reactions that were not implicated in loops that could carry flux greater than the solver tolerance in at least one condition were included ball model cellular_metabolites that were not implicated in loops were included
