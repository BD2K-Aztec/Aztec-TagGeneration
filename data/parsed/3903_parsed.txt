gene_expression rcount simple and flexible rna_seq read counting analysis of differential_gene by rna sequen_cing rna_seq is frequently done using feature counts i e the number of reads mapping to a gene however commonly used count algorithms e g htseq do not address the problem of reads aligning with multiple_locations in the genome multireads or reads aligning with positions where two or more genes overlap ambiguous reads rcount specifically addresses these issues furthermore rcount allows the user to assign priorities to certain feature_types e g higher_priority for protein_coding compared to rrna coding_genes or to add flanking_regions availability_and rcount provides a fast and easy to use graphical_user requiring no command_line or programming_skills it is implemented in c using the seqan www seqan de and the qt libraries qt project org source_code and bit binaries for ubuntu linux windows and macosx are released under the gplv_license and are freely_available on github com mwschmid rcount contact marcschmid gmx ch supplementary_information test data genome_annotation files useful python and r scripts and a step_by user guide including run time and memory_usage tests are available on github com mwschmid rcount rna_seq is the method of choice for transcriptional_profiling and differential_expression de studies for de analysis methods based on negative_binomial modeling such as the popular deseq and edger have been shown to outperform other methods in terms of specificity sensitivity and control of false_positives current work flows for de analysis generally involve the i alignment of the short_reads to a reference_genome ii quantification of expression levels and iii comparison between different treatments tissue cell_types and time points read counting and read summarization are essential steps in any rna_seq workflow however they have received_little specifically for rna_seq counting is not as simple as it may appear first a read may align multiple times with the genome multireads second several genes may overlap at a given position within the genome reads aligning with those positions are ambiguous with respect to the gene they originate from ambiguous reads third alignments can span exonjunctions exon junction reads furthermore a gene may have several isoforms however de analysis is often performed using the total number of reads per gene popular open_source tools for read counting such as htseq www huber embl de users anders htseq bedtools and featurecounts do not specifically address all three issues multireads are not treated specifically by any of these programs and are generally discarded although this problem has been addressed for chip_seq analysis ambiguous reads are counted repeatedly for each gene by bedtools and featurecounts optionally whereas htseq discards them htseq and featurecounts both consider exon junction reads whereas bedtools does not erange addresses all three problems but uses rpkm reads per kilobase per million instead of counts throughout the whole algorithm moreover a conversion to counts during the algorithm is not possible here we describe rcount a fast and simple gui tool for flexible rna_seq read counting it builds on the algorithm described in and further allows for editing the genome_annotation and assigning priorities to certain feature_types seefor details on genomic feature_types
