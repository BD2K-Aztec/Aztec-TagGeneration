systems_biology nail a software toolset for inferring analyzing and visualizing regulatory_networks the wide_variety of published approaches for the problem of regulatory_network makes using multiple inference algorithms complex and time consuming network_analysis and inference library nail is a set of software_tools to simplify the range of computational activities involved in regulatory_network it uses a modular approach to connect different network_inference to the same visualization and network based analyses nail is technology independent and includes an interface layer to allow easy integration of components into other applications availability_and nail is implemented in matlab runs on windows linux and osx and is available from sourceforge at https sourceforge net_projects nailsystemsbiology for all researchers to use modelling biological_systems as networks graphs is becoming a common approach in the life_sciences specifically inferring regulatory_networks from genomic transcriptomic and proteomic_data is now giving insight into how biological_systems function in healthy and pathological states in a clinical context network medicine is becoming increasingly important in developing treatments for complex multifactorial conditions
