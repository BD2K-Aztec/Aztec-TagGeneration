databases_and metdisease connecting metabolites to diseases via literature motivation in recent_years metabolomics has emerged as an approach to perform large_scale characterization of small_molecules in biological_systems metabolomics posed a number of bioinformatics challenges associated in data analysis and interpretation genome based metabolic reconstructions have established a powerful framework for connecting metabolites to genes through metabolic_reactions and enzymes that catalyze them pathway_databases and bioinfor_matics tools that use this framework have proven to be useful for annotating experimental metabolomics_data this framework can be used to infer connections between metabolites and diseases through annotated disease genes however only about half of experimentally detected metabolites can be mapped to canonical metabolic_pathways we present a new cytoscape plug in metdisease which uses an alternative approach to link metabolites to disease information metdisease uses medical_subject mesh disease terms mapped to pubchem compounds through literature to annotate compound networks availability_and metdisease can be downloaded from http apps cytoscape org apps metdisease or installed via the cytoscape app manager further information about metdisease can be found at http metdisease a wide_range of pathway mapping and visualization_tools have been developed for the analysis of transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics_data they provide a quick and intuitive way to place experimental_data into the context of prior_biological most of the existing_tools for the analysis of metabolomics_data rely on genome based metabolic reconstruction databases metabolic reconstruction databases such as kegg biocyc and their subsequent refinements provide carefully curated information about metabolic_pathways metabolites metabolic_reactions enzymes and the genes that encode them recent_progress in the field of metabolomics now allows rapid and quantitative measurement of hundreds of named metabolites and thousands of chromatographic features representing additional metabolites as the experimental_data analysis methods improve metabolomics has increasing potential to provide informative readouts of metabolic changes in a variety of diseases however biological_interpretation of metabolomic experiments is hindered by relatively low coverage of experimentally_identified metabolites in pathway_databases in fact most metabolic reconstructions cover the majority of primary_metabolites whereas the coverage of lipids secondary_metabolites and volatile metabolites is significantly_lower additional reasons for low metabolite coverage include the presence of metabolites from different organisms e g presence of bacterial metabolites in human samples originating from microbiome drug_metabolites and compounds of environmental origin few of which are contained in most pathway_databases to explore the possibility of expanding metabolite annotation through biomedical_literature we have developed metab mesh http metab mesh ncibi org which links pubchem compounds to mesh_terms via substances that are annotated to pubmed articles national_library nlm provides a list of chemical substances that contain a wide_range of synonyms used in biomedical publications that can be linked to the compound synonyms used in pubchem using the compounds and their occurrences in pubmed literature statistical_tests were performed to estimate the significance of the associations between compoundmesh descriptor pairs the resulting associations supporting data and literature are stored in a relational_database and can be accessed via metab mesh web_interface and web_services however incorporating these annotations into data analysis workflow remains a challenge to further demonstrate the utility of metab mesh data_set and provide a quick and easy way to annotate metabolic_networks we developed metdisease a plug in for the open_source tool cytoscapethat uses disease related mesh_terms users can import and annotate any network where metabolites compounds are represented as nodes referenced by kegg or pubchem ids the edges can be arbitrarily defined by the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com users metdisease allows users to highlight and explore parts of metabolic_networks related to one or more mesh disease terms and provides links to relevant pubmed literature users have an option to import their own metabolic_networks or to use metdisease to annotate metabolic_networks generated with the cytoscape plug in metscape both use cases are illustrated below to illustrate the use and features of metdisease we created a network using a publicly_available metabolomics dataset a subset of known metabolites was downloaded from supplementary data ggm xlsx partial correlation_coefficient values e were used to draw the edges in the resulting network see supplementary data file once the network was loaded to cytoscape we used metdisease to identify mesh disease terms associated with compound nodes as shown in once the network has been loaded users can select metdisease from the cytoscape apps menu when the filter options dialog box appears users are prompted to select an appropriate identifier kegg or pubchem id and the column in their input_file that contains that identifier after the mapping has been completed the disease branch of the mesh tree is displayed the mesh_terms that have mapped compounds in an active network are shown in bold users have an option to hide unmatched terms by right clicking on the node of interest users can access pubmed publications as shown in or identify other mesh_terms related to the compound of interest by going to the metab mesh web_application another characteristic feature of metdisease is the ability to annotate metabolic_networks generated by metscape a use case where a glycine metabolic_network generated by metscape was annotated using metdisease is shown in supplementary where sarcosine has been appropriately linked to prostatic neoplasms in conclusion metdisease provides a quick convenient way to identify compounds associated with a disease term and identify publications that link them together just like the underlying metab mesh data_set because of its dependence on what is in the literature metdisease is not meant to predict novel associations however as the examples illustrate it is a useful tool for identifying disease associations that would otherwise be difficult to find importantly because the associations are not derived from genome based metabolic reconstructions metdisease can be used to annotate a broader range of compounds including drugs nutritional compounds and environmental toxins funding support was provided by the nih u da a p dk p es and dk conflict of interest none declared numbers to the right of the term indicate the number of mapped metabolites in the active network by right clicking on the node of interest e g glycine user can access the publications in pubmed that substantiate that connection
