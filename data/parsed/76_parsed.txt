a combinatorial_approach for analyzing intra_tumor from high_throughput high_throughput of tumor_samples has shown that most tumors_exhibit extensive intra_tumor with multiple subpopulations of tumor_cells containing different som atic mutations recent_studies have quantified this intra tumor hetero geneity by clustering mutations into subpopulations according to the observed counts of dna sequencing_reads containing the variant allele however these clustering_approaches do not consider that the population frequencies of different tumor subpopulations are correlated by their shared_ancestry in the same population of cells results we introduce the binary tree partition btp a novel com binatorial formulation of the problem of constructing the subpopula tions of tumor_cells from the variant allele_frequencies of somatic_mutations we show that finding a btp is an np complete problem derive an approximation algorithm for an optimization version of the problem and present a recursive algorithm to find a btp with errors in the input we show that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing clustering_approaches on simulated and real sequencing_data availability_and python and matlab implementations of our method are available atcancer is a disease driven by somatic_mutations that accumulate in the genome during the lifetime of an individual high_throughput now provide an unprecedented ability to measure these somatic_mutations in tumor_samples application of these technologies to cohorts of cancer patients has revealed a number of new cancer causing mutations and cancer_genes cancer sequencing studies have also demonstrated that most tumors_exhibit extensive intra_tumor characterized by individual cells in the same tumor harboring different complements of somatic_mutations such heterogeneity is a consequence of the fact that cancer is an evolutionary_process in a population of cells the clonal theory of cancer evolution posits that the cells of a tumor descended from a single founder cell this founder cell contained an advantageous mutation leading to a clonal_expansion of a large population of cells descended from the founder subsequent clonal expansions occur as additional advantageous mutations accumulate in descendent cells a sequenced tumor sample thus consists of multiple subpopulations of tumor_cells from the most recent clonal expansions nearly all cancer sequencing_efforts thus far sequence dna from a single sample of a tumor at a single time this is because of technical_limitations the most cost_effective dna_sequencing e g illumina require input dna from many tumor_cells and such samples are typically available only when patients undergo surgery occasionally paired_samples from two time points such as a primary_tumor and a metastasis are also sequenced while sequencing of multiple samples from the same tumor or single_cell might eventually provide even better datasets to assess intra_tumor technical_considerations have limited their applicability utility thus far thus there is tremendous interest in methods that infer the relative proportion of different subpopulations of tumor_cells in a single sample several recent_studies that it is possible to infer the subpopulations of tumor_cells by counting the number of dna_sequence that contain a somatic_mutation for single_nucleotide or variants the variant allele_frequency vaf is defined as the fraction of dna_sequence covering the variant position that contains the variant allele rather than the reference germ_line allele the vaf provides an estimate of the fraction of tumor chromosomes containing the mutation but with error due to the stochastic_nature of the sequencing_process in addition technologies currently used in cancer sequencing studies produce short_reads that rarely contain more than one somatic_mutation thus for any pair of somatic_mutations the only information available to distinguish their subpopulation of origin is the vaf to overcome substantial variability in measured vafs a common approach is to cluster vafs and from these clusters infer the number and proportion of various subpopulations of tumor_cells in the sample a number of techniques have been introduced to perform this clustering with dirichlet_process mixture_models and related non parametric_models being particularly popular as they do not fix the number of clusters in advance vaf clusters correspond to tumor subpopulations and the cellular fraction or fraction of tumor_cells containing the cluster of somatic_mutation is derived from the vaf of the clusters in the simplest case the vaf directly determines the cellular fraction e g a cluster with vaf corresponding to homozygous mutations in of tumor_cells or to whom correspondence should be

heterozygous_mutations in of tumor_cells however in practice the inference of cellular fraction is complicated by copy_number and normal admixture percentage of the tumor sample that is normal cells and these two factors are themselves correlated we will not consider such complications here rather we restrict attention to heterozygous somatic_mutations outside of copy_number assumptions that were made in sequencing studies including with two exceptions current_techniques for clustering vafs treat each subpopulation independently and do not consider that these frequencies are correlated by the fact that they are partitions of the same cellular population thus these approaches do not explicitly construct an evolutionary_history of the accumulated somatic_mutations in the cells performs a heuristic_search over possible trees and we discussbelow contributions in this article we formulate the problem of inferring subpopulations of tumor_cells from vaf data obtained from a single tumor sample as the combinatorial problem of constructing a binary tree partition btp we show that the problem of finding a btp is np complete and present a o approximation algorithm for a related max btp problem the approximation algorithm is based on local_search and we use the well known packing bound offor the purpose of analysis next we define btp a generalization of the btp problem that allows for the possibility that vafs are observed with errors and some vafs are not observed we present a straightforward recursive algorithm to find an btp and show that this algorithm outperforms existing vaf clustering_approaches on simulated_and this recursive algorithm is fast in practice and runs in less than a minute on a single_cpu for each of our simulated or real_samples
