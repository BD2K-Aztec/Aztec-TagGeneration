dsviadrm an r package for estimating disease similarity via dysfunctional regulation_mechanism elucidation of human disease similarities has provided new insights into etiology disease classification and drug_repositioning since dysfunctional regulation would be manifested as the decoupling of expression correlation disease similarity ds in terms of dysfunctional regulation_mechanism drm could be estimated by using a differential_coexpression based_approach which is described in a companion_paper due to the lack of tools for estimating ds from the viewpoint of drm in public_domain we implemented an r package dsviadrm to identify significant ds via drm based on transcriptomic_data dsviadrm contains five easy to use functions dcea dcpathway ds comdcgl and comdcglplot for identifying disease relationships and showing common differential regulation information shared by similar diseases availability_and dsviadrm is available as an r package with a users guide and source_code at http cran r project org_web dsviadrm index html disease similarity ds study has emerged as an active research area which helps to systematically investigate etiology pathogenesis and even perform drug_repositioning because drug clinical_application can be appropriated from one disease to its similar ones in recent_years scientists explored ds based on clinical_manifestations electronic_medical disease related genes and disease related differentially_expressed accordingly several analysis tools and databases have been released to detect disease relationships such as dosim diseaseconnect human phenotype ontology comparative_toxicogenomics and malacards it has been realized that although clinical_manifestations and electronic_medical supply valuable information for estimating ds it is hard to unravel underlying_mechanisms hidden in disease relationships while the disease relationships generated from disease related genes pathways are inevitably biased to well studied diseases and thus offer limited chance to discover novel findings it has been well established that diseases are highly_correlated to the rewiring of gene_regulatory or dysfunctional regulation and differential_coexpression analysis dcea has proved to be useful in exploring potential differential regulation_mechanism i e dysfunctional regulation_mechanism drm shows the overall design and main outputs of dsviadrm first dcea carries out differential_coexpression analyses at both gene level and gene_pair level second dcpathway transforms the calculation results from gene level to pathway level based on which ds estimates disease similarities and outputs significantly similar diseases in the form of a disease network then comdcgl extracts common differentially_coexpressed genes dcgs and differentially_coexpressed links pairs dcls shared by similar diseases finally by integrating transcriptional_regulation information the common dcgs and dcls are presented as a gene network via comdcglplot following this architecture we introduce the above five functions one by one dcea dcea includes dcp and dce methods which were developed in our previous_works to identify dcgs and dcls dcp calculates differential_coexpression values dc of n genes for m diseases as well as their pand q values while dce calculates correlation values of p gene_pairs for m diseases and their p q values see the supplementary_file for more algorithmic information of dcp and dce dcpathway dcpathway includes a pathway library which comes from msigdb and involves pathways and genes by calculating the dc of a pathway as the average dc of its component genes dcpathway outputs the dc values of pathways for each disease as shown in ds ds is the core of the whole package it computes the partial correlation_coefficients of pathways dcs between any two diseases as their ds measure partial correlation_coefficient eq is evoked from an r package ppcor dsviadrm is released as an r package into the comprehensive_r cran and can be obtained at http cran r project org_web dsviadrm index html functions of the overall design of dsviadrm dsviadrm includes dcea dcpathway ds comdcgl and comdcglplot functions in comdcgl dc d n is short for the dc values of genes for disease n similarly corr d n is short for the correlation values of gene_pairs for disease n
