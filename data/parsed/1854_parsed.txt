bioimage_informatics flowfit a bioconductor_package to estimate proliferation in cell_tracking dye studies herein we introduce flowfit a bioconductor_package designed to perform quantitative analysis of cell_proliferation in tracking dye based experiments the software distributed as an r bioconductor library is based on a mathematical_model that takes_into the height of each peak the size and position of the parental population labeled but not proliferating and the estimated distance between the brightness of a cell and the brightness of its daughter in which the dye is assumed to undergo a fold dilution although the algorithm does not make any inference on cell_types rates of cell_divisions or rates of cell_death it deconvolutes the actual collected data into a set of peaks whereby each peak corresponds to a subpopulation of cells that have divided n times we validated flowfit by retrospective_analysis of published proliferation tracking experiments and demonstrated that the algorithm predicts the same percentage of cells generation either in samples with discernible peaks in which the peaks are visible in the collected raw_data or in samples with non discernible peaks in which the peaks are fused together to the best of our knowledge flowfit represents the first open_source algorithm in its category and might be applied to numerous areas of cell_biology in which quantitative deconvolution of tracking dye based experiments is desired including stem_cell availability_and in cell_proliferation tracking experiments cells are stained before being cultured under various conditionswith a fluorescent_dye to follow proliferation kinetics at each mitosis the dye is roughly equally_divided between daughter_cells so that each daughter is about half as fluorescent as the mother at any given moment therefore the fluorescence_intensity of a cell bears witness to its divisional history when compared with the intensity of the parental population in a typical experimental pipeline cells are first labeled with a tracking dye then allowed to proliferate frequently in the presence of specific stimuli and finally analyzed_by by collecting data for i unlabeled cells used as a negative control ii unstimulated labeled cells the non proliferating population and iii sample s of labeled and stimulated cells the proliferating populations if the characteristics of the logarithmic amplifier on the flow_cytometer are known it is possible to derive from a histogram of fluorescence_intensity the proportion of cells that have undergone any particular number of divisions generally a flow_cytometer with channels channels range represents a nominal range of log decades several fluorochromes have been used to track cell_proliferation including dna_binding fluorescent_dyes hoechst thiazole orange cytoplasmically distributed fluorescent_dyes calcein bis carboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein covalent coupling fluorescent_dyes carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester fluorescein_isothiocyanate and membrane inserting fluorescent_dyes pkh cellvue lavander although each dye displays advantages_and for individual experimental purposes reviewed in a common problem is represented by the quantification of the fluorescence_signal under optimal conditions some dyes e g carboxyfluorescein_diacetate succinimidyl ester cfse form separate peaks defining different proliferative generations whereas others e g pkh do not a good proliferation tracking algorithm should be able to give similar results in both cases here we introduce flowfit an r r development core team bioconductor library that fits a set of peaks corresponding to different generations of cells to the histogram of fluorescence_intensity acquired during a fluorescence_activated facs experiment the package is integrated with the bioconductor libraries used for the analysis of flow_cytometry datasets flowcore and flowviz the performance of flowfit was evaluated by the retrospective_analysis of a published dataset of dye tracking experiments in which lymphocytes were stained with three different proliferationtracking dyes cfse cell_proliferation dye efluor cpd and celltrace violet ctv in particular we meta_analyzed a subpopulation of cd lymphocytes labeled with the three different staining reagents the three samples were allowed to proliferate under identical growth conditions however differences in the characteristics of the dyes yielded rather different to whom correspondence should be addressed fluorescence histograms with different peak definitions flowfit was able to deconvolute equally well in all situations and to estimate the same percentage of cells per generation under all conditions the proliferation fitting algorithm was tested by retrospective_analysis of a published dataset consisting of three samples of mouse lymphocytes stained with cfse ctv and cpd we focused on the raw_data used to generateof the original paper this subset of raw_data contains four samples cd non stimulated lymphocytes labeled with cfse cpd and ctv parental population cd lymphocytes labeled with cfse and stimulated cd lymphocytes labeled with cpd and stimulated cd lymphocytes labeled with ctv and stimulatedthe datasets already gated for cd lymphocytes were log_transformed after truncation at then we performed three parentfitting on the parental sample to establish the position and size of the parental population for the three dyes using the parental peak_position and size as a best guess we performed a proliferationfitting with the dynamic_model on the cfse and ctv samples in the cpd sample the stimulated population did not display well separated peaks at variance with the ctv and cfse samples thus for the cpd sample we used a fixed model proliferationfitting with fixedmodel true keeping the parental peak_position fixed finally we compared the percentage of cells per generation in the three samples and evaluated the concordance among the fittings using the chi_squared we did not observe any significant_difference in the distribution of cells per generation among the three estimates p arguing that the algorithm is correctly estimating the percentage of cells per generation in the three samples supplementary altogether the proliferationfitting analysis performed on the datasets published by quah and parish which yielded_similar compared with those of the original study argues for the suitability of flowfit to the analysis of cell_proliferation in tracking dye experiments with either poorly or well discernible peaks based on the dual possibility to fit them respectively with the dynamic_model or with the fixed model we also performed an in silico analysis to benchmark the performance of the algorithm with random_samples and supplementary_materials section including supplementary figs s s for the dynamic and fixed models in general the dynamic_model performed well with samples where the parental peak size that corresponds to the variance in the initial staining is small and the proliferating population forms wellseparated peaks the fixed model on the other hand performs well also with samples with a poorly_defined cell_division peaks cf supplementary figs s and s the objective of this work was to provide an open_source algorithm to quantify the proliferation of cells in tracking dye experiments of note although the proliferation fitting algorithms currently available for this type of analyses modfit lt tm fcs express and flowjo are commercial software flowfit is already publicly_available and published with the artistic license in the bioconductor r framework we provided statistical demonstration of the quality of the fitting with both in silico analysis and real_dataset analysis in particular we demonstrated the intrinsic versatility of flowfit in providing reliable results in the analysis of samples with both discernible and non discernible peaks at variance with modfit lt tm which uses a statistical_analysis of the fluorescence histogram to identify potential peaks and a gaussian_model for the single peak flowfit uses a levenbergmarquadt algorithm to minimize the difference between the observed data and the model and uses a non gaussian formula to define a peak in addition flowfit is fully integrated in the bioconductor r framework in recent_years several approaches based on dye tracking have been developed to identify and isolate adult_stem scs from normal and tumor_tissues e g these methodologies rely on the fact thatin the normal adult sc compartmentscs divide asymmetrically to generate two daughter_cells with opposite proliferative and differentiative fates one of the two daughter_cells retains the sc fate and withdraws into quiescence whereas the other becomes a progenitor and enters a tumultuous phase of repeated symmetric divisions required to expand the progenitor compartment followed by terminal lineage differentiation one characteristic of the sc compartment in cancer is that the cancer scs tend to skip rounds of asymmetric_division in favor of symmetric divisions after which both daughters divide again this leads to an expansion of the sc compartment the rate of skipping seems to be higher in poorly_differentiated more aggressive_tumors methodologies to follow the kinetics of sc division in vitro and to compare the rate of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions are needed if we want to understand the biological bases of homeostasis of normal sc compartments and of how expansion of the sc compartment drives cancer growth and aggressiveness we envision this as one of the major areas of application for flowfit to this aim the integration of flowfit with a stochastic_model of cell_proliferation based on a gillespie algorithm will likely be required to analyze in real tumor_tissues the proliferation kinetics of cancer scs compared with that of their tumor progeny and to compare proliferation data from these populations with relevant theoretical_models of proliferation for instance models of asymmetric versus symmetric mode of division in the cancer sc versus the transient amplifying compartment of progenitors this approach will probably be instrumental to identifying parameters in the stochastic_model able to yield the best overlap between real_data and simulations note summary of in silico analysis random_samples with different levels of division peak quality supplementary section the maximum peak width that gives reliable results column varying
