funcish learning a functional representation of neural ish images motivation high_spatial imaging datasets of mammalian brains have recently become available in unprecedented amounts images now reveal highly complex patterns of gene_expression varying on multiple_scales the challenge in analyzing these images is both in extracting the patterns that are most relevant functionally and in providing a meaningful representation that allows neuroscien tists to interpret the extracted patterns results here we present funcisha method to learn functional representations of neural in situ_hybridization ish images we represent images using a histogram of local descriptors in several scales and we use this representation to learn detectors of functional go categories for every image as a result each image is represented as a point in a low dimensional_space whose axes correspond to meaningful functional_annotations the resulting representations define similarities between ish images that can be easily explained by functional_categories we applied our method to the genomic set of mouse neural ish images available at the allen brain atlas finding that most neural biological_processes can be inferred from spatial expression_patterns with high_accuracy using functional representations we predict several gene interaction properties such as proteinprotein_interactions and cell_type specificity more accurately than competing_methods based on global correlations we used funcish to identify similar expression_patterns of gabaergic neuronal_markers that were not previously_identified and to infer new gene function based on imageimage similarities in recent_years high_resolution expression data measured in mammalian brains became available in quantities and qualities never witnessed before calling for new ways to analyze neural gene_expression images most existing_methods for bio imaging analysis were developed to handle data with different characteristics like drosophila_embryos or cellular imagery the mammalian_brain composed of billions of neurons and glia is organized in highly complex anatomical_structures and poses new challenges for analysis current approaches for analyzing brain_images are based on smooth non linear transformations to a reference atlas and may be insensitive to fine local patterns like those emerging from the layered_structure of the cerebellum or the spatial distribution of cortical_interneurons another challenge for automatic_analysis of biological images lies in providing human interpretable analysis most machinevision approaches are developed for tasks in analysis of natural_images like object_recognition in such tasks humans can understand the scene effortlessly and infer complex relations between objects easily in bio imaging however the goal of image_analysis is often to reveal features and structures that are hardly seen even by experts it is therefore important that an image_analysis approach provides meaningful interpretation to any patterns or structures that it detects here we develop a method to learn functional representations of expression images by using predefined functional ontologies this approach has two main advantages accuracy and interpretability and it builds on a growing body of work in object_recognition in natural_images showing how images can be represented using the activations of a large set of detectors for object_recognition the detectors may include common objects like a detector for the presence of a chair a mug or a door here we show how to adapt this idea to represent gene_expression images by training a large set of detectors each corresponding to a known functional category like axon_guidance or glutamatergic receptors once this representation is trained every gene is represented as a point in a low dimensional_space whose axes correspond to functional meaningful categories we describe in section how to learn functional representations in a discriminative way and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on in situ_hybridization ish gene_expression images of the adult_mouse collected by the allen institute for brain science ish image_analysis has been used in the past to infer gene biological_functions from spatial co expression in non neural_tissues however inferring functions based on gene_expression in the brain is believed to be hard as several studies found very low_variability between transcriptomic patterns of different brain_regions sometimes even lower than between subject variability for the same area neural expression_patterns are usually studied using methods that average expression values over a brain_region and this averaging removes fine resolution spatial_information that may differentiate between brain_regions here we analyze high_resolution ish images at several scales taking_into subtle even cellular resolution information for functional inference to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an open_access

please_contact permissions_oup comwe find that gene function can indeed be inferred from neural ish images particularly in biological_processes that are related to neural_activities our approach detects related genes with better accuracy based on the similarity of their functional representations furthermore these similarities can be explained and interpreted using semantic terms we start with evaluating the quality of the low_dimensional semantic representation that we learned in two aspects the classification_accuracy for individual semantic terms and the precision of our genegene similarity measure compared with a spatial_correlation based method we then take a closer look at discriminative spatial_patterns mapping them back onto raw images finally we use the geometry of the low_dimensional semantic space to infer new gene_functions via gene similarities and their interpretations
