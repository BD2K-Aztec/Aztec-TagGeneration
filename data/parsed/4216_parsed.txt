shape component analysis structure preserving dimension_reduction on biological shape spaces motivation quantitative shape analysis is required by a wide_range of biological studies across diverse scales ranging from molecules to cells and organisms in particular high_throughput and systems level studies of biological structures and functions have started to produce large volumes of complex high_dimensional shape data analysis and understanding of high_dimensional biological shape data require dimension_reduction techniques results we have developed a technique for non linear dimension_reduction of d and d biological shape representations on their riemannian spaces a key feature of this technique is that it preserves distances between different shapes in an embedded low_dimensional shape space we demonstrate an application of this technique by combining it with non linear mean shift clustering on the riemannian spaces for unsupervised_clustering of shapes of cellular organelles and proteins availability_and source_code and data for reproducing results of this article are freely_available at https github com ccdlcmu shape component analysis matlab the implementation was made in matlab and supported on ms windows linux and mac os geometrical shapes are a fundamental property of biological structures quantitative shape analysis is required by many biological studies across diverse scales for example at the molecular_scale quantitative analysis of shapes of proteins is essential for understanding their functions and interactions as another example at the cellular scale quantitative analysis of shapes of cells is essential for understanding their morphogenesis and migration recently high_throughput and systems level biological studies have started to produce large volumes of complex biological shape data from structural analysis or image_analysis d the biological shape data produced often have high_dimensions which pose a significant challenge for their analysis and understanding dimension_reduction is an essential tool for analyzing and understanding high_dimensional a wide_range of related techniques have been developed however for effective dimension_reduction of biological shape representations it is crucial to take into account their specific structures and properties specifically biological shapes are often represented by points on high_dimensional riemannian spaces differences between distinct shapes are best represented by their riemannian distances rather than euclidean_distances which are commonly used in dimension_reduction this can be seen from the example in which shows that riemannian distances better differentiate between different shapes indeed non linear riemannian geometry of shape spaces is proposed as a tool of choice for characterizing geometric differences between shapes in this study we described d shapes using their landmark representation lack well defined landmarks using their spherical harmonic representation shr we developed a technique for nonlinear dimension_reduction of these two shape representations on their riemannian spaces a key feature of our technique is that the non linear distances between shapes are preserved in an embedded low_dimensional shape space we demonstrate an application of our dimension_reduction approach by combining it with non linear mean shift clustering on riemannian spaces for unsupervised_clustering of shapes of mitochondria and proteins experimental_results confirmed that the proposed dimension_reduction technique when combined with mean shift clustering provided equivalent clustering performance but substantially_reduced processing time because the cost of computing the riemannian distance between two shapes depends linearly on their dimension the proposed dimension_reduction approach is general and can also be combined with other shape analysis techniques in the remaining part of the article we first outline the theory of shape space and then describe our dimension_reduction technique and its integration with unsupervised mean shift clustering on shape spaces the overall shape analysis work flow is summarized in we present experimental_results on a variety of shape datasets first on a generic d shape dataset then on a d mitochondrial shape dataset and lastly on a d protein shape dataset in this study we proposed a technique for dimension_reduction on the riemannian manifold of d and d biological shapes a key_advantage of this technique is that it preserves distances between different shapes in an embedded low_dimensional shape space we showed that although shr of d shapes differs from the landmark representation of d shapes they share the same riemannian geometry and thus can be processed using the same dimension_reduction technique we verified the proposed technique on datasets of d and d shapes specifically we demonstrated an application of the technique by combining it with non linear mean shift clustering for unsupervised classification of biological shapes our approach is general and provides a tool for analyzing and understanding large sets of high_dimensional shape data it can also be integrated with shape analysis techniques other than mean shift clustering our approach is similar to pga in that both aim for dimension_reduction of shape representations pga relies on principal_component on the tangent space of the mean shape in comparison our approach maps shapes directly from a high_dimensional shape space to a low_dimensional shape space without making use of the tangent space in this way our approach better preserves distances between different shapes by causing less distortion and therefore better retains riemannian geometry in the dimension reduced space tables and however our approach also has its limitations in its current form it can only handle genus zero surfaces and does not support local or adaptive approximation
