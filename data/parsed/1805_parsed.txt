sequence_analysis feature incorporated alignment based ligand_binding residue prediction for carbohydrate binding modules motivation carbohydrate binding modules cbms share similar secondary and tertiary topology but their primary sequence_identity is low computational_identification of ligand_binding residues allows biologists to better understand the proteincarbohydrate binding mechanism in general functional characterization can be alternatively solved by alignment based manners as alignment_accuracy based on conventional methods is often sensitive to sequence_identity low sequence_identity among query_sequences makes_it to precisely locate small portions of relevant_features therefore we propose a feature incorporated alignment fia to flexibly align conserved signatures in cbms then an fia based target template prediction model was further implemented to identify functional ligand_binding residues results arabidopsis_thaliana cbm and cbm were used to validate the fia based prediction model the predicted ligand_binding residues residing on the surface in the hypothetical structures were verified to be ligand_binding residues in the absence of d structural_information fia demonstrated_significant in the estimation of sequence_similarity and identity for a total of sequences from different cbm families as compared with six leading tools by friedman rank test contact carbohydrate binding modules cbms are defined as a set of protein_domains capable of recognizing and binding polysaccharide ligands with the exception of some lectins and sugar transport proteins most cbms mediate the interaction between the substrate and the enzyme which in turn increases local substrate_concentration at the active_site of the catalytic_domain cbms are protein_domains sharing low sequence_identities that possess conserved_structure topology up to now cbms have been classified into families still growing by cazy to whom correspondence should be addressed database http www cazy org among these families cbm cbm cbm cbm cbm cbm cbm cbm and cbm are reported to possess starch binding activity the most recent review comprehensively introduces the importance of functions and structures of cbm the primary sequence_identities of cbm families are low however bioinformatics_analysis suggests that some cbms constitute a cbm clan such as cbm s cbm s cbm s and cbm s a better understanding of ligand_binding residues in cbms can boost protein_engineering for industrial_development in food_processing and biofuel_production guzman to predict ligand_binding residues in a protein domain proteinligand docking programs are typically applied to simulate the binding_site of a target protein relative to a ligand conformation and orientation in general docking programs require precise atom coordinate information to calculate the optimal geometric pose under stereo chemical restraints and are usually based on certain criteria such as binding_affinity and minimal free_energy nevertheless the time complexity of the optimized procedure is extremely_high such that docking programs are commonly solved by heuristic_algorithms like the genetic_algorithm besides real proteinligand_interactions always involve conformational_change when the structural flexibility is also taken into account the computational_complexity becomes prohibitively complicated furthermore although more than million protein_sequences are currently available in uniprotkb trembl database as of january only protein_structures have been deposited in protein_data thus the number of resolved protein_structures is far behind that of protein_sequences in reality it is expensive_and to resolve a protein_structure and non productive to determine all protein_structures nevertheless the lack of a resolved protein_structure does not hinder researchers from identifying crucial functional_residues governing reaction_mechanisms when tertiary structural_information is not available it is still possible to predict ligand_binding residues from sequence alone recently some pure sequence_based prediction methodologies applied sequence_alignment to generate a column of conserved_residues and calculated the residue conservation score based on training with known functional_residues in terms ofpage the original motivation of this study was to locate conserved_regions possessing hydrophilic aromatic_residues and stranded structures in cbms based on accurate alignment results from fia we further applied the idea to predict ligand_binding residues for cbm and cbm family proteins lacking resolved structures demonstrates the strength of fia and in that stranded structures and aromatic_residues appeared to be well aligned low sequence_identity makes_it to recognize the core_regions in most cases which implies that not every region in the query_sequence is equally_important for molecular_recognition alternatively if the key conserved_regions can be well aligned or anchored the alignment_quality will not drop substantially indeed fia successfully predicts four experimentally confirmed ligandbinding residues in atcbm and atcbm in addition sequence_alignment is a preliminary_analysis tool and is the foundation of advanced research topics such as classification cath secondary_structure dsc and structure modeling swiss model as shown in lists the performance comparison of fia and the other six outstanding alignment tools fia achieved the highest_average sequence_similarity and identity among all tested families fia significantly_improved sequence_similarity and sequence_identity at a high confidence_level by friedman rank test these improvements suggest that the incorporated biological_features are informative for increasing alignment_accuracy besides an excellent alignment_tool should insert fewer gaps to minimize alignment_length as shown in with the exception of fia mafft outperforms the other five tools by which five more averaged gaps were inserted as compared with fia refer to supplementary these findings_suggest that fia reports high alignment_accuracy with minimized alignment_length a similar knowledge incorporated approach was applied in constrained multiple_sequence the problem was that the constrained positions rely on experts prior_knowledge in contrast fia is based on biological_properties inside sequence content contained within cbms nevertheless the hydrophilic aromatic_residues in other protein_families including hsp like chaperones superfamily and e regulatory transactivation_domain can be also identified and correlated with functional_roles thus fia is easy to be generalized without specialist intervention furthermore advanced tools usually rely on plain alignment and the alignment_quality directly affects the performance of future_studies the advanced tools require accurate alignment to increase their robustness this requirement emphasizes the importance of alignment_accuracy in practice fia is based on the experimentally confirmed ligand_binding residues more annotated sequences trend to increase the ppv furthermore the template structures were preclassified by cath a more plentiful and accurate structure classification is believed to extend protein categories that fia can predict for implementation fia requires secondary_structure when more accurate secondary_structure prediction_tool is available the performance can be further improved
