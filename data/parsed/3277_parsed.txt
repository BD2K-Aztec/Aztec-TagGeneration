nonparametric bayesian_inference for perturbed and orthologous gene_regulatory motivation the generation of time series transcriptomic datasets collected under multiple experimental_conditions has proven to be a powerful approach for disentangling complex biological_processes allowing for the reverse_engineering of gene_regulatory grns most methods for reverse_engineering grns from multiple datasets assume that each of the time series were generated from networks with identical topology in this study we outline a hierarchical non parametric bayesian_approach for reverse_engineering grns using multiple time series that can be applied in a number of novel situations including i where different but overlapping sets of transcription_factors are expected to bind in the different experimental_conditions that is where switching events could potentially arise under the different treatments and ii for inference in evolutionary related species in which orthologous grns exist more generally the method can be used to identify context specific regulation by leveraging time_series alongside methods that can identify putative lists of transcription_factors or transcription_factor targets results the hierarchical inference outperforms related but non hierarchical approaches when the networks used to generate the data were identical and performs comparably even when the networks used to generate data were independent the method was subsequently used alongside yeast one hybrid and microarray time series data to infer potential transcriptional switches in arabidopsis_thaliana response to stress the results confirm previous biological studies and allow for additional insights into gene_regulation under various abiotic_stresses the generation and analysis of highly_resolved time series datasets measuring transcriptional change has become an increasingly common and powerful approach for disentangling complex biological_processes with several consortia having generated detailed time series under different experimental_conditions perturbations for example the atgenexpress consortium to whom correspondence should be or presta consortium a major_goal in the analysis of such data is the identification of regulatory_relationships by reverse_engineering gene_regulatory grns recent_approaches for the reverse_engineering of grns from time series data make use of nonparametric bayesian learning_strategies that have proven competitive with other state of the art approaches particularly when learning from multiple datasets to be computationally manageable these methods assume that the number of transcription_factor tf proteins binding the promoter_region of a given gene at any given time are limited corresponding to a fan in restriction recent_studies using yeast one hybrid screens of arabidopsis_thaliana tfs however suggest that large_numbers of tfs have the potential to bind any given gene additionally in order for these nonparametric methods to learn from multiple datasets it was assumed that the individual time series were generated from networks with identical topology in light of the number of tf_binding promoter_regions it is likely that most organisms use a series of transcriptional switches to cope with the variety of stresses and environmental_challenges they face with the tfs binding under a given condition not necessarily the same as those binding in another condition or in different tissues in these situations the number of tfs binding under any given condition is likely to be fewer than the total number that can possibly bind consequently it is of interest to identify which subsets of tfs are binding under different conditions by identifying treatment specific grns which may or may not share some common structure in this regard identifying context specific regulatory_networks represents a useful way of combining time_series with methods that can identify putative transcriptional_regulators including yeast one hybrid and multiple chip chip_seq alternatively the grns of evolutionarily_related species might be expected to share some common structure by virtue of a shared ancestral network time series data generated in the two species could therefore be informative of one another in these cases it might be of interest to identify the similarities and differences in the grns of the two species such an approach could prove immensely useful for leveraging information from simpler but better understood model systems into more complex organisms allowing for useful biological_insights such as addressing whyrecent approaches for reverse_engineering grns make use of nonparametric bayesian_methods and have proven competitive with other approaches penfold and wild a key_advantage of these nonparametric approaches is their ability to learn from multiple experimental perturbations to do so however these methods must make assumptions about the number of tfs that can bind any given gene and further assume that each of the time series perturbations were generated from an identical network these assumptions do not appear to hold in vivo where large_numbers of tfs can bind albeit with different subsets likely acting under different perturbations conditions to address these limitations we have used a hierarchical modelling framework that that should be applicable to a variety of novel situations including modelling grns under different experimental_conditions different tissues or ecotypes where different but overlapping sets of transcription_factors are expected to bind in the different treatments with a limited number of tfs binding under any given condition tissue ecotype modelling of orthologous networks in evolutionary related species where orthologous_genes are expected to form similar but non identical networks in these situations the hyperparent can be interpreted as the network_structure of a common_ancestor with the individual temperature parameters representing evolutionary distance from the common_ancestor for leveraging multiple sources of potentially contradictory prior information such as competing network_structures similar to the use in werhli and husmeier
