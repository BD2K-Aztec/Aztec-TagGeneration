data_and algorithms and tools for protein_protein clustering with a special focus on population_based stochastic_methods motivation proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks are powerful models to represent the pairwise protein interactions of the organisms clustering ppi_networks can be useful for isolating groups of interacting_proteins that participate in the same biological_processes or that perform together specific_biological evolutionary orthologies can be inferred this way as well as functions and properties of yet uncharacterized_proteins results we present an overview of the main state of the art clustering_methods that have been applied to ppi_networks over the past_decade we distinguish five specific categories of approaches describe and compare their main features and then focus on one of them i e population_based stochastic_search we provide an experimental evaluation based on some validation measures widely used in the literature of techniques in this class that are as yet less explored than the others in particular we study how the capability of genetic_algorithms gas to extract clusters in ppi_networks varies when different topology based fitness functions are used and we compare gas with the main techniques in the other categories the experimental campaign shows that predictions returned by gas are often more accurate than those produced by the contestant methods interesting issues still remain_open about possible generalizations of gas allowing for cluster overlapping availability_and we point out which methods and tools described here are publicly_available biological_networks have received much attention in the past_few since they model the complex interactions_occurring among different components in the cell thanks to the development of advanced high_throughput von large volumes of experimental_data on proteinprotein_interactions ppis have been made available special kinds of biological_networks ppi_networks are where the cellular_components under analysis are proteins in a ppi_network nodes correspond to proteins and edges correspond to pairwise interactions between proteins proteins are organized into different putative complexes each performing specific tasks in the cell proteins interacting with each other often participate in the same biological_processes or can be associated with specific_biological being strongly related it is worth pointing out that interacting_proteins can belong to protein_complexes or functional_modules with different biological meanings a protein complex is a molecular machine consisting of several proteins that bind to each other at the same place and time whereas a functional module consists of a few proteins that control or perform a particular cellular function by interacting among themselves these proteins do not necessarily interact at the same time and place however pairwise protein interaction data stored in public_databases usually do not distinguish explicitly between such temporal and spatial_information about ppis in the following we will refer either to complex or module to indicate a group of proteins that are connected by a large number of pairwise interactions the detection of protein_complexes using ppi_networks can help in understanding the mechanisms_regulating cell life in describing the evolutionary orthology signal e g in predicting the biological_functions of uncharacterized_proteins and more importantly for therapeutic purposes the problem of detecting protein_complexes using ppi_networks can be computationally addressed using clustering techniques clustering consists of grouping data_objects into groups also called clusters or communities such that the objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than the objects in the other clusters possible uncharacterized_proteins in a cluster may be assigned to the biological_function recognized for that module and groups of proteins performing the same tasks can be singled out this way as observed in a generally_accepted definition of cluster does not exist in the context of networks as it depends on the specific application domain however it is widely_accepted that a community should have more internal than external connections for biological to whom correspondence should be addressed the goal of this review is fold i providing a compact overview of the main techniques presented in the literature for ppi_networks clustering and ii presenting an experimental campaign to show the capability of gas in extracting clusters from ppi_networks according to different topology based fitness functions and with respect to the main other approaches both aspects allow us to draw interesting considerations and conclusive remarks a first observation is that some of the methods discussed here almost in the ld category obtain modules one at a time by the selection of a seed node that is expanded until a condition generally related to the cluster density is satisfied thus they can be considered bottom up approaches individual nodes are grouped together until all the graphs have been examined approaches that simultaneously find the clusters e g ps ones are instead top_down approaches they consider the whole graph and try to partition it in connected components by cutting edges owing to the threshold constrains that many ld methods require to satisfy to decide when a group of connected nodes is a cluster nodes with few interactions are often discarded the presence of these proteins would reduce the value of the function to optimize the elimination of sparsely connected nodes has two main drawbacks first it prevents the possibility of obtaining topological shapes different from maximally dense subgraphs second important information on the network_structure could be lost in the authors observe that bottom up approaches discard a high percentage of nodes though the returned clusters may have a more accurate p value on the other hand top_down approaches produce a lower number of unassigned proteins yielding modules with larger_size but with lower p value results on the network coverage of ppi clustering techniques are provided in pizzuti and rombo a where it is shown that some of the ld approaches are able to reach a good compromise between the percentage of input network that is included in the output clustering and the overall accuracy of the clustering populationbased methods follow a top_down approach however they rely on the evolution of solutions guided by fitness maximization and their combination to either connect or disconnect pairs nodes they simultaneously extract the output clusters thus guaranteeing a total coverage of the input network as no protein is unassigned another point is that proteins generally may participate in multiple_biological thus methods that assign a protein to only one group such as the gas tested here hamper the possibility of proteins to be clustered in several groups on the basis of the different functions they have in the cell this limits their potentiality in describing the complexity of biological_systems as also proved by the experimental campaign provided here the experimental_results described in section show that the application of gas to detect protein_complexes in ppi_networks is promising concerning the accuracy of the discovered groups but it deserves further study to improve the number ofpredicted true complexes generalization to allow overlapping clusters would be desirable to enhance the prediction capability of such approaches an interesting direction to investigate would be that of combining lc and gas to make the latter ones able to detect overlapping clusters to this aim the link similarity measure by solava et_al see also section could be applied note also that the performances of the considered approaches vary with respect to the different considered interaction datasets interestingly ocg that in becker et_al has been shown to overcome ahn on human datasets is outperformed by the latter one on y h for both recall and f measure however all the networks considered here refer to yeast ppi data as saccharomyces_cerevisiae is one of the best characterized organisms as proved by the experimental campaign provided in pizzuti and rombo a the performances of ppi_network clustering techniques may become different when they are applied on less complete networks and only a few of them are able to keep a good accuracy future work may include also analyzing how ga ppi algorithms perform on the ppi_networks of organisms such as human and fly which are less characterized than yeast in conclusion the investigation of population based_methods for ppi_networks clustering is relatively recent and not yet enough explored presenting interesting potentialities thus additional research is necessary and desirable to improve the predictive_power of these approaches
