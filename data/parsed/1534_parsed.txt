sequence_analysis effectively addressing complex proteomic search spaces with peptide spectrum matching protein identification by mass_spectrometry is commonly accomplished using a peptide sequence_matching search algorithm whose sensitivity varies inversely with the size of the sequence database and the number of post_translational considered we present the spectrum identification machine a peptide sequence_matching tool that capitalizes on the high_intensity b fragment_ion of tandem_mass of peptides coupled in solution with pheny lisotiocyanate to confidently sequence the first amino_acid and ultimately reduce_the we demonstrate that in complex search spaces a gain of some in sensitivity can be achieved availability all data generated and the software are freely_available for academic use atone of the goals of shotgun_proteomics is to perform large_scale identification and quantitation of thousands of proteins within complex_protein e g biological_fluids or whole cell_lysates the strategy comprises protein_digestion followed by peptide chromatographic_separation online with tandem_mass ms the ms data are then generally identified using a peptide sequence_matching psm tool examples are sequest and most recently andromeda briefly given a peptides precursor ion mass and ms these algorithms pull out from a peptide_sequence database peptide_sequences whose theoretical mass lies within a given tolerance from the experimental precursor mass following that theoretical spectra are generated for all peptide candidates so that some similarity_metric be it empirical or statistical can be used to select the most likely candidate finally a list of identifications satisfying some false_discovery fdr is obtained by using a statistical filtering tool such as sepro the sensitivity of a psm tool varies inversely with the size of the sequence database and the number of post_translational considered consequently studies addressing complex search spaces are challenging when seen from a computational perspective examples are analysing snake_venoms for identifying naturally_occurring peptides or performing a meta proteomic_study of a microorganism biota the former requires not trypsinizing the samples and thus lifts the constraints of a psm search_engine to only tryptic_peptides which results in an exponential_growth of the search_space the latter entails the concatenation of hundreds of sequence_databases of different organisms nevertheless the rewards at stake could be discovering a naturally_occurring peptide with pharmaceutical_properties or the in depth comprehension of a systems_biology recently sanchez et_al demonstrated the possibility to identify peptides using the n_terminal residue and accurate precursor mass for this they coupled peptides in solution with phenylisotiocyanate pitc during the activation in the collision cell these phenylthiocarbamoyl derivatized peptides dissociate to specifically yield an intense b fragment this unlocks the possibility to confidently determine the n_terminal residue in a single mass_spectrum the authors then demonstrated a peptide_identification tool that considered only the b fragment_ion mass and the high_mass of the precursor and used it to identify peptides in an escherichia_coli tryptic_digest the shortcomings of this method are in the inability to discriminate between peptides with close masses and same first residue as the remaining ms information is not taken into account the method is blind to peptides not found in the database but also coinciding in mass and first residue and thus prone to such false_positives to whom correspondence should be addressed search results with and without the pitc logic are presented in an example of a pitc peptide tandem mass_spectrum is found in supplementary further comparisons to the method fromare provided in the supplementary_file
