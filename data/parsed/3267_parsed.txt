nmrpro an integrated web component for interactive processing and visualization of nmr_spectra the popularity of using nmr_spectroscopy in metabolomics and natural_products has driven the development of an array of nmr spectral_analysis tools and databases particularly web_applications are well used recently because they are platform independent and easy to extend through reusable web components currently available web_applications provide the analysis of nmr_spectra however they still lack the necessary processing and interactive_visualization func tionalities to overcome_these we present nmrpro a web component that can be easily incorporated into current web_applications enabling easy to use online interactive processing and visualization nmrpro integrates server side processing with client side interactive visualiza tion through three parts a python_package to efficiently process large nmr datasets on the server side a django app managing server client interaction and specdrawjs for client side interactive_visualization availability_and demo and installation_instructions are available at http mamitsu kalab org tools nmrpro nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy is indispensible for structure identification of chemical_compounds becoming a crucial part of metabolomics and natural_products studies web_applications are attractive environments for analysis and storage of nmr_spectra because i web is a platform independent highly interactive environment and ii existing web_applications can be easily extended through integrating web components such as javascript libraries and web_services to provide additional functionalities online processing and interactive_visualization of spectra are necessary functionalities for all nmr web_applications however web_applications for nmr_analysis such as metaboanalyst metabohunter and colmar require nmr_spectra to be processed offline beforehand also interactive investigation of nmr_spectra in databases such as hmdb requires raw spectra to be downloaded and visualized offline although processing and interactive_visualization of nmr_spectra are needed for web_applications web components providing these functionalities are still lacking in fact previously used java_applet components such as jspecview and nemo suffer from security concerns and require installation of additional software also although the recently_developed jsnmr and specktackle offer javascript based visualization they have very limited processing functionalities the development of web components for processing nmr_spectra is hampered by three challenges caused by the large size of nmr_spectra i processing of large_datasets is computationally_intensive requiring server side integration ii a compressed spectral format required for efficient_transfer across the web is lacking we present nmrpro an open_source easy to integrate web component for processing and visualization of nmr_data which is highly extensible to include new functionalities according to the needs of each application nmrpro consists of three integrated parts i python_package with extensible functionality plugins for server side spectral processing ii django app for spectral compression and managing communication between server and clientsides and iii specdrawjs a javascript_library for visualization of d and d nmr datasets advantages over existing_tools are summarized in the supplement tables s and s we present nmrpro an extensible web component that can be easily integrated in current web_applications and databases providing nmr processing and visualization functionalities future work is to extend nmrpro by implementing new plugins to add further functionalities such as covariance nmr and multivariate_analysis for wider application in metabolomics and natural_products
