data_and multi_platform segmentation for joint detection of copy_number motivation with the expansion of whole_genome studies there is rapid evolution of genotyping_platforms this leads to practical issues such as upgrading of genotyping equipment which often results in research groups having data from different platforms for the same samples while having more data can potentially yield more accurate copy_number estimates combining such data is not straightforward as different platforms show different degrees of attenuation of the true copy_number or different noise_characteristics and marker panels currently there is still a relative lack of procedures for combining information from different platforms results we develop a method called mpss based on a correlated random_effect for the unobserved patterns and extend the robust smooth segmentation approach to the multiple platform scenario we also propose an objective criterion for discrete segmentation required for downstream_analyses for each identified segment the software reports a p value to indicate the likelihood of the segment being a true cnv from the analyses of real and simulated_data we show that mpss has better operating characteristics when compared to single_platform methods and have substantially_higher sensitivity compared to an existing multiplatform method availability the methods are implemented in an r package mpss and the source is available from http www meb ki se yudpaw copy_number cnvs are defined as duplications or deletions in the number of copies of a dna_segment larger than kb in length when compared to a reference_genome currently common technologies used to detect_cnvs include high_density to whom correspondence should be addressed single_nucleotide snp_arrays and comparativegenomic hybridization cgh arrays in recent_years whole_genome studies using commercial genotyping_arrays to detect_cnvs have been rapidly_expanding with decreasing cost of commercially_available platforms and the fast evolution of these platforms it is not unusual for research groups to have data from multiple_platforms for each sample for example the cancer_genome research network a joint effort of the national_cancer nci and the national_human nhgri to explore genomic changes involved in human_cancers used agilent k affymetrix snp and illumina k platforms to measure copy_number in its pilot_study our own collaborators and perhaps many other researchers collected genotype data using both illumina humanhap and humanhap s arrays for each sample in order to get higher genome_coverage marker_density is an important factor for comprehensive and accurate detection of cnvs and their breakpoints and different platforms have different probe coverage and density seefor a summary of probe coverage of the different platforms in the different chromosomes combining data from different platforms can potentially yield more precise and accurate detection of cnvs and its breakpoints however combining such data is not straightforward because it is known that estimates from different platforms show different degrees of attenuation of the true copy_number changes as well as different noise_characteristics furthermore different platforms have different marker panels and molecular assay methods currently there is still a relative lack of formal procedures for combining information from different platforms for copy_number calling most studies with multiple_platforms interrogating the same samples process the data from the different platforms independently then combine the segments in an ad_hoc manner this approach does not fully utilize information from the different platforms and when the segmented results from the different platforms differ it is difficult for researchers to come to a consensus in a statistically_rigorous manner one published method multiple platform circular_binary mpcbs is able to jointly use information from different platforms for cnv_calling the mpcbs method extends the circular_binary cbs algorithm by detecting coupled changes in multiple_sequences briefly it uses a weighted_sum of t statisticswe have described a new method for identifying cnvs by using data from multiple_platforms simultaneously this method allows researchers to come to a formal consensus result when data from different platforms but for the same individuals are available the model assumes a random_effects parameter that is common to all platforms meaning that each platform is assumed to have the same underlying copy_number pattern we also develop an objective method to segment the estimated random_effects parameter which describes the underlying copy_number pattern into discrete segments in addition we provide a method for calculating a p value associated with a segment of interest the p value would indicate how likely that the segment is a deletion duplication and is useful for filtering out likely false_positives background correction is needed to make the data from the different platforms comparable we use a robust smoother that assumes the majority of each chromosome has normal copy_number while this assumption is likely to be true for germ_line samples it may not hold for cancer tumor_samples recently developed a normalization method to bring data from different platforms to the same scale the method uses a technique based on principal curves to estimate the normalization functions this method was tested on data from the cancer_genome research network and seems to work well on tumor_samples where there is sufficient deletions and duplications in the genome but we found that it did not work well with the germ_line samples we use when we performeds normalization on our samples the correlation in the copy_number estimates between the platforms increased only very slightly after normalization see supplementaryand this could be due to insufficient cnvs in the data for the principal curves to be identified we illustrate the performance of mpss using real and simulated_data in the comparisons using real_datasets we show that mpss cnvs has greater amount of overlap with the reference as compared to the other methods in the comparisons using simulated_datasets we show that the proposed method can achieve high_sensitivity at reasonable noise levels in general for all methods the proportion of overlapping bases with the highly comprehensive cnv map published byis low however we believe it is due to the limitation of the snp_arrays rather than the inadequacy of the algorithms this was also noted bywhere the authors investigated and found that in the regions where the reference cnvs lie both affymetrix and illumina platforms do not have a shift in the intensities and hence the algorithm would not pick out the region as a cnv moreover we do not know if the reference list we have used can be considered_the since it is not likely to have sensitivity_and even sequencing methods only show between and specificity the arrival of higher_density arrays for example the illumina humanomni and humanomni arrays will likely improve the sensitivity of cnv identification another kind of multiplatform problem arises when there is some stratification of cohorts by chips for example if the cases and controls were typed on different chips differential_sensitivity or false_positive between the platforms will lead to confounding bias in the casecontrol comparisons the method presented here assumes that the data from the different platforms are available for each individual hence the algorithm could not address this problem this is an important and valid concern and warrants further investigations
