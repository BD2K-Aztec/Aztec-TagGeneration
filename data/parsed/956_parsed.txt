chepimod a knowledgebase for chemical modulators of epigenome reader domains context epigenome reader domains are rapidly emerging as a new class of drug_targets for a wide_array of human_diseases to facilitate study of structureactivity relationship and small_molecule ligand_design for these domains we have created chepimod chepimod is a free knowledgebase of chemical modulators with documented modulatory activity for epigenome reader domains methods chepimod organizes information about chemical modula tors and their associated binding_affinity data as well as available structures of epigenome readers from the protein_data the data are gathered from the literature and patents entries are supplemented by annotation the current version of chepimod covers six epigenome reader domain families bromodomain phd_finger chromodomain mbt pwwp and tudor the database can be used to browse existing chemical modulators and bioactivity data as well as all available structures of readers and their molecular_interactions the database is updated weekly availability chepimod is freely_available atepigenetic control of gene_expression plays a fundamental role in numerous biological_processes including development cell_proliferation and its dysregulation has been linked to multiple disorders such as cancer inflammation and infection the evolutionarily_conserved modular domains that are embedded in transcription associated proteins and recognize post_translational such as lysine_acetylation or methylation are called epigenome readers the desire to better understand and modulate the molecular_functions of these readers has encouraged the development of small_molecule compounds or chemical modulators that serve as research_tools and as potential therapeutic_agents for a wide_array of human_diseases the ever increasing number of compounds with documented modulatory activity against epigenome readers has prompted us to develop chepimod a comprehensive knowledgebase of structureactivity relationship data for these domains and their chemical modulators the goal of chepimod is to organize in a single place all publicly_available and relevant research data to facilitate the structure_guided development and use of epigenome reader modulators as tools for chemical epigenomics research general_purpose bioactivity databases such as chembl and pubchem bioassay contain information about some ligands for epigenome readers but are far from comprehensive for these domains and do not provide structural_information on proteinligand_interactions additionally ligands stored in these general databases have their affinities listed for proteins rather than domains chepimod overcomes these limitations by providing comprehensive coverage of epigenome reader bioactivities coupled with structural_information and advanced analysis tools
