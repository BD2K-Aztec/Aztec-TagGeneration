structural_bioinformatics mobi a web_server to define and visualize structural mobility in nmr protein ensembles motivation mobi is a web_server for the identification of structurally mobile regions in nmr protein ensembles it provides a binary mobility definition that is analogous to the commonly used definition of intrinsic_disorder in x_ray at least three different use cases can be envisaged i visualization of nmr mobility for structural analysis ii definition of regions for reliable comparative modelling in protein_structure and iii definition of mobility in analogy to intrinsic_disorder mobi uses structural superposition and local conformational_differences to derive a robust binary mobility definition that is in excellent_agreement with the manually_curated definition used in the casp experiment for intrinsic_disorder in nmr_structure the output includes mobility coloured pdb files mobility plots and a fasta formatted sequence file summarizing the mobility results availability the mobi server and supplementary methods are available for non commercial use atnmr solved structures deposited in the protein_data pdb often contain an ensemble of structurally different conformers where each model equally satisfies the experimentally_obtained restrains among other reasons differences between models are due to incompleteness or noise in the experimental_data as well as reflecting the dynamic behaviour of proteins in solution to gain insight into protein dynamics the structural ensemble can be further enriched or used to deduce quasi rigid dynamical domains in order to make sense of this structural_variability e g to identify reliable regions for protein_structure it is commonly sieved for conserved_regions or to select the best representative an intuitive representation of nmr variability through colouring of the structure by rmsd values has been recently_proposed in caron extreme structural_variability in proteins is called intrinsic_disorder and commonly has functional_implications dyson and
