data_and deviance residuals based sparse pls and sparse kernel pls regression for censored_data motivation a vast literature from the past_decade is devoted to relating gene profiles and subject survival or time to cancer_recurrence biomarker_discovery from high_dimensional such as transcrip tomic or single_nucleotide profiles is a major_challenge in the search for more precise diagnoses the proportional hazard regression_model suggested by cox to study the relationship between the time to event and a set of covariates in the presence of censoring is the most commonly used model for the analysis of survival data however like multivariate_regression it supposes that more observations than variables complete data and not strongly correlated variables are available in practice when dealing with high_dimensional these constraints are crippling collinearity gives rise to issues of over fitting and model misidentification variable_selection can improve the estimation accuracy by effectively identifying the subset of relevant predictors and enhance the model interpretability with parsimonious representation to deal with both collinearity and variable_selection issues many methods based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized cox_proportional have been proposed since the reference paper of tibshirani regularization could also be performed using dimension_reduction as is the case with partial_least pls regression we propose two original algorithms named splsdr and its non linear kernel counterpart dksplsdr by using sparse pls regression spls based on deviance residuals we compared their predicting performance with state of the art algorithms on both simulated and real reference benchmark_datasets results splsdr and dksplsdr compare favorably with other methods in their computational time prediction and selectivity as indicated by results based on benchmark_datasets moreover in the framework of pls regression they feature other useful tools including biplots representation or the ability to deal with missing_data therefore we view them as a useful addition to the toolbox of estimation and prediction_methods for the widely used coxs model in the high_dimensional and low sample_size settings availability_and the r package plsrcox is available on the cran and is maintained by fr ed eric bertrand http cran r project org_web plsrcox index html overall dksplsdr and even more splsdr compare favorably with the benchmark methods on both simulated_and in the simulation_study splsdr turned out to be the best method to recover the linear link according to the issw performance measure and for the three simulation schemes linear link row panel more generally in that setting the models featuring components had better performance_measures than the lasso and elastic_net based ones similar results can be observed for the iaucsurvroc criterion supplementary linear link row panel with lesser advantage to splsdr and dksplsdr in both cases simulations study show that neither splsdr or dksplsdr tend to wrongly recover a link between the response and the explanatory_variable when there is none supplementary figs s and s no link row panel whereas lasso and elastic_net based_methods do for the factorial simulation scheme and the iaucsurvroc criterion supplementary no link row panel whatever the real_dataset the overall patterns of the splsdr and dksplsdr algorithms follow the general patterns of predictability of the benchmark methods e g a low increase in predictability for the metzeler dataset or a global step_wise decrease on the romain datasets these patterns suggest that the performances of the different methods may depend on the real but unknown data dimension the splsdr or dksplsdr almost always rank among the to best methods with higher predictability often being even st or nd both on short_and predictions see tables and this is particularly true in cases where a large predictability heterogeneity is to be noted among the benchmark algorithms such as for the garber and the wang datasets last but not least splsdr and dksplsdr not only automatically handle missing_data the study of the robustness of these two algorithms to the amount and type of missing databeing beyond the scope of this article but also provide nice data exploration tools such as biplots representation of individuals and descriptors by projecting the dataset on the first spls components see in a word we view splsdr and dksplsdr as a useful addition to the toolbox of estimation and prediction_methods for the widely used coxs model in the high_dimensional and low sample_size settings
