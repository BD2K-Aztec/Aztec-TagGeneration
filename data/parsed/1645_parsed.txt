genome_analysis eugene pp a next generation automated annotation_pipeline for prokaryotic_genomes it is now easy and increasingly usual to produce oriented rna_seq as a prokaryotic_genome is being sequenced however this information is usually just used for expression quantifi cation eugene pp is a fully_automated pipeline for structural annotation of prokaryotic_genomes integrating protein similarities statistical_information and any oriented expression information rna_seq or tiling arrays through a variety of file_formats to produce a qualitatively enriched annotation including coding_regions but also possibly anti sense non coding_genes and transcription_start availability_and eugene pp is an open_source based on eugene p integrating a galaxyprokaryotic genome_sequencing and expression quantification using rna_seq or tiling arrays are becoming routine however existing prokaryotic gene_finders are either ab_initio gene_finders that identify only coding_regions or purely rna_seq based gene_finders predicting transcripts and are much less effective than their ab_initio competitors for coding dna_sequence cds prediction reconciling conflicting predictions is a tedious work which is incompatible with the growing prokaryotic genome_sequencing rate there is a need for new prokaryotic gene_finders that would directly integrate all available information to produce an enriched and precise structural annotation identifying cds but also possibly antisense non coding_genes and transcription_start tsss avoiding tedious reconciliation we have shown inthat this can be accomplished by finely adapting conditional_random based integrative eukaryotic gene_finding technology to prokaryotic specificities overlapping genes operons the resulting software eugene p simultaneously exploits statistical_properties of sequences existing annotations similarities to proteins and oriented rna_seq to produce an enriched annotation with a better delineation of functional genomic_elements and therefore improved expression quantification
