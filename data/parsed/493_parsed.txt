a scalable and portable framework for massively_parallel variable_selection in genetic_association the deluge of data emerging from high_throughput poses large analytical challenges when testing for association to disease we introduce a scalable framework for variable_selection implemented in c and opencl that fits regularized_regression across multiple graphics_processing open source_code can be found at a google code repository under the url http bioinformatics oxfordjournals as the cost of sequencing continues to drop exponentially it will soon be practical to test all variation in the genome for association to disease using data from thousands of individuals there are obvious computational challenges in analyzing datasets on this scale regularized regression_methods such as the lasso and other extensions are appropriate tools for selecting important variables in problems where variables far exceed observations programs like glmnet are computationally_efficient for small to moderately sized datasets but do not scale to extremely large_datasets due to memory burden we introduce an object oriented framework that scales across nodes on graphics_processing gpu clusters yet shields users from the underlying complexities of a distributed optimization_algorithm allowing them to easily implement custom monte_carlo routines e g permutation_testing bootstrapping etc practical use of our framework is demonstrated by an application to real and simulated_data in the first example we demonstrate how a mixed l and l penalization scheme can be beneficial for rare_variant analyses by carrying out a simulation_study based on real_data from pilot of the genomes_project we assigned genic snps most of which had a minor_allele to be causal with a relative_risk of disease of which presents power as a function of false_discovery fdr shows that as expected inclusion of a mixed penalty in this specific case l l can improve power over a pure l penalty when informative groupings i e genes are defined in our second example we apply the method of stability_selection which has been demonstrated to provide good error control in gene_expression data to a large gwas on prostate_cancer genotyped across snps on african_american we fit the model across subsampled replicates of the data completing analysis in slightly under h based on our benchmarks we estimate this analysis would have completed in days on a single_cpu using the same algorithm presents the three variables declared as being stable based on a threshold derived as a function of a pure l penalty that controls fdr at the level the first two snps listed in the table replicate significant findings in earlier_studies of prostate_cancer while the last snp appears to be a genuinely novel risk variant as we have recently replicated this finding in an independent stage analysis all reported variables based on a threshold thr which controls fdr at
