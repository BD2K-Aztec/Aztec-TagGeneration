proteus a web_based context specific modelling tool for molecular_networks molecular_networks are often studied in diverse cellular or experimental contexts with highly context specific details modelling introduces further choices as to levels of mathematical description the resulting possibilities are difficult to explore rapidly hampering the integration of modelling and experiment we have developed proteus a web_based context specific tool for building compartmentalized ordinary_differential ode_models it is inspired by the idea of a molecular toolkit for ca signalling toolkits in proteus are context independent representations of biological_systems as sets of components which may correspond to mechanisms of differing levels of complexity users pick and choose components from a toolkit and for each component pick and choose from different mechanisms each of which describes a different instantiation of the components mechanism proteus combines these choices into a system of odes which may then be downloaded in sbml systems_biology matlab or fortran format and independently_analyzed toolkits components and mechanisms are user constructible either de_novo or by cannibalizing existing_models including all those in the biomodels_database a wide_variety of context specific models may thereby be rapidly built modified and explored availability_and proteus implemented in c and a prototype toolkit for modelling calcium signalling are freely and universally available at www modularmodeling commathematical models are increasingly used with experimental_approaches to analyze the functional complexities of molecular_networks one of the challenges in doing this is model reconstruction in the light of new experiments new knowledge changing biological_context and changing levels of mathematical description new approaches have emerged to shift the burden of model re construction to software the models as programs approach has brought programming principles to bear both at the to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address department of bioinformatics and computational_biology genentech inc south san_francisco california usa low_level of molecular domains through rule_based methodologies and at a higher_level of modularity through the functional paradigm here we take a complementary_approach inspired by biological ideas compared to other tools the main advantage of proteus is modularity allowing the user to model complex systems by combining simpler components via a webbased pick and choose approach moreover proteus allows the establishment of a user community that manages and shares toolkits and mechanisms experimental work typically focusses on a specific biological_context such as the nf b pathway or calcium signalling such contexts allow for much variation in detail but also for constraining assumptions about the molecular_players and their underlying_mechanisms for instance calcium signalling is thought to involve a calcium signalling toolkit with a limited repertoire of functional partstransporters pumps calcium_sensitive enzymes buffering proteins organelle stores and leak currentsfrom which mammalian_cells mix and match specific_molecular to orchestrate the calcium response appropriate to their biological_context we exploit the biological idea of a toolkit by analogy at the software level
