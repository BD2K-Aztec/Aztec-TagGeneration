genetics_and dinamic a method to identify recurrent dna_copy in tumors motivation dna_copy gains_and are commonly found in tumor_tissue and some of these aberrations play a role in tumor genesis and development although high_resolution dna_copy data can be obtained using array based techniques no single method is widely used to distinguish between recurrent and sporadic copy_number results here we introduce discovering copy_number manifested in cancer dinamic a novel method for assessing_the of recurrent copy_number in contrast to competing procedures the testing procedure underlying dinamic is carefully motivated and employs a novel cyclic permutation scheme extensive_simulation show that dinamic controls false_positive discoveries in a variety of realistic scenarios we use dinamic to analyze two publicly_available tumor datasets and our results show that dinamic detects multiple_loci that have biological_relevance availability source_code implemented in r as well as text_files containing examples and sample datasets are available atdna copy_number cnas are commonly found in tumor_tissue and can range from losses deletions of one or both copies of chromosomal_regions to gains of numerous additional copies amplifications the size of these aberrations can range from entire chromosome_arms to less than kb a variety of platforms are used to detect cnas and provide quantitative signals that reflect the underlying discrete copy_number much of the statistical effort in analyzing cnas has focused on discerning copy_number at each location within individual tumors and in handling the potential contamination of normal_tissue in tumor_samples to whom correspondence should be addressed in contrast to heritable copy_number cnas are the result of genomic_instability in somatic tumor_tissue from the earliest days of modern cancer genetics it was recognized that such instability could unmask or promote the effects of tumor_suppressors and oncogenes however surveys of a number of tumor_types e g demonstrate that sporadic gains_and can also occur throughout the genome likely representing generic genomic_instability with little effect on tumor_progression the phenomenon of recurrent_cnas which affect the same region in multiple_tumors is of great interest as such cnas may highlight genes or regions that are directly involved in tumor_progression past_studies have detected recurrent_cnas in a wide_range of tumor_types with an extensive catalog of these findings in the mitelman database and the genetic_alterations in cancer gac database despite the apparent successes in the field there is no clear basis for a general approach for sensitive detection of recurrent_cnas as many regions important for tumor_progression may affect only a minority of tumors the task of distinguishing between sporadic and recurrent_cnas is thus largely a statistical issue the instabilityselection model introduced byprovides a statistical_framework specific to loss_of loh data but even for this specific data type difficulties remain in assessing significance over multiple_markers the problem of assessing significance for general copy_number data has received relatively little attention until recently few of the existing_methods reviewed below provide an explicit description of the null_hypothesis being tested or fully acknowledge the inherent correlation_structure of copy_number data for these reasons it has been difficult to place the techniques in a traditional statistical_framework or to understand error_rates on a genome_wide scale the purpose of this article is to introduce an explicit testing scheme for recurrent_cnas that preserves correlations inherent to the data before proceeding to our testing framework we review the current methods for copy_number calling segmentation which can serve as a useful intermediary to the detection of recurrent_cnas numerous technologies are available to measure dna_copy ranging from array_comparative at tens_of of probes to highdensity snp platforms up to million probes or more reviews of the technologies are provided elsewhere but a common_feature is that a quantitative signal is extracted at each probe that reflects underlyingthe analysis of dna_copy data has proven to be a valuable_tool for the study of cancer segmentation_methods can be used to detect loci where copy_number changes occur for a single subject but different approaches are needed if we wish to assess_the of dna_copy changes present in multiple subjects here we have introduced dinamic a new permutationbased method that can be used by researchers to detect statistically_significant recurrent_cnas when compared to existing_methods dinamic has a number of advantages first since dinamic makes no distributional assumptions it can analyze a variety of input datacontinuous continuous segmented or discrete segmented in addition dinamic can analyze genome_wide data as well as data from a single chromosome or chromosome arm finally it does not require any tuning parameters such as user_defined thresholds for gain or loss that are potentially arbitrary
