systems_biology topological augmentation to infer hidden processes in biological_systems motivation a common problem in understanding a biochemical system is to infer its correct structure or topology this topology consists of all relevant state variablesusually molecules and their interactions here we present a method called topological augmentation to infer this structure in a statistically_rigorous and systematic way from prior_knowledge and experimental_data results topological augmentation starts from a simple model that is unable to explain the experimental_data and augments its topology by adding new terms that capture the experimental behavior this process is guided by representing the uncertainty in the model topology through stochastic_differential whose trajectories contain information about missing model parts we first apply this semiauto matic procedure to a pharmacokinetic model this example illustrates that a global sampling of the parameter_space is critical for inferring a correct model structure we also use our method to improve our understanding of glutamine transport in yeast this analysis shows that transport dynamics is determined by glutamine permeases with two different kinds of kinetics topological augmentation can not only be applied to biochemical_systems but also to any system that can be described by ordinary_differential availability_and matlab_code and examples are available at http www csb ethz ch tools index cellular_processes for instance in metabolism signaling or transport can often be modeled by sets of deterministic differential_equations that describe concentration changes in the molecular_species of interest over time however the kind of molecular_interactions and the specific biochemical form they take in a cellular_process are frequently uncertain such topological or structural uncertainty has been previously tackled by defining a set of candidate models e g see that reflects different mechanistic hypotheses each of these candidates could in principle encapsulate the process and empirical data can be used to discriminate between them using available methods for statistical_inference a severe limitation of evaluating all candidate models is that their number grows exponentially with the number of uncertainties in the model topology to preselect a subset of candidate models that is small enough to be analyzed one can incorporate all hypotheses into a single master model which is then reduced by elimination of hypotheses however the resulting subset of models may not contain any model that satisfactorily explains the experimental_data furthermore the number of model_parameters increases with the number of hypothetical mechanisms and model reduction may become infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality if no satisfactory model emerges from model reduction or if the number of hypothetical mechanisms is too large it may be best to start the inference process from a smaller model that is successively extended and improved however there are few computational_methods available to extend a model by systematically identifying missing terms in a differential_equation or by improving the existing terms have suggested using stochastic_differential instead of ordinary_differential odes for model construction in addition to deterministic terms as in odes sdes comprise stochastic terms that account for uncertainty in the realization of trajectories and the equations solution takes the form of a probability_distribution the method byexploits that stochastic equation terms may fill the gap between the model_predictions and the experimental_data and point to the deterministic part of a models equations that can be improved this is because the estimated level of uncertainty in the prediction of to whom correspondence should be addressed ytopological augmentation is a method designed to infer biochemical_models in the face of uncertainties about their structure it classifies and quantifies topological uncertainties that emerge from experimental_observations the method starts from an usually too simple ode model which it reformulates with sdes and relies on the distribution of viable parameter points obtained from random_sampling to reveal the presence and the form of missing or incomplete reactions motivated by current gaps in the biological understanding of glutamine transport in yeast we developed a model for glutamine transport and generated experimental_data for topological augmentation interestingly this analysis indicated a subsidiary role of gap posterior_probabilities for glutamine transport models number of parameters in parentheses for convergences see supplementary
