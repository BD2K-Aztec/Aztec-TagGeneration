data_and a meta_analysis of two_dimensional electrophoresis pattern of the parkinson's_disease related protein dj motivation the two_dimensional electrophoresis de pattern of proteins is thought to be specifically related to the physiological or pathological condition at the moment of sample_preparation on this ground most proteomic_studies move to identify specific hallmarks for a number of different conditions however the information arising from these investigations is often incomplete due to inherent_limitations of the technique to extensive protein post_translational and sometimes to the paucity of available samples the meta_analysis of proteomic_data can provide_valuable pertinent to various biological_processes that otherwise remains hidden results here we show a meta_analysis of the pd protein dj in heterogeneous de experiments the protein was shown to segregate into specific clusters associated with defined conditions interestingly the dj pool from neural_tissues displayed a specific and characteristic molecular_weight and isoelectric_point pattern moreover changes in this pattern have been related to neurodegenerative_processes and aging these results were experimentally_validated on human_brain specimens from control_subjects and pd patients availability imagej is a public_domain image_processing program developed by the national_institutes and is freely_available rsbweb nih gov ij all the imagej macros used in this study are available as supplementary_material and upon request at info biodigitalvalley com xlstat can be purchased online atdj park is an ubiquitous highly_conserved protein that was originally identified because of its ability to transform nih t mouse cells in cooperation with ras starting from the association between loss_of in to whom correspondence should be addressed the dj gene and park a monogenic autosomal_recessive form of parkinsons disease pd an accumulating body of evidence pinpointed the important role of dj in this neurodegenerative condition very recently it has been shown that oxidized dopamine can covalently modify dj however whether this can affect dopamine cell_degeneration is unknown some hints may come from the involvement of dj into many cellular_functions including evidence_linking this protein to oxidative_stress responsea fact well known even before the association of dj with pd mitochondrial_function and transcription nuclear transcription mrna binding and protein interaction and protein_degradation mirroring the involvement of dj in multiple cellular_activities this protein has been found in complex with multiple molecular partners including dj itself pink and parkin alpha_synuclein hsp djbp piasx alpha ask histone_deacetylase androgen_receptor daxx and abstrakt dj has been shown to modulate dopamine toxicity in cellular_models of oxidative_stress with reference to pd dopamine exposure leads to upregulation of dj that in turn increases cell resistance to dopamine itself and reduces intracellular oxidants on the other hand synuclein overexpression leads to upregulation of dj and dj overexpression protects cells from synuclein toxicity besides being in complex with a number of different partners dj is often post_translationally dj modifications mainly include oxidations at different sites which is related to its antioxidant role but there are also evidences of ubiquitination and sumoylation small_ubiquitin not unexpectedly dj binding to its molecular counterparts and thus its pleiotropic_effects are affected by dj post_translational for example oxidation regulates homodimerization and affects dj binding to mrna van_der ask hsp page
