genome_analysis longtarget a tool to predict lncrna dna_binding and binding_sites via hoogsteen base_pairing analysis motivation in mammalian_cells many genes are silenced by genome methylation dna_methyltransferases and polycomb repressive complexes which both lack sequence_specific motifs are recruited by long_non lncrna to specific genomic_sites to methylate dna and chromatin increasing evidence indicates that many lncrnas contain dna_binding that can bind to dna by forming rna dna triplexes the identification of lncrna dna_binding and binding_sites is essential for deciphering lncrna functions and correct and erroneous genome methylation however such identification is challenging because lncrnas may contain thousands of nucleotides no computational_analysis of typical lncrnas has been reported here we report a computational_method and program longtarget to predict lncrna dna_binding and binding_sites we used this program to analyse multiple antisense lncrnas including those that control well known imprinting clusters and obtained results agreeing with experimental_observations and epigen etic marks these results suggest that it is feasible to predict many lncrna dna_binding and binding_sites genome_wide availability_and website of longtarget in mammalian_cells especially differentiated somatic_cells many genes are accurately silenced by dna and chromatin methylation via dna_methyltransferases dnmts and polycomb repressive complexes prcs by contrast in cancer_cells genomic_regions are often erroneously methylated or demethylated mammals have very limited dnmt and prc proteins which lack sequence specific dnabinding motifs many long_noncoding lncrnas have dna and protein binding_motifs allowing them to carry dnmts and prcs to specific genomic_sites and lncrnas can bind to dna by forming rna dna triplexes however details of how lncrnas bind to dna targets are scarce single_stranded rnas that are rich in pyrimidines t and c can bind to dna_strands that are rich in purines a and g by hoogsteen type hydrogen binding to form rna dna triplexes in vitro studies have revealed at least four types of rna dna_binding i a pyrimidine rich rna strand binds to a polypurine dna_strand by hoogsteen basepairing ii a purine rich rna strand binds to a polypurine dna_strand by reverse hoogsteen base_pairing and iii and iv an rna strand that is rich in both purines and pyrimidines binds to a polypurine dna_strand by either hoogsteen or reverse hoogsteen base_pairing triplexes however occur widely between rna rna and rna dna a recent study indicates that there should be additional non canonical situations of hoogsteen and reverse hoogsteen base_pairing given the huge number of human lncrnas the experimental identification of their dna_binding and binding_sites is not feasible a computational program was reported to predict rna dna_binding based on the above four canonical base_pairing rules and was used to analyse a large set of short mostly bp chromatin associated rnas compared with such short non_coding the prediction of lncrna dna_binding and binding_sites is complicated by two factors and is much more challenging first lncrnas may contain thousands of nucleotides and multiple functional_motifs with featured sequences second a considerable number of lncrnas such as hotair function in trans and regulate remote genome methylation for which binding to their target_regions is also controlled by ctcf here we introduce a computational_method and program longtarget to predict lncrna dna_binding and binding_sites we used this program to analyse multiple antisense lncrnas including some well characterized lncrnas that control gene imprinting the predicted binding_motifs and binding_sites exhibit significant sensitivity_and and agree with experimental_observations these lncrnas bind not only to promoter_regions and cpg_sites but also to many transposable_elements there are two classes of lncrnas one class locates near and antisense to the genes they regulate a typical example is anril cdkn b as which regulates the expression of cdkn a arf cdkn b an antisense lncrna may silence nearby genes if its transcript fully or partially overlaps with these genes but many lncrnas including those controlling imprinted gene_clusters function as long_range cissilencers to regulate non overlapping genes the second class comprises lncrnas that are located far from their target_genes the best known is hotair which is located between hoxc and hoxc on chromosome and regulates the expression of multiple hoxd genes on chromosome compared with antisense lncrnas the targets of lncrnas that function in trans are poorly_understood the tertiary_structures play_an in target_site recognition for some lncrnas at this stage we used longtarget to analyse multiple antisense lncrnas and obtained results agreeing with experimental_observations supplementary results the prediction of lncrnas dna_binding and binding_sites is important for uncovering the correct and aberrant genome modification longtarget is different from the reportedtriplexator in that it explores a wide_range of base_pairing rules e g cg a and gc c in the dominant rule set r for multiple lncrnas instead of canonical ones examines base_pairing between all nucleotides instead of enriched ones determines the single best tfo on the rna_sequences in triplexes that overlap most densely in the lncrna determines the best tfos ttss upon dense distributions of triplexes in a genome region and evaluates the triplexes stability supplementary table s supplementary because binding between ncrnas and dna_sequences occurs widelyin the large kcnq imprinting cluster ttss were predicted at the promoter_regions of multiple imprinted_genes including ascl tspan and cd which are located far from kcnq ot supplementary note that the h_k signals at this region in the shown datasets are not as strong as the specific report it is necessary to include non canonical base_pairing rules the inclusion of these rules in longtarget is harmless if these rules do not generate significant triplexes but is significant in some case because on these rule sets a nucleotide in a tfo can bind to two different nucleotides in a tts ttss are structurally more complex and informative than are tfos which may explain why anrils ttss are more sensitive to sequence shuffling than its tfo the permutation_tests of anril and the quality of other lncrna tfo indicate that tfo and its ttss have a high_sensitivity the analysis of these lncrnas suggests that it is feasible to predict many lncrna tfos and ttss consistent with experimental_evidence most of the predicted ttss of lncrnas are at promoter_regions of nearby genes and at cpg_sites examined with signals of encode histone_modification in the ucsc_genome these ttss match well with ezh suz and h k m signals but poorly with h k m and h k m signals in many cells this poor match can be explained by four reasons first the detected h k m signals may be low in some experiments but high in others second lncrnas such as kcnq ot and prc proteins may have preferred target_sites from where they most likely spread to neighbouring imprinted_genes making sites of h k m signals different from and broader than ttss third the expression levels of lncrna are low therefore the amount of transcripts is likely insufficient for them to bind to the broad h k m domains fourth in some situations lncrnas interact with methylated histone h lysine suggesting that h k m signals may exist as a condition for a lncrna to bind to dna it is interesting that many ttss perfectly match strong h k m or h k ac signals which indicate active_chromatin and occur in many gene promoter_regions and some ttss occur at the gap in high_level h k and h k signals supplementary because in many datasets both h k m h k ac signals and h k m h k m signals exist at a genomic site the ttss at sites with strong h k m and h k ac signals are sensible and it is possible that such sites can be competitively bound by lncrnas of different regulatory_functions technically when predicting a lncrna tfo and ttss three issues should be considered first the default minimal tfo length is rather small while this value ensures that no important triplexes would be filtered out it increases the chance of generating a bad tfo because rna_sequences in short triplexes are prone to generate more dense distributions in the lncrna a large value minimal tfo length shares the same risk because it filters out too many triplexes it is advisable to try a small and a large minimal tfo length and to determine_whether tfo is different or whether the number of its triplexes is significantly_changed normally minimal tfo length or and offset or second we determined whether filtering the triplexes with a large identity would improve the quality of tfo and found that identity may help but identity does not indicating that lncrna dna triplexes may enjoy a high_binding but not accurate base_pairing between all nucleotides third while most lncrna tfo s are negligible some lncrna tfo s generate considerable triplexes whether some lncrnas could use two motifs to bind to dna_sequences is an interesting and unresolved issue promoter_regions cpg_sites and dmrs are known targets of genome modification the predicted ttss of lncrnas at these positions indicate that they are direct_targets of lncrnas transposable_elements inserted into the introns of functional_genes can reduce the transcription of those genes because considerable ttss are at transposable_elements we postulate that after targeting by lncrnas the methylation of these transposable_elements may hinder the transcription of genes and that because many lncrna genes contain multiple transposable_elements the ttss at transposable_elements in lncrnas help control the highly tissue_specific expression of lncrnas because most lncrnas emerge in mammals beyond the hypothesis that x inactivation and gene imprinting may have co evolved in mammals imprinting in somatic_cells as a genome defence against transposable_elements and as a mechanism_regulating gene_expression may also have an associated origin and evolution
