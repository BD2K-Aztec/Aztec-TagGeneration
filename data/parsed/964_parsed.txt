chipseeker an r bioconductor_package for chip peak annotation comparison and visualization chipseeker is an r package for annotating chip_seq analysis it supports annotating chip peaks and provides functions to visualize chip peaks coverage over chromosomes and profiles of peaks binding to tss regions comparison of chip peak profiles and annotation are also supported moreover it supports evaluating significant_overlap among chip_seq currently chipseeker contains bed file information from geo database these datasets can be downloaded and compare with users own data to explore significant_overlap datasets for inferring co regulation or transcription_factor complex for further investigation availability_and chipseeker is released under artistic license the source_code and documents are freely_available through bioconductorchromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high_throughput chip_seq has become standard technology to investigate genome_wide binding_sites of transcription_factors tfs to analyze these dna_binding to determine their potential regulatory_functions proximal genes transcripts and regulatory_elements are considered to annotate these loci several applications were developed for annotating chip_seq chippeakanno is an r package that designed for chip_seq and chipchip data annotation because chippeakanno does not consider strand information it misclassifies peaks with wrong orientation see supplemental file other tools including pavis and peakanalyzer they all have similar functions of annotating peaks by nearest genes and proximal genomic_features existing_tools are all designed for single dataset chip_seq is rapidly becoming a common technique and there are a large number of datasets available in the public_domain results from individual experiments provide a limited understanding of chromatin_interactions as there is many factors cooperate to regulate_transcription existing software lack of functionalities for comparing profiles of chip_seq in different levels including profiles of peaks binding to tss regions annotation and enriched functional profiles there are increasing evidences shown that combinations of tfs are important for regulating gene_expression however systematically identification of tf interactions by chip_seq is still not available even if a specific tf_binding is essential for a particular regulation was known we do not have prior_knowledge of all its co factors there are no systematic strategies available to identified un known co factors by chipseq to fill this gap we present an r bioconductor_package chipseeker for chip peak annotation comparison and visualization it incorporates statistical_testing of co occurrence of difference chip_seq and can be used to identify co factors by exploring publicly_available chip_seq chipseeker is developed as an r package within the bioconductor_project and is released under artistic license chipseeker integrates chip annotation comparison and visualization and serves as a toolbox for analysis of chip_seq it can visualize genomic coverage of chip_seq annotate genomic_features of chip peaks and their nearest genes chipseeker supports visualize intensities of chip peaks binding to tss sites and comparison based on these profiles it supports statistical_test for overlap among chip_seq more importantly it removes a major_obstacle for scientists to query and utilize chip_seq in public domains
