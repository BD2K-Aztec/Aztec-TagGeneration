systems_biology fluxmodecalculator an efficient tool for large_scale flux mode computation elementary_flux efm analysis is a powerful technique for determining the metabolic capacities and robustness of stoichiometric networks recently several improvements have been made to the algorithm for enumerating the efms making the study of large models possible however currently these tools require high performance workstations to perform large_scale efm computations thus limiting their applicability we developed a more time and memory_efficient implementation of the algorithm for efm enumeration in matlab called fluxmodecalculator which enables large_scale efm computation on ordinary desktop computers availability_and fluxmodecalculator is open_source and freely_available under the terms of the gnu_general v at http www lumc nl jan bert van klinken contact j b van klinken lumc nl supplementary_information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online due to recent_advances in genomic transcriptomic and metabolomic technologies it has become possible to reconstruct detailed metabolic maps of a wide_range of organisms and tissue_types elementary_flux analysis is a powerful method for investigating the metabolic capacities of these networks listing the complete set of physiological_states that are feasible given mass_balance and thermodynamic_constraints efms are defined as the minimal reaction sets that are able to operate at steady_state schuster and hilgetag and provide a natural and unbiased definition of a metabolic_pathway efm analysis has been applied for several different purposes such as designing knockout strategies for bacteria trinh et_al analyzing network robustness to perturbations stelling et_al determining substrate cycles gebauer et_al and investigating network flexibility in optimal_growth states kelk et_al formally efm analysis corresponds to enumerating the extreme rays of the polyhedral cone that is formed by the intersection of the right null space of the stoichiometric matrix and the positive orthant
