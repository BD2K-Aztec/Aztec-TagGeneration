data_and ncidp assign a sparky extension for the effective nmr assignment of intrinsically_disordered we describe here the ncidp assign extension for the popular nmr assignment program sparky which aids in the sequence specific resonance assignment of intrinsically_disordered idps the assignment plugin greatly_facilitates the effective matching of a set of connected resonances to the correct position in the sequence by making use of idp random_coil chemical_shifts availability the ncidp assign extension is available at http www protein nmr org the structural_characterization of intrinsically_disordered idps is a rapidly_growing field in structural molecular_biology over the past_decade nmr_spectroscopy has proven to be singular in its capacity to provide detailed structural_characterization of these dynamic entities although diverse experimental_approaches have been developed the sequential resonance assignment of kda natively unfolded polypeptides is still not a trivial task here we describe an enhanced version of the sparky sequence repositioning extension which assist in matching connecting and assigning consecutive residues and is specifically_designed for intrinsically_disordered ncidpassign neighbor corrected idp chemical_shift assignment this tool makes use of a novel random_coil chemical_shift library enabling the accurate prediction of the chemical_shifts of a queried protein on a basis of tripeptides predicted sequence specific chemical_shifts are used as a template for reassignment and validation of existing resonance_assignments the newly_designed ncidp assign greatly accelerates the process of sequential resonance assignment of large intrinsically_disordered by drastically reducing the level of assignment ambiguities
