statistical_analysis of glycosylation profiles to compare tissue type and inflammatory disease_state motivation glycosylation is one of the most important post_translational of proteins and explains some aspects of the diversification of higher organisms not explained by template driven synthesis for glycomics to mature as much as genomics and proteomics the necessary tools need to be developed and tested liquid_chromatography is one of the gold_standards for oligosaccharide analysis and leads to large_amounts of data not easily interpreted manually we present a study on the testing and validation of statistical_analysis tools to aid the structural_elucidation of these analyses as well as using the results to answer biologically_relevant questions results we show the usefulness of data reduction and statistical_analysis in the interpretation of complex glycosylation data the reduction does not result in the loss of importance of the glycosylation information as shown by comparison of control and disease samples in two tissue_types glycosylation is regarded as one of the most important co and post_translational protein_modifications there are two main types bonded to the nitrogen of an asparagine in the consensus_sequence asn x ser_thr n linked or to the oxygen of a serine_threonine with a favourable placed proline in the or position o linked oligosaccharide attachment to protein sites explains some aspects of the functional diversification of higher organisms beyond the template driven gene encoded polypeptide synthesis the role and impact of glycosylation is complex and not very well understood and many studies have provided profiles from glycosylated proteins glycome and or glyco proteome highlighting a number of different causative_factors e g underlying proteins tissue location disease_state presence of pathogens immune_response system etc it is reasonable to assume that changes in glycosylation are viable targets for biomarker based research_projects genomic and proteomic_studies often make use of microarray_data to explain changes in phenotype manifestation of a disease_state or to whom correspondence should be addressed to explain a certain biological_pathway these data are quite large with thousands of microscopic array spots being recorded statistical_methods have been developed to deal with the interpretation of this type of data mass_spectrometry is a powerful technique in the structural_elucidation of glycans and in particular liquid chromatographymass spectrometry lc_ms which allows separation of isomeric structures glycome data from lc_ms can be data rich and difficult to transform into useful knowledge either analytical or biological unlike the proteomic domain oligosaccharide structural databases and the tools to interrogate them are still in their infancy o linked glycosylation is a major part of the structure of mucins in the mucous and usually account for more than of the mass of the protein as mucins mainly have a protective_function on epithelial surfaces as well as in secretions e g stomach lining saliva changes in their glycosylation can be indicative of inflammation lessened lubrication pathogen_attack etc blood_group are expressed on o linked structures and the presence_or of the sec fucosyltransferase fut determines the secretor status of individuals a data_set of published o linked oligosaccharide lc_ms data from different tissue_types and or inflammatory disease_states was compiled to compare normal and inflammatory glycosylation response in different tissues by converting lc_ms data into a mass_spectrometry average composition msac metric that describes each sample statistical_analysis could be simplified and facilitate screening of large sets of sugar data that would be difficult by manual interpretation to achieve this for lc_ms data each sample was reduced to a monosaccharide composition that describes the normalized number of sugar residues and modifications per glycan molecule this method could also be applied to malditof data not taking isomers into consideration or for glycopeptide data as well as other types of glycosylation e g n linked glycosyaminoglycans etc one advantage of reducing the data to this type of metric is the elimination of misinterpretation of structure due to re arrangements another advantage is reducing the need for full structural_elucidation of samples the main objective of this study was the identification of statistical_tools that could be used to probe large_datasets of oligosaccharide lc_ms data to extract relevant_biological evaluations that may not have been easily achievable by manual interpretation these tools could also be used to identify patterns in the analytical data that may help in structure_determination as well as providing insight into important biological_events such as inflammation glycosylation is recognized as an important post_translational involved in cellcell recognition and communication changes in glycosylation due to inflammatory_response can arise in a number of different ways i e biosynthetic alterations of transferases donors acceptors or glycosidases changes in protein expression or cellular_location de coding these changes and their contribution to the glyco profile of a sample will allow greater understanding of the inflammatory_response the msac metric allows the reduction of complicated data but in contrast to traditional monosaccharide compositional_analysis there is a common baseline among the samples core hexnac an example of the difference between the two methods of normalization is given in supplementary table s
