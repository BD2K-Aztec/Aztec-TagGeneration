genetics_and fitchi haplotype_genealogy based on the fitch algorithm in population_genetics and phylogeography haplotype_genealogy are important tools for the visualization of population_structure based on sequence_data in this type of graph node sizes are often drawn in proportion to haplotype_frequencies and edge lengths represent the minimum number of mutations separating adjacent nodes i here present fitchi a new program that produces publication ready haplotype_genealogy based on the fitch algorithm availability_and for population level sequence_data of closely_related individuals haplotype_genealogy are commonly used to visualize population divergence structure and connectivity as opposed to phylogenetic_trees these graphs focus on the relationships of haplotypes rather than of individuals they are usually unrooted and tips carrying identical haplotypes are collapsed into a single_node the haplotypes of internal nodes are estimated and these nodes are also collapsed with terminal or other internal nodes wherever identical haplotypes are inferred as a result haplotype genealogies can be multifurcating even when sequences have evolved along a bifurcating tree haplotype_genealogy have been used to visualize processes as diverse as panmixia population expansion parallel adaptation sympatric speciation and introgression multiple software_tools have been developed to draw haplotype_genealogy from sequence_data and have in their combination been used in over publications the most popular algorithms include statistical parsimony implemented in tcs median joining implemented in the program network and minimum spanning implemented in arlequin and hapstar these three methods have also been implemented in the recent software popart together with a newly_developed algorithm integer neighbour_joining these algorithms have in common that they allow graphs to include reticulations which are visualized as loops in the genealogy due to this property genealogy graphs produced with these methods are usually referred to as haplotype networks however it has been argued that reticulations in haplotype genealogies are often difficult_to as they can represent either ambiguous relationships or conflicting topologies due to recombination as an alternative propose that haplotype genealogies should rather be based on phylogenetic_trees without reticulations which outperformed statistical parsimony in their analyses of simulated_data on the other hand mardulyn discusses arguments for and against the use of trees versus networks and concludes that networks appear more appropriate when alternative connections are equally parsimonious here i present fitchi a new program for the production of haplotype_genealogy following fitchi uses reticulation free phylogenetic_trees and the fitch algorithm if terminal sequences contain missing_data the fitch algorithm is used to infer the sequence with the shortest hamming_distance to its parental node subsequent to sequence reconstruction branches with a hamming distances of zero are collapsed thus creating nodes with more than three connections as each node is associated with a haplotypic sequence the number of times this sequence occurs in the alignment is used to calculate the radius of the node in the graph visualization if population names are provided by the user nodes are drawn as pie charts indicating how often the haplotype represented by this node is found in each population to infer the optimal layout of nodes in the graph visualization fitchi makes use of the neato algorithm implemented in graphviz however since this algorithm does not take node sizes into account fitchi only uses edge angles inferred by neato and recalculates edge lengths according to hamming distances between adjacent nodes with longer and more divergent sequence_alignments the number of unique haplotypes can become large leading to the reconstructed haplotype_genealogy being too cluttered for easy interpretation fitchi therefore includes several options to simplify haplotype_genealogy highlighting only the most important patterns of population divergence a minimum node size or hamming_distance can be specified to draw nodes only for haplotypes found with a given minimum frequency or to collapse nodes separated by short hamming distances alternatively edge lengths can be calculated only on the basis of inferred transversions which effectively collapses nodes separated by transitions only these options are demonstrated with a worked example in supplementaryin the supplementary data in addition to the haplotype genealogy graph visualization fitchi reports basic alignment statistics as well as measures of population_differentiation including weir and cockerhams f st d xy and d f and the genealogical sorting index as a measure of per population monophyly fitchi is written as a python script and allows piping of input and output thus it can easily be integrated into population_genomics workflows where haplotype_genealogy and measures of population_differentiation are calculated e g in sliding_windows across chromosome length alignments
