structural_bioinformatics salign a web_server for alignment of multiple protein_sequences and structures accurate alignment of protein_sequences and or structures is crucial for many biological analyses including functional_annotation of proteins classifying protein_sequences into families and comparative protein_structure modeling described here is a web_interface to salign the versatile protein multiple sequence structure alignment module of modeller the web_server automatically determines the best alignment procedure based on the inputs while allowing the user to override default parameter_values multiple_alignments are guided by a dendrogram computed from a matrix of all pairwise_alignment scores when aligning sequences to structures salign uses structural environment information to place gaps optimally if two multiple_sequence of related proteins are input to the server a profile profile alignment is performed all features of the server have been previously optimized for accuracy especially in the contexts of comparative modeling and identification of interacting protein_partners availability the salign web_server is freely_accessible to the academic community at http salilab org salign salign is a module of the modeller software also freely_available to academic usersas part of our effort to better understand cellular_processes we annotate the functions of proteins classify them into families determine or model their d structures categorize these structures etc to achieve these aims robust and accurate methods for aligning protein_sequences and structures with one another are essential alignment_methods can be divided_into three categories based on the information used to align proteins sequencesequence sequence structure and structurestructure alignments the salign web_server is designed to provide a user_friendly interface to producing robust and accurate solutions for the alignment problems in these different categories although several programs and servers e g di to whom correspondence should be addressed align protein_sequences or protein_structures with one another salign can align sequences structures or a combination of sequences and structures
