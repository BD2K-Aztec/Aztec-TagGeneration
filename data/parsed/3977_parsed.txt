phylogenetics advance_access replacementmatrix a web_server for maximum_likelihood of amino_acid rate matrices amino_acid rate matrices are an essential basis of protein studies e g in phylogenetics and alignment a number of general_purpose matrices have been proposed e g jtt wag lg since the seminal work of margaret dayhoff and co workers however it has been shown that matrices specific to certain protein groups e g mitochondrial or life_domains e g viruses differ significantly from general average matrices and thus perform better when applied to the data to which they are dedicated this web_server implements the maximum_likelihood procedure that was used to estimate lg and provides a number of tools and facilities users upload a set of multiple protein_alignments from their domain of interest and receive the resulting matrix by email along with statistics and comparisons with other matrices a non parametric bootstrap is performed optionally to assess the variability of replacement rate estimates maximum_likelihood trees inferred using the estimated rate matrix are also computed optionally for each input alignment finely_tuned procedures and up to date ml software phyml xrate are combined to perform all these heavy calculations on our clusters amino_acid matrices contain estimates of the instantaneous substitution_rates from any amino_acid to another these rates reflect the biological chemical_and of amino_acids for example we usually observe a high substitution_rate between lysine positively_charged and arginine also positively_charged and a low substitution_rate between lysine and aspartate negatively_charged amino_acid matrices are an essential basis of protein phylogenetics they are used to compute substitution_probabilities along phylogeny branches and thus the likelihood of the data they are also closely_related to score matrices which are essential for aligning proteins and computing alignment scores several general replacement matrices have been proposed such as pam jtt wag and lg these matrices were estimated from large and diverse sets of protein_alignments they tend to be robust and perform well in many cases however the performance of replacement matrices depends on life_domains and protein groups replacement matrices have thus been estimated for specific domains e g for hiv and influenza and protein groups e g mitochondrial_proteins it has been shown that specific replacement matrices often differ significantly from general matrices and thus perform better when applied to the data to which they are dedicated e g since the seminal work of a number of methods have been designed to estimate amino_acid matrices from protein_alignments these methods belong to either counting e g or maximum_likelihood ml approaches e g the former are limited to pairwise protein_alignments while the latter fully benefit from the information contained in multiple_alignments and the corresponding phylogenies recently we improved the ml method proposed byby incorporating the variability of evolutionary_rates across sites into the matrix estimation process this procedure was successfully_applied to estimate the lg matrix from alignments of the pfam_database the flu matrix from influenza protein_alignments and a number of matrices corresponding to various structural configurations of the residues the demand to estimate amino_acid matrices for particular data is rising quickly because of the rapidly_growing volume of sequence_data and a desire to better understand the evolution and relationships of specific protein groups and species however up to date replacement matrix estimation procedures are complex and highly demanding in computational terms our method involves complex data_processing and alternates tree building using phyml and matrix estimation using xrate it thus requires a huge amount of work to estimate a matrix from raw datasets here we describe an implementation of this method in a web_server users upload their alignments and receive the output matrix by email along with a number of additional statistics and comparisons optionally the server performs a non parametric
