psi search iterative hoe reduced profile ssearch searching iterative similarity_searches with psi_blast position specific score matrices pssms find many more homologs than single searches but pssms can be contaminated when homologous alignments are extended into unrelated protein domainshomologous over extension hoe psi search combines an optimal smithwaterman local_alignment sequence_search using ssearch with the psi_blast profile construction strategy an optional sequence boundary masking procedure which prevents alignments from being extended after they are initially included can reduce hoe errors in the pssm profile preventing hoe improves selectivity for both psi_blast and psi search but psi search has fold better selectivity than psi_blast and similar sensitivity at and family coverage psi search is also produces for fold fewer false_positives than jackhmmer but is less sensitive psi_blast uses an iterative strategy to construct a protein profile in the form of a position specific score matrix pssm which dramatically improves homology detection in diverse protein_families improved versions of psi_blast have more accurate statistics and more sensitive consensus profiles but the most common cause of psi_blast errors is contamination of the pssm by extension of an homologous domain into a non homologous_region homologous over extension hoe even searches with a single welldefined domain do not guarantee uncontaminated profiles some hoe errors can be reduced by profile cleaning focuses on long insertions but requires insertion boundaries to be specified by the user thus assuming a priori_knowledge of the domain structure of the query_protein five iterative search strategiespsi blast standard and hoe reduced psi search standard and hoe reduced and jackhmmer were evaluated on the refprotdom benchmark queries sampled domain embedded sequences against the refprotdom benchmark database using an e value threshold of jackhmmer is another iterative search tool that uses hidden_markov hmms rather than a pssm the output alignments from the fifth iteration were classified into true_positives tps and false_positives fps at family coverage psi search reduces the weighted fraction of errors from psi_blast to psi search reducing hoe improves sensitivity even more to for hoe reduced psiblast and for hoe reduced psi search at coverage jackhmmer performs very well using its statistical alignment envelope producing only weighted fps but its selectivity is worse than psi search or hoe reduced psi search at and coverage overall hoe reduced psi search is fold more selective than psi_blast at the end of iteration and of weighted homologs are found by psi_blast psi search hoe reduced psi_blast hoe reduced psi search and jackhmmer respectively thus i hoe reduction greatly_improves search selectivity with a small cost in sensitivity in both psi_blast and psi search ii both psi search and jackhmmer are more sensitive and selective than psi_blast iii hoereduced psi search is more selective but slightly less sensitive than jackhmmer jackhmmer is the most sensitive tool but hoe reduced psi search is the most selective iterative tool
