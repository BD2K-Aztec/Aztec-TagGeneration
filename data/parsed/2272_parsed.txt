structural_bioinformatics advance_access idbps a web_server for the identification of dna_binding the idbps server uses the three_dimensional d structure of a query_protein to predict whether it binds dna first the algorithm predicts the functional region of the protein based on its evolutionary profile the assumption is that large_clusters of conserved_residues are good markers of functional_regions next various characteristics of the predicted functional region as well as global features of the protein are calculated such as the average surface electrostatic_potential the dipole_moment and cluster based amino_acid conservation patterns finally a random_forests classifier is used to predict whether the query_protein is likely to bind_dna and to estimate the prediction confidence we have trained and tested the classifier on various datasets and shown that it outperformed related methods on a dataset that reflects the fraction of dna_binding dbps in a proteome the area_under was the application of the server to an updated version of the n func database which contains proteins of unknown function with solved d structure suggested new putative dbps for experimental_studies dna_binding dbps compose a considerable part of the proteomes of the various organisms and take part in various processes such as dna transcription replication and packing there are a number of approaches for the identification of dbps some methods look for direct similarity between the query_protein and dbps e g when the dna_binding is novel methods that do not rely directly on previous data may be advantageous such methods often rely on electrostatic features of the proteins dna is negatively_charged and the dna_binding of the protein is often positively_charged therefore features of positively_charged patches on the proteins surfaces have been examined in order to identify dbps to whom correspondence should be addressed other features that represent the distribution of charges within the protein_structure have also been used as well as secondary_structure content and the amino_acid we recently_developed a method for the prediction of dbps based on the identification of the functional region within the query_protein we showed that patches of highly_conserved amino_acids detected by patchfinder often delineate the functional_regions in proteins in general and the core of dna_binding regions within dbps in particular using features of the predicted functional_regions and additional global features we trained a random_forests classifier on a dataset of dbps and proteins that do not bind_dna we examined the classifier on a realistic dataset that reflects the fraction of dbps in proteomes we evaluated this fraction to be and extended the original dataset by additional proteins that do not bind_dna the sensitivity and the precision on this dataset were and respectively with the default prediction score cutoff the area_under auc was we also showed that the performance of the classifier was superior to related methods here we present the idbps web_server which implements the classifier the server is freely_available idbps tau ac il it is easy to use and only requires the pdb_file or pdb id and the chain identifier of the protein of interest the n func database is a collection which we recently established of proteins of known three_dimensional d structure that lack functional_annotation the functional region of each of the proteins in n func was predicted using patchfinder as a first step toward the annotation of these proteins here we present an updated version of the database which includes pdb entries and their predicted functional_regions next we applied the idbps server to n func in order to identify potential dna binders the results available as supplementary include the prediction score of each protein as well as the corresponding estimated precision and sensitivity using the default prediction threshold proteins were identified as potential dbps at this threshold the expected precision is only while the sensitivity is however one can filter
