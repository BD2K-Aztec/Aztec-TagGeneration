genetics_and fastsimcoal a continuous time coalescent simulator of genomic_diversity under arbitrarily complex evolutionary_scenarios motivation genetic_studies focus on increasingly larger genomic_regions of both extant and ancient_dna and there is a need for simulation software to match these technological_advances we present here a new coalescent_based simulation program fastsimcoal which is able to quickly simulate a variety of genetic_markers scattered over very long genomic_regions with arbitrary recombination patterns under complex evolutionary_scenarios availability_and fastsimcoal is a c program compiled for windows macosx and linux platforms it is freely_available at cmpg unibe ch software fastsimcoal together with its detailed user_manual and example input_files contact coalescent_theory has revolutionized the field of population_genetics by providing a very powerful and intuitive framework for the study of molecular_diversity within and between species it has also provided very efficient ways to simulate diversity under complex evolutionary_scenarios a variety of coalescent_based simulation programs have been developed in the past_few e g allowing one to generate genetic data much more quickly than with classical forward approaches see e g for a review of recent coalescent and forward_genetic simulators however many standard simulation programs now have problems in generating polymorphisms over long genomic_regions like those now produced by new generation sequencing_technologies e g in this article we present fastsimcoal a completely rewritten continuous time implementation of simcoal with a fast sequential markovian coalescent smc model for recombining dna_sequences fastsimcoal retains simcoal full flexibility in setting up complex demographic scenarios arbitrary recombination distances between markers arbitrary migration_rates between populations and historical events in addition fastsimcoal allows users to specify the to whom correspondence should be addressed sampling_times of different population samples making it suitable for serial sampling
