databases_and gpcrrd g_protein spatial restraint database for d structure modeling and function_annotation g_protein gpcrs comprise the largest family of integral_membrane they are the most important class of drug_targets while there exist crystal_structures for only a very few gpcr sequences numerous experiments have been performed on gpcrs to identify the critical residues and motifs gpcrrd database is designed to systematically collect all experimental restraints including residue orientation contact and distance maps available from the literature and primary gpcr resources using an automated text_mining algorithm combined with manual validation with the purpose of assisting gpcr d structure modeling and function_annotation the current dataset contains thousands of spatial restraints from mutagenesis disulfide mapping distances electron_cryo and fourier_transform experiments g_protein gpcrs are the largest family of membrane_proteins and mediate most cellular_responses to hormones and neurotransmitters as well as being responsible for vision olfaction and taste many diseases involve the malfunction of these receptors making them important_drug while knowledge of a proteins structure furnishes important information for understanding its function and drug_design the experimental determination of the d structure of gpcr membrane_proteins has proved to be very difficult only four gpcr structures from human have been solved so_far adrenergic a a adenosine cxcr and dopamine d to be released fortunately computer based_methods for predicting the d structure of a protein from its amino_acid have been increasingly successful as demonstrated by the recent casp experiments the structure models for all registered gpcrs in the human_genome were recently generated using a threading assembly refinement method tasser about gpcrs are anticipated to have correct topology and transmembrane to whom correspondence should be addressed helix arrangement nevertheless great cautions are needed when utilizing the homology_based models for detail structural and functional_annotations since helix kinks and extracellular_loops are often different in different receptors modeling the subtle distinctions which is essential for ligand_docking and screening remains_a as highlighted by the recent blind gpcr dock experiment while there exist crystal_structures for only a very few gpcr sequences numerous experiments have been performed on gpcrs to identify the critical residues and motifs the information can be of important use to the structure and function modeling of the gpcr molecules for example the coherent activation and inactivation of residues in mutagenesis experiments usually indicate that the residues are spatially neighbors because they are binding to the common ligands the orientation of mutated functional_residues is usually towards inside of the seven helix_bundle thus specific_contacts or distance maps and residue orientations can be derived from the experimental_data which can be used as restraints to guide the protein_structure modeling simulations this is especially helpful for the modeling of the structurally variant regions that cannot be directly transferred by homology inference gpcrrd is designed to systematically collect all available restraints derived from the experimental_data scattered in the literature and gpcr related databases using an automated text_mining algorithm combined with manual validation with the purpose of assisting gpcr d structure modeling and function_annotation the gpcrrd database is freely_accessible the database is updated automatically once every weeks the gpcrrd currently contains electron_microscopy neutron_diffraction functional site_directed ftir disulfide_bridge and x_ray data the search page allows users to specify gpcrs of interest a basic query system is available to search gpcrrd entries using swiss_prot identifiers or protein_names another way to access the data is to browse lists of all the data in the database an illustration plot which is generated with the graph visualization software graphviz is used to represent and combine gpcr sequence and experimental_data information for each gpcr a pointer is available to access remote information this is done automatically by reading the swiss_prot entries and querying other remote resources for each entry cross_links to the original_articles and other resources e g gpcrdb and gpcr okb are provided the main purpose of gpcrrd is to automatically retrieve and update experimental information for gpcr d structure modeling and function_annotation although several gpcr databases have been developed useful information for gpcr d modeling cannot be directly obtained from these sources for example gpcrdb has general sequence and family data of gpcrs and tinygrap collects mutations but both do not provide the residuelevel structural_information gpcrrd is to our knowledge the first structure oriented database that systematically collects gpcr spatial restraints from primary experimental resources assisted by manual_curation the use of the gpcrrd to guide i tasser for high_resolution gpcr structure and function modeling is under progress funding alfred p sloan foundation national_science career award dbi national_institute of general medical_sciences gm gm
