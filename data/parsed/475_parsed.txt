genome_analysis a regression_model for estimating dna_copy applied to capture sequencing_data target enrichment also referred to as dna capture provides an effective way to focus sequencing_efforts on a genomic_region of interest capture data are typically used to detect single_nucleotide it can also be used to detect copy_number which is particularly useful in the context of cancer where such changes occur frequently in copy_number analysis it is a common practice to determine log ratios between test and control samples but this approach results in a loss of information as it disregards the total coverage or intensity at a locus results we modeled the coverage or intensity of the test sample as a linear function of the control sample this regression_approach is able to deal with regions that are completely deleted which are problematic for methods that use log ratios to demonstrate the utility of our approach we used capture data to determine copy_number for a set of genes in a panel of nine breast_cancer we found high concordance between our results and those generated using a single nucleotide polymorphsim genotyping platform when we compared our results with other log_ratio based_methods including exomecnv we found that our approach produced better overall correlation with snp data the majority of the human_genome is composed of repetitive_sequences and intergenic_regions over the past_years a number of hybridization based_approaches have been developed to enable selective enrichment of target_dna allowing for high_coverage of protein_coding capture sequencing has been used successfully to identify variants underlying rare_genetic and to find genes that are recurrently mutated in cancer although capture sequencing has traditionally been used to identify snvs and small insertions_and it is now clear that it can also be used to derive gene_copy this approach has tremendous potential as detecting recurrent copy_number cnas is a powerful way to identify oncogenes_and here we present a new statistical_approach for the detection of cnas and illustrate its performances on capture sequencing_data instead of modeling the ratio or log_ratio between the test and control sample coverage we modeled the test sample coverage as a linear function of the control sample coverage a proportionality model using the outcome of this model we segment the data into regions where the proportionality between the test coverage and control coverage is constant which should equate to regions with similar copy_number an exact algorithm was used to recover the maximum_likelihood ml segmentation and the number of segments was selected using a modified bayesian_information bic that is adapted for segmentation problems to validate our method we determined copy_number from capture sequencing_data derived from nine breast_cancer that had previously been analyzed with single_nucleotide snp_genotyping one major_challenge in determining copy_number from sequencing_data is that the level of coverage varies_greatly between different regions using a proportionality model overcomes this problem and produces far fewer outliers than approaches that use the ratio between a test and control sample the proportionality model is also able to handle homozygous_deletions which are problematic for methods which use log ratios overall we found that the proportionality model propseg for proportionality based_segmentation outperformed ratio and log_ratio based_methods for copy_number determination produced the best correlation to snp_array and the lowest number of false_positive breakpoints with an equivalent recall in the following sections we describe the details of the statistical_model and the associated inference scheme to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the last two authors should be regarded as joint last authors
