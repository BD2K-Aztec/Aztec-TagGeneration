databases_and advance_access biddsat visualizing the content of biodiversity data publishers in the global biodiversity information facility network in any data_quality workflow data publishers must become aware of issues in their data so these can be corrected user feedback_mechanisms provide one avenue while global assessments of datasets provide another to date there is no publicly_available tool to allow both biodiversity data institutions sharing their data through the global biodiversity information facility network and its potential users to assess datasets as a whole contributing to bridge this gap both for publishers and users we introduce biodiversity datasets assessment_tool an online tool that enables selected diagnostic visualizations on the content of data publishers and or their individual collections availability_and the online application is accessible atestablished in as an outcome of the oecd mega science forum working group with the aim of making the worlds primary data on biodiversity freely and universally available via the internet the global biodiversity information facility gbif http www gbif org is currently considered to be the largest initiative in providing access to collections of biodiversity records it is defined as a network of biodiversity data institutions data publishers that own and manage digital collections of primary biodiversity data pbd and make them publicly_available on the internet coordinated at the international secretariat in copenhagen denmark gbif acts as a worldwide proxy for pbd owned and shared by participant institutions in order to optimize information query and retrieval and to serve as a common gateway to the data gbif builds a searchable index http www gbif org informatics infrastructure indexing the institutions that join the gbif network remain the owners of their own records intellectual_property rights and host the authoritative version of the records therefore gbif does not modify the original data it being the data publishers responsibility for any data_quality issue that might appear in theirthis application visualizes and assesses several aspects of the content of the data publishers which are based on recent_advances in data_quality and fitness for use analyses as well as on previous work developed by the authors the application is focused on assessing the status of the three aspects of the pbd geospatial temporal and taxonomic information but some metadata issues are also addressed such as the volume of the collection publisher or the distribution of types of record the visualizations make it possible to detect patternseither good natural or wrong artifactual and issues and in most cases the discovery of wrong trends leads to unveiling methodological_issues in the datasets when processed by gbifs internal mechanisms a data publishers records pass through a standardization process and some information is codified for performance reasons if the original data are not structured according to the standard schema some inconsistencies might appear in the process leading to interoperability issues the content of a publisher is assessed as it is once the records have gone through these processes thus detecting the final status of the records as available to end_users although there are other tools to assess the quality of a set of data the collectioncentric perspective of this tool allows for the effective detection of patterns that would not arise when records are checked one by one our online application tries to contribute to bridge biodiversity data_quality researchers and data managers in the gbif network by allowing visual_exploration of a data publishers collection of records being a web_based openly available application everyone can access the assessments and thus anyone can contribute spotting issues to the improvement of the available biodiversity data_quality our future roadmap points to the development of new quality_assessments and the establishment of an effective_communication channel with the data publishers themselves
