watclust a tool for improving the design of drugs based on protein water interactions motivation water_molecules are key_players for protein_folding and function on the protein surface water is not placed randomly but display instead a particular structure evidenced by the presence of specific water sites ws these ws can be derived and characterized using explicit water molecular_dynamics simulations providing useful information for ligand_binding prediction and design here we present watclust a ws determination and analysis tool running on the vmd platform the tool also allows direct_transfer of the ws information to autodock program to perform biased docking availability_and the watclust plugin and documentation are freely_available atwater molecules play_an in the structure function of proteins participating in enzymatic reaction_mechanisms ligand_binding and release and proton electron_transfer processes among others importantly due to the shape and electrostatic_potential of the protein surface water_molecules are not placed randomly and display instead a particular structure that can be characterized by the presence of hydration or water sites ws these sites are defined as confined space regions adjacent to the protein surface where the probability of finding a water_molecule is higher than in the bulk_solvent they can be determined from explicit water molecular_dynamics md_simulations moreover using the theoretical basis of the inhomogeneous fluid solvation theory ws can also be structurally and thermodynamically characterized once identified they constitute a precious knowledge that can be used in several applications such as analysis of protein ligand and protein protein_complexes determination of hydration free_energies of simple solutes small ligands uptake by heme_proteins and as shown by us and others significant_improvement of molecular docking_results both in terms of accuracy and selectivity to date there are few methods for ws detection and characterization watermap is a grid based method part of the schrodinger package which is not freely_available watsite is restricted to perform md_simulations only with gromacs finally there are other programs that do not require md_simulations or use alternative thermodynamic calculation_methods it should be noted that none of them allow to use the ws information directly in docking_calculations extended application of md_simulations to understand protein_function boosted the use of the open_source graphical one of the most widely used open_source docking programs in order to perform ws biased docking wsbd we present an application that works as a plugin under the widely used vmd program based on an explicit water md_simulation trajectory it allows the characterization of the solvent structure through the identification and analysis of ws the program features are a flexible definition of the ws finding algorithm determination of each ws structural and thermodynamical parameters and visualization of results on vmd with all its functionality the method is thus ideally_suited for studies of the solvent structure on protein_surfaces and cavities with a wide_range such as i determination of ws in protein ligand_binding and ii proteinprotein_interaction surfaces that evidence hydrophilic hot_spots iii determination of water structure in water ion_channels and iv characterization of catalytic waters among others it also allows to build modified autodock grid maps to perform ws biased docking_calculations which we have shown to give significantly better results when compared to conventional docking especially for ligands having hydrophilic moieties the only drawback is that the method relies on the presence of specific protein water interactions so it should not be used on large highly hydrophobic_surfaces or regions with too high mobility
