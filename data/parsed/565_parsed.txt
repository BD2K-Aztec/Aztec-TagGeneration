systems_biology a systems level integrative framework for genome_wide and gene_expression data identifies differential_gene modules under epigenetic_control motivation there is a growing number of studies generating matched illumina_infinium humanmethylation and gene_expression data yet there is a corresponding shortage of statistical_tools aimed at their integrative_analysis such integrative tools are important for the discovery of epigenetically regulated gene_modules or molecular_pathways which play_key cellular_differentiation and disease results here we present a novel functional supervised algorithm called functional epigenetic modules fem for the integrative_analysis of infinium k dna_methylation and matched or unmatched gene_expression data the algorithm identifies gene_modules of coordinated differential_methylation and differential_expression in the context of a human interactome we validate the fem algorithm on simulated_and demonstrating how it successfully retrieves an epigenetically deregulated gene previously known to drive endo metrial cancer development importantly in the same cancer fem identified a novel epigenetically deregulated hotspot directly upstream of the well known progesterone_receptor tumour_suppressor pathway in the context of cellular_differentiation fem successfully identifies known endothelial_cell subtype specific gene_expression markers as well as a novel gene module whose overexpression in blood endothelial_cells is mediated by dna_hypomethylation the systems level integrative framework presented here could be used to identify novel key_genes or signalling_pathways which drive cellular_differentiation or disease through an underlying epigenetic_mechanism availability_and fem is freely_available as an r package from http sourceforge net_projects funepimod epigenetic_mechanisms are important not only in cellular_differentiation but also in disease especially cancer among the epigenetic_modifications seen in disease dna_methylation dnam is especially important for two reasons first unlike other epigenetic_modifications such as histone_marks it is possible to measure genome_wide dnam profiles in large_numbers of samples including fresh_frozen and formalinfixed paraffin_embedded clinical tissue_specimens second there is mounting evidence that dnam aberrations can either predispose to or cause disease_progression such causal influences have been shown to be mediated by corresponding changes in gene_expression thus dnam has emerged as the epigenetic marker of choice in epigenome_wide and in the cancer_genome tcga studies that generate matched gene_expression data specifically the illumina_infinium k dnam beadarray has emerged as a popular choice offering both scalability and coverage at a reasonable economic_cost thus there is now an urgent need to develop statistical bioinformatic_tools for the integrative_analysis of illumina_infinium k and gene_expression data here we present the functional epigenetic module fem algorithm for integrative_analysis of illumina_infinium k data with matched or unmatched gene_expression data the fem algorithm performs a supervised analysis using a proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network as a scaffold to identify gene_modules or signalling_pathways which are epigenetically and functionally deregulated in a cellular_phenotype supervised functional network_analyses have been used extensively in the gene_expression context see e g we have also previously demonstrated the feasibility of integrating illumina_infinium k dnam data with a ppi identifying_key signalling_pathways and gene_modules undergoing age associated changes in dna_methylation which were then validated in independent data similarly we also recently demonstrated the feasibility and power of integrating illumina_infinium k dnam data with gene_expression and a ppi identifying an epigenetically deregulated gene called hand which drives endometrial_cancer what these latter studies have to whom correspondence should be addressed demonstrated is that ppi hotspots of differential_methylation i e ppi subnetworks where a significant number of members exhibit statistically_significant differential_methylation associated with ageing and cancer exist and that further integration with gene_expression data allows the identification of its putative target s given that the illumina k technology has now been superseded by the more comprehensive illumina k platform we were impelled to extend our previous algorithm to the k case this extension however is non trivial because for the illumina k methylation beadchip there are typically many probes mapping to a gene and to different regions associated with the gene including distal transcription_start tss proximal tss utr first exon gene body and utr thus at present it is still unclear how best to summarize the dnam values at the gene level especially in relation to its integration with matched or unmatched gene_expression data although the reported correlations between infinium k and gene_expression data are not strong they are nevertheless highly statistically_significant indicating that valuable information can be extracted from such integrative analyses to this end we here develop a novel integrative approach especially designed for illumina k dnam data and validate this approach by demonstrating that it can successfully retrieve known genes and gene_modules driving cellular_differentiation or cancer the key aspect of our approach is the identification of key_genes or gene_modules which are functionally deregulated as a result of underlying dnam changes we have presented a novel algorithm for integrative functional supervised analyses of illumina k dnam and gene_expression data by applying and testing it in two different biological_contexts we have demonstrated here the feasibility of integrating illumina k data with gene_expression in a systems context using a human protein_interaction as a scaffold to identify gene_modules whose differential_expression is regulated by differential_methylation in an application to cancer we have seen how it successfully retrieved an epigenetically deregulated gene module centred around hand a gene known to mediate the tumour suppressive_effects of the pgr pathway specifically silencing of hand inactivates this tumour_suppressor pathway it is therefore remarkable that fem identified another hotspot and target_gene tgfb i implicated in the pgr pathway our data suggest that hypermethylationmediated silencing of tgfb i could also lead to downregulation of the pgr tumour_suppressor pathway because tgfb i hic is a known co activator of pgr importantly the tgfb i module was validated in independent data further supporting its biological_significance in the context of endothelial cell_differentiation we have shown how fem retrieved known markers of endothelial_cell subtypes including an mhc gene module hypomethylated and overexpressed in becs likewise it identified dna_hypomethylation as the potential mechanism underlying stat s overexpression in becs that the overexpression of the mhc module genes and stat in becs may be regulated by dnam isto the best of our knowledgean entirely novel insight all these results clearly highlight the value of the fem algorithm to identify novel biologically and clinically interesting gene_modules of coordinated differential_methylation and expression it is important to comment on the number and nature of the inferred fems in principle a fem could be driven by one gene only if this gene has exceptionally large absolute statistics of differential_methylation and expression other fems could be driven by several genes but with each one having only a marginally_significant statistic importantly the fem algorithm is capable of identifying both types for instance in the application to endometrial_cancer we have observed fems of the two types with the hand module being an example of the former and the tgfb i module an example of the latter in the case of the hand module many genes showed differential_methylation changes but only hand showed the expected directional change in gene_expression thus identifying it as the target of the deregulated epigenetic hotspot in the application to endothelial cell_differentiation we observed a similar pattern with some fems driven mainly by individual genes with large differential_methylation and expression statistics and others driven by a number of functionally_related e g the mhc module the existence of rich modules i e modules implicating several targets like the mhc module should not be surprising because functionally_related are often commonly regulated with epigenetic_mechanisms controlling this regulation in particular application of fem to complex tissues such as blood may revealnote we provide the symbol entrez id the statistic and p value of differential_methylation the statistic and p value of differential_expression and the overall statistic t int positive statistics mean higher levels in becs compared with lecs
