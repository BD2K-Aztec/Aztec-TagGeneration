sequence_analysis avia an interactive web_server for annotation visualization and impact analysis of genomic_variations motivation the plethora of information that emerges from large_scale genome characterization studies has triggered the development of computational frameworks and tools for efficient analysis interpretation and visualization of genomic_data functional_annotation of gen_omic variations and the ability to visualize the data in the context of whole_genome and or multiple_genomes has remained a challenging_task we have developed an interactive web_based avia annotation visualization and impact analysis to explore and interpret large sets of genomic_variations single_nucleotide and insertion deletions and to help guide and summarize genomic experiments the annotation summary plots and tables are packaged and can be downloaded by the user from the email link provided availability_and http avia abcc ncifcrf gov with the advances of next_generation many laboratories and research groups generate huge_amounts of sequencing_data and face common challenges of identification managing and interpretation of genomic_variations recent surveys of software_tools supporting basic computational steps of variation analysis present a comprehensive picture of the different options for analysis and help to identify the best practices in the field the variety of the variation analysis_pipelines is indicative of how each research group incorporates its own goals and expertise some of these pipelines are available as web_based applications wannovar variant interpretome cravat and snpeff and can be used by a wider research_community to facilitate genomic_research we have developed an interactive web_based avia annotation visualization and impact analysis to explore and interpret large sets of genomic_variations generated by high_throughput genomic experiments such as exome_capture whole_genome and targeted re sequencing_projects avia was implemented by adopting the annovar framework and circos visualization options with an emphasis on interactive annotation and visualization capabilities and a modularized structure that allows facile extension of the pipelines with new tools and databases as they become available avia provides a basic functional impact assessment of small_indels and single_nucleotide based on their proteincoding capacity and or position associated ability to affect known non coding regulatory_elements and genomic_features several of avias workflows allow functional_annotation and variant filtering options tumor normal comparisons and identification of population specific variants interactive features of avias interface permit exploratory_analysis that can focus on selected gene_sets or whole_genome data with flexible visualization options and resubmission of a previously_established workflow for the analysis of new datasets a comprehensive tutorial posted on the avia site http avia abcc ncifcrf gov apps site tutorials can guide users from a quick start example to more rigorous analytical options
