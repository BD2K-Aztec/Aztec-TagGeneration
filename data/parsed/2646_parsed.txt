kit a matlab_package for kinetochore tracking during mitosis chromosomes are attached to the mitotic_spindle via large_protein called kinetochores the motion of kinetochores throughout mitosis is intricate and automated quantitative tracking of their motion has already revealed many surprising facets of their behaviour here we present kit kinetochore tracking an easy to use open_source software_package for tracking kinetochores from live_cell fluorescent movies kit supports d d and multi colour movies quantification of fluorescence integrated deconvolution parallel execution and multiple algorithms for particle localization availability_and kit is free open_source implemented in matlab and runs on all matlab supported platforms kit can be downloaded as a package from http www mechanochemistry org mcainsh software php the source repository is available at https bitbucket org jarmond kit and under continuing development the process of mitosis involves the attachment of chromosomes to a protein_scaffold called the mitotic_spindle via large_protein called kinetochores throughout mitosis the kinetochores and hence the chromosomes execute a highly complex stochastic motion culminating in the segregation of the genetic_material to the two daughter_cells automated quantitative tracking of fluorescently_labelled kinetochores is revealing surprising details of their behaviour and makes the analysis of large_datasets consisting of hundreds_or of cells feasible we have developed a matlab packagekinetochore tracking kit for tracking the motion of kinetochores facilitating the quantitative analysis of chromosome motionc although kit is primarily developed with tracking of kinetochores in mind it is also useful as a tool for tracking other fluorescently marked particles in cells e g centrosomes motors etc provided they have an approximately gaussian shape and are not extended objects for example the centrosomes can also be tracked when fluorescently marked e g we have developed kit a software_tool which enables user_friendly and efficient particle_tracking and basic analysis of kinetochores and other objects we hope that it will lower the entry barrier for quantitative tracking analysis of live_cell data by cell_biology laboratories
