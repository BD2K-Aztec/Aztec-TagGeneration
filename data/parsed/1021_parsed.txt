cnogpro detection and quantification of cnvs in prokaryotic whole_genome sequencing_data the explosion of whole_genome wgs as a tool in the mapping and understanding of genomes has been accompanied by an equally massive report of tools and pipelines for the analysis of dna copy_number cnv most currently available tools are designed specifically for human_genomes with comparatively little literature devoted to cnvs in pro karyotic organisms however there are several idiosyncrasies in prokaryotic wgs_data this work proposes a step_by approach for detection and quantification of copy_number specifically aimed at prokaryotes results after aligning wgs reads to a reference_genome we count the individual_reads in a sliding_window and normalize these counts for bias introduced by differences in gc_content we then investigate the coverage in two fundamentally different ways i employing a hidden_markov and ii by repeated sampling with replacement bootstrapping on each individual gene the latter bypasses the complex problem of breakpoint determination to demonstrate our method we apply it to real and simulated wgs_data and benchmark it against two popular_methods for cnv_detection the proposed methodology will in some cases represent a significant jump in accuracy from other current methods availability_and copy_number cnv is a type of structural_variation that refers to any abnormality in the frequency at which a dna_sequence occurs in a genome it is a critical component of the genetic_variability of organisms cnvs can include duplications sometimes referred to as amplifications or deletions of a particular stretch of sequence considerable_research has been carried_out on the relatively easy problem of determining whether a strain contains a gene or not but less work has been devoted to the more complex problem of measuring non zero variation in the gene_copy the phenotypical implications of cnv are also less clear than those resulting from a functional deletion although cnvs are known to be a source of important genetic_variation in both humans and bacteria research in humans has typically focused on the role of cnvs in cancer and inherited_disease and there is also evidence of adaptive duplications less work has been devoted to exploring the role of cnvs in prokaryotes however bacteria display substantial variation in gene copy_numbers and the extra cost of maintaining a redundant gene comes with the payoff of a selectiveadvantage under certain environmental_conditions the most common way of testing the hypothesis of no cnv is by examining the read_counts rcs along the chromosome after alignment of the sequenced_reads to a reference_genome or de_novo the argument is that the rc in any non overlapping equally sized bin can be considered as a stochastic variable with a particular probability_distribution and that there is an inherent proportionality between the expected value mean of this variable and the underlying copy_number analogous to principles of cnv estimation in array comparative_genome technology however rcs are affected by biases that must be corrected for before any valid conclusions can be made there are currently at least available tools for the discovery of cnvs from next_generation data for a detailed runthrough see of these few attempt to quantify the number of copies of any particular chromosomal segment furthermore most of these tools are designed with a diploid human setting in mind this presents a number of problems when applying these tools to prokaryotes prokaryotes are organisms of indefinite ploidy and there are some additional allowances on the valid copy_number outcomes when compared with diploid genomes although for human_genomes a copy_number of would mean that the segment in question had two copies on one chromosome but one on the other in bacteria the interpretation would vary from species to species depending on the number of sets of chromosomes both complete and incomplete it maintains complicating matters even further the copy_number result may vary due to bacterial_growth mechanics in fact any nonnegative decimal copy_number could make sense for bacteria because bacteria growing under exponential_growth conditions are able to replicate their chromosomes faster than they can divide this is reflected in dna sequencing_data with copy_numbers representing a mixture of the discrete number of chromosomes that the bacterium maintains at the stationary nondividing phase and a fractional number that stems from the fact that cells are in different phases of binary fission cycle this article_presents a tool for the discovery of cnvs from prokaryote origin whole_genome wgs_data we have developed an r package called cnogpro which is an acronym for copy_numbers of genes in prokaryotes the main purpose of the tool is to quickly estimate the number of copies of any gene or intergenic segment in a resequencing experiment cnogpro supports rapid calling of copy_number using a hidden_markov and additionally allows for the construction of confidence_intervals around copy_number estimates by bootstrapping although several publicly_available cnv analysis tools designed for work on humanorigin data can with varying_amounts of tinkering also accept prokaryote data to our knowledge no existing tool for cnv analysis focuses specifically on prokaryote data we have presented a simple quick and effective tool for detecting and quantifying cnvs in wgs_data of prokaryotic organisms when comparing similar prokaryotic_genomes where details about the genomic layout in the reference are available it represents a considerable jump in accuracy over other methods it additionally has functions for creating high_quality informative plots and figures an example of which can be seen in our method starts with wgs_data in the sam format data are easily_accessible through the sequence_read sra https www ncbi nlm nih gov traces sra from comparison of the present algorithm cnv seq and cn mops in detecting and quantifying cnvs in simulated_data with artificially introduced cnvs red_color indicates that the algorithm correctly_detected a cnv region but that it was either not quantified as in cnv seq or it was quantified incorrectly segments that were quantified correctly are highlighted in blue the x axes correspond to genomic_position where one can also download the sra toolkit and create sam format files from sequencing_experiments there are probably datasets from thousands of sequencing_experiments freely_available in the different sequence banks just waiting for someone to analyze the clues that have been hidden in the frequencies with which each sequence occurs cnogpro is written entirely in the r programming_language and is freely_available under the gnu public license gpl we believe it will be a valuable addition to the toolbox of every researcher conducting resequencing experiments to study copy_number variance
