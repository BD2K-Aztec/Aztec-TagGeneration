data_and agra analysis of gene ranking algorithms often the most informative genes have to be selected from different gene_sets and several computer gene ranking algorithms have been developed to cope with the problem to help researchers decide which algorithm to use we developed the analysis of gene ranking algorithms agra system that offers a novel technique for comparing ranked lists of genes the most important feature of agra is that no previous_knowledge of gene ranking algorithms is needed for their comparison using the text_mining system finding associated concepts with text analysis agra defines what we call biomedical concept space bcs for each gene_list and offers a comparison of the gene_lists in six different bcs categories the uploaded gene_lists can be compared using two different methods in the first method the overlap between each pair of two gene_lists of bcss is calculated the second method offers a text field where a specific biomedical concept can be entered agra searches for this concept in each gene_lists bcs highlights the rank of the concept and offers a visual representation of concepts ranked above and below it availability_and available at http agra fzv uni mb si implemented_in and running on the glassfishdna microarray is a technology that can simultaneously measure the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single experiment the use of microarray chips in gene_expression analysis requires an enormous amount of data to be analysed and often while at the same time selecting the most informative genes from different gene_sets one of the possible ways to rank the genes is to use a feature_selection fs method fs is a machine_learning technique used to select the most important features for building a robust learning model the same fs techniques are now widely used in bioinformatics for identification of biomarkers or lists of relevant_genes from dna microarray_based gene_expression there are many fs methods which can be used but how do researches know which one is the best several different methodsshows agras main interface with uploaded gene_lists the application offers a novel way to compare ranked lists of genes with the help of bcs bcs is a set of ranked biomedical concepts gathered through facta where they are grouped into six different categories facta can be queried by inputting a word e g p a concept id e g uniprot p or a combination of these uniprot p and lung or gastric agra calculates bcs for a single gene_list in three steps i calculation of protein bcs ii calculation of gene symbol bcs and iii calculation of gene_list bcs to achieve this each gene symbol from the gene_lists is associated with its protein s and their uniprot ids are extracted with help of the affymetrix annotation file hg u plus annotations release agra then queries facta with these uniprot identifiers and maximum most important biomedical concepts ranked by their frequencies of appearing in the medline_abstracts from each category are extracted concepts that are gathered in this step represent six bcs categories of each associated protein next bcs categories for the gene symbol are calculated if the gene symbol is associated with only one protein its bcs is identical to the proteins one when the symbol is associated with more than one protein the average values of the frequencies in each category are calculated in the final step the six categories for each gene_list bcs are calculated this is done by summarizing values from all gene symbol bcs categories from the list because the order of the gene symbols in the list is crucial agra weights each gene symbol bcs according to the gene symbol position in the list the weight w for single symbol x i is defined as w x i n i n where n is number of all its concepts and i represents the rank of the gene that concept belongs to in the gene_list starting from finally to avoid sending queries to the facta system too often agra saves bcss in a local database whenever a gene symbol for which bcs has not been defined yet appears in one of the gene_lists the system queries facta calculates its bcs and saves it locally when bcss for all gene_lists are extracted agra calculates the overlap values for every combination of two bcss to evaluate the effectiveness of fs methods overlap is a simple method to measure similarity between two bcss where biomedical concepts that appear in both bcs are counted and divided by the number of concepts in the shorter bcs another way to compare fs methods is to search for the position of relevant biomedical concepts in the final gene_list bcs position of a single biomedical concept is defined as it is ranked number among all the concepts in one of the categories this way researchers can decide which fs method selects the most important concepts and ranks them higher compared with other methods
