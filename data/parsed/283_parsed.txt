gene_expression analysis of gene_expression data using a linear_mixed finite mixture_model approach application to regional differences in the human_brain the united_kingdom brain expression consortium ukbec motivation gene_expression data exhibit common information over the genome this article shows how data can be analysed from an efficient whole_genome perspective further the methods have been developed so that users with limited expertise in bioinformatics and statistical computing techniques could use and modify this procedure to their own needs the method outlined first uses a large_scale linear_mixed for the expression data genome_wide and then uses finite mixture_models to separate differentially_expressed de from non de transcripts these methods are illustrated through application to an exceptional uk brain expression consortium involving human frozen post_mortem brain_regions results fitting linear_mixed has allowed variation in gene_expression between different biological_states e g brain_regions gender age to be investigated the model can be extended to allow for differing levels of variation between different biological_states predicted values of the random_effects show the effects of each transcript in a particular biological state using the uk brain expression consortium data this approach yielded striking patterns of co regional gene_expression fitting the finite mixture_model to the effects within each state provides a convenient method to filter transcripts that are de these de transcripts can then be extracted for advanced functional analysis research_efforts in molecular_and are vital to develop our understanding of for example the human central_nervous cns function and to dissect the functional complexity and the progress of diseases these rapid advancements were mainly determined by the genomic transcriptomic and diagnostic technological innovations these technologies such as expression arrays and rna_sequencing are applicable at the genome_wide scale and their application results in more insightful information being produced and this can lead towards more informed investigations and in turn through to clinical_applications however the analyses and the volume of the data that are generated from these complex techniques are computationally_challenging to date there is no standard protocol available to normalize and process the raw_data from these experiments into a manageable format that can then be further interrogated on a personal computer and to align and assemble the data to a reference_genome by scientists with no great experience in bioinformatics with expression arrays and rna_sequencing increasing in coverage and reducing in cost they are now widely used with increasingly_large sample_sizes consequently there is an ongoing need to develop and assess computationally_efficient means of analysing big_data although there is no universal approach to gene_expression analysis the conventional approach is to consider a model for one gene at a time and consider if this particular gene is differentially_expressed de between any of the biological_states considered for example as implemented in the limma package of r naturally this results in an extreme multiple testing situation which is usually overcome by using an appropriate false_discovery fdr control such as the q value procedure the alternative is to consider a global model for all the expression data and replace the many thousands of null and alternative_hypotheses by more global tests to dissect causes of variation in gene_expression such an approach would have two advantages first transcripts are not independent identities and there is much common information across the genome so combining this would be expected to increase power of signal_detection second although a more philosophical point we question whether it is best practice to consider many thousands of separate hypotheses as students we were taught the importance of writing out the null and alternative_hypotheses to whom correspondence should be addressed for every statistical_test and this pragmatic_approach would seem to fail here so a global or genome_wide approach can be achieved by fitting linear_mixed lmms to all the data for example as has been done by with the variation between transcripts as another source of variation suggested a similar process using hierarchical_models one potential limitation of the approach of using an lmm fitted to all the expression data is that it may not allow for differences in variability in expression across the biological_states of the system under study for example in the human_brain some regions of the brain show greater levels of variation in gene_expression than in other regions however improvements in lmm software for example as described inand pinheiro and bates allowing flexible variance structure modelling make it worthwhile again considering the use of large_scale lmms in expression data analysis fitting lmms by themselves does not lead to the determination of which individual transcripts are de nor do the lmms identify clusters of transcripts with similar expression_profiles however fitting of finite mixture_models has been used successfully in this endeavour to separate out potential de from nonde transcripts the following article demonstrates how these two approaches can be adopted in the analysis of a large gene_expression dataset the methods are described to allow easy implementation in other situations while some of this approach has been described in previous papers the present article provides additional detail and extends these methods to illustrate the methods one of the most comprehensive gene_expression databases related to human brain_tissue namely the uk brain expression consortium ukbec is used highlighting different expression_patterns across the brain_regions the estimates of the overall expression mean and the variance components from each random subset as well as their combined estimates are shown in it is clear that the estimates from both subsets are similar and consistent with sampling fluctuations there is very little between array variation as indicated by its small estimated variance_component a ae there was a relatively large estimated variance_component to assess between transcript variation t ae blups of overall transcripts effects can be obtained to highlight differing overall expression levels between transcripts for the transcript specific effects in individual regions the level of variation differed widely crbl showed the greatest level of variation tr ae followed by whmt tr ae with hypo displaying the least variation tr ae note the formal reml lrts indicate the heterogeneous model was superior to a homogeneous model with a common between transcript variance for part lrt and for part lrt and compared with a chi_square distribution with df returns p in both estimated residual variation ae accounted for between and of the variation in expression levels depending on the region supplementaryshows a boxplot

that the expression levels in crbl were not substantially correlated with those in other regions the greatest being with octx r the highest correlations all positive were between the three cortex regions fctx octx and tctx to illustrate shows a smoothed scatter_plot using the smoothscatter function in the geneplotter package of r indicating the strong correlations between fctx and octx r

mixture_model was fitted to the transcript effects within each region and these are summarized in on average just of transcripts show differential_expression in any one region although this varies from hypo to octx in terms of variation in expression the de transcripts show on average greater standard_deviations than non de transcripts and this ratio is fairly consistent across regions r note that using results for mixture distributions the overall reml variance estimates incan be approximately reproduced here as tr k because the means of both mixture components can be taken as to
