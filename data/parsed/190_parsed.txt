genome_analysis aisaic a software_suite for accurate identification of significant aberrations in cancers accurate identification of significant aberrations in cancers aisaic is a systematic effort to discover potential cancer driving genes such as oncogenes_and two major confounding_factors against this goal are the normal_cell and random background aberrations in tumor_samples we describe a java aisaic package that provides comprehensive analytic functions and graphic_user for integrating two statistically principled in silico approaches to address the aforementioned challenges in dna_copy analyses in addition the package provides a command_line for users with scripting and programming needs to incorporate or extend aisaic to their customized analysis_pipelines this open_source multiplatform software offers several attractive features i it implements a user_friendly complete pipeline from processing raw_data to reporting analytic_results ii it detects deletion types directly from copy_number signals using a bayes hypothesis_test iii it estimates the fraction of normal contamination for each sample iv it produces unbiased null_distribution of random background alterations by iterative aberration exclusive permutations and v it identifies significant consensus regions and the percentage of homozygous hemizygous deletions across multiple samples aisaic also provides users with a parallel_computing option to leverage ubiquitous multicore machines availability_and aisaic is available as a java_application with a users guide and source_code at https code aisaic presents a comprehensive and unsupervised_approach to analyze dna_copy in the cancer genome aisaic is supported by a well grounded statistical_framework and can detect homo hemi deletion types and rates estimate and correct normal_cell and identify significant consensus cna regions tested on both simulations and tcga datasets aisaic is effective at revealing novel consensus regions that harbor potential cancer_driver and enhancers we expect that with further development aisaics methodology can be applied to other forms of genomic and epigenetic data such as dna methylations
