motifsuite workflow for probabilistic motif_detection and assessment motivation probabilistic motif_detection requires a multi_step approach going from the actual de_novo regulatory motif_finding up to a tedious assessment of the predicted motifs motifsuite a_user streamlines this analysis flow its core consists of two post_processing procedures that allow prioritizing the motif_detection output the tools offered by motifsuite are built around the well established motif_detection tool motifsampler and can also be used in combination with any other probabilistic motif_detection tool elaborate guidelines on each of its applications have been provided probabilistic methods which search de_novo for statistically overrepresented motifs in co regulated_genes have been proven successful for the prediction of regulatory_motifs due to the presence of local_optima in the search_space of possible overrepresented motifs different initializations of a deterministic algorithm such as meme or different runs of a stochastic algorithm such as motifsampler will output non identical motif predictions even when performed under identical parameter_settings a tedious post_processing is required to extract from this set of multiple candidate predictions the most significant ones motifsuite streamlines this multi_step approach from de_novo motif_detection to the assessment of motif significance
