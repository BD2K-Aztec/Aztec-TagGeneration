data_and biotextquest a web_based biomedical_text suite for concept discovery biotextquest combines automated discovery of significant terms in article clusters with structured knowledge annotation via named_entity services offering interactive user_friendly visualization a tag cloud_based illustration of terms labeling each document cluster are semantically annotated according to the biological entity and a list of document titles enable users to simultaneously compare terms and documents of each cluster facilitating concept association and hypothesis_generation biotextquest allows customization of analysis parameters e g clustering stemming algorithms exclusion of documents significant terms to better match the biological_question addressed availability http biotextquest several information_retrieval tools are available to the scientific_community each attempting to analyze the large amount of biomedical information from a different perspective most of the currently available literature mining systems are based on natural_language supervised machine_learning or their combination an alternative approach is the summarizing of large query outputs by document clustering where similar documents are grouped on the basis of particular meaningful terms it is an unsupervised technique thus its success does not depend on prior_knowledge or domain expertise existing biomedical_literature clustering systems include clustermed http demos vivisimo com clustermed and pured mcl clustermed is a commercial software whose free version supports the clustering of at most abstracts pured mcl is a downloadable collection of perl and r scripts mostly addressing expert users with biotextquest our aim has been to provide researchers with a user_friendly web_application that enables online queries for defining corpora of biomedical abstracts followed by document clustering and visualization biotextquest is an application that offers an array of visualization_tools for efficient navigation among biomedical records and concept extraction it also supports the depiction of term associations within clusters and can be easily customized in the following sections we describe the biotextquest architecture and demonstrate its functionality based on a reworked query example of a drosophila developmental_pattern presented in the original textquest publication we describe biotextquest an online text_mining system enabling concept discovery from the biomedical_literature recorded in pubmed via a clustering based procedure further exploration of literature information is facilitated by intuitive graphical depictions of biologically_relevant terms and interactive re subclustering capabilities biotextquest is designed with simplicity for end_users while advanced options enable further analyses
