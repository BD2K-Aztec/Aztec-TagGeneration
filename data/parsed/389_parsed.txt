data_and a novel link prediction algorithm for reconstructing protein_protein by topological_similarity motivation recent_advances in technology have dramatically_increased the availability of proteinprotein_interaction ppi data and stimulated the development of many methods for improving the systems level understanding the cell however those efforts have been significantly hindered by the high_level of noise sparseness and highly_skewed degree_distribution of ppi_networks here we present a novel algorithm to reduce the noise present in ppi_networks the key idea of our algorithm is that two proteins_sharing some higher_order topo logical similarities measured by a novel random_walk based procedure are likely interacting with each other and may belong to the same protein complex results applying our algorithm to a yeast ppi_network we found that the edges in the reconstructed network have higher biological_relevance than in the original network assessed by multiple types of information including gene_ontology gene_expression essentiality conservation between species and known protein_complexes comparison with existing_methods shows that the network reconstructed by our method has the highest quality using two independent graph clustering_algorithms we found that the reconstructed network has resulted in significantly_improved prediction_accuracy of protein_complexes furthermore our method is applicable to ppi_networks obtained with different experimental_systems such as affinity_purification yeast_two y h and protein_fragment complemen tation assay pca and evidence shows that the predicted edges are likely bona_fide physical_interactions finally an application to a human ppi_network increased the coverage of the network by at least recent_advances in high_throughput techniques such as yeast_two y h and tandem_affinity have enabled the production of a large amount of proteinprotein_interaction ppi data these ppi data can be modelled by networks where nodes in networks represent proteins and edges between the nodes represent physical_interactions between proteins these networks together with other high_throughput functional_genomics data are offering unprecedented_opportunities for both biological and computational scientists to understand the cell at a systems level for example global analysis of ppi_networks has revealed important connections between topology and function ppi_networks have also been used for predicting gene_functions functional pathways or protein_complexes with both supervised and unsupervised methods furthermore much effort has been devoted recently towards incorporating ppi_networks to obtain a better mechanistic_understanding of complex_diseases and to improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases however the growing size and complexity of ppi_networks poses multiple challenges to biologists first ppi_networks often have a high false_positive and an even higher false_negative second ppi_networks are typically sparse partially because of the high false_negative which places a hurdle for algorithms that rely on neighbour information for example in gene_function third ppi_networks are known to have skewed degree_distribution meaning that they have more than expected quantity of hub_genes such hub nodes can often reduce the performance of existing graph_theoretic algorithms e g for predicting protein_complexes that were often designed for networks with relatively uniform degree distributions in this article we present a novel method to improve the quality of a given ppi_network by computationally predicting some new interactions and removing spurious edges it is worth noting that our idea is purely based on the topology of the network with no additional biological_information involved this ensures that our algorithm can be easily combined with other algorithms that have already been developed for predicting protein_complexes or performing ppi based studies there are also several studies that attempt to combine additional biological_information such as gene_ontology and gene_expression with ppi_network for protein complex prediction it should be straightforward to use our method in these approaches by replacing the ppi_network with our reconstructed ppi_network to assess the performance of our algorithm we tested it on three yeast ppi_networks obtained with different experimental_systems and we examined the biological_relevance of the results to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for
