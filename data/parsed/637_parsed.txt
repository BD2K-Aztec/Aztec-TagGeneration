a wholly defined agilent microarray spike in dataset motivation spike in datasets provide a valuable resource for assessing and comparing among competing microarray_analysis strategies our previous wholly defined spike in datasets the golden and platinum spikes have provided insights for the analysis of affymetrix genechips however a similar dataset in which all crna identities and relative levels are known prospectively has not been available for two color platforms results we have generated a wholly defined spike in dataset for agilent microarrays consisting of arrays with more than differentially_expressed and approximately background crnas the composition of this ag spike dataset is identical to that of our previous platinum spike dataset and therefore allows direct cross_platform comparison we demonstrate here the utility of the ag spike dataset for evaluating different analysis methods designed for two color arrays comparison between the ag spike and platinum spike studies shows high agreement between results obtained using the affymetrix and agilent platforms availability the ag spike raw_data can be accessed atsince their introduction in the mid s dna_microarrays have become a leading tool in a diverse assortment of research disciplines including cancer and other disease research developmental_biology and evolutionary_biology the popularity of microarrays owes much to their ability to simultaneously interrogate the expression_level of tens_of of genes enabling genome_scale transcriptional_profiling of multiple tissues in essentially a single experiment although next_generation approaches such as rna_seq provide potentially compelling advantages over microarray_based gene_expression profilingno limitation to known transcripts no cross_hybridization issues and a broader detection range for expression levels comparisons between these two technologies have indicated that rna_seq may have less accurate measurement of absolute rna expression_level less sensitive detection of differentially_expressed degs and a higher_error for weakly expressed genes for the present therefore microarrays remain an important cost_effective and mature platform for gene_expression the benefit of profiling numerous_genes simultaneously by microarrays leads to one of the techniques biggest drawbacks it is generally not possible to independently verify such a large number of individual data_points making_it to assess the accuracy of the data analysis this is of particular concern due to the tremendous number of microarray_data analysis methods which have proliferated in tandem with the increased use of the arrays themselves most previous_studies of microarray performance including the microarray quality_control maqc project used rna samples in which the identities of most of the individual rna_transcripts were not known affymetrix latin square data www affymetrix com support technical sample data datasets affx such an experimental_design limits the evaluation of accuracy to only a small number of spike in crnas present in the sample we previously generated two wholly defined control datasets for the affymetrix_genechip platform the golden spike and platinum spike datasets in these spike in experiments the identities and relative concentrations of the complete complement of present crnas are known over crnas are differentially_expressed with designated fold changes ranging from to and over crnas serve as background with constant expression levels we and others have used these datasets to determine optimal methods for analysis of affymetrix microarrays under various experimental_conditions unfortunately similar wholly defined spike in datasets do not exist for other popular microarray_platforms in particular for dual channel platforms different from affymetrixs single_channel design for dual channel microarrays the two samples to be compared are labeled separately with different fluorescent dyesthe ag spike dataset involves two groups of six arrays each from two independent sample preparations the six arrays within each group contain three technical_replicates and their corresponding dyeswapped pairs each array was hybridized with samples from two different conditions a and b the crna composition under each condition is identical to that in our previous platinum spike dataset except that the crnas spiked with known absolute_concentration in the platinum spike dataset were excluded here the ag spike dataset contains and crnas up and down_regulated respectively in condition a compared with b with fold_change values varying between and the relative concentrations of another rnas were kept unchanged between the two conditions similar to the platinum spike dataset the ag spike dataset is balanced with respect to total labeled rna amount and extent of up and down_regulation for each experimental_condition
