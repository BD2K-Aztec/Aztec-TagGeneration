systems_biology ideom an excel interface for analysis of lc_ms based metabolomics_data the application of emerging metabolomics technologies to the comprehensive investigation of cellular biochemistry has been limited by bottlenecks in data_processing particularly noise filtering and metabolite_identification ideom provides a user_friendly data_processing application that automates filtering and identification of metabolite peaks paying particular attention to common sources of noise and false identifications generated by liquid_chromatography lcms platforms building on advanced processing_tools such as mzmatch and xcms it allows users to run a comprehensive pipeline for data analysis and visualization from a graphical_user within microsoft_excel a familiar program for most biological scientists availability_and ideom is provided free of charge at http mzmatch sourceforge net ideom html as a macro enabled spreadsheetmetabolomics aims to measure all small_molecules metabolites in a biological system however challenges associated with data analysis in particular the accurate identification of metabolites have restricted progress recent_advances in high_resolution ms provide accurate_mass detection that significantly_improves metabolite_identification from liquid chromatographyms lcms although limitations still abound and noise or artifact peaks are often incorrectly identified as metabolites the automated pre_processing in ideom drastically reduce the need for manual_curation of lcms data by applying filters to remove hundreds of false identifications the example tutorial dataset supplementary_material demonstrates putative identification of metabolites and rejection of false identifications from serum_samples the putatively identified metabolites are displayed in an interactive table that includes metabolite information sample intensities comparative statistics lcms data and links to websites and graphs putative identifications can be rapidly scrutinized by double click access to lcms metadata or adjusted by selecting alternative isomers from dropdown lists data visualization is enhanced by excels conditional formatting filtering and sorting allowing users to view
