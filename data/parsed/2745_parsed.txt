logical transformation of genome_scale for gene level applications and analysis motivation in recent_years genome_scale gems have played_important in areas like systems_biology and bioinformatics however because of the complexity of gene reaction associations gems often have limitations in gene level analysis and related applications hence the existing_methods were mainly focused on applications and analysis of reactions and metabolites results here we propose a framework named logic transformation of model ltm that is able to simplify the genereaction associations and enables integration with other developed methods for gene level applications we show that the transformed gems have increased reaction and metabolite number as well as degree of freedom in flux_balance but the genereaction associations and the main features of flux_distributions remain constant in addition we develop two methods optgeneknock and fastgenesl by combining ltm with previously_developed reaction based_methods we show that the fastgenesl outperforms exhaustive_search finally we demonstrate the use of the developed methods in two different case studies we could design fast genetic intervention_strategies for targeted overproduction of biochemicals and identify double and triple synthetic_lethal gene_sets for inhibition of hepatocellular_carcinoma tumor_growth through the use of optgeneknock and fastgenesl respectively availability_and source_code implemented in matlab raven toolbox and cobra toolbox is public available at https sourceforge net_projects genome_scale gems are a useful platform for systems_biology and have been widely used in industrial biotechnology applications there are many successful stories showing the usefulness of gems in rational_design of genetic_modifications of microorganism for improved production of specific metabolites and provide new biological_insight into the physiology of different microorganisms more recently human gems have been employed to identify novel prognostic_biomarkers and potential_drug for designing efficient treatment_strategies although gems are widely used their uses have some limitations in genetic related applications a number of bi level linear_programming methods have been developed for in silico metabolic_engineering such as optknock optreg optforce genetic design through local_search gdls and genetic design through branch and bound gdbb and these methods have only identified potential targeted reactions knockouts or up down regulations rather than targeted genes which can be modified in vivo moreover these reaction based_methods did not consider the genetic_interactions in the context of protein_complexes and isoenzymes which result in strategies genetically complicated or infeasible recently another bilevel based method optorf was developed for identifying metabolic and regulatory_gene that are targets for knockout or upregulation which may lead to overproduction of desired chemicals optorf employed a three_dimensional geneenzyme reaction array to enable gene level prediction nevertheless this array needs to be systematically defined by the user for each model which restrict the widely use of optorf in strain design on the other hand optgene and its derived algorithms could identify gene_knockout strategies however these methods are based on genetic_algorithm which is basically random mutation and would probably miss the optimal_solution moreover synthetic_lethality sl analysis which identifies combinations of mutations in two or more genes leading to cell lethality in silico could be applied for identification of small_hairpin shrna and crispr targets for cancer treatment however the huge computational_cost of triple or higher_level sl makes it infeasible for its use in biotechnology applications there were two methods developed for efficient identification of synthetic_lethal reactions but when it comes to synthetic_lethal genes analysis one of them becomes unavailable while the other one requires manual identification of appropriate equations relating binary variables of genes and reactions which is time consuming this gene level application problem originates from the geneprotein relations gprs information_loss in the genereaction association matrix gram the gram is a predefined binary matrix in gems whose ijth elements is if ith reaction is associated with jth gene and is otherwise gram is the only mathematically friendly part for most of the existing_methods to capture the gprs information however gram does not include any information of the relationship among gene_sets for example one cannot know whether a reaction is associated with a protein complex and relationship in gene_set or with isoenzymes or relationship in gene_set directly from gram therefore in order to correctly integrate gprs information into the simulation algorithms one needs to interpret the information into mathematical expressions which is time consuming and tedious and sometimes it may even be extremely_difficult to reconstruct the correct relationship here we introduced a gem modification algorithm called logic transformation of model ltm which extended the original gem into a logically equivalent with much better genetic applicability in this algorithm pseudo reactions and metabolites were added into the gem based on the gpr relationships described in gems to simulate the isoenzyme and protein complex relationships hereby reactions are associated with no more than one gene therefore gprs information was included in the stoichiometric matrix of gem and we can directly apply gram to all kind of optimization programming algorithms such as optknock optreg and optforce furthermore ltm could extend the use of previously well designed methods that were only developed for reaction simulations in gene level applications we developed optgeneknock which incorporated ltm with a bilevel mixed_integer milp based knockout method the milp problem was then solved by truncated branch and bound to obtain near optimal gene_knockout strategies with desired phenotype in addition by incorporating ltm with a previous method which was developed for efficient identification of reaction sl a new method called fastgenesl was designed for genetic sl analysis we showed that fastgenesl greatly outperformed exhaustive analysis in gene sl analysis for gems of escherichia_coli saccharomyces_cerevisiae and hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc finally we performed two case studies for demonstrating the capability of the here presented methods first we identified gene_targets that may increase the production of desired biochemicals by designing fast genetic intervention_strategies by optgeneknock using two different gems of e coli second we employed fastgenesl together with a hcc gem for gaining biological_insight into underlying_molecular of hcc and identifying potential shrna targets which may inhibit_tumor in this article we developed a method called ltm which transforms a gem to a logically equivalent extended model to enable gene level applications the transformation enlarges the size of gems while keeps the correct gprs and the fba results of extended models are equivalent to the original models despite the increased degree of freedom we showed the applicability of our method in two different biotechnology applications we first showed the utility of ltm in optimization frameworks the optimization frameworks could be easily applied to genetic solution prediction by incorporating with ltm this implicated the wide_application of ltm with many well designed methods such as optknock and optforce we developed optgeneknock by combining optknock and ltm as well as truncated branch and bound algorithm and showed its capability in designing gene_knockout strategies leading to overproduction of desired biochemical in addition we developed a gene sl analysis method called fastgenesl this method combined ltm and a previous method fastsl and enabled efficient genet sl analysis in gems for different organisms we demonstrated that the efficiency was greatly_improved by fastgenesl and this enable identification of triple sl genes in gems which was previously infeasible next by employing fastgenesl we identified novel anticancer drug_targets that can be used for inhibition of the hcc tumors and performed in silico toxicity test for these identified targets we found the most prominent distinguishing metabolic_features of hcc and observed that here identified targets can be used in the drug_development process for efficient treatment of hcc tumors by the two biotechnology applications tested in this study we could conclude that although the principle of ltm is simple it greatly benefits gene level analysis and applications in addition many previous methods e g optknock and fastsl could be extended to gene level applications e g optgeneknock and fastgenesl by incorporating with ltm in a straightforward way furthermore as gprs are simplified after ltm complex gene_set controlled reactions are avoided and it becomes very convenient to integrate different omics_data into extended models thus ltm could also be used together with multiomic data integrating methods like gimme and prom in total we could conclude that ltm is a useful tool which facilitates the application of gems and we are therefore confident that it will find wide use in the community
