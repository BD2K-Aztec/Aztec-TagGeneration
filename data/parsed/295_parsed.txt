genome_analysis an approximate bayesian_approach for mapping paired_end dna_reads to a reference_genome many high_throughput sequencing_experiments produce paired dna_reads paired_end dna_reads provide extra positional_information that is useful in reliable mapping of short_reads to a reference_genome as well as in downstream_analyses of structural_variations given the importance of paired_end alignments it is surprising that there have been no previous publications focusing on this topic in this article we present a new probabilistic_framework to predict the alignment of paired_end to a reference_genome using both simulated_and we compare the performance of our method with six other read_mapping tools that provide a paired_end option we show that our method provides a good combination of accuracy error_rate and computation time especially in more challenging and practical cases such as when the reference_genome is incomplete or unavailable for the sample or when there are large variations between the reference_genome and the source of the reads an open_source implementation of our method is available as part of last a multipurpose alignment program freely_available atmany high_throughput sequencers provide a paired_end option in which each of the two opposite strands of a dna_fragment is read from the edge to the interior in the direction generating a pair of reads paired_end can be obtained by a simple modification to the standard single_end workflow yet they provide several benefits over single_end they contain extra positional_information that aids in accurate mapping of reads to a reference for instance by disambiguating alignments when one of the ends aligns to a repetitive region they are also extremely useful in downstream_analyses of structural_variations such as detection of indels or rearrangements in this article we focus on the former the task of mapping a set of paired_end to a reference_genome which is often the first and fundamental step in inferring biological_phenomena from high_throughput sequencing_data to motivate our work we compare inthe results of mapping million pairs of simulated human reads to the human reference using various alignment tools in their paired_end and single_end modes for nearly all the aligners the use of pairing information significantly_improves mapping accuracy various read_mapping tools support paired_end data although not all provide adequate statistical treatment mappers such as bowtie soap and gsnap require the user to input the expected value and standard_deviation of the genomic_distance between the two ends based on this information they flag a pair of mapped_reads as being either concordant or discordant for possible use in analyses of structural_variations however the user may not know before hand the expected genomic_distance especially when relying on third_party datasetssome provide reliable information about the fragment size_distribution but not all do bwa does not rely on user provided fragment_size thresholds and estimates the fragment size_distribution from uniquely mapped pairs another feature of the paired_end strategy of bwa is that if only one end is reliably mapped it attempts to rescue the other end by aligning it using the smithwaterman_algorithm in the area implied by the inferred fragment_size like bwa stampy lunter and learns the fragment size_distribution from the input_data and also attempts to rescue mates for pairs whose ends do not map uniquely and at sufficiently close distance to each other additionally it uses an elaborate probabilistic_model that incorporates pairing information to compute for a pair of alignments of a read_pair the posterior_probability of having predicted an incorrect alignment novoalign www novocraft com computes a similar mapping quality for each paired alignment but it relies on the user to provide the fragment size_distribution we propose a new approach to apply pairing information for mapping paired_end we first align each read independently to obtain candidate alignments for each candidate we apply our new probabilistic_model to estimate the posterior_probability that this alignment is incorrect by considering other candidate alignments of the read those of its mate and the fragment size_distribution to allow for the possibility that paired_reads may actually come from disjoint locations in the reference our model includes a prior probability on the occurrence of such an event one major departure from previous methods is that we calculate marginal posterior_probabilities for each candidate alignment of a read as opposed to associating this value to a read_pair our method also benefits from using last in the alignment phase

seedsthus allowing the application of classic sequence alignment_techniques to the problem of mapping giga scale sized sets of reads generated by high_throughput sequencers we describe our method in detail in section we compare the performance of our method with six other mapping tools in section for each mapping tool the technique used to align individual_reads hugely influences the final_outcome and as it is not feasible to isolate the pairing algorithm we are comparing to some extent the performance of the alignment_algorithms as well many articles that introduce new read_mapping tools or survey them provide benchmarking tests that tend to be not very informativeonly ideal or easy cases are testedor even misleadingperformance is measured by counting the number of reads_mapped with complete disregard to the correctness of mapping in this article we conduct more rigorous tests that cover various practical scenarios
