toward the estimation of the absolute quality of individual protein_structure models_motivation quality_assessment of protein_structures is an important part of experimental structure validation and plays_a in protein_structure where the predicted models may contain substantial errors most current scoring_functions are primarily designed to rank alternative_models of the same sequence supporting model_selection whereas the prediction of the absolute quality of an individual protein model has received_little in the field however reliable absolute quality estimates are crucial to assess the suitability of a model for specific biomedical_applications results in this work we present a new absolute measure for the quality of protein models which provides an estimate of the degree of nativeness of the structural_features observed in a model and describes the likelihood that a given model is of comparable quality to experimental_structures model quality estimates based on the qmean scoring_function were normalized with respect to the number of interactions the resulting scoring_function is independent of the size of the protein and may therefore be used to assess both monomers and entire oligomeric assemblies model quality_scores for individual models are then expressed as z scores in comparison to scores obtained for high_resolution we demonstrate the ability of the newly_introduced qmean z_score to detect experimentally solved_protein containing significant errors as well as to evaluate theoretical protein models in a comprehensive qmean z_score analysis of all experimental_structures in the pdb membrane_proteins accumulate on one side of the score spectrum and thermostable proteins on the other proteins from the thermophilic organism thermatoga maritima received significantly_higher qmean z scores in a pairwise_comparison with their homologous mesophilic counterparts underlining the significance of the qmean z_score as an estimate of protein_stability availability the z_score calculation has been integrated in the qmean server available at http swissmodel expasy org qmean in homology_modelling the quality of a model is largely dictated by the evolutionary distance of the protein of interest target to whom correspondence should be addressed to the available template structures the sensitivity of tools for detecting remote homologues with very low sequence_identity has increased_significantly in recent_years due to the development of sophisticated algorithms and growth in sequence_databases however with decreasing sequence_similarity an increasing amount of structural divergence is observed and the resulting models may contain significant inaccuracies especially models_built on distant templates typical sources of errors range from misplaced side_chains incorrect loop conformations backbone distortions alignment errors to choice of a template with incorrect fold ultimately the accuracy of a protein model determines its suitability for biomedical_applications however at the time of modelling the quality of a model is unknown and has to be predicted as well for this purpose scoring_functions have been developed that evaluate different structural_features of protein models in order to generate a quality estimate most scoring_functions are primarily designed to rank alternative_models of the same protein_sequence however variability in model quality between different target_proteins is typically by far larger than the variability within the ensemble of models generated by different prediction_methods for a given protein therefore relative ranking of alternative_models for a given protein is insufficient for determining its usefulness for biomedical_applications such as drug_design mutagenesis experiments analysis of functional sites etc reliable absolute quality estimates are crucial for the scientist intending to use computational_models the prediction of absolute model quality has rarely been addressed in the literature the pioneering tool prosa has primarily been developed to evaluate experimental_structures and estimates the statistical_significance of a structure by comparing its knowledge based score to random structures with the same sequence the prosa z_score can hardly be used as a measure of absolute model quality as it is highly dependent on the protein size i e the energy_gap between the native_fold and random decoy structures increases with protein size apply support_vector to estimate the quality of models based on other modelling cases with similar properties selected from a large database of precompiled structure model pairs generated by thepage
