structural_bioinformatics a grid enabled web_portal for nmr_structure refinement with amber motivation the typical workflow for nmr_structure involves collecting thousands of conformational restraints calculating a bundle of conformers in agreement with them and refining the energetics of these conformers the structure calculation step employs simulated_annealing based on molecular_dynamics md_simulations with very simplified force_fields the value of refining the calculated conformers using restrained md rmd simulations with state of art force_fields is documented this refinement however presents various subtleties from the proper formatting of conformational restraints to the definition of suitable protocols results we describe a web_interface to set up and run calculations with the amber package which we called amps nmr amber based portal server for nmr structures the interface allows the refinement of nmr structures through rmd some predefined protocols are provided for this purpose which can be personalized it is also possible to create an entirely new protocol amps nmr can handle various restraint types standard rmd refinement in explicit water of the structures of three different proteins are shown as examples amps nmr additionally includes a workspace for the user to store different calculations as an ancillary service a web_interface to antechamber is available enabling the calculation of force_field for organic_molecules such as ligands in proteinligand adducts availability_and amps nmr is embedded within the nmr services of the wenmr project and is available at http py enmr cerm unifi it access index amps nmr its use requires registration with a digital certificate since the s nmr_spectroscopy has been used as a technique complementary to x_ray to determine the solution structure of proteins indeed nmr has to whom correspondence should be addressed contributed of the total content of protein_structures in the pdb a share that has remained relatively steady in the last few years the usefulness of applying nmr as a tool complementary to x_ray in protein structure_determination efforts has been_extensively in the context of structural_genomics initiatives a unique aspect of nmr_data is their capability to provide a view of protein structural_features that includes unfolded_proteins and the residuespecific characterization of disordered protein segments including functionally_important flexible surface loops standard protocols to determine protein_structures by nmr involve three basic steps i determining the chemical_shift assignments of the target protein ii measuring as many as possible intra and particularly inter residue noes nuclear overhauser enhancements among h nuclei to generate protonproton distance_restraints typically in the form of upper distance bounds and iii using the noe derived restraints to perform simulated_annealing calculations providing the d structure of the protein additional restraints can be used such as dihedral_angle restraints which often are derived from j couplings or from chemical_shifts residual_dipolar rdcs and paramagnetism based restraints more recently alternative protocols that are based on the use of chemical_shift data or chemical_shift and rdcs without any noe information have been described however the adoption of these innovative protocols by the nmr community is still limited within standard protocols an additional step that may have a dramatic impact on the quality of the final nmr_structure is structure refinement which typically involves the application of molecular_dynamics md_simulations using a force_field more accurate than that employed to generate the structural_models to be refined indeed it has long been realized that due to the sparseness of nmr restraints the force_field used for refinement can have a large impact on the quality and possibly the accuracy of nmr structures refinement of protein_structures using state of the art force_fields in md calculations with explicit solvent_molecules can afford a significant_improvement of various stereochemical parameters that are often used as indicators of structural quality and can also have a positive impact on the accuracy of the structure as measured from the agreement with the nmr constraints
