msa pad dna multiple_sequence framework based on pfam accessed domain information here we present the msa pad application a dna multiple_sequence framework that uses pfam protein domain information to align dna sequences_encoding either single or multiple protein_domains msa pad has two alignment options gene and genome mode availability_and msa pad is available as a web_application https recasgate way ba infn it and as two taverna workflows corresponding to two alignment modes gene modemultiple sequence_alignment msa is one of the oldest problems in bioinformatics and represents a key_step in sequence_analysis applications such as phylogenetic_inference and comparative_genomics algorithms such as translatorx and tranalign emboss taking_advantage of the higher conservation of proteins than their respective coding_sequences use the protein alignment to guide the reconstruction of accurate msas at nucleotide level however these methods do not make use of information embedded in protein_domains moreover when applied to genomic_sequences such approaches account neither for intron occurrence nor for gene_order variations e g mitochondrial_genomes donorio resulting in apparently truncated protein_domains or variations in their arrangement along the genome_regions under investigation here we present a dna msa framework msa pad which conceptually translates dna_sequences into amino_acids based on user_defined genetic_code and reading_frame s uses information from conserved pfam domains to assign the translated sequences to known protein_domains accounts for frameshifts when domain regions are split by introns performs a domain based protein alignment and then uses protein alignment information to generate the relevant nucleotide multiple_alignment the final msa can be generated following two different strategies i gene and ii genome mode gene mode alignment respects domain order organization from to and resolves the alignment of repetitive domains even when they are repeated in tandem genome mode alignment provides a super gene like alignment ignoring domain order constraints we evaluated the ability of msa pad to assign sequence_fragments to the correct domain block the alignment within blocks was not assessed given that it is entirely determined by the hmmalign algorithm the case studies consisted of mitochondrial_genomes exhibiting either conserved or varied gene_order genes containing introns sequences_encoding repeated domains genes demonstrating intron loss gain and orfs encoding single protein_domains we evaluated msa pad for protein sequence_identity compared with the reference protein_sequence assignment to the correct pfam_domain the order of domain blocks mergedwith particular reference to repeated domains in gene mode and the uniqueness of these domains in genome mode our results show that msapad correctly translated dna_sequences assigned them to the right pfam domains no false_positive assignments and assembled them as expected in both gene and genome modes supplementary the unique feature of msa pad compared to other methods e g translatorx tranalign is that it is able to automatically generate an accurate msa even where frameshifts or introns are present in the input_sequences furthermore it is able to generate a supergene like alignment when input_sequences contain multiple genes e g complete_mitochondrial sequences however msa pad may have some limitations when no pfam_domain match is found for the input_sequences or when a matched domain fragment is too short e g in the case of a short exon to produce a significant alignment score
