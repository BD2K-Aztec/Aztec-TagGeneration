sequence_analysis a multiobjective method for robust identification of bacterial small_non motivation small_non srnas have major roles in the post_transcriptional in prokaryotes the experimental_validation of a relatively small number of srnas in few species requires developing computational algorithms capable of robustly encoding the available knowledge and using this knowledge to predict srnas within and across species results we present a novel methodology designed to identify bacterial srnas by incorporating the knowledge encoded by different srna prediction_methods and optimally aggregating them as potential pre dictors because some of these methods emphasize specificity whereas others emphasize sensitivity while detecting srnas their optimal aggregation constitutes trade_off solutions between these two contradictory objectives that enhance their individual merits many non redundant optimal aggregations uncovered by using multiobjec tive optimization techniques are then combined into a multiclassifier which ensures robustness during detection and prediction even in gen omes with distinct nucleotide_composition by training with srnas in salmonella_enterica typhimurium we were able to successfully predict srnas in sinorhizobium_meliloti as well as in multiple and poorly_annotated species the proposed methodology like a meta_analysis approach may begin to lay a possible foundation for developing robust predictive methods across a wide_spectrum of genomic variability availability_and scripts created for the experimentation are available atsmall non_coding srnas have major roles in the bacterial post_transcriptional affecting important_cellular such as cell_division and response to environmental_stimuli among others experimental methods including nextgeneration_sequencing are critical for the functional characterization of srnas however the experimental_verification of a relatively small number of srnas primarily in escherichia_coli k and salmonella_enterica lt slt is not sufficient to help detect them in the large list of available sequenced_genomes therefore there is a requirement of developing computational algorithms capable of robustly encoding the knowledge of known srnas available in certain genomes and using this knowledge to predict srnas in other species the computational_identification of non_coding ncrnas which includes srnas ribosomal_rnas rrnas and transfer rnas trnas is constrained by their diversity in terms of structures sequences and functions structures of ncrnas are often scored based on thermodynamic_stability conservation and or covariance of sequence_alignments sequences of ncrnas are primarily analyzed by using two strategies ab_initio which scrutinizes a single query_sequence e g zmfold vsfold and comparative e g qrna alifoldz dynalign msari and rnaz where the query_sequence is investigated by its similarity to other aligned sequences the latter strategy requires methods for accessing databases as well as heuristics to efficiently evaluate similarity among sequences both strategies require classifiers e g support_vector or customized hidden_markov to predict new ncrnas based on the acquired_knowledge in the training phase remarkably most of the training_sets currently used to predict srnas are composed of positive examples of rrnas and trnas which are easier to identify than srnas because of their longer_sequences and well defined structure although several methods have been developed and represent a step_forward in the computational detection of srnas their success is limited because of i the excessive emphasis on specificity which generates a high number of false_negative predictions by targeting few well known srna families corresponding only to a small percentage of the available srnas ii the use of genomic_features e g motifs of terminators rna_polymerase that are only conserved in closely_related organisms e g e coli and salmonella the emphasis on sensitivity to detect novel findings by thermodynamical approaches where several examples shown in bacterial_genomes harbor well defined secondary_structures and high thermodynamical stability but do not correspond to true srna sequences i e predicted false_positive combining pairs of these methods partially overcome_these del for example we previously combined qrna and rnaz to identify srnas in sinorhizobium_meliloti however the significant reduction in the number of false_positive leads to very low sensitivity del the performance of a classifier or prediction method may be improved when combining different methods and thus suggests a path to improve bacterial srna prediction through metaanalyses of results from existing_tools therefore here we propose a new methodology which performs optimal aggregations of existing methodstermed basic methodsto predict srnas by using machine_learning and optimization techniques this strategy minimizes the false_positive during detection and prediction and simultaneously maximizes the number of srna identified independently of the evaluated genome we trained our methodology using the slt genome which is the gammaproteobacteria model_organism harboring the highest number of experimentally_validated srnas the resulting strategy was later successfully_applied to predict srnas in s meliloti a distant alphaproteobacteria of a great agricultural importance that has not been used in the training_set and has numerous annotated srnas finally the strategy was tested in a multispecies dataset the performance achieved by our methodology when compared with that of the basic or pairwise combinations of methods demonstrated that the proposed methodology is accurate and robust to detect srnas even in distantly_related note that our approach does not invalidate methods developed de_novo but complements them by providing an efficient way of combining their most reliable features and thus extracts the maximum benefits from each method our approach might bring some light into the development of robust predictive methods across a wide_spectrum of genomic variability the use of next generation technologies such as rna_seq demonstrated that the number and diversity of srnas is greater than was originally expected therefore there is increased interest in identifying srnas and deciphering their role in regulatory_systems within a particular species or across multiple species these experimental methods are critical for functional characterization of srnas however their applicability still has been constrained to a relatively small number of srnas as well as genomes consequently computational_prediction of srnas is required to develop new hypothesis that allows focusing the experimental_verification on particular targets to provide_clues about the molecular_mechanisms gene_regulation different strategies have been implemented using distinct computational_methods to predict srnas however most of them exhibit similar limitations essentially there is a trend in these computational_methods to favor either sp or sn but not both in their predictions and that in turn generates either a high number of false_positive or false_negative predictions this is true even if some methods combine in one predictor different srna features and or genomic_information in this work we presented a new methodology which identifies bacterial srnas by simultaneously minimizing the false_positive sp and maximizing the number of recognized srnas sn this method isable to predict srnas in different genomes even when there is a lack of reliable annotations because it does not rely on additional genomic_features several characteristics distinguish our methodology from other methods the proposed approach uses the distinctive_features of different methodstermed basic methodsinstead of developing a new method de_novo and combines them in a manner that resolves the problem of contradictory knowledge and thus improving their predictive_power to do that our methodology combines the predictions of the basic methods by using typical set theory operations such as the union and or intersection likewise in logic expressions the systematic application of these operations produces chained and disparate aggregations of methods because not all aggregations may perform better than an individual method del and large aggregations including all methods may also produce overfitting our methodology selects optimal aggregations as a trade_off between sp and sn by using multiobjective optimization heuristic techniques particularly we used the genetic_algorithms nsga ii the efficient heuristics used by our methodology avoids intractable processing_times which are common in combinatorial_optimization de this process results in non redundant optimal aggregations where the balance between the two contradictory objectives also prevents overfitting this approach substantially improves both sp and sn over that of previous single aggregation of two predefined methods we applied our methodology to a dataset of experimentally_validated srnas in slt the results are significantly better than those results from the basic methods alone tables and in training or test datasets supplementaryand supplementary tables s s remarkably the sp and sn scores are similar between both training and test_sets and even within the training test fold partitions performed in the crossvalidation these results strongly suggest that the method is robust for predicting srnas despite the possible sample variability to effectively confirm these findings we tested the predictive_power of the method in two datasets that were not used in the training_process the s meliloti and the multispecies datasets despite the different nucleotide_composition of these genomes see gc_content supplementary our methodology obtained good sp and sn scores finally our proposed method obtained better sn scores than sipht a widely used method that uses specific genomic_information about binding_sites and terminators unlike our method that uses general_characteristics of srnas sipht uses particular genomic_features therefore the database of negative_examples based on shuffled sequences cannot be fairly used to estimate comparable sps for both methods it would be interesting to derive negative_examples acceptable to both methods to better compare their power in sum our approach has demonstrated to encode a successful and robust methodology to predict srnas even in poorly_annotated genomes moreover we have shown that appropriately combining results from existing_methods in a meta_analysis like approach may significantly improve their accuracy and facilitates the generation of new predictors by simply using different training_datasets and or aggregating new basic methods
