systems_biology measuring the physical cohesiveness of proteins using physical_interaction enrichment motivation proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks are a valuable resource for the interpretation of genomics data however such networks have interaction enrichment biases for proteins that are often studied these biases skew quantitative results from comparing ppi_networks with genomics data here we introduce an approach named physical_interaction enrichment pie to eliminate these biases methodology pie employs a normalization that ensures equal node degree edge distribution of a test_set and of the random networks it is compared with it quantifies whether a set of proteins have more interactions between themselves than proteins in random networks and can therewith be regarded as physically cohesive results among other datasets we applied pie to genetic morbid disease gmd genes and to genes whose expression is induced upon infection with human_metapneumovirus hmpv both sets contain proteins that are often studied and that have relatively many interactions in the ppi_network although interactions between proteins of both sets are found to be overrepresented in ppi_networks the gmd proteins are not more likely to interact with each other than random proteins when this overrepresentation is taken into account in contrast the hmpv induced genes representing a biologically more coherent set encode_proteins that do tend to interact with each other and can be used to predict new hmpv induced genes by handling biases in ppi_networks pie can be a valuable_tool to quantify the degree to which a set of genes are involved in the same biological_process contactphysical interactions between proteins explain how proteins function together in protein_complexes or functional_modules discovery of all proteinprotein_interactions ppis has therefore been a priority in systems_biology and there have been several efforts to elucidate ppis both in low and in high_throughput platforms as well as to whom correspondence should be addressed by evolutionary inference the resulting ppi_networks are invaluable for the interpretation of other genomics data in a number of studies specific emphasis has been placed on quantifying aspects of network_topology to identify proteins that are specifically relevant to a biological_process or for evolution for instance wachi and coworkers identified a high network centrality for genes that are upregulated during lung_cancer as a distinguishing topological feature to enable placement of cancer_genes into the global and systematic context of the cell in a similar study essential genes in yeast have been found to be well connected and globally centered in the ppi_network notwithstanding the success of such approaches there are some experimental biases in the determination of ppis for instance the yeast hybrid y h approach is known to detect interactions among proteins that may not be likely because the proteins naturally do not occur in the same subcellular compartment von tandem_affinity followed by mass_spectrometry is known to favor highly abundant proteins in addition evolutionary inference of ppis as interologs has placed highly_conserved proteins as hubs in general ppi_networks even manual_curation of ppis in scientific_literature has caveats one main caveat being that the discovery of such interactions is driven by existing knowledge and hypotheses the latter has led to an overrepresentation of interactions between proteins encoded by disease genes in the human protein reference_database hprd several measures have been developed to improve the reliability of ppi_networks like the integration of general ppi_networks with networks based on other data although such comparative genomic_approaches increase the reliability of the ppi_network they do not specifically remove systematic_biases like the overrepresentation of well studied proteins from general ppi_networks this is of pertinent concern because function information derived from such networks would be skewed towards well studied genes that are often evolutionarily_conserved nodes immune_related nodes or disease associated nodes in ppi_networks moreover such biases can cloud quantitative assessments of whether a set of proteins of interest tend to interact with each other and are therewith physically cohesive for example when genes that are upregulated under a specific condition encode_proteins that physically interact with each other this can be because they truly interact more within order to explore ppis in a quantitative_manner we have developed a method called pie to circumvent interaction enrichment biases in context specific networks derived from general ppi_networks pie employs a randomization procedure that appropriately considers the global degrees in a general ppi_network of the extant nodes in a context specific test network prior to assigning physical cohesiveness to the test network we have focused on the context of disease and immunity because many proteins have been studied in this area we observe that there are significantly p more interactions for proteins of morbid disease genes and hmpv induced genes than random expectation in general ppi_networks this observed enrichment for ppi of morbid disease genes and hmpv induced genes is in agreement with other page
