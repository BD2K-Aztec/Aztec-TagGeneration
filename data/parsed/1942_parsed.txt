sequence_analysis gcup rapid gpu based hiv co receptor usage prediction for next_generation next_generation ngs has a large potential in hiv diagnostics and genotypic prediction_models have been developed and successfully tested in the recent_years however albeit being highly_accurate these computational_models lack computational_efficiency to reach their full potential in this study we demonstrate the use of graphics_processing gpus in combination with a computational_prediction model for hiv tropism our new model named gcup parallelized and optimized for gpu is highly_accurate and can classify sequences per second on an nvidia geforce gtx the computational_efficiency of our new model is the next step to enable ngs_technologies to reach clinical_significance in hiv diagnostics moreover our approach is not limited to hiv tropism prediction but can also be easily adapted to other settings e g drug_resistance prediction availability_and the source_code can be down loaded at http www heiderlab de contactnext generation sequencing ngs_technologies are currently moving into the field of clinical_diagnostics as such enabling the clinicians to analyze not only the majority variants in hiv quasispecies but also smaller fractions and minority variants this is especially important for hiv drug_resistance prediction as small fractions of resistant_variants can rise during antiviral_treatment and can lead to failure of antiviral_therapy an example for such a therapy_failure due to minority variants can be found in we analyzed ngs_data from four different patients during treatment with an ccr antagonist these drugs bind specifically to the ccr co receptor on the host_cells and by this prevent viral_entry however there exist two classes of hiv viruses the ccr using viruses and the cxcr using viruses obviously these ccr antagonists have no effect on the latter ones the binding of hiv to the co receptor is mainly mediated by the so_called v loop which is part of the surface protein gp of hiv there exist some computational_models for hiv tropism prediction e g and geno pheno these models make their predictions based on genotypic information of hiv namely the sequence of the v loop albeit these computational_models have been demonstrated to give reliable results on ngs they all lack computational_efficiency with regard to computing time which is the main bottleneck to clinical_relevance of these technologies nextgeneration_sequencing can generate up to billions of reads for a given sample for instance with technology one can generate around million_reads while with the use of the illumina technology one can generate up to billion reads with this large number of reads minority variants can be reliably detected however the huge amount of data generated needs to be efficiently analyzed in a reasonable period for instance tcup albeit highly_accurate needs around days on a single_cpu for million_reads from a roche gs flx sequencing run in this study we introduce and benchmark our new computional prediction model named gcup this model is based on our recently_developed method t cup but was redeveloped parallelized and optimized for the use on graphics_processing gpus in we demonstrate the accuracy of our t cup model for the prediction of hiv tropism compared with other available models on an independent dataset t cup outperformed geno pheno as well as the model of gcup and t cup give identical predictions and thus the accuracy of the model is not compromised by using gpus by harvesting the power of gpus and optimizing the use of their fast local memory gcup can drastically reduce the runtime and process the same million_reads in just min using one modern gpu
