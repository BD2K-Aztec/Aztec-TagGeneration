structural_bioinformatics as east a functional_annotation tool for putative proteins encoded by alternatively_spliced alternative_splicing effects assessment_tools as east is an online tool for the functional_annotation of putative proteins encoded by transcripts generated_by as when provided with a transcript_sequence as east identifies regions altered by as events in the putative protein_sequence encoded by the transcript users can evaluate the predicted function of the putative protein by inspecting whether functional_domains are included in the altered regions moreover users can infer the loss of inter molecular_interactions in the protein network according to whether the as events affect interaction residues observed in the d structure of the reference isoform the information obtained from as east will help to design experimental analyses for the functional significance of novel splice_isoforms availability the online tool is freely_available as alps in higher_eukaryotes genes often produce alternatively_spliced as transcripts many as events have been actively detected with high_throughput experimental methods such as rna_seq and microarrays however the functions of putative proteins encoded by as transcripts termed as isoforms have not been experimentally analyzed in many cases functional_annotation tools for transcripts with novel patterns of splicing are desirable to infer the functional significance of as isoforms there are few tools for analyzing as isoforms translated from novel transcripts queried by users altanalyze http www altanalyze org identifies as events using rna_seq or microarray_data and shows how these events may affect domain_composition however it does not provide information on the effects of as on the d structures of as isoforms maistas assesses whether user queried as isoforms are structurally plausible proteins but explicit functional_annotations are not provided previously we developed a pipeline that detects regions altered by as events termed as regions in as isoforms using genome_sequences and full_length transcript data the pipeline then evaluates the impact of as events on the to whom correspondence should be addressed interactions between the as isoforms and other molecules by identifying interaction residues from d structure data of relevant molecular complexes all of the data derived from the pipeline are provided in the as alps database in this article we describe as east that annotates and analyzes user uploaded transcript sequences using as alps as east determines whether the transcript encodes a novel as isoform and annotates such functional sites in the as isoform as residues interacting with other molecules we provide an example as east predicts that a novel as isoform of mitogen_activated mapk in human skeletal_muscle inhibits the signaling_pathway by removing residues that interact with atp and substrate proteins
