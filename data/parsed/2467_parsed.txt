genetics_and inferring the paths of somatic evolution in cancer motivation cancer cell genomes acquire several genetic_alterations during somatic evolution from a normal cell_type the relative order in which these mutations accumulate and contribute to cell fitness is affected by epistatic_interactions inferring their evolutionary_history is challenging because of the large number of mutations acquired by cancer_cells as well as the presence of unknown epistatic_interactions results we developed bayesian mutation landscape bml a prob abilistic approach for reconstructing ancestral genotypes from tumor_samples for much larger sets of genes than previously feasible bml infers the likely sequence of mutation_accumulation for any set of genes that is recurrently mutated in tumor_samples when applied to tumor_samples from colorectal glioblastoma lung and ovarian_cancer patients bml identifies the diverse evolutionary_scenarios involved in tumor_initiation in greater detail but broadly in agreement with prior results availability_and source_code and all datasets are freely_available attumor samples from cancer patients show a large variety of genetic_abnormalities that have accumulated during somatic evolution from a normal cell state somatic_mutations are continuously acquired in individual cells but depending on among other things the fitness of the resultant genotype only a small fraction may reach fixation within a cell_population fitness change induced by a mutation can in turn depend on the genetic_background a phenomenon known as epistasis epistasis has been known to play_an in molecular_evolution and can constrain the sequence of mutation_accumulation the fitness_function or landscape over the space of all genotypes depends both on the magnitude and sign of the epistatic_interactions therefore genotypes observed in tumor_samples are likely the result of a diverse set of mutational paths evolving across a complex fitness_landscape patterns of somatic_mutations observed in tumor_samples contain information both about the evolutionary paths of cancer_progression and the epistatic gene interactions that influence them however extracting this evolutionary_information is challenging because the fitness_landscapes are unknown and analyzing large_datasets with hundreds of recurrently mutated genes is computationally_demanding owing to these difficulties existing computational_methods for cancer_progression either constrain the set of possible evolutionary_scenarios or are feasible for relatively small sets of genes bml analysis for each dataset was accompanied with parametric bootstrap replicates to assess the robustness of the inferred bayesian_network shows the highest probability genotypes and the most likely paths of progression for each dataset note that the trees shown inare not the same as the full bifurcating tree used by the algorithm but only the high_probability genotypes traversed by tumor_samples see section modeling the evolutionary_events leading to cancer and characterizing the fitness_landscape of cancer_cells promises innovative applications in clinical_cancer bml allows the reconstruction of likely ancestral genotypes and the paths of mutation_accumulation in greater detail than existing_methods bml accomplishes these tasks owing to several algorithmic improvements that take into account the unobserved precancer genotypes that provide a systematic_bias to epp reconstruction as well as the effects of unknown epistatic_interactions we should emphasize that the goal of bml is not to classify somatic_mutations as drivers or passengers rather bml recapitulates the likely sequence of somatic mutation_accumulation in recurrently mutated genes it should also be noted that the bifurcating tree used by bml is simply an efficient data_structure to represent paths and does not necessarily imply a hierarchical ordering of mutations this distinction is important because somatic evolution occurred independently in each cancer patient and different tumor_samples do not have a shared evolutionary_history even though the genotypes at the internal nodes of the bifurcating tree allow us to correct for the systematic_bias due to unobserved precancer genotypes the estimated evolutionary probabilities are still only an approximation of the true distribution however since the estimated p are computed after taking_into the inferred precancer genotypes they also incorporate the evolutionary aspect of the true evolutionary probabilities there are some obvious limitations of bml analysis because it does not include copy_number and genomic_rearrangements that likely provide alternative paths for tumor_initiation another source of complexity is the existence of genetic_heterogeneity within individual tumor_samples nik zainalshows the sum of the two single mutated states mutations in these genes show a tendency to co occur suggesting that the departures from additivity are due to positive epistasis furthermore a clear sequence of genetic_events can be inferred along the red box plots suggesting the presence of a fitness valley along one blue single mutant of two possible paths to reach the double_mutant genotype the case of tp ttn genotype in ovarian_cancer shows how ttn mutations despite their recurrence rarely initiate tumor_progression bd simulation based parametric bootstrap for each of the datasets blue box plots in b and curves in c and d show the results for the bml model that uses inferred ancestral information whereas the results for standard bayesian_network learning algorithm are in red the box plots in b show p g for single mutated states for frequently mutated genes these genes were selected based on an ordering that the algorithm automatically assigns to the genes section vertical axes in c and d represent the percentages of bootstrap confidence whereas the horizontal axes represent the number of edges in the inferred networks that were false and true_positives respectively as well as the role of tumor_microenvironment during cancer_progression bml ignores the possible cooperative interactions between subclonal cell_populations within a tumor and between tumor and surrounding stromal_cells these are all important avenues that are left for further exploration aside from these limitations an extensive bootstrap analysis demonstrates that bml estimates of p are accurate and robust simulations and d also show that bml identifies epistatic_interactions with greater_accuracy than a naive network_reconstruction algorithm at the same time bml is scalable for application to some of the largest available cancer datasets therefore bml is an efficient and powerful_tool that brings us a step closer to understanding the evolution of the cancer genome
