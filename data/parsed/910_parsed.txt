cellprofiler analyst interactive data exploration analysis and classification of large biological image sets cellprofiler analyst allows the exploration and visualization of image_based data together with the classification of complex biological phenotypes via an interactive user_interface designed for biologists and data scientists cellprofiler analyst completely rewritten in python builds on these features and adds enhanced supervised machine_learning capabilities classifier as well as visualization_tools to overview an experiment plate viewer and image gallery availability_and cellprofiler analyst is free_and available atcellprofiler analyst is open_source for biological imagebased classification data exploration and visualization with an interactive user_interface designed for biologists and data scientists using data from feature_extraction software such as cellprofiler cellprofiler analyst offers easy to use tools for exploration and mining of image data which is being generated in ever increasing amounts particularly in high content screens hcs its tools can help identify complex and subtle phenotypes improve quality_control and provide single_cell and population level information from experiments some distinctive and critical features of cellprofiler analyst are its user_friendly object based machine_learning interface its ability to handle the tremendous scale of hcs experiments millions of cell images its gating capabilities that allow observing relationships among different data displays and its exploration tools which enable interactively viewing connections between cell level data and well level data and among raw images processed segmented images extracted_features and sample metadata compared to other commonly cited open_source biological image classification software like ilastik cellcognition and wnd charm cellprofiler analyst has the advantage of containing companion visualization_tools being suitable for high_throughput datasets having multiple classifier options and allowing both cell and fieldof view classification advanced cell classifier shares many of the classification features of cellprofiler analyst but it lacks hcs data exploration and visualization_tools compared to command_line based data exploration software like cellhts and imagehts and v c the author published_by
