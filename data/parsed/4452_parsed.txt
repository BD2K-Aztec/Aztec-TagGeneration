structure based prediction of dna_binding by structural_alignment and a volume_fraction corrected dfire based energy function motivation template based prediction of dna_binding requires not only structural_similarity between target and template structures but also prediction of binding_affinity between the target and dna to ensure binding here we propose to predict protein dna binding_affinity by introducing a new volume_fraction correction to a statistical energy function based on a distance scaled finite ideal gas reference dfire state results we showed that this energy function together with the structural_alignment program tm_align achieves the matthews correlation_coefficient mcc of with an accuracy of a precision of and a sensitivity of for predicting dna_binding in a benchmark of dna_binding and non binding_proteins the mcc value is substantially_higher than the best mcc value of given by previous methods application of this method to structural_genomics targets uncovered as dna_binding of which are putatively dna_binding and only protein whose annotated functions do not contain dna_binding while the remaining proteins have unknown function the method provides a highly_accurate and sensitive technique for structure based prediction of dna_binding availability the method is implemented as a part of the structure based function prediction on line tools spot dna_binding are proteins that make specific binding to either single or double_stranded they play_an in transcription_regulation replication packaging repair and rearrangement with completion of many genome_projects and many more in progress more and more proteins are discovered with unknown function the structures for some of those function unknown_proteins are solved because of structural_genomics functional_annotations of these proteins are particularly challenging because the goal of structural_genomics is to cover the sequence_space of proteins so that homology_modeling becomes a reliable tool for structure_prediction of any proteins and thus many targets in structural_genomics have low sequence_identity to the proteins with known function therefore it is necessary to develop computational_tools that utilize not only sequence but also structural_information for function prediction many methods have been developed for structure based prediction of dna_binding these include function prediction through homology and structural comparisons others explore sequence and structural_features of dna_binding and non binding_proteins with sophisticated machine_learning such as neural_network logistic_regression and support_vector recently proposed a new twostep approach called dbd hunter for structure based prediction of dna_binding in dbd hunter the structure of a target protein is first structurally aligned to known proteindna complexes and the aligned complex structures are used to build the complex structures between dna and the target protein the predicted complex structures are then employed for judging dna_binding or not by structural similarity_scores tm_score and predicted proteindna binding_affinities tm_align and a contact based statistical energy function are employed in the first and second steps of dbd hunter respectively dbd hunter is found to substantially_improve over the methods based on sequence comparison only psi_blast structural_alignment only tm_align and a logistic_regression technique in this study we investigate if one can further improve the prediction of dna_binding by employing a different statistical energy function for predicting binding_affinity our knowledge based energy function is distance_dependent and built on a distance scaled finite ideal gas reference dfire state originallypage we have developed a highly_accurate method ddna o to predict dna_binding this is accomplished by developing a new statistical energy function for predicting dna_binding we found that introducing an atom_type dependent volume_fraction correction and dna mutation in the dfire statistical energy function leads to a significant_improvement in the performance in predicting dna_binding mcc for db nb by ddna o this is a significant_improvement from mcc of given by optimized dbd hunter application of ddna oto structural genome targets confirms the accuracy of the proposed method with potentially correct prediction of dna_binding annotated as putative dna_binding potentially false_positives function annotated but not dna_binding and the rest unknown for ddna the effect of dna mutation is small for improving the mcc value of the training_set from to but is significant for improving the sensitivity from to of the apo test_set we further find that the mutation leads to no significant_improvement in sequence_identity between template dna_sequence and wild_type dna_sequence the sequence_identities to wild_type dna_sequences before and after mutation are both close to the random value of one possible reason is the absence of structural refinement for protein during page
