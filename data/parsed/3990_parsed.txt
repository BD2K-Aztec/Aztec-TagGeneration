data_and retro concept based clustering of biomedical topical sets motivation clustering_methods can be useful for automatically grouping documents into meaningful clusters improving human comprehension of a document collection although there are clustering_algorithms that can achieve the goal for relatively large document collections they do not always work well for small and homogenous datasets methods in this article we present retroa novel clustering_algorithm that extracts meaningful clusters along with concise and descriptive titles from small and homogenous document collections unlike common clustering_approaches our algorithm predicts cluster titles before clustering it relies on the hypergeometric_distribution model to discover key phrases and generates candidate clusters by assigning documents to these phrases further the statistical_significance of candidate clusters is tested using supervised_learning methods and a multiple_testing technique is used to control the overall quality of clustering results we test our system on five disease datasets from omim v r and evaluate the results based on mesh v r term assignments we further compare our method with several baseline and state of the art methods including k means expectation_maximization latent_dirichlet based clustering lingo optimsrc and adapted gk means the experimental_results on the newsgroup and odp collections demonstrate that our method is successful at extracting significant clusters and is superior to existing_methods in terms of quality of clusters finally we apply our system to a collection of topical sets from the homologene v r database a resource in pubmed v r empirical evaluation confirms the method is useful for small homogenous datasets in producing meaningful clusters with descriptive titles availability_and a web_based demonstration of the algorithm applied to a collection of sets from the homologene database is available at http www ncbi nlm nih gov cbbresearch wilbur iret clustering homologene index html text clustering_algorithms group a set of documents into meaningful clusters and can be useful in many settings although a vast collection of clustering_methods exists most of them work best for relatively large sets of documents however we frequently encounter topics that are discussed in a limited number of documents one such example is ncbis homologene resource available through pubmed http www ncbi nlm nih gov homologene which is a system for automated_detection of homologs among the annotated_genes of several completely_sequenced eukaryotic_genomes the resource provides the list of articles associated with every entry and most of these sets are small and homogenous when applied to such document collections traditional clustering_approaches often fail to produce useful results suggesting that more sensitive methods are needed for the task there are two ways to fail at clustering small document collections first the algorithm could place all documents in a single cluster a second way in which an algorithm may fail is to produce weak clusters that represent noise for example many clustering_algorithms produce different results depending on the cluster initialization which suggests some of the clusters are unstable or weak the more homogenous the data the more severe both of these problems are another issue that motivated this research is that most existing algorithms produce clusters that are not self descriptive and one has to further sort through the documents to decipher the subject of the cluster however presenting visual_cues such as cluster titles can significantly improve the user perception of clustering_results we emphasize the importance of cluster titles and provide clusters along with meaningful titles in this article we develop a robust clustering_algorithm that addresses these issues and produces meaningful clusters along with concise and descriptive titles for small document collections our algorithm which we named retro predicts cluster titles prior to clustering it first identifies central phrases using p values based on a hypergeometric_test each such phrase is then evaluated as a potential cluster title using supervised_learning techniques the evaluation hinges on the hypothesis that a phrase represents a useful cluster title if it has discriminative_power thus a cluster is formed around the phrase by collecting the documents that contain that phrase in the title and is enriched with documents that are closely_related to those then a machine_learning is used to measure how strongly that cluster stands out from the rest of the documents in the set clusters are then sorted based on that measure and a multiple_testing technique is used to control the number of top scoring clusters to retain document titles in the resultant clusters are then used to extend the initial phrase into a more descriptive cluster title our approach can be characterized as a soft clustering_algorithm which allows a document to be to whom correspondence should be addressed assigned into more than one cluster and does not force every document into a cluster it produces a flat structure works on homogenous datasets and does not require any initialization or control parameters except for a desired confidence_level of the output for multiple_testing in section we review related literature section_describes in detail our clustering framework section_presents the datasets used for experiments and clustering_results in section we present an application of our system and also discuss our clustering approach and draw_conclusions we applied our algorithm to homologene a reference_database and a system for automated_detection of homologs among the annotated_genes of several completely_sequenced eukaryotic_genomes it provides information on genes proteins conserved domains and protein_alignments the resource also provides the list of articles associated with genes and sequences for every homology group automatically retrieved from pubmed the list of linked pubmed records is often relatively small in size compared with the datasets that are generally used for document clustering the homologene collection consists of gene records selected from the homologene resource of these sets contain documents contain documents and sets contain records with the largest set containing records tumor protein p the bar graph represents the average number of clusters in each bin and the line graph represents the total number of datasets in the bin overall we compute at least one cluster for of the homologene datasets on average we identify significant clusters for small sets containing or fewer documents that group constitutes over half of all datasets and thus is important the average size of clusters over the whole collection is documents per cluster and for the sets containing or fewer documents it is documents a few examples of small homologene datasets along with computed clusters are presented in supplementary appendix b in the supplementary_materials clustering_results of the full collection are made publicly_available at http www ncbi nlm nih gov iret homologene
