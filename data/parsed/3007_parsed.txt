data_and missforest non parametric missing_value for mixed_type data motivation modern data_acquisition based on high_throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing_data algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large_scale data often depend on a complete set missing_value offers a solution to this problem however the majority of available imputation_methods are restricted to one type of variable only continuous or categorical for mixed_type data the different types are usually handled separately therefore these methods ignore possible relations between variable types we propose a non parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously results we compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing_values we propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method missforest based on a random_forest by averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees random_forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple_imputation scheme using the built in out of bag error estimates of random_forest we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test_set evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing_values ranging from to we show that missforest can successfully handle missing_values particularly in datasets including different types of variables in our comparative_study missforest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non linear relations are suspected the out of bag imputation error estimates of missforest prove to be adequate in all settings additionally missforest exhibits attractive computational_efficiency and can cope with high_dimensional availability the r package missforest is freely_available fromimputation of missing_values is often a crucial step in data analysis many established methods of analysis require fully observed datasets without any missing_values however this is seldom the case in medical and biological_research today the ongoing to whom correspondence should be addressed development of new and enhanced measurement techniques in these fields provides data analysts with challenges prompted not only by high_dimensional multivariate_data where the number of variables may greatly exceed the number of observations but also by mixed data types where continuous and categorical_variables are present in our context categorical_variables can arise as any kind ranging from technical settings in a mass_spectrometer to a diagnostic expert_opinion on a disease_state additionally such datasets often contain complex interactions and non linear relation structures which are notoriously hard to capture with parametric procedures most prevalent imputation_methods like k nearest neighbours for continuous data saturated multinomial model for categorical_data and multivariate imputation by chained equations mice van buuren and for mixed data types depend on tuning parameters or specification of a parametric model the choice of such tuning parameters or models without prior_knowledge is difficult and might have a dramatic effect on a methods performance excluding mice the above methods and the majority of other imputation_methods are restricted to one type of variable furthermore all these methods make assumptions about the distribution of the data or subsets of the variables leading to questionable situations e g assuming normal_distributions the literature on mixed_type data imputation is rather scarce its first appearance was in the developing field of multiple_imputation brought up by little andpresented an approach based on maximum_likelihood combining the multivariate_normal model for continuous and the poisson multinomial model for categorical_data this idea was later on extended in the book of little and rubin see also rubin and schafer and schafer a more refined method to combine different regression_models for mixed_type data was proposed by van buuren and oudshoorn using chained equations the conditional model in mice can be specified for the missing_data in each incomplete variable therefore no multivariate_model covering the entire dataset has to be specified however it is assumed that such a full multivariate distribution exists and missing_values are sampled from conditional distributions based on this full distribution for more details see section another similar method using variable wise conditional distributions was proposed bycalled sequential regression multivariate imputation unlike in mice the predictors must not be incomplete the method is focussed on survey data and therefore includes strategies to incorporate restrictions onour new algorithm missforest allows for missing_value on basically any kind of data in particular it can handle multivariate_data consisting of continuous and categorical_variables simultaneously missforest has no need for tuning parameters nor does it require assumptions about distributional aspects of the data we show on several real_datasets coming from different biological and medical_fields that missforest outperforms established imputation_methods like k nearest neighbours imputation or multivariate imputation using chained equations using our oob imputation error estimates missforest offers a way to assess the quality of an imputation without the need of setting aside test data nor performing laborious cross_validations for subsequent analysis these error estimates represent a mean of informal reliability check for each variable the full potential of missforest is deployed when the data include complex interactions or non linear relations between variables of unequal scales and different type furthermore missforest can be applied to high_dimensional where the number of variables may greatly exceed the number of observations to a large extent and still provides excellent imputation results
