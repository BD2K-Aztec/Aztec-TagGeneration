gene_expression pathclass an r package for integration of pathway_knowledge into support_vector for biomarker_discovery prognostic and diagnostic biomarker_discovery is one of the key_issues for a successful stratification of patients according to clinical risk_factors for this purpose statistical classification methods such as support_vector svm are frequently used tools different groups have recently shown that the usage of prior_biological significantly_improves the classification results in terms of accuracy as well as reproducibility and interpretability of gene_lists here we introduce pathclass a collection of different svm based classification methods for improved gene_selection and classfication performance the methods contained in pathclass do not merely rely on gene_expression data but also exploit the information that is carried in gene network data availability pathclass is open_source and freely_available as an r package on the cran repository at http cran rmicroarray studies are commonly used in clinical_cancer to investigate molecular_profiles associated with tumor_development several thousand genes are measured to identify predictive or prognostic gene_signatures comprising only a couple of genes the goal is to use these gene_signatures for stratification of patients according to clinical relevant endpoints classification algorithms are frequently used to identify gene_signatures the support_vector svm is a well known example of such a classification algorithm several groups have proposed the so_called feature gene_selection methods for the svm since the algorithm does not offer an embedded feature_selection mechanism despite the identification of biomarkers the aim of feature_selection is to reduce the dimensionality of the feature_space in order to avoid the so_called curse of dimensionalty that is overfitting overfitting occurs when the number of features genes is large and the amount of samples i e patients is comparatively_small which is often the case when performing microarray_studies thus the algorithm can easily find a hyperplane that separates the training examples however the
