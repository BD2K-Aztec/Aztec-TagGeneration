genetics_and scphaser haplotype inference using single_cell determination of haplotypes is important for modelling the phenotypic consequences of genetic_variation in diploid organisms including cis regulatory_control and compound_heterozygosity we realized that single_cell scrna_seq data are well suited for phasing genetic_variants since both transcriptional bursts and technical bottlenecks cause pronounced allelic fluctuations in individual single cells here we present scphaser an r package that phases alleles at heterozygous variants to reconstruct haplotypes within transcribed regions of the genome using scrna_seq data the devised method efficiently and accurately reconstructed the known haplotype for of phasable genes in both human and mouse it also enables phasing of rare and de_novo variants and variants far apart within genes which is hard to attain with population_based computational inference availability_and scphaser is implemented as an r package tutorial and code are available at https the haplotype phase the sequence of alleles present on the same nucleic_acid molecule such as the maternal or paternal copy of a chromosome is of importance to reveal relationships between dna_sequence and phenotype major efforts have been made using expression_quantitative studies to identify cis_regulatory variants that affect_gene making use of allele_specific ase increases the power of such studies however to reach the full potential of ase based_approaches require or depend on phased alleles within genes phase_information is also important for associating clinical_outcomes to genetic_variation e g to identify cases of compound_heterozygosity where risk_alleles at different loci do not co occur on the same dna_molecule but affect both homologous copies of a gene we assessed the performance of scphaser on two full_length scrnaseq datasets where the phase was known the first dataset contained cells from a mouse f cross of two inbred_strains for which the genomes are known cast eij c bl j reciprocal cross and the second dataset contained single cells from the human individual na where the phase was inferred via transmission between the sequenced_genomes of the family trio all eight phasing approaches implemented in scphaser methods were assessed with respect to varying pre filtering settings and genotype_calling cutoffs for the two datasets supplementary a suitable trade_off between phasing accuracy and number of phasable genes at least two heterozygous variants left in a gene was obtained by pre filtering for at least five cells with imbalanced ase for a variant where imbalance should be at least fold fc or fc where fc alternative allele count reference allele count and there are at least three reads for any of the alleles in such a cell furthermore we set the default phasing arguments to cluster exhaustive input allele counts and weigh false since that combination performed the best on average across the two datasets with and correctly phased variants in the mouse and human dataset respectively at gene level and of phasable genes had all variants correctly phased originally there were and refseq genes with at least two heterozygous variants at the dna level and using the default pre filtering values and phasable genes remained in the mouse and human dataset respectively versus sequenced cells in a second human dataset containing single cells sequenced from a single individual we found that refseq genes were phasable out of refseq genes with at least two heterozygous variants the dependency of number of phasable genes with respect to number of sequenced cells degree of genome heterozygosity and sequencing_depth is shown in supplementary the run time on the human cell dataset using default_settings was seconds using cores and the computational_complexity with respect to the number of variants genes and cells are shown in supplementary we conclude that phasing by leveraging the imbalanced ase frequently observed in full_length scrna_seq data is both accurate and fast using rna instead of dna enables phasing of variants located far apart from each other within a gene due to introns as data from only a single individual is needed scphaser can also phase rare and de_novo variants the number of genes available for phasing depends on i the number of sequenced single cells ii cell_type as the number of expressed genes vary_considerably between cell_types iii the number of heterozygous variants in the individual where genetically distant parents yield higher heterozygosity iv sequencing_depth and v the efficiency of the full_length scrna_seq protocol the retrieved gene phase_information has important_applications in functional and clinical genomics such as empowering cis_regulatory variation studies and in elucidating the impact of haplotype structures on phenotypic outcome and response
