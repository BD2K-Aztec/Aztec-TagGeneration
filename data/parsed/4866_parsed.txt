visualcna a gui for interactive constraint network_analysis and protein_engineering for improving thermostability constraint network_analysis cna is a graph_theory based rigidity analysis approach for linking a biomolecules structure flexibility thermo stability and function results from cna are highly information rich and require intuitive synchronized and interactive_visualization for a comprehensive analysis we developed visualcna an easy to use pymol plug in that allows setup of cna runs and analysis of cna results linking plots with molecular_graphics representations from a practical viewpoint the most striking feature of visualcna is that it facilitates interactive protein_engineering aimed at improving thermostability availability_and visualcna and its dependencies cna and first software are available free of charge under gpl and academic licenses respectively visualcna and cna are available atstructural flexibility and rigidity is important for a proteins function and stability being able to accurately_predict protein_flexibility is thus instrumental in protein science and engineering as well as drug_design our group developed the python based software_package constraint network_analysis cna b for characterizing biomolecular flexibility both at the global and residue_level cna functions as a front and back end to the graph theorybased rigidity analysis software floppy inclusions and rigid substructure topography first and has been used to predict protein thermostability identify structural weak spots and link protein_flexibility and function including allosteric_regulation c pfleger and h gohlke unpublished results cna models a protein as a body and bar constraint network in which bodies atoms are connected by bars covalent and non covalent interactions a rigidity analysis is then performed using the pebble game algorithm resulting in a decomposition of the network into rigid and flexible regions by removing non covalent constraints from the network in the order of increasing strength cna simulates thermal_unfolding from the unfolding trajectory cna calculates several global and local flexibility indices from the global indices phase transition_points are identified at which the network switches from rigid to flexible these points are used to predict the thermostability of a protein and identify structural weak spots local indices describe intrinsic biomolecular flexibility at the level of bonds and can be compared with quantitative data from experiments on biomolecular mobility the output from cna is highly information rich for a comprehensive analysis the data needs to be visualized as plots showing global and local flexibility indices as well as d graphics representations of the biomolecule the constraint network and the decomposition into rigid and flexible regions furthermore the speed of cna allows performing real_time rigidity analyses on biomolecules thus interactive structural_modifications and or editing of the constraint network followed by a re analysis of the biomolecules flexibility can be performed iteratively with this in mind we developed visualcna an intuitive easy to use graphical_interface for cna built as a plug in for the molecular viewer pymol the pymol molecular_graphics system version schr dinger llc visualcna supports scientists interested in the rigidity analysis of biomolecules by a synchronized and interactive_visualization of the cna output it also enables interactive protein_engineering for improving thermostability by iteratively mutating identified weak spots performing a subsequent rigidity analysis and automatically comparing cna output from wild_type structures
