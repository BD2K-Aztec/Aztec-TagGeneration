grasp analysis of genotype phenotype results from genome_wide and corresponding open_access database we created a deeply extracted and annotated database of genome_wide gwas results grasp v contains million snp phenotype association from among gwas_studies we re annotated gwas results with annotation sources including some rarely compared to gwas results e g rnaediting sites lincrnas ptms motivation to create a high_quality resource to facilitate further use and interpretation of human gwas results in order to address important scientific questions results gwas have grown exponentially with increases in sample_sizes and markers tested and continuing bias toward european_ancestry samples grasp contains phenotypes roughly eqtls metabolite qtls methylation qtls and diseases biomarkers and other traits cis eqtls meqtls mqtls and mhc region snps are highly_enriched among significant results after removing these categories grasp still contains a greater proportion of studies and results than comparable gwas catalogs cardiovascular_disease and related risk_factors predominate remaining gwas results followed by immunological neuro logical and cancer traits significant results in gwas display a highly gene centric tendency sex_chromosome x or and y or genes are depleted for gwas results gene length is correlated with gwas results at nominal significance p levels we show this gene length correlation decays at increasingly more stringent p value thresholds potential pleotropic genes and snps enriched for multi phenotype association in gwas are identified however we note possible population_stratification at some of these loci finally via re annotation we identify compelling functional hypotheses at gwas loci in some cases unrealized in studies to date conclusion pooling summary level gwas results and re annotating with bioinformatics predictions and molecular_features provides a good platform for new insights availability the grasp database is available at http apps nhlbi nih gov grasp genome_wide gwas revolutionized the study of human_genetics for numerous traits and diseases but have rarely been used to synthesize results across traits and diseases johnson and o biomolecular annotations of results from gwas are not uniformly applied across studies hampering comparisons even for fundamental aspects such as overlap with genes johnson and o scientists commonly use existing gwas results databases to provide evidence for association but these databases have significant_limitations in annotations applied and studies and results included we collected million available results from gwas papers to create a large results database deeply annotated in a uniform manner in analysis of collected results we observe temporal_trends across gwas_studies demonstrate how deep annotation can lead to functional hypotheses often missed in original reports and show how data_mining across diverse phenotypes reveals putative pleiotropic loci and variants the genome_wide repository of associations between snps and phenotypes grasp is freely_available for query and download http apps nhlbi nih gov grasp and plans to accept submission of additional results for public posting and archiving in future releases
