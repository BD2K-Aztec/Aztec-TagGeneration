genomed plot a library for rich interactive_visualizations of genomic_data in web_applications motivation a simple static image of genomes and associated metadata is very limiting as researchers expect rich interactive tools similar to the web_applications found in the post web world genomed plot is a light_weight visualization library written in javascript using the d library genomed plot provides a rich api to allow the rapid visualization of complex genomic_data using a convenient standards based json configuration file when integrated into existing web_services genomed plot allows researchers to interact with data dynamically alter the view or even resize or reposition the visualization in their browser window in addition genomed plot has built in functionality to export any resulting genome visualization in png or svg format for easy inclusion in manuscripts or presentations in the study of an organisms genome multiple data_sources are often integrated along side the genome to facilitate analysis two often used methods for visualization are linear or circular representations of the genome stacked with this additional data as seen in tools such as gmod or circos however these often create either static image or visualizations with limited interaction not taking_advantage of the advances in web_browsers and their associated javascript engines newer tools have been produced such as jbrowse that bring dynamic_interaction to these datasets but unfortunately act more like a standalone tool being complex to setup and not integrating seamlessly in to existing analysis platforms other tools such as scribl and genome maps lack a circular genome view which is useful for some types of microbial analyses genomed plot takes_advantage of the well supported d library http d js org used by hundreds of websites globally to allow rapid creation of dynamic interactive_visualizations of datasets the goal in the development of genomed plot was to create a library with minimal external dependencies that could be integrated in to existing web_applications just as a developer might include an image or table the use of json a standardized and well supported data format to configure a visualization with genomed plot reduces the burden on developers and lowers the complexity of use genomed plot features an easy to use json based data language for visualizations in its simplest form a developer needs only define the tracks give the size of the genome and the base_pairs boundaries of elements to visualize genomed plot will create an svg canvas and plot the genomes and associated metadata as either a linear or circular view
