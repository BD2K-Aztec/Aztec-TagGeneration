data_and identifying duplicate content using statistically improbable phrases motivation document similarity_metrics such as pubmeds find related_articles feature which have been primarily used to identify studies with similar topics can now also be used to detect duplicated or potentially plagiarized papers within literature reference_databases however the cpu intensive nature of document comparison has limited medline text similarity studies to the comparison of abstracts which constitute only a small fraction of a publications total text extending searches to include text archived by online search_engines would drastically increase comparison ability for large_scale studies submitting short phrases encased in direct quotes to search_engines for exact_matches would be optimal for both individual queries and programmatic interfaces we have derived a method of analyzing statistically improbable phrases sips for assistance in identifying duplicate content results when applied to medline citations this method substantially improves upon previous_algorithms in the detection of duplication citations yielding a precision and recall of versus for etblast and versus for etblast respectively availability similar citations identified by this work are freely_accessible in the dj vu database under the sip discovery method category atmost scientists today face intense competition in the race for peer recognition visibility and international acclaim academic distinction is gained based on the number of peer_reviewed in highly circulated journals this intense pressure to publish not only to advance but also simply to sustain ones career is summarized in the adage publish or perish because substantial_amounts of time and resources are needed to complete scientific_studies there is often a natural desire to seek maximumsips have been shown to provide a more sensitive method of duplicate identification than etblast the only tool currently used to identify duplicate citations we have demonstrated that the sip method_performs in areas where etblast operates with low sensitivity indeed etblast has been shown to underperform in abstracts whose text similarity is low and whose size is small i e below four sentences data not shown sips also outperform etblast in computation power whereas etblast runs on a cpu cluster and typically compares one abstract to all others in pubmed in s to min the sips of an abstract are searched through pubmed in s on average and the process can be run on a single_cpu although the parallelization of the sip code has not been performed on a cluster of cpus it would likely result in a substantial gain of speed when compared with etblast in spite of this enhanced_performance the false_positive of sip analysis is roughly_equivalent to that of etblast false_positives are highly_similar citations not otherwise considered to be duplicates for these cases the use of a text similarity tool using a bag of word approach like etblast or short similar sentences with sips would fail because text similarity does not account for natural syntactic inconsistencies such as synonym use or grammatical variations when using an appropriate threshold for the sip score ratio in this analysisfew false_negatives were found although we cannot measure the exact number without visually inspecting thousands of pairs we estimate the false_negative of sip analysis to be when calculated using duplicates tagged in pubmed both etblast and sip analysis use exceedingly simple text comparison techniques compared to advanced natural_language algorithms yet these tools have proven_effective at identifying the majority of duplicate citations the exhaustive identification of all duplicates in medline will necessitate the development of more sophisticated tools to analyze grammar and extract meaning from sentences rather than rely on word comparisons only unfortunately increased awareness of such technology could lead to an arms_race whereby authors wishing to plagiarize seek to exploit these areas of weakness in order to avoid detection however since most publications are now stored electronically these authors will have to contend with the possibility that although the technology needed to detect these exploitations is not available now it may be in the near futureat which point any hidden indiscretions may quickly rise to the surface
