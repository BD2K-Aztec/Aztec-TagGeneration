the smal web_server global multiple network_alignment from pairwise_alignments motivation alignments of protein_protein ppin can be used to predict protein_function study conserved aspects of the interactome and to establish evolutionary correspondences within this problem context determining multiple network alignments mna is a significant challenge that involves high_computational a limited number of public mna implementations are available currently and the majority of the pairwise network_alignment pna algorithms do not have mna counterparts furthermore current mna algorithms do not allow choosing a specific ppin relative to which an mna could be constructed also once an mna is obtained it cannot easily be modified such as through addition of a new network without expensive re computation of the entire mna results smal scaffold based multiple network aligner is a public open_source web_based application for determining mnas from existing pnas that addresses all the aforementioned challenges with smal pnas can be combined rapidly to obtain an mna the software also supports visualiza tion and user data interactions to facilitate exploratory_analysis and sensemaking smal is especially useful when multiple_alignments relative to a particular ppin are required furthermore smal alignments are persistent in that existing correspondences between networks obtained during pna or mna are not lost as new networks are added in comparative_studies alongside existent mna techniques smal mnas were found to be superior per a number of measures such as the total number of identified homologs and interologs as well as the fraction of all identified correspondences that are functionally_similar or homologous to the scaffold while directed primarily at ppin alignment smal is a generic network aligner and may be applied to arbitrary networks availability information the smal web_server and source codenetwork alignment in both the pairwise_alignment and multiple network_alignment mna formulations is an np_hard of these formulations in practice mna requires significantly_greater time to compute understandably therefore at the state_ofthe the number of pairwise network_alignment pna algorithms and software significantly surpasses those for mna however with increasing availability of interactomes the ability to compare ppins across species through mna becomes increasingly critical for a spectrum of problems including identification of conserved functional components function prediction and phylogenetics smal scaffold based multiple network aligner incorporates a number of operational and theoretical novelties i unlike current mna methods it allows mna construction with respect to
