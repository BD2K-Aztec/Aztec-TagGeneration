phylogenetics measuring guide_tree dependency of inferred gaps in progressive aligners motivation multiple_sequence are generally reconstructed using a progressive approach that follows a guide_tree during this process gaps are introduced at a cost to maximize residue pairing but it is unclear whether inferred gaps reflect actual past_events of sequence insertions_or it has been found that patterns of inferred gaps in alignments contain information towards the true phylogeny but it is as yet unknown whether gaps are simply reflecting information that was already present in the guide_tree results we here develop a framework to disentangle the phylogen etic signal carried by gaps from that which is already present in the guide_tree our results indicate that most gaps are incorrectly inserted in patterns that nevertheless follow the guide_tree thus most gap patterns in current alignments are not informative per se this affects different programs to various degrees prank being the most sensitive to the guide_tree multiple_sequence msa play_a in modern_molecular and they are used in a broad set of applications ranging from phylogenetic_analyses to the identification of functional_motifs as the quality of an alignment will inevitably affect the quality of downstream_analyses different strategies have been proposed to improve the quality of msa in the context of the reconstruction of phylogenetic_trees to establish the evolutionary_relationship among a given set of sequences a major_problem is how to extract phylogenetic_information from inferred gaps theoretically inferred gaps in an alignment should represent past_events of sequence insertions_or when this is the case a proper incorporation of gap information into phylogenetic_inference has been shown to be informative in practice however gaps are generally introduced at a penalty cost to maximize residue pairing scores most alignment reconstruction programs use a progressive approach in which most similar sequences are aligned first following a guide_tree during the alignment reconstruction optimization is based on two main components residue pairing and gap penalties in contrast to residue pairings where empirical_models exist gap penalties are generally rather arbitrary with some notable exceptions it is unclear to which degree inferred gaps in alignments correspond real past_events of insertions_and as a result highly gapped regions are commonly_considered unreliable and it is common practice to ignore them before phylogenetic_analyses a recent study has reported an unexpected accuracy of maximum_parsimony trees reconstructed solely from the information contained in presence absence patterns of inferred gaps in protein_alignments this result has been attributed to phylogenetic_information contained directly in gaps introduced by alignment programs and it would imply that current phylogenetic_methods could be improved by exploiting such information however for this to be true gaps should carry independent phylogenetic_information truly reflecting past evolutionary_events such as insertions_and alternatively because of the progressive nature of the alignment reconstruction gap patterns may simply reflect information already present in the guide_tree which is usually reconstructed from pairwise sequence distance information if this would be the case usage of the gap patterns in phylogenetic_reconstruction would be biased towards the guide_tree which is prone to contain errors disentangling the two scenarios is of central importance to improve the existing multiple_sequence methods and to design proper strategies to exploit the potential information contained in gaps at the same time this task is challenging given the lack of a proper framework to measure the effect that guide trees have in the introduction of gaps here we develop a novel approach to assess whether the information contained in gap patterns reflect true evolutionary_events and whether this is different from the phylogenetic_signal already present in the guide_tree we apply such framework to several synthetic and real_datasets and using five different alignment strategies that represent the main alignment approaches our results show that most gaps are incorrectly inserted in patterns that nevertheless tend to follow the guide_tree hence gaps carry little additional information distinct from that already present in the guide_tree our results emphasize the role of the guide_tree when alignments of gappy data are used for evolutionary_analyses although the impact of this effect varies across datasets some alignment_algorithms are consistently more affected than others in all cases the errors could be reduced by either using the known true tree as a to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http
