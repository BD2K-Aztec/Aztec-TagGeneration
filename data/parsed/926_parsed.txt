genome_analysis champ k chip_analysis methylation pipeline the illumina_infinium is a new platform for high_throughput dna_methylation analysis several methods for normalization and processing of these data have been published_recently here we present an integrated analysis_pipeline offering a choice of the most popular normalization_methods while also introducing new methods for calling differentially_methylated and detecting copy_number availability_and champ is implemented as a bioconductor_package in r the package and the vignette can be downloaded atdna methylation is the most studied epigenetic_modification changes in dna_methylation have been implicated in the development of a number of diseases and have been defined as a major hallmark of cancer technological_developments for the genome_wide detection of dna_methylation have grown rapidly in recent_years and several options exist although bisulphite conversion combined with next_generation is the most comprehensive approach it is currently feasible for only small_sample and application to large_scale studies remains_challenging the infinium_humanmethylation www illumina com offers this rapidly moving field an attractive balance with respect to throughput coverage and cost it extends the previous k array providing an assessment for cpg loci covering key features of the human_genome including cpg islands shores and shelves as well as promoters gene_bodies intergenic and imprinted regions based on pubmed and geo submissions the k array has established itself as the platform of choice for epigenome_wide the challenge with this new technology is in the analysis there are several important_steps a k analysis_pipeline should include normalization batch_effect analysis single_nucleotide snp flagging detection of copy_number cnas and segmentation of methylation variable positions mvps into biologically_relevant dmrs normalization is especially important as the k platform combines two different assays infinium i and infinium ii a number of normalization_methods are now available that deal with this issue in slightly different ways in chronological_order of development they are peak based correction pbc sqn subset quantile within array normalisation swan and beta mixture quantile normalization bmiq the bottleneck for researchers using the k platform as part of systems and disease oriented projects is the need for an integrated analysis_pipeline we have addressed this need by developing champ and making it publicly_available champ incorporates already published and novel tools and complements existing k analysis_pipelines such as illumina methylation analyzer rnbeads and watermelon providing users a choice for their analyses the advantage of champ is that it offers three additional methods for the analysis of batch_effects dmr calling and cna detection over and above the standard functionalities champ has been tested on studies containing up to samples on a personal machine with gb of memory for larger epigenome_wide the pipeline requires more memory and running it in steps as described in the vignette can break up the time requirements an integrated map of genetic_variation from human_genomes nature touleimat n and tost j complete pipeline for infinium r human methylation k beadchip data_processing using subset quantile normalization for accurate dna_methylation estimation epigenomics ima an r package for high_throughput analysis of illuminas k infinium methylation data bioinformatics zhuang j et_al a comparison of feature_selection and classification methods in dna_methylation studies using the illumina_infinium platform bmc bioinformatics
