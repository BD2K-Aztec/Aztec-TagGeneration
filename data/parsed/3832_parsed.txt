bioimage_informatics quantifying spatial relationships from whole retinal images motivation microscopy advances have enabled the acquisition of large_scale biological images that capture whole tissues in situ this in turn has fostered the study of spatial relationships between cells and various biological structures which has proved enormously beneficial toward understanding organ and organism function however the unique nature of biological images and tissues precludes the application of many existing spatial mining and quantification_methods necessary to make inferences about the data especially difficult is attempting to quantify the spatial_correlation between heterogeneous structures and point objects which often occurs in many biological_tissues results we develop a method to quantify the spatial_correlation between a continuous structure and point data in large pixel biological images we use this method to study the spatial_relationship between the vasculature and a type of cell in the retina called astrocytes we use a geodesic feature_space based on vascular_structures and embed astrocytes into the space by spatial sampling we then propose a quantification_method in this feature_space that enables us to empirically demonstrate that the spatial distribution of astrocytes is often correlated with vascular_structure additionally these patterns are conserved in the retina after injury these results prove the long assumed patterns of astrocyte spatial distribution and provide a novel methodology for conducting other spatial studies of similar tissue and structures availability the matlab_code for the method described in this article can be found atthe advent_of large_scale microscopy has been a boon to the biological community technological_advances have enabled the capture of whole tissue at micrometer resolution providing opportunities of study that have previously been unavailable these improvements have especially had a profound impact on examination of the spatial distribution and correlation of biological_entities as the locations of large_amounts of cells and other structures can be imaged in situ studying the spatial_arrangement and relationships inherent in tissues can improve our understanding of the various development or pathological_processes that underlie proper organ or organism function despite the abundance of image data mining or quantifying spatial properties in tissue can be a challenging_task although automated microscopy has significantly_improved acquisition_rates capturing the spatial layout of whole cell_populations or structures at high_resolution can require thousands of images that take many days to acquire under limited time constraints oftentimes small samples of tissue are imaged and analyzed to infer spatial properties of a whole tissue however many tissues are spatially_heterogeneous application of mining or quantification_methods on small images may not provide a representative_sample necessary to draw_conclusions about the whole tissue as such development of spatial mining and quantification_methods that can be effectively applied to extremely_large images with diverse structures are highly_desirable yet many spatial mining methods are not suitable to handle the complex and non traditional spatial relationships found in these large biological images for example neuronal or vascular_structures are pervasive in many tissues and oftentimes are spatially_correlated with other cells traditional spatial quantification_methods such as co location k function or nearest_neighbor methods cannot be applied to model the relationship between these structures and cells because they inherently operate on discrete points in euclidean_space methods that can model the complex relationship between biological structure and cellular spatial distribution are needed to take full advantage of these rich images in addition comparative_analysis of spatial relationships between normal and pathological tissues is highly_beneficial for understanding underlying biological_processes these existing spatial methods are difficult to apply to different specimens or conditions because the euclidean orientation and scaling between a set of images may not be the same one tissue that exhibits many of the aforementioned spatial characteristics is the mammalian retina the nerve_fiber nfl of the retina is blanketed by a cell known as the astrocyte which performs a multitude of physiological_functions astrocyte processes physically contact the vascular_structure and they also play a key to whom correspondence should be addressed functional role in the development of the retinal_vasculature an apparent spatial_correlation between astrocytes and the blood_vessels has been noted but only observational_evidence of such a relationship has been provided strong evidence of astrocyte spatial_correlation with various vascular properties would lend further support to additional hypotheses of astrocyte function such as the suspected role of astrocytes in vasodilation and constriction attempts to quantify the correlation between vascular_structure and the spatial placement of astrocytes will suffer from the problems previously discussed the vasculature is a large heterogeneous structure with specific arterial and venous delineations that requires us to image the entire retina in addition while astrocytes can be represented as points in euclidean_space the vasculature is a continuous structure and cannot be represented as such hence a quantification_method is needed that can map these disparate and large data_sources into a common space in this article we describe a method to quantify the spatial_correlation between features of heterogeneous_biological structures and euclidean points in tissue and apply it to the retina the proposed method is capable of capturing differences between the features of heterogeneous structures and spatial distribution of points the method implements a geodesic coordinate system that is based on the vascular_structure the vasculature and astrocytes are converted to this geodesic feature_space such that the position of astrocytes relative to the vasculature is preserved astrocyte distribution in the geodesic feature_space is then empirically compared with the vascular distribution we show that the distribution of astrocytes often spatially correlates with changes in the vascular_structure finally we apply our methodology to a set of injured retinas and demonstrate that long_term detached retina do not deviate from the spatial_patterns observed on normal retinas our methodology uses a geodesic feature_space that is independent of euclidean_space the scale of the images and rotation of the retina about the optic_nerve have no impact on the results the scale and rotation invariance facilitates comparison between retinas and different cell_types for example retinal_neurons pericytes or muler cells can be converted into this same feature_space for comparative_analysis in addition this methodology can be used on spatial studies between other structures and cells such as the relationship between neuronal_networks and supporting cells our results demonstrate that we can successfully quantify the spatial_correlation between these disparate biological_entities and provide a foundation for future_research aimed at studying the spatial distribution of various biological_components in large tissue images the mallows distance quantification_method was performed on the three histogram scenarios for the nine retinas in addition the method was also tested on synthetic retinal data to demonstrate its effectiveness at capturing the spatial_correlation between vascular_structure and astrocyte distribution ae is initially set to be m which is approximately the width of an average retinal astrocyte s bv is varied from to each bootstrapping test used random_samples from a histogram exploration of the effect of ae on the statistical_testing can be found in the supplementary_material in this work we developed a method to quantify the spatial_relationship between a heterogeneous structure and discrete points in euclidean_space we used a novel geodesic feature_space and studied the relationship between astrocytes and the vasculature in the retinal nfl the vasculature and astrocytes are converted to this feature_space which facilitates comparison of astrocyte spatial distribution relative to the vasculature empirical quantification using the mallows distance reveals that astrocytes are spatially_distributed independently from the vasculature with the exception of increased astrocyte density on thick portions of veins our method of quantifying the spatial_relationship between large structures and point objects has many advantages the used feature_space is based on the geodesic distance to a common object in all the images thus enabling direct comparison of all data furthermore conversion of the vascular data to geodesic distance allows different resolutions of spatial relationships to be tested such varying resolutions could be applied to other domains as well for instance from individual_neurons to larger circuits lastly use of the mallows distance to compare histograms provides an accurate reflection of the differences between vascular_structure and astrocyte spatial distribution clustering of point objects around specific regions of large continuous structures in diverse tissues can be easily_identified using our method our method and subsequent results already have an immediate impact on our understanding of the underlying biological_processes occurring in the retina it is clear from our results that detachment appears to have no discernible effect on the distribution of astrocytes with respect to the vasculature this is an unexpected result as it has been shown in various animals that astrocytes react in response to trauma such as the up regulation of gfap in astrocytes or by proliferation these previously observed injury responses by astrocytes appear to have little to no long_term impact on their spatial distribution relative to the vasculature indicating that a specific spatial configuration of astrocytes may be required for healthy function of the retina these results lend insight into biological_processes that are occurring in an adult retina there are significant broader implications of our proposed method as well the geodesic distance in our method is not restricted to radial vascular_structures it only requires a reference_point therefore it can be used on other vascular networks such as the brain vascular_network or even complete organisms where the entire vasculature is observable in addition many otherthe astrocyte histogram was denser in a there are large regions where the two histograms significantly differ as seen by the intense light and dark biological_tissues exhibit similar structure and relationships to those encountered in the retina our feature_space and quantification methodology can be used to study spatial relationships in these domains as well for instance connectomes of neurons_and contain large continuous structures similar to the vasculature and are often spatially_correlated with other cells or entities the geodesic feature_space can be adapted for neuronal axons or circuitry a common physiological or anatomical reference_point can be used in lieu of the optic_nerve e g cell soma along with axonal width or any other spatially_correlated structural_feature the locations of other nearby cells can then be converted into this geodesic space now based on neurons and the spatial_correlation between cells and neuronal structure can be quantified in a similar manner to astrocytes and the vasculature there have also been efforts to quantify the structure of neurons using methods similar to our proposed method these methods attempt to characterize the morphology of neuronal structures using topological_features such as diameter path_length or branching factors while these approaches are not specifically_designed to measure spatial_correlation they can be incorporated into our method as an additional histogram dimension for instance sholl analysis could be used in conjunction with soma distance and dendrite width to measure spatial_correlation between neurons and other biological_features using our method finally our methodology will provide further insight into the biological_processes in the retina spatial_correlation can be studied using our method in new experimental_conditions such as development or disease these additional spatial studies of retinal conditions as well as spatial studies on tissues with similar structure are promising avenues of future research_efforts
