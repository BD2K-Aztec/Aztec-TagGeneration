gene_expression nvt a fast and simple tool for the assessment of rna_seq normalization strategies motivation measuring differential_gene is a common task in the analysis of rna_seq to_identify between two samples it is crucial to normalize the datasets while multiple normalization_methods are available all of them are based on certain assumptions that may or may not be suitable for the type of data they are applied on researchers therefore need to select an adequate normalization strategy for each rna_seq experiment this selection includes exploration of different normalization_methods as well as their comparison methods that agree with each other most likely represent realistic assumptions under the particular experimental_conditions results we developed the nvt package which provides a fast and simple way to analyze and evaluate multiple normalization_methods via visualization and representation of correlation values based on a user_defined set of uniformly expressed genes high_throughput of rna or cdna rna_seq had an enormous impact on basic_and since its introduction in the s independently of the used sequencing_technology the vast_majority of research_projects attempting to measure global expression levels of features genes exons small_rnas or non_coding compare expression values of multiple samples that represent different biological_states importantly any such differential_expression de analysis requires normalized data this means that all nonbiological influence such as potential effects of sample_preparation or sequencing efficiency has to be removed to make the data comparable in between different experiments to balance sequencing_depths several methods use scaling_factors supplementary total_count tc median me upper_quartile uq trimmed mean of m values tmm and the relative log expression method implemented in deseq both tmm and deseq operate under the assumption that most of the genes are not differentially_expressed normalization_methods without scaling_factors are supplementary quantile q reads per kilobase per_million rpkm and normalization by a defined gene_set g thus two main concepts for data_normalization in rna_seq applications exist while tmm and deseq mainly consider differential library size other normalization_methods account for the distribution adjustment of read_counts tc uq me q rpkm normalization based on rna spike ins makes other methods obsolete but this requires the rna spike in which had to be planned and applied previous to the sequencing all the previously described methods are based on specific assumptions thus identifying the method s for which these assumptions agree with the specific experimental_setting represents a significant challenge an exception is quantro v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com which gives recommendations on when to use q normalization or not for example if an experiment compares gene_expression levels of healthy versus rapidly_growing tumor_cells the assumptions of non differentially_expressed or equal_amounts of mrna might not apply the decision to utilize a certain normalization method can therefore have an enormous impact on the entire downstream_analysis also conclusions drawn from the enrichment of differentially_expressed with respect to functional_categories might be severely_affected as rna_seq experiments have become popular and powerful research_tools in many areas of biology and medicine also non specialists need to be able to explore and compare different normalization_methods to select the most appropriate one to assist researchers in these tasks we present the normalization visualization_tool nvt nvt is a fast and simple way to visually and quantitatively assess the normalization strategy including a set of user_defined genes this set should consist of genes that do not change their relative_expression in the particular study this requires preliminary knowledge or experimental_data e g from quantitative_pcr measurements
