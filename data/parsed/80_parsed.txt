sequence_analysis a common_ancestry for bap and uch regulators to reveal how the polycomb repressivedeubiquitinase prdub complex controls substrate selection specificity we undertook a detailed computational sequence_analysis of its components additional sex combs like asxl and brca associated protein bap proteins this led to the discovery of two previously_unrecognized domains in asxl a forkhead winged_helix dna_binding and a deubiquitinase adaptor domain shared with two regulators of ubiquitin carboxyl_terminal hydrolase uch namely adhesion regulating molecule adrm and nuclear_factor related to kappab nfrkb our analysis demonstrates a common_ancestry for bap and uch regulators in prdub ino chromatin_remodelling and proteosome complexes brca associated protein bap and ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase uch also known as uchl are two deubiquitinating proteases dubs from the same peptidase family that share a high degree of sequence_similarity not only in their catalytic ubiquitin carboxy_terminal hydrolase uch domain but also in an additional conserved carboxy_terminal region previously called the uch like domain uld the controlled removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin like proteins by dubs is required in diverse_cellular the catalytic_domains of dubs often require adapter domains to control the specificity of substrate selection and thus to avoid cleavage of inappropriate substrates the human prdub complex contains bap and additional sex combs like asxl the prdub complex represses polycomb_group target_genes by removing monoubiquitin from histone h a in nucleosomes recently it was found that the asxl n_terminal region residues is essential for its interaction with bap although the domains responsible for this interaction have been determined in neither asxl nor bap protein_sequences the prdub complex has increasingly attracted medical interest as somatic_mutations in asxl frequently occur in different to whom correspondence should be addressed myelodysplastic_syndromes asxl mutations have been also associated with glioblastoma ovarian_serous cystadenocarcinoma cervical and colon_cancer de_novo nonsense_mutations in human asxl have also been recently associated with bohringopitz syndrome also known as oberklaiddanks or c like syndromes characterized by severe intellectual_disability distinctive facial_features and multiple congenital_malformations human asxl belongs to a family of three vertebrate paralogues and it is orthologous to drosophila asx additional sex combs whose product is required for long_term repression of hox_genes during development and whose mutants enhance homeotic phenotypes of both polycomb and trithorax mutations mouse asxl is required for normal_hematopoiesis and its knockout results in simultaneous anterior and posterior transformations of the axial_skeleton in addition several lines of evidence suggest that asxl has a genuine transcription_factor role by regulating retinoic_acid and peroxisome_proliferator asx proteins have been previously_reported to contain two evolutionarily conserved_regions in metazoa from fly to humans a region termed the asx homology asxh domain and a c terminal plant homeo domain phd zinc_finger however with the exception of its c terminal phd domain significant_sequence was not detected with any other known protein domain in order to trace its evolutionary_history and to identify functional_domains we embarked on a computational protein sequence_analysis of the asx protein_family in summary the computational_identification of the deubad and forkhead domains in the human asxl protein should now greatly assist in experimentally delineating its critical function in regulating the histone code under non pathological and pathological_conditions
