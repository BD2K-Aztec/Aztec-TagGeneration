genome_analysis defining and providing robust controls for microrna prediction motivation micrornas are short non_coding that regulate_gene by inhibiting target_mrna genes next_generation combined with bioinformatics analyses provide an opportunity to predict numerous novel mirnas the efficiency of these predictions relies on the set of positive_and controls used we demonstrate that commonly used positive_and controls may be unreliable and provide a rational methodology with which to replace them micrornas mirnas are short nucleotide long rnas that reduce gene_expression usually by binding to the untranslated_region of mrnas they are involved in many biological_processes including cell_proliferation development and disease alvarez in mammals the primary mirna transcript is processed by drosha into a precursor premirna of nt with a distinctive stem_loop this precursor is exported to the cytoplasm and further processed into a mature mirna by a plethora of algorithms have been created to predict novel mirnas using the primary sequence and predicted folding structure of pre mirnas more recently predictive algorithms have included next_generation ngs_data to discover novel mirnas these algorithms are crucial for discovering tissueor species specific_mirnas that are not present in widely used databases to evaluate these predictive tools and assist the creation of novel algorithms it is essential to define a high_confidence set of positive_and controls these will not only be used to benchmark algorithms but also to identify distinguishing_features of mirnas we suggest that the most commonly used reference_set of positive controls mirbase requires further refinement to create a high_confidence set appropriate for use as positive controls in order to improve the dynamic range of the to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as predictions we introduce a novel method to create a set of robust negative controls we provide both sets as supplementary_material the recent_discovery of numerous small functional rnas through ngs experiments has revitalized the field of mirna gene prediction the quality of these predictions relies heavily on the positive_and datasets used to create and test them we demonstrate that commonly used datasets are heterogeneous and may contain rnas from different families or mirnas with distinct functions the methods we describe in this article use ngs_data to characterize rnas based on their processing_patterns and functional evidence taken from the literature our aim in providing these rigorous positive_and controls was to improve_the of existing algorithms leading to their refinement although this study was performed using murine samples and microrna sequences the methods described here are applicable to other mammalian_species experimental confirmation of any predicted mirna remains as an important standard in the field
