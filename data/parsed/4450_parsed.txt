structure based de_novo prediction of zinc binding_sites in proteins of unknown function motivation zinc binding_proteins are the most abundant metallo proteins in protein_data pdb accurate prediction of zinc binding_sites in proteins of unknown function may provide_important for the inference of protein_function as zinc binding is often associated with characteristic d arrangements of zinc ligand residues its prediction may benefit from using not only the sequence_information but also the structure information of proteins results in this work we present a structure based method temsp d template based metal site prediction to predict zinc binding_sites temsp significantly_improves over previously_reported best methods in predicting as many as possible true ligand residues for zinc with minimum overpredictions if only those results in which all zinc ligand residues have been correctly_predicted are defined as true_positives our method improves sensitivity from less than to above and selectivity from around to these results are for predictions based on apo state structures in addition the method can predict the zinc bound local structures reliably generating predictions useful for function inference we applied temsp to protein_structures of the unknown function class in the pdb database a number of zinc binding_sites have been discovered de_novo i e based solely on the protein_structures using the predicted local structures of these sites possible functional_roles were analyzed about one third of all proteins in nature require metal_ions for their normal structures and functions in the protein_structure database pdb zinc is the most abundant metal_ion it has been suggested that zinc binding_proteins may comprise up to to whom correspondence should be addressed of the entire human_proteome in zincbinding proteins the zinc_ions or their binding_motifs often play important functional_roles for example about of the zincbinding proteins in the human_proteome are transcription_factors in which the zinc containing motifs are involved in dna_binding the remaining are primarily enzymes in many of them zinc plays important catalytic roles thus the prediction of zinc binding_sites in proteins is of general interest for the inference of protein_function metal_binding especially zinc sites can be predicted based on the sequences of target_proteins many reasonably successful methods are available for this purpose in some methods comparative modeling of the structures of the target_proteins are attempted to verify or improve the predictions recently a method using the sequence_profiles of known zinc binding_domains in pdb assisted by the so_called metal binding_patterns has been proposed and tested because it needs only the sequence_information of the target_proteins the method can be applied to annotate full zinc proteomes from genome_sequences however as metal binding is very sensitive to the local arrangements of ligand residues in the d space if the d structure of a target protein is available it can be expected that much higher accuracy can be achieved by making predictions directly based on the structure several methods were recently_proposed to predict metalbinding sites especially zinc sites directly based on the d structures among them the method metsite uses neural_networks trained on sequence_profiles secondary_structure states the solvent accessible surface areas sasas as well as the inter residue distance_matrices the empirical fold x force_field has been developed to predict binding_sites and binding_affinities for water and for metal_ions goyal and mande reported a method based on statistically derived geometrical constraints on zinc binding_sites the method ched makes use of the properties of triads of zinc coordinating ligand residues to make predictions based on apoprotein structures the method feature uses a bayesian_classifier based on analyses of the properties of amino_acid in concentric shells around zinc_ions the method sitepredict uses random_forest classifiers trained on diverse ligand residue based site properties topage
