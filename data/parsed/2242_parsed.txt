databases_and human interactome resource and gene_set linkage_analysis for the functional_interpretation of biologically_meaningful gene_sets motivation a molecular_interaction can be viewed as a network in which genes with related functions are connected therefore at a systems level connections between individual genes in a molecular_interaction can be used to infer the collective functional linkages between biologically_meaningful gene_sets results we present the human interactome resource and the gene_set linkage_analysis gsla tool for the functional_interpretation of biologically_meaningful gene_sets observed in experiments gsla determines whether an observed gene_set has significant functional linkages to established biological_processes when an observed gene_set is not enriched by known biological_processes traditional enrichment based interpretation methods cannot produce functional insights but gsla can still evaluate whether those genes work in concert to regulate specific biological_processes thereby suggesting the functional_implications of the observed gene_set the quality of human interactome resource and the utility of gsla are illustrated with multiple assessments a wide_range of genome_wide technologies has emerged during the past_decade and these have become a foundation of current biological_research the challenge is no longer obtaining the profiling data instead the challenge is the interpretation of molecular_profiles to elucidate biological_mechanisms and overcome the curse of spreadsheets the traditional approach to interpreting a molecular_profile is to focus on a handful of the most significantly_changed genes because of the noise inherent in profiling technologies and the poor annotation of many genes this approach has significant_limitations to better interpret the biological_significance of a molecular_profile annotation enrichment based_approaches have been developed these approaches examine whether members of a gene_set defined by an established biological concept i e an annotation term typically a biological_process tend to be enriched in the list of significantly_changed genes or occur toward the top bottom of the ranked_list of all genes in this manner these approaches determine_whether an established biological concept and the gene_set defined by it is correlated with the molecular_profile because annotation enrichment based analyses tend to produce results that are more reproducible and interpretable than individual gene based analyses they have quickly become popular however these approaches are not always useful as that whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent annotation enrichment based_approaches examine whether genes that constitute well established biological_concepts are enriched in a molecular_profile therefore these approaches essentially map the observed molecular_profiles to established biological_concepts i e defining what these profiles are and the researchers are left to interpret the functional_implications of these molecular_profiles using their knowledge regarding the biology of the mapped concepts for a truly novel molecular_profile that does not have established concepts to describe it annotation enrichment based_approaches would fail to map to established concepts consequently researchers would be unable to appreciate the functional_implications of observing such a profile by examining the identity of the profile however it is important to understand the functional_implications of novel molecular_profiles because novel molecular_profiles are often the basis for the introduction of new biological_concepts that expand_our to meet this analytical challenge we developed a tool called gene_set linkage_analysis gsla which detects significant functional linkages between biologically_meaningful gene_sets i e experimentally_observed significantly_changed genes and gene_sets defined by established biological_concepts functional linkages that relate an observed molecular_profile to well established biological_concepts might assist in interpreting the functional_implications of the observed molecular_profile even in a case in which no established concept can be found to describe i e be enriched in the observed molecular_profile to identify these collective functional linkages between gene_sets we developed the gsla tool which evaluates a largely homogenous functional interactome the human interactome resource hir here homogenous functional interactome means that the functional interactions in the interactome have similar strengths and represent an unbiased sample of the true complete functional interactome in a homogenous functional to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as interactome the density of inter gene_set interactions will be able to indicate the overall strength of the functional linkage between two gene_sets the idea of exploring interaction density for functional inference has been discussed previously based on the coverage and reliability of hir we designed a pair of tests that validate both the strength and the biological_significance of the observed inter gene_set interaction density to detect substantial functional linkage at the gene_set level in the following sections we provide a description of our method for obtaining a largely homogenous functional interactome hir and the details of our gsla approach the quality of hir and the utility of gsla were evaluated in a series of systematic evaluations and case studies gsla summarizes functional linkages at the individual gene level to identify functional linkages at the gene_set level therefore the quality of the reference network has a critical impact on the usefulness of the approach the reason why gsla produced biologically_interesting functional linkages in our assessments is most likely because gsla used an interaction_network that has balanced coverage and specificity for example assuming that we aim to identify functional linkages between specific biological_concepts and in particular that we aim to identify functional linkages between two small biological_processes each consisting of genes if functional interactions between genes in these two processes were good evidence for a biologically_interesting gene_set interaction then we would need a reference network that can cover at least of the true interactome to observe at least two inter gene_set functional interactions in this case a false_positive of only false interactions per pair of genes would result in two random false interactions between two gene processes if hir had a false_positive this high such a signal_to would make it difficult to identify biologically_meaningful functional linkages as detailed in the supplemental material the interactions in hir were predicted using data before january using new interactions reported after this date we estimated that hir covered of the physical human interactome with a per interaction reliability of this per interaction reliability corresponds to a false_positive of false protein interactions per pair of genes or random false protein interactions between two gene processes this signal_to was likely to allow the identification of biologically_meaningful functional linkages at the gene_set level before this work several other human interactomes have been developed e g the string database and the humannet these interactomes were not rigorously assessed for their coverage and reliability using newly_reported interactions typically they included half a million interactions or more interactions per pair of genes in contrast the rate of yeast protein interactions is per pair of genes and we estimated in this work that the rate of human interactions is per pair of genes supplemental material therefore the false_positive in these interactomes are likely high which might not provide sufficient signal_to for gsla to identify biologically_meaningful gene_set interactions for example if humannet or string was used in the above statin case study gsla would no longer be able to connect the expression changes in statin sensitive cells to apoptosis related biological_processes to further improve our network powered functional implication interpretation approach we believe that the bottleneck is the creation of a high_quality network that can provide a sufficient signal_to for downstream approaches to accurately summarize gene level functional interactions into gene_set level functional linkages our approach to building a protein interaction like functional interactome shows_promise gsla identified biologically_meaningful functional linkages in a series of assessments however this approach is still limited primarily because its theoretical basis involves many concepts that are still poorly_defined particularly the strength of a functional interaction we hope that this work inspires future_research to define a rigorous and consistent measurement of the strength of a functional interaction as suggested by multiple types of data which is likely the key to building accurate functional interactomes and useful network powered gene_set interpretation approaches
