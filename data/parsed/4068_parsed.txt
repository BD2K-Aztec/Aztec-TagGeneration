systems_biology robust synthetic_gene design via library_based motivation synthetic_biology aims to develop the artificial gene_networks with desirable behaviors using systematic method these networks with desired behaviors could be constructed using diverse biological_parts which may limit the development to complex synthetic gene_networks fortunately some well characterized promoter libraries for engineering gene_networks are widely available thus a synthetic_gene can be constructed by selecting adequate promoters from promoter libraries to achieve the desired behaviors however the present promoter libraries cannot be directly applied to engineer a synthetic_gene in order to efficiently select adequate promoters from promoter libraries for a synthetic_gene promoter libraries are needed to be redefined based on the dynamic gene_regulation results based on four design specifications a library_based is proposed to efficiently select the most adequate promoter set from the redefined promoter libraries by a genetic_algorithm ga to achieve optimal reference tracking design as the number and size of promoter libraries increase the proposed method can play_an in the systematic_design of synthetic_biology contact synthetic_biology seeks the improvement of rational_design and reprogramming of biological_systems based on design principles during the past_decade synthetic_biology had significant progress in designing biological_parts synthetic biologists have assembled these parts into genetic_circuits to achieve basic_functions such as toggle switches oscillators pulse_generators genetic counters logic evaluators filters b sensors and cellcell communicators recently the design concepts of next generation gene_networks such as to whom correspondence should be addressed tunable filters analog to digital and digital to analog converters adaptive learning networks and protein based computational circuits have been proposed to enable the construction of more complex_biological with the full understanding of biological_parts and modules synthetic biologists can construct useful next generation synthetic gene_networks with real_world applications in medicine biotechnology bioremediation and bioenergy at present engineered organisms contain only very simple genetic_circuits since there are problems for assembling biological_parts into more complex genetic_circuits for example although standard biological_parts can be obtained from the registry of standard biological_parts http partsregistry org only a few parts have measured characteristics describing quantitative behavior in the composed devices there is still lack of an efficient method to select adequate biological_parts from usable libraries to engineer a genetic circuit to track the desired reference trajectory in this article we first redefine the presented promoter libraries based on promoter_activity and then a proposed library_based is used to efficiently select adequate promoters through their promoter_activities in order to engineer a synthetic_gene with desired behaviors despite intrinsic fluctuations and environmental disturbances on the host_cell the proposed librarybased search method can solve the global optimization_problem by employing genetic_algorithm ga hence the most adequate promoters from redefined promoter libraries can be efficiently selected to achieve a desired reference trajectory finally two design examples are given to illustrate the design_procedure of the proposed method in silico in the future synthetic biologists can employ the proposed library_based to select the most adequate promoter set from redefined promoter libraries to construct a predictable synthetic_gene in this section two in silico design examples are given to illustrate the design_procedure of the proposed library_based first of all synthetic biologists need to engineer a genetic circuit topology and then a dynamic_model could be constructed finally the proposed library_based is used to obtain the most adequate promoter setthe main_challenge in genetic circuit design lies in selecting wellmatched genetic_parts that combine and produce the desired behavior reliably some studies have proposed to engineer a synthetic_gene to achieve a desired steady_state or an h optimal tracking of a desired oscillator however the above design methods need to tune some kinetic_parameters to achieve the desired steady or oscillatory state in fact tuning intrinsic parameters of biological devices to fit the designed parameter is currently quite a difficult or even unfeasible task for biotechnology further it is still hard to select adequate biological_parts to implement a desired cellular function with quantitative value to overcome this problem synthetic biologists usually create many versions of synthetic circuits with diverse characteristic by directed_evolution point_mutation or random combinational of dna components and the functions of these versions are investigated to engineer the gene circuit with the desired behavior but when the design of the genetic circuit is complex the number of mutated versions needed to be created and tested is dramatically_increased hence these experimental steps become tedious and time consuming due to the significant amount of trail and error experiments our method is to select the existent promoters from promoter libraries and will be more appealing to synthetic biologists in the future in this study the present promoter libraries are first redefined based on the dynamic gene_regulation from experimental_data and a library_based is then introduced to engineer a synthetic_gene with desired behaviors by satisfying four design specifications through re characteristic biological part datasheets we can design a synthetic_gene with a new function in the existing libraries without having to perform a large number of trail and error experiments using ga operators the library_based is used to mimic the realistic gene network evolution under natural_selection to fit four design specifications but with much fast evolution needed for synthetic gene_networks to achieve their desired behaviors hence the proposed method can efficiently engineer a synthetic_gene to perform its desired behaviors despite intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances in design examples of the synthetic_gene the most adequate promoter set c is selected to achieve the minimum tracking error between the desired reference trajectory and the observed output i e fluorescence despite intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances in vivo as shown in supplementary it is worth to notice that this method is also useful for constructing a synthetic oscillator after constructing the synthetic_gene and providing four design specifications the library_based can efficiently select the most adequate promoter set to track the desired trajectory as shown in supplementary for the oscillator design in only of the promoter sets selected fromhave oscillatory_behavior and only a few set of these can track the reference trajectory furthermore by the proposed method the design_procedure of a synthetic_gene can be simplified for in vivo experiments in this study promoter libraries are redefined based on their promoter_activities so that they are more suitable for the gene circuit design of synthetic_biology the library_based can produce biological_insights for how to design a synthetic_gene with prescribed functions a ga based search method is proposed to mimic the gene network evolution under natural_selection to select adequate promoters to fit four design specifications with more fast evolution speed the proposed design method to select the most adequate promoter set from promoter libraries will help synthetic biologists to simplify the design_procedure of synthetic gene_networks and accelerate the progress of synthetic_biology with advances in modern dna_synthesis technologies together with well defined characteristics of promoters and other standard biological_parts in the future our systematic method could be widely_applied for the faster design cycle of synthetic gene_networks
