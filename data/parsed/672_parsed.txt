bayesian experts in exploring reaction_kinetics of transcription circuits motivation biochemical_reactions in cells are made of several types of biological circuits in current systems_biology making differential_equation de models simulatable in silico has been an appealing general approach to uncover a complex world of biochemical_reaction dynamics despite of a need for simulation aided studies our research field has yet provided no clear answers how to specify kinetic values in models that are difficult to measure from experimental theoretical_analyses on biochemical kinetics results we present a novel non parametric bayesian_approach to this problem the key idea lies in the development of a dirichlet_process dp prior_distribution called bayesian experts which reflects substantive knowledge on reaction_mechanisms inherent in given models and experimentally observable kinetic evidences to the subsequent parameter search the dp prior identifies significant local_regions of unknown parameter_space before proceeding to the posterior analyses this article reports that a bayesian expert inducing stochastic_search can effectively explore unknown_parameters of in silico transcription circuits such that solutions of des reproduce transcriptomic time course profiles availability a sample source_code is available at the urlcells can sense many different environmental signals and respond to extraneous stimuli by switching activation_inactivation of specific molecules such as transcription_factors via several types of biological circuits kinetic biochemical modelling of such reaction circuits often called biochemical_reaction using des realizes experiments in silico to enhance our understanding of the complex dynamic_systems it enables us to test a plausibility of current knowledge and hypothetical models on biological circuits and to create new further models when inconsistencies arise in simulation domain_knowledge and experimentally_observed quantitative data despite of a growing need for simulation aided studies on bio pathways some fundamental issues prevent us from drawing their full potentials one critical issue addressed here is related to uncertainty in specified kinetic_parameters of models in many cases we have no clear answer on how to specify kinetic values and initial_conditions on simulations because biochemical reaction_kinetics differ depending on a cell by cell to whom correspondence should be addressed basis and intra extracellular environments such as temperatures presence absence of biochemical components in specific tissues with the aim to explore kinetic_parameters in in silico biological circuits that make solutions of des fit experimental_data a range of advanced technologies have appeared in the last several years of computational_systems involving genetic_algorithm ga sequential monte_carlo smc mcmc driven parameter search_methods and also gradient_descent algorithms quantitative data such as transcriptomic profiles and protein expression values are usually measured over times in general a bayesian statistical_method involves all the preceding methods as a unified_framework any estimation tasks are treated as evaluations of posterior distributions in which prior distributions embodying our prior belief on reaction_kinetics are adapted to experimental_data using likelihood functions as demonstrated later however the practical relevance of the existing_approaches remains far below what practical analyses require our view on this is that such a low performance depends highly on the lack of effective biochemical kinetic priors this article_presents a previously unexplored class of prior distributions called bayesian experts on biochemical reaction_kinetics the key notion of our approach can be found in the construction of dirichlet_process dp prior_distribution whose base measure g is modelled by a mixture of m gibbs distributions with mixing rates i i m temperature t and partition functions z i the m potential functions i defined on unknown_parameters reflect substantive knowledge on reaction_kinetics for a given model such that regions of interest in the parameter_space are prescribed prior to a posterior analysis in many applications we are able to collect several kinetic evidences on such local_regions by observing temporal_patterns of experimental_data for instance rates of increasing and or decreasing to which de solutions have to match can be guessed in advance by observing steepness of relevant local patterns of given time course data alternatively maximum and minimum levels of gene_expression data provide a helpful clue to determinations of steady_state levels to which a transcription circuit model reaches in equilibrium the gibbsian mixture distribution enabling bayesian expert system in kinetic explorations aggregates such m constraint conditions on the kinetic_parameters that are induced automatically in light of experimental_data and reaction speeds inherent in given models an example in kinetic search of a circadian_clock transcriptional circuit illustrates the practical relevance of the bayesian expert systems and we make a comparison to the non expert approach using a conventional smc our model considered here is an extended version of the gene regulatory model developed inwhere among several studies used in evaluating relevance of various parameter search algorithms the original model describes a reaction circuit of endogenous variables involving five mrnas five translated proteins and two protein_complexes which constitute an interlock of several types of positive_and we here added to the previous model seven clock related variables and their regulatory_mechanisms reflecting in part the recent_discoveries the newly constructed de i modelits mathematical form is available in the supplementary materialcontains unknown_parameters in total consisting of kinetic_parameters and initial_conditions on x the search_methods were applied to time course gene_expression indices from genechip mouse_genome microrrays of the variables temporal expression changes of the seven mrnas were measured along time points equally_spaced on h http sirius cdb riken jp mousescn mousescnccg html a much detailed information on the specified prior distributionsvalues for temperature and conventional gaussian priors used in combinationsis accessible from the supplementary web_site as well as the lisdas code that can reproduce the subsequent numerical analyses with a default configuration file displays simulation trajectories of the endogenous variables where the identified kinetic_parameters and initial state_variables were defined as the i exhibiting the best fit in terms of p y i the des were solved using the euler discretization with time steps equally_spaced on the entire time interval cpu time required for the execution of lisdas was min intel core quad processor ghz for the particles of size k compared with the very poor results of the non expert smc method using only the conventional gaussian priors the lisdas could capture the underlying circadian_rhythm inherent in the observed data with much better degree of fitness note that the applied search_procedure is almost the same as a random search the particles were all drawn from g and then the best fit value was merely chosen therefore the good performance arose from only the added bayesian expert system to the best of our knowledge the methods being able to estimate such many parameters have never appeared in the related research field while so_far our previous study and the ga ofcould draw reasonably good performances in analyses of a transcription model and in silico signal_transduction containing and unknown_parameters respectively
