gene_expression wigwams identifying gene_modules co regulated across multiple biological conditions motivation identification of modules of co regulated_genes is a crucial first step towards dissecting the regulatory circuitry underlying biological_processes co regulated_genes are likely to reveal themselves by showing tight co expression e g high correlation of expression_profiles across multiple time series datasets however numbers of up or downregulated genes are often large making_it to discriminate between dependent co expression resulting from co regulation and independent co expression furthermore modules of co regulated_genes may only show tight co expression across a subset of the time series i e show condition_dependent regulation results wigwams is a simple and efficient method to identify gene_modules showing evidence for co regulation in multiple time series of gene_expression data wigwams analyzes similarities of gene_expression within each time series condition and directly tests the dependence or independence of these across different conditions the expression pattern of each gene in each subset of conditions is tested statistically as a potential signature of a condition_dependent regulatory mechanism_regulating multiple genes wigwams does not require particular time points and can process datasets that are on different time scales differential_expression relative to control conditions can be taken into account the output is succinct and non redundant enabling gene network_reconstruction to be focused on those gene_modules and combinations of conditions that show evidence for shared regulatory_mechanisms wigwams was run using six arabidopsis time series expression datasets producing a set of biologically_significant modules spanning different combinations of conditions availability_and a matlab_implementation of wigwams complete with graphical_user and documentation is available at elucidating the regulatory_mechanisms mediating biological_processes is a key challenge in many eukaryotic_organisms much regulation occurs at the transcriptional level however despite our ability to profile genome_wide gene_expression and the availability of bioinformatics_tools to analyze sequence_information our understanding of gene_regulatory underlying biological_processes is still relatively basic regulatory_interactions are often common meaning that the ability to understand the regulation of a response requires a mathematical or computational network model underlying these network models is the knowledge of regulatory_mechanisms techniques to identify regulatory_mechanisms such as genome_wide chromatin_immunoprecipitation and matrixbased yeast one hybrid y h have improved but these techniques are not high_throughput therefore it is crucial to be able to make high_quality predictions of regulatory_mechanisms using existing data these predictions can then be tested in focused experimental and modelling efforts time series experiments are often used to examine the dynamics of gene_expression and with the decreasing cost of profiling techniques more datasets covering multiple time series showing how an organism responds to different conditions are becoming available such data offer the opportunity to study shared regulatory_mechanisms that are used to regulate genes under more than one condition such shared regulatory_mechanisms may drive gene_expression in the same way in each time series or they may be modified to drive expression on a different time scale or to change the direction of regulation activation versus repression to facilitate gene network_reconstruction it is important to develop tools that can map out which gene_modules are coregulated in what combinations of conditions it is a long_standing assumption that co expression may reflect co regulation and using data from multiple conditions can improve the correlation between the two however in noisy biological_systems co regulated_genes may still show some differences in their expression and there may be more than one regulatory_mechanism that can drive genes with a particular expression pattern following a perturbation such as infection or treatment with a chemical stimulus many genes change in expression and even with high_resolution time series large_numbers of genes can to whom

similar expression_profile as a result it can be challenging to distinguish between dependent co expression indicative of coregulation and independent co expression of genes that achieve a similar expression pattern in different ways it is important to note that both dependent and independent co expression may pass statistical_tests that are geared towards testing the similarity of expression_patterns and or the tightness of a gene_cluster relative to other clusters therefore tools that solely aim to detect clusters of similarly expressed genes may not discriminate informative dependent co expression from uninformative independent co expression multiple high_resolution time series of gene_expression for a single_organism under different conditions provide a powerful approach for identifying dependent co expression of genes likely to be controlled by a common upstream_regulator however while an increasing number of time series would help to improve the specificity of co expression i e co expression across more time series is more likely to be dependent coexpression it is unlikely that a single group of genes will be co expressed across all the datasets for example it is known that there is significant cross_talk between signalling_networks for different plant_hormones in arabidopsis but not all of the components are playing a role in the response to every hormone furthermore some of the detected co expression across multiple datasets may still be independent co expression due to the abundance of particular expression_profiles rather than due to a shared regulatory_mechanism hence there is a need for an algorithm that can identify modules of genes dependently co expressed across subsets of time series data combining the increased specificity of multiple time series datasets with biological reality a myriad of clustering_algorithms have been developed to assign genes into clusters based on the similarity of their expression_profiles across a single time series or multiple static i e single or few time points datasets a few algorithms have also been developed to specifically cluster genes using two or more time series datasets such as bhc and splinecluster however these algorithms partition genes into clusters and do not enable identification of genes co expressed across subsets of the data a few methods are capable of identifying co expression across subsets of the data but these come with their own drawbacks tensor methods require the timescale of the experiments to be uniform throughout edisa does not require the same timescale across all of the datasets but it is non deterministic none of these methods is able to incorporate differential_expression relative to control time series into the analysis and crucially none statistically evaluates dependent co expression versus independent co expression enigma can account for genes differential_expression but the method was designed for a series of static expression data ccc biclustering tests biclusters for statistical_significance against a null_hypothesis of independent expression_profile evolution but the method is only capable of analyzing a single time course experiment wigwams wigwams identifies genes working across multiple situations is a simple deterministic and efficient method capable of identifying groups of dependently co expressed genes termed gene_modules spanning subsets of the available time series datasets wigwams is a comprehensive method all potential dataset combinations are scanned for gene_modules by rigorously testing putative gene_modules around each gene differentially_expressed in a dataset wigwams evaluates each putative module for statistical_significance and provides a non redundant output of gene_modules showing significant co expression across varying combinations of the time series data each gene may be assigned to one or more gene_modules or to no module at all wigwams requires little user input further aided by easy to use graphical_user and is computationally inexpensive and relatively fast making it a useful method to analyze_multiple time series experiments for evidence of co regulation we demonstrate that gene_modules identified by wigwams are often enriched for gene_ontology go terms and known transcription_factor tf_binding indicating biological_relevance we also provide experimental_evidence of potential co regulation wigwams is a powerful_tool to utilize the resolution of time series expression data in a statistically_rigorous approach for identification of co regulated gene_modules it can make a direct contribution to gene_regulatory analysis and computational_prediction of regulatory_mechanisms wigwams is a simple deterministic method capable of identifying groups of genes_exhibiting statistically_significant dependent coexpression across subsets of time series datasets and using that information to construct larger non redundant modules capturing broader transcriptional phenomena its comprehensive nature minimizes the odds of missing evidence of co regulation and the redundancy removal procedures provide the researcher with a succinct biologically informative output in some cases when examining the expression plots of gene_modules the module appears to exhibit co expression in conditions that are not deemed significant this demonstrates the power of wigwams to select modules with statistically_significant dependent co expression in these non significant conditions the given expression_profile may have been abundant and or the module members are not de in that time series i e expression_profile in the control samples was similar when comparing wigwams with other methods capable of identifying groups of genes co expressed across different subsets of time series data its main advantages are flexibility statistical_significance testing and relevance of the provided output additionally wigwams is able to account for differential_expression of genes in each of the time series and ensure that gene profiles are only tested for statistically_significant dependent co expression in relevant conditions the value of testing the statistical_significance of detected co expression can be seen when comparing wigwams with the edisa algorithm when run on a permuted dataset edisa identified several co expressed gene_modules whereas wigwams did not identify any furthermore we have shown the value of the comprehensive nature of wigwams it is capable of detecting dependent co expression that edisa misses see_supplementary for details on this analysis to our knowledge wigwams is the only algorithm capable of mining multiple time series on varying time scales for dependent co expression across subsets of the time series the modules produced by wigwams were demonstrated to be biologically_relevant due to enrichment of go terms and known tf_binding suggesting shared function and regulation between module members we also provide experimental_evidence for co regulation showing that in yeast a set of similar tfs bind to the promoters of multiple genes from a single wigwams module although y h does not indicate the conditions under which these tfs bind to the gene_promoters or whether they bind in planta it does indicate the potential for coregulation the wigwams tool is easy to use with intuitive graphical_user comprehensive documentation and output provided in a clear manner that can be readily analyzed by tools such as bingo and meme lab the algorithm is flexible and intuitive parameters can be used to tailor the output as desired additionally the module lists are saved as matlab cell structures enabling access to intermediate stages of wigwams analysis e g to identify the most statistically_significant original smaller gene_modules a more computationally_tractable version of the modified hypergeometric_test could enable modification of the wigwams method to obtain the p values for an overlap spanning k sets all the p values for k sets need to be generated if the tests were more efficient the algorithm could be modified to use correlation thresholds instead of pre defined set sizes when evaluating overlaps and non de genes could be excluded from any analysis without large adverse_effects on run time due to varying universe size between dataset combinations owing to the time and cost of experimental_approaches to genome_wide network elucidation computational inference of regulatory_networks from time series expression data is a useful approach however despite the multitude of inference methods available these methods are still only capable of inferring moderately_large dynamic networks wigwams provides output that can be used to extend network models_built with a subset of genes e g using tfs only integrating wigwams modules with a transcriptional_network model can also provide condition_dependent information such as indicating network neighbourhoods active during particular conditions wigwams modules can be viewed as the footprint of flux through regulatory_networks under different conditions and examining the abundance and functionality of modules for various combinations of conditions can provide insight into the commonality between the responses to different conditions at a more nuanced level than simple
