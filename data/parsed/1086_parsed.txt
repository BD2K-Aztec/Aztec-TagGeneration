composition and abstraction of logical regulatory_modules application to multicellular systems motivation logical boolean or multi valued modelling is widely used to study regulatory or signalling_networks even though these discrete models constitute a coarse yet useful abstraction of reality the analysis of large_networks faces a classical combinatorial problem here we propose to take advantage of the intrinsic modularity of inter cellular_networks to set up a compositional procedure that enables a significant reduction of the dynamics yet preserving the reach ability of stable_states to that end we rely on process algebras a well established computational technique for the specification and verification of interacting_systems results we develop a novel compositional approach to support the logical modelling of interconnected cellular_networks first we formalize the concept of logical regulatory_modules and their composition then we make this framework operational by transposing the composition of logical modules into a process algebra framework importantly the combination of incremental composition abstraction and minimization using an appropriate equivalence relation here the safety equivalence yields huge reductions of the dynamics we illustrate the potential of this approach with two case studies the segment polarity and the delta notch modules availability_and ginsimthe growing number of published models shows the suitability of qualitative logical modelling to study regulatory and signalling_networks e g however when dealing with large_networks a classical combinatorial explosion arises hampering efficient analyses of the dynamical_properties of these systems in particular reachability properties although efficient algorithms have been proposed to identify all stable_states via static analysis e g de dubrova and reachability analysis is hard to perform because it requires exploring the dynamics to address_this we propose to rely on the concepts of modularity and compositionality focusing on the multi valued logical formalism initially defined by thomas and co workers modularity has emerged as a key feature of molecular_networks e g but a precise_definition of functional regulatory_modules is still lacking let alone a method to decompose large intricate networks into such functional_modules nevertheless when cellular patterns are governed by both inter cellular_signals and intra cellular regulatory_networks it is natural to consider each cellular network as a module moreover based on previous_knowledge sub networks are often attributed specific functions within complex_cellular this is the case of the cell_cycle control for which specific modules are associated to check points entry or exit control of specific phases etc in a logical model was defined by combining three modules involved in the control of the budding_yeast cell_cycle logical modelling was also applied to multi cellular_networks controlling early embryonic developmental_processes in drosophila the composed models cited above were manually defined from smaller modules indeed little work on model composition has been carried_out although it has been identified as a major_goal in systems_biology generally existing composition procedures are not automatic and aim at properly defining a composed model while little attention is paid to the analysis of the potentially very large associated dynamics in any case these studies mainly focus on biochemical_reaction concerning the composition of logical regulatory_modules lrms a framework based on high_level petri_nets has been developed providing a formal and systematic procedure however it does not solve the scalability issue of the analysis since the resulting composed models have still to be analysed in a monolithic manner to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comconsider models in the form of sets of non linear differential_equations and propose three different ways of combining sub models composition fusion and aggregation model composition and fusion respectively keep or eliminate references to the original sub models while model aggregation requires that individual sub models come with their input and output ports similar to our definition of lrms these notions are important to distinguish different types of model combination but again they do not address the issue of analysing the resulting models in this article we simply refer to the combination of models as model composition process algebras aim at representing and analysing complex interacting discrete systems this framework has led to the development of compositional approaches that mitigate the combinatorial explosion problem through the minimization of the individual dynamics while preserving properties of interest and then by incrementally composing and minimizing intermediate dynamics until a description of the global behaviour is obtained process algebras have already been considered for biological_processes see e g ciocchetta and hillston and references therein adopting different modelling approaches recently a compositional algorithm was proposed for gene_regulatory modelled as piecewise_linear ode systems to check the reachability of a specific steady_state from an initial condition in contrast we determine all stable_states reachable from a given initial condition see section for a comparison of the two approaches in this article we propose a new computational_approach to cope with the combinatorial explosion that hampers proper analyses of models defined as compositions of lrms for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the composition of identical modules which is often the case of multi cellular_systems in any case this constitutes an important class of applications that notably includes most of the patterning problems in developmental_biology furthermore we are concerned with the reachability of stable_states that is a property of real interest for differentiation regulatory_networks we thus define a framework to compose logical modules by means of logical integration functions describing how modules interact with their neighbours we establish a constructive method to determine the dynamics of the composition from the dynamics of the individual modules and their interactions then we rely on process algebra techniques to generate abstract and minimize the behaviours of the modules yet preserving reachability properties these dynamics are iteratively combined and minimized to obtain a final reduced description of the dynamics of the composed model minimization relies on an equivalence relation which is chosen depending on the property to be preserved here we rely on the safety equivalence that preserves the reachability of the stable_states while ensuring significant reductions of the dynamics for the implementation we use the cadp toolbox construction and analysis of distributed processes to specify the dynamics of the logical modules and to implement operations of abstraction minimization and incremental composition the article is organized as follows first in section we introduce the modelling framework with formal definitions of lrm logical integration function composition rules as well as the corresponding dynamics section_presents the principles of abstraction and minimization relying on classical process algebra operations other implementation aspects are also briefly_discussed section includes the application of our procedure to the segment polarity and the delta notch modules these case studies illustrate the potential of our approach to analyse crucial properties of composed lrms dynamics that are far too large to be comprehensively tackled with currently available tools
