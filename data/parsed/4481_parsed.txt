gene_expression survjamda an r package to predict patients'_survival and risk_assessment using joint analysis of microarray_gene survjamda survival_prediction by joint analysis of microarray_data is an r package that utilizes joint analysis of microarray_gene to predict patients survival and risk_assessment joint analysis can be performed by merging datasets or meta_analysis to increase the sample_size and to improve_survival prognosis the prognosis performance derived from the combined datasets can be assessed to determine which feature_selection approach joint analysis method and bias estimation provide the most robust prognosis for a given set of datasets availability the survjamda package is available at the comprehensive_r http cran rthe survjamda package was developed for survival_prediction and risk_assessment based on microarray_data it allows to jointly analyze the datasets through data merging and meta_analysis data merging combines the data into one set prior to their analysis whereas meta_analysis integrates only the results in addition to different joint analysis methods survjamda contains various feature_selection approaches and bias estimation_techniques which enable the user to determine the combination of which methods provides the most robust prediction for a given set of datasets a few other r packages like ipdmeta and survcomp have been created for joint analysis that are more specifically related to meta_analysis of censored_data with time to event outcome
