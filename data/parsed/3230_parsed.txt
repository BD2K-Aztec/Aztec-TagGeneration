gene_expression network based analysis_identifies epigenetic biomarkers of esophageal_squamous progression motivation a rapid progression of esophageal squamous_cell carcin oma escc causes a high mortality_rate because of the propensity for metastasis driven by genetic and epigenetic_alterations the identification of prognostic_biomarkers would help prevent or control meta static progression expression analyses have been used to find such markers but do not always validate in separate cohorts epigenetic_marks such as dna_methylation are a potential source of more reliable and stable biomarkers importantly the integration of both expression and epigenetic_alterations is more likely to identify relevant biomarkers results we present a new analysis framework using escc progression associated gene_regulatory grn escc to identify differentially_methylated prognostic of escc progression from the cpg loci differentially_methylated in tumornormal pairs we selected cpg loci most highly associated with survival and located in the promoters of genes more likely to belong to grn escc using an independent escc cohort we confirmed that of cpg loci in the promoter of grn escc genes significantly correlated with patient_survival in contrast cpg loci in the promoter genes outside the grn escc were correlated with patient_survival we further characterized the grn escc network_topology and observed that the genes with methylated cpg loci associated with survival deviated from the center of mass and were less likely to be hubs in the grn escc we postulate that our analysis framework improves the identification of bona_fide prognostic_biomarkers from dna_methylation studies especially with partial genome_coverage contact recently systematic biological approaches to study cancer have provided unprecedented views of molecular changes in many cancers for example the mutagenesis within a network of general human cancer signaling genes and the protein expression within a proteinprotein_interaction have led to the discovery of subnetworks involving cancer_related the combination of proteinprotein networks with gene_expression microarray_datasets has also been used to distinguish metastatic from non metastatic tumor_samples or to identify_biomarkers correlated with patient_survival more recently used a genetic network as a reference to estimate the penalty score of a conditional_logistic and applied it on a matched tumornormal analysis of dna_methylation array data to identify a list of candidate cpg_sites associated with hepatocellular_cancer development attempted to integrate more biological resources like the epigenomic transcriptomic and protein interactome data to identify glioblastoma prognostic_biomarkers using gene_expression and dna_methylation based networks although dna_methylation can be used as a powerful and promising prognostic_indicator alone none of the aforementioned network based studies integrating dna_methylation gene_expression or protein expression information performed experimental_validation of the identified biomarkers this can be because of the large number of candidate_biomarkers within networks making their validation and use in the clinic more difficult affecting patients annually esophageal_carcinoma with squamous_cell escc as the predominant histological_subtype worldwide is the sixth leading cause of cancerrelated mortality with deaths per year late presentation with already existing lymph_node lnm followed by rapid progression explains the poor_outcome of the disease metastasis requires certain steps like primary_tumor initialization and proliferation blood_vessel lymphatic channel intravasation cell arrest and extravasation to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as and proliferation at secondary target_sites organs metastasis can arise from tumor_cells that have undergone phenotypic changes called epithelial_to emt gaining plasticity and circulating and seeding ability there is no observable change in dna_methylation during the transforming_growth mediated emt in aml mouse hepatocyte but such dna_methylation is able to be involved in gene_regulation during the emt of prostate cell_line ep t identifying epigenetic_alterations occurring during escc progression is therefore not only essential for a detailed understanding of the molecular_biology underlying the disease_progression but also to improve clinical prognosis and develop more sophisticated treatment_strategies until now only few genomic_regions such as the retrotransposon related long_interspersed element or the gene_regulatory showing methylation alterations have been identified as possible biomarkers for lnm and or patient_survival in escc of the gene_annotation based studies hyper methylation at cpg islands cgis in the vicinities of pax paired box and rn skp rna sk small_nuclear pseudogene were significantly associated with lnm and disease_free in patients hyper methylated cgis located within uchl ubiquitin carboxyl_terminal esterase l fhit fragile histidine triad grin b glutamate_receptor ionotropic n_methyl b and gadd g growth_arrest inducible gamma promoter_regions were associated with poor_survival however these studies only validated cpg_sites in a small set of candidate_genes therefore limiting the scope of the findings a more comprehensive analysis is likely to reveal new dna_methylation as biomarkers associated with lnm and survival in this study we use a new comprehensive approach to efficiently identify and validate dna methylation_sites as putative prognostic_biomarkers of escc progression we propose an intuitive framework and demonstrate its ability to identify cpg_sites of prognostic value the framework leverages an escc progression associated gene_regulatory grn escc to identify methylated sites with significant prognostic value by taking_into differentially_methylated whose corresponding gene_promoters are ranked the ranked cpg_sites are purified selected via a top k precision test in network we validate the results on a selection of cpg loci in a separate cohort of escc patients and demonstrate that this framework is capable of identifying novel sites of dna_methylation with prognostic_impact that had not been discovered by previous_approaches
