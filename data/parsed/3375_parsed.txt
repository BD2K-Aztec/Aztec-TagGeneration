optimized application of penalized regression_methods to diverse genomic_data motivation penalized regression_methods have been adopted widely for high_dimensional feature_selection and prediction in many bioinformatic and biostatistical contexts while their theoretical_properties are well understood specific methodology for their optimal application to genomic_data has not been determined results through simulation of contrasting scenarios of correlated high_dimensional survival data we compared the lasso ridge and elastic_net penalties for prediction and variable_selection we found that a d tuning of the elastic_net penalties was necessary to avoid mimicking the performance of lasso or ridge_regression furthermore we found that in a simulated scenario favoring the lasso penalty a univariate pre filter made the elastic_net behave more like ridge_regression which was detrimental to prediction_performance we demonstrate the real_life application of these methods to predicting the survival of cancer patients from microarray_data and to classification of obese and lean individuals from metagenomic_data based on these results we provide an optimized set of guidelines for the application of penalized_regression for reproducible class comparison and prediction with genomic_data availability_and a parallelized implementation of the methods presented for regression and for simulation of synthetic data is provided as the pensim r package available at http cran r project org_web pensim index html multivariate_regression is a flexible machine_learning suited to prediction of discrete continuous and censored time toevent survival_outcomes from arbitrary combinations of predictor variable classes in genomic settings collinear predictors typically greatly outnumber available samples p n a now classic example being the prediction of cancer patient_survival from tumor gene to whom correspondence should be addressed expression data in this setting ordinary regression is subject to overfitting and instability of coefficients and stepwise variable_selection methods do not scale well regression has been successfully adapted to high_dimensional situations by penalization methods review by and penalized_regression has been shown to outperform univariate and other multivariate regression_methods in multiple genomic_datasets two penalization methods and a hybrid of these are most commonly used ridge_regression uses a penalty on the l norm of the coefficients which introduces bias in the prediction_error in exchange for reduced variance however ridge_regression keeps all variables in the model and thus cannot produce a parsimonious model from many variables lasso_regression penalizes the l norm which tends to reduce many coefficients to exactly zero and thus performs variable_selection in addition to prediction however the lasso has been noted to be inferior to ridge_regression for prediction in lower dimensional situations and tends to select only one of a group of collinear variables which may not always be desirable thus proposed the elastic_net penalizing both the l and l norms with individual tuning parameters as a way to achieve the best of both lasso and ridge these three variants of penalized regressionlasso ridge and elastic nethave since been applied to a variety of phenotype prediction tasks using genomic_data for example several previous simulation_studies have investigated properties of the elastic_net the lasso and ridge_regression but have not compared all these methods with alternative_strategies for their application we present a comprehensive assessment and optimization of these methods using two contrasting configurations of simulated genomic_data and two genome_scale experimental_datasets comparative_studies of this nature provide the most realistic and unbiased assessments of available machine_learning issues which have been identified as critical to researchers selection of appropriate methodology we introduce a d optimization of the elastic_net penalty parameters and show that it or a comparable procedure is necessaryto establish optimized guidelines for reproducibly linking genomic_features such as gene_expression to outcome using penalized_regression we compared the lasso ridge_regression and elastic_net with three strategies for d tuning of its penalty parameters we additionally varied the stringencies of an optional univariate pre filter and evaluated two methods for selecting from repeated tunings using simulated high_dimensional with several configurations of signal_to and censoring of survival_outcomes results of these simulations along with current best practices for high_dimensional model assessment were used to guide analyses of two publicly_available experimental_datasets a microarray experiment investigating survival of cancer patients with lung_adenocarcinomas and metagenomic_data from the metahit consortium describing the composition of gene function in the gut microbiotas of lean and obese_individuals based on the results of these simulations and subsequent comparable analyses of real experimental_data we provide a set of guidelines for penalized regression_analysis of diverse high_dimensional
