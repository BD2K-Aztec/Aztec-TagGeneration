data_and organismtagger detection normalization and grounding of organism entities in biomedical documents motivation semantic tagging of organism mentions in full_text is an important part of literature mining and semantic enrichment solutions tagged organism mentions also play_a in disambiguating other entities in a text such as proteins a high_precision organism tagging system must be able to detect the numerous forms of organism mentions including common names as well as the traditional taxonomic_groups genus species and strains in addition such a system must resolve abbreviations and acronyms assign the scientific name and if possible link the detected mention to the ncbi taxonomy database for further semantic queries and literature navigation results we present the organismtagger a hybrid rule_based machine_learning system to extract organism mentions from the literature it includes tools for automatically generating lexical and ontological resources from a copy of the ncbi taxonomy database thereby facilitating system updates by end_users its novel ontology_based resources can also be reused in other semantic mining and linked data tasks each detected organism mention is normalized to a canonical name through the resolution of acronyms and abbreviations and subsequently grounded with an ncbi taxonomy database id in particular our system combines a novel machine_learning approach with rule_based and lexical methods for detecting strain mentions in documents on our manually_annotated ot corpus the organismtagger achieves a precision of a recall of and a grounding accuracy of on the manually_annotated corpus of linnaeus the results show a precision of recall of and grounding accuracy of availability the organismtagger including supporting tools resources training data and manual annotations as well as end_user and developer documentation is freely_available under an open_source at http www semanticsoftware info organism tagger text_mining solutions have become an integral part of biomedical_research an important class of entities to detect through natural_language nlp techniques are organisms their detection facilitates taxonomy aware text_mining systems and provides users with the ability to find relevant subsets of papers based on species specific queries when textual mentions are further annotated with an external database identifier they can provide additional benefits for disambiguation in the recognition of other named_entities such as mutations proteins or genes primarily organism mentions are based on established hierarchical nomenclature conventions defined in the th century however the recognition of taxonomic_groups in texts presents a number of ongoing challenges specifically there is considerable ambiguity in the way taxonomic information is formulated in scientific documents abbreviations of species names are widespread and the use of common english names instead of latin names further obscures the taxonomic identity of the organisms described in a text the use of acronyms which can be both species specific and species independent also poses_challenges for recognition tasks lastly incorrect spellings have created yet more ambiguity finding organism mentions is the task of named entity ne detection simply tagging an entity as an organism is however not sufficient for more advanced text_mining tasks to account for variability within the same document e g the use of both abbreviated and full forms each mention of an organism must be additionally tagged with a canonical name through normalization these unique names can then be used for downstream_analysis tasks like co reference resolution to facilitate the disambiguation of other entities in a text additional analysis so_called grounding is required in order to create a link between a textual reference and its entry in an external database combined with semantic technologies such as ontologies and reasoners further knowledge_discovery approaches are made possible given the labile nature of scientific_knowledge in the era of high_throughput biology online_resources are frequently updated and custom applications dependent on such resources must also be readily updated to avoid latency of processed content consequently the ability to easily update the organism tagging system with respect to external taxonomic resources becomes an additional requirement further technical requirements include configurability for different classes of organisms the free availability of the system for its incorporation into custom analysis_pipelines multicore multiprocessor scalability embedded or web_service execution and integration into common desktop clients to facilitate literature mining to address these challenges a number of species name recognition systems have been developed in line with the goals of the organismtagger a recent work resolves the ambiguity of genes and gene_products with respect to model_organisms in addition a corpus annotated with protein gene mentions associated with species ids is provided in this system detection of species words is simply done by list matching this list includes the organism names from two dictionariesncbi taxonomy and the uniprot controlled_vocabulary of taxa gene mentions are then tagged with species ids with different methods like heuristic rules supervised_classification with a maximum_entropy model and parsers taxongrab uses a lexicon of english_words combination of wordnet and specialist excluding the terms from ncbi taxonomy the integrated taxonomic information system and the german collection of microorganisms and cell_cultures to compare against a text detected sets of two or three consecutive words that do not exist in the lexicon are further validated with regular expressions the performance of their system is tested on volume of the birds of the belgian congo by james paul chapin with a precision of and recall of findit a web_service tries to index the taxonomic names using pattern matching expressions and a lexicon of english_words providing a confidence_score for resultant names rule_based word frequency and regular expression based_approaches manage to capture genusspecies combinations with high levels of precision and recall in some implementations this is achieved without further grounding to database_identifiers in some cases grounding to database_identifiers or nodes in a taxonomic tree is made examples are taxonfinder http code google com p taxon finder and ubiorss for such systems common names still pose problems whereas gazetteer based_approaches are able to handle common name issues a number of gazetteer based web_services are available for entity recognition and normalization such as whatizit most recently the linnaeus system has illustrated good performance tagging species names in biomedical texts using a gazetteer species dictionary combined with post_processing techniques for disambiguation acronym resolution and filtering however all these existing_approaches have difficulties recognizing and disambiguating strain level information our organismtagger addresses the above challenges with a number of novel contributions i provision of semantic data models for organisms that can be re used in other applications ii tools for automatically generating organism specific resources derived from the ncbi taxonomy database iii a text_mining pipeline for organism detection normalization and grounding iv a machine_learning based_classifier for strain detection v flexible system architecture for running the system embedded stand alone published as a web_service or integrated into a number of desktop clients we first present an overview of the organismtagger in section section_describes existing taxonomy resources and section their integration into our system the text_mining pipeline is then described in section followed by its evaluation in section and conclusions in section the performance of the organismtagger v is evaluated in three different steps first the mentions of the organisms are evaluated against the gold_standard without taking the ncbi ids into consideration detected entities in in this step the focus is on the entity recognition_performance of the organismtagger the performance is further evaluated based on the normalized mentions of the organisms normalized if the organism is not successfully normalized it is removed from the list of retrieved organisms and finally the computed ncbi ids are compared against the manual annotations specified as grounded linnaeus a species name identification system uses deterministic finite_state automatons dfa to capture species mentions and then assign them their ncbi taxonomy ids however when the full form appears but no ncbi ids exist for the species all the abbreviated forms of this species are associated with other possible ncbi ids to compare our results with the results of the linnaeus system v we applied it in the same way as the organismtagger on the manually_annotated corpora the results for the linnaeus system are also shown in false_negatives of the organismtagger in the linnaeus corpora are mainly due to misspellings some acronyms resembling gene and protein_names are filtered for minimizing error propagation these acronym mentions are ignored by the organismtagger also we do not cover the occurrence of species ranked as no rank in the taxonomy database e g salmonella_typhimurium the linnaeus system uses additional synonyms to capture terms like patient and children this is reflected by the recall section of the l a corpus for better comparison of the linnaeus performance with that of our system these additional synonyms of the linnaeus system are ignored in the l b l c and l d corpora false_positive mentions in the linnaeus corpora arise from common names like small white for pieris rapae ncbi id and white underwing for catocala relicta ncbi id some acronyms namely par and atv captured by the organismtagger refer to non organism mentions we expect that in some cases problematic acronyms can be filtered out by more accurate protein and gene name lists however the elimination of all false_positives will negatively impact on recall false_negatives of the linnaeus system are due to its inability to handle ligatures and the limited strain recognition which is analyzed in more detail below moreover some organisms are renamed and the old names usually appear following the new names in parentheses like in emericella aspergillus_nidulans these cases are also ignored by the linnaeus system while many abbreviated organisms can be resolved to their nonabbreviated form after locating the full form in the document a few still remain ambiguous using our additional heuristic some of these ambiguous organisms can be resolved to their non abbreviated format in particular l d contains abbreviated organism mentions without the corresponding full form and ot b contains mentions after applying the second normalization heuristic the organismtagger successfully resolved and in l d and ot b respectively we also performed comparisons with other systems but do not report them in detail here as their performance is generally below that of the linnaeus system using a combination of a lexicon with non taxonomic words and rules taxongrab finds the longest match without grounding the entity nactem species word detector and nactem species disambiguator mostly annotate the species level for example pseudomonas_fluorescens subsp cellulosa is grounded with the ncbi taxonomy id and bacillus_sp strain c is grounded with the ncbi taxonomy id the strain level of the organism mentions is usually ignored by the aforementioned taggers
