structural_bioinformatics peakr simulating solid_state nmr_spectra of proteins motivation when analyzing solid_state nmr_spectra of proteins assignment of resonances to nuclei and derivation of restraints for d structure calculations are challenging and time consuming processes simulated spectra that have been calculated based on for example chemical_shift predictions and structural_models can be of considerable help existing solutions are typically limited in the type of experiment they can consider and difficult to adapt to different settings results here we present peakr a software to simulate solid_state nmr_spectra of proteins it can generate simulated spectra based on numerous common types of internuclear correlations relevant for assignment and structure_elucidation can compare simulated and experimental_spectra and produces lists and visualizations useful for analyzing measured spectra compared with other solutions it is fast versatile and user_friendly availability_and peakr is maintained under the gpl license and can be accessed at http www peakr org the source_code can be obtained on request from the authors in recent_years solid_state nmr has made significant progress in studying structure and function of biomolecules such as membrane_proteins and protein fibrils for reviews see however especially for larger proteins resonance assignment and determination of restraints for d structure calculations are still difficult and time consuming processes owing to often limited spectral_resolution and chemical_shift ambiguity as well as complex relationships between internuclear distances and signal_intensities these problems especially apply to through space correlations that cannot be traced along the chemical bond network for the assignment of resonances and the extraction of restraints it has been proven helpful to have simulated spectra sometimes referred to as spectrum predictions at hand simulated spectra can be calculated based on amino_acid known or modeled d structures chemical_shift assignments or predictions from tools such as shiftx and the type of correlation probed in the respective experiment this way cross peak assignments can be suggested and for example it can be investigated whether an experimental_spectrum can be explained by a given structural model simulated spectra can also be used in an iterative process of obtaining shift assignments and refining the molecular_structure at the same time existing software for the simulation of nmr_spectra is usually tailored to calculating spectra of small_molecules in solution acd labs nmr or to specifically simulate noesy spectra in the context of nmr protein structure_determination and references therein some nmr_data analysis software_packages such as sparky goddard and kneller nmrpipe and ccpnmr contain routines for simulation of protein nmr_spectra but these are often not straightforward to use or do not work in a stand alone manner moreover with the exception of recent additions to ccpnmr they are usually more adapted to solution_state correlation types thus far spectrum simulation has typically been carried_out using general_purpose tools like spreadsheet software or custom made programs limited in flexibility and usability thus it would be desirable to be able to simulate a wide_range of solid_state nmr_experiments commonly used for resonance assignment and structure_elucidation with a single software_tool that is flexible enough to swiftly handle changes in input_data such as chemical_shift values structural_models or labeling patterns we implemented peakr a software_package that fulfills these requirements based on chemical_shifts provided by the user or predicted by built in third_party software_tools spectra for d n c and c c intra_and residue as well as through space correlations can be computed quickly and can easily be adapted to specific needs using the calculated spectra to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as presented in part at the rd international conference on magnetic_resonance in biological_systems icmrbs august san_diego ca usa and in odronitz f genomics and phylogeny of motor proteins tools and analyses phd thesis university of gottingengottingen germany http webdoc sub gwdg de diss odro nitz visual and numerical comparisons between simulated and measured data are possible peakr is available through a web_interface www peakr org
