system biology okvar boost a novel boosting algorithm to infer nonlinear_dynamics and interactions in gene_regulatory motivation reverse_engineering of gene_regulatory remains a central challenge in computational_systems despite recent_advances facilitated by benchmark in silico challenges that have aided in calibrating their performance a number of approaches using either perturbation knock_out or wild_type time series data have appeared in the literature addressing this problem with the latter using linear temporal models nonlinear dynamical_models are particularly appropriate for this inference task given the generation mechanism of the time series data in this study we introduce a novel nonlinear autoregressive model based on operator valued kernels that simultaneously learns the model_parameters as well as the network_structure results a flexible boosting algorithm okvar boost that shares features from l boosting and randomization based_algorithms is developed to perform the tasks of parameter learning and network_inference for the proposed model specifically at each boosting iteration a regularized operator valued kernel_based vector autoregressive model okvar is trained on a random subnetwork the final model consists of an ensemble of such models the empirical estimation of the ensemble models jacobian matrix provides an estimation of the network_structure the performance of the proposed algorithm is first evaluated on a number of benchmark_datasets from the dream_challenge and then on real_datasets related to the in vivo reverse_engineering and modeling assessment irma and t cell networks the high_quality results obtained strongly indicate that it outperforms existing_approaches availability the okvar boost matlab_code is available as the archive http amis group fr sourcecode okvar boost okvarboostthe ability to reconstruct cellular_networks plays an important role in our understanding of how genes interact with each other and how this information_flow coordinates gene_regulation and expression in the cell gene_regulatory grn have the potential to provide us with the cellular_context of all genes of interest as well as with a means to identify specific subnetworks that are malfunctioning in a given disease_state a diverse suite of mathematical tools has been developed and used to infer gene regulatory_interactions from spatial and temporal high_throughput seeand references therein a fair comparison for the relative_merits of these methods requires their evaluation on benchmark_datasets which the dream dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods project provided it aims to understand the strengths and the limitations of various algorithms to reconstruct cellular_networks from high_throughput data in addition to the choice of the algorithm network_reconstruction heavily depends on the input_data type used data that measure the response of the cell to perturbationseither by knocking out or silencing genesare particularly useful for such reconstructions because they offer the potential to obtain a detailed view of cellular_functions the downside is that obtaining large_scale perturbation data is expensive and relatively few methods have been proposed in the literature to infer regulatory_networks from such data due to computational challenges data from time course gene_expression experiments have the potential to reveal regulatory_interactions as they are induced over time a number of methods have been used for this task including dynamic_bayesian granger_causality models see shojaie and michailidis b and references therein and state_space models the first set of methods is computationally_demanding while the latter two use linear dynamics hence limiting their appeal other approaches are based on assumptions about the parametric nature of the dynamical_model and resort to time consuming evolutionary algorithms to learn the network moreover in spite of the rich collection of methods used to solve the topology and dynamics of grns certain types of errors continue to to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their

improvement this study makes a number of key contributions to the challenging_problem of network_inference based solely on timecourse data it introduces a powerful network_inference framework based on nonlinear autoregressive modeling and jacobian estimation the proposed_framework is rich and flexible using penalized regression_models that coupled with randomized search algorithms and features of l boosting prove particularly effective as the extensive simulation_results attest the models used require tuning of a number of parameters and we introduce a novel and generally_applicable strategy that combines bootstrapping with stability_selection to achieve_this
