structural_bioinformatics deep architectures for protein contact_map motivation residueresidue contact_prediction is important for protein_structure and other applications however the accuracy of current contact predictors often barely exceeds on long_range falling short of the level required for ab_initio structure_prediction results here we develop a novel machine_learning approach for contact_map using three steps of increasing resolution first we use d recursive neural_networks to predict coarse contacts and orientations between secondary_structure second we use an energy based method to align secondary_structure and predict contact probabilities between residues in contacting alpha_helices or strands third we use a deep neural_network architecture to organize and progressively refine the prediction of contacts integrating information over both space and time we train the architecture on a large set of non redundant proteins and test it on a large set of non homologous domains as well as on the set of protein_domains used for contact_prediction in the two most recent casp and casp experiments for long_range the accuracy of the new cmappro predictor is close to a significant increase over existing_approaches availability cmappro is available as part of the scratch suite atprotein residueresidue contact_prediction is the problem of predicting whether any two residues in a protein_sequence are spatially close to each other in the folded d structure contacts occurring between sequentially distant residues i e long_range impose strong constraints on the d structure of a protein and are particularly important for structural_analyses understanding the folding_process and predicting the d structure even a small set of correctly_predicted long_range can be useful for improving ab_initio structure_prediction for proteins without known templates the performance of many contact predictors has been assessed every years during the critical assessment of protein_structure casp experiments since casp in unfortunately the accuracy for long_range routinely reported at casp for the best predictors suggests that contact_prediction is not yet accurate enough to be systematically useful for ab_initio protein_structure or engineering in broad terms there are four main approaches for residue residue_contact machine_learning use methods such as neural_networks recursive neural_networks support_vector and hidden_markov to learn how to predict contact probabilities from a training_set of experimentally_determined protein_structures inputs to these approaches typically include predicted_secondary predicted solvent_accessibility as well as evolutionary_information in the form of profiles template based_approaches use homology or threading methods to identify structurally_similar templates from which residueresidue contacts are then inferred correlated_mutations approaches apply statistical_measures such as pearson_correlation and mutual_information to multiple_alignments in order to identify pairs of residues that co evolve and thus are likely to be in contact recently a new elegant mutual_information based measure for correlated_mutations psicov has been proposed inand used for fold_recognition although this method has been reported to yield significant accuracy improvements its performance is very dependent on the availability and quality of multiple_alignments finally d model based_approaches rely on predicted d structures for deriving distance constraints through a consensus strategy although d model based_approaches have been reported to be the most accurate at casp in practice their applicability remain somewhat limited since the main goal of contact_prediction is to improve ab_initio structure_prediction and not the converse here we introduce several new ideas for contact_prediction using primarily a multi_stage machine_learning approach with increasingly refined levels of resolution first we predict coarse contact_maps corresponding to contacts between secondary_structure by itself the idea of coarse contact_maps is not new and several useful methods have been developed yet none of these approaches has been able to convincingly demonstrate that coarse prediction is useful for residue residue_contact here we both refine the previous coarse prediction_methods in part by extending the notion of to whom correspondence should be addressed coarse contact beyond a simple binary value to include information about orientation parallel versus anti_parallel between contacting segments and demonstrate that coarse_grained prediction can be used to improve fine_grained prediction of contact_maps second we use a novel energy based neural_network approach to refine the prediction of the alignment and orientation of contacting secondary_structure and predict residueresidue_contact probabilities for residues in contacting pairs of alphahelices or beta_strands finally we introduce a deep neural_network architecture in the form of a deep stack of neural_networks with the same topology but different parameters to predict all the residueresidue_contact probabilities by integrating information both spatially_and spatial integration refers to the idea that contacts are spatially_correlated for instance long_range often include other long_range in their neighborhood temporal integration refers to the idea that protein_folding is not an instantaneous physical process although the stack is not necessarily meant to mimic the actual physical process the stack is used to organize the prediction in such a way that each level in the stack is meant to refine the prediction produced by the previous level inputs at a given level of the stack include both information coming from the previous level in the stack as well as static information produced by the previous coarse prediction stages as well as predicted_secondary and solvent_accessibility and evolutionary profiles thus these dynamic and static inputs are used to iteratively refine the contact_prediction we next describe these methods in detail together with the data used for rigorous training and assessment results here we have introduced a new approach for the prediction of protein contact_maps in particular partly inspired by the observation that nature uses an iterative refinement approach to compute the structure of proteins we have developed modular deep architectures that can integrate_information over multiple temporal_and in rigorous tests these architectures have been shown to predict contact_maps with an accuracy close to a significant_improvement although further improvements are necessary it should be obvious that there are many generalizations and variations on the architectures and training methods we have described that remain to be explored giving us hope that further progress lies ahead
