genome_analysis rapid match searching for gene_silencing assessment motivation gene_silencing also called rna_interference requires reliable assessment of silencer impacts a critical task is to find matches between silencer oligomers and sites in the genome in accordance with one to many matching rules gu matching with provision for mismatches fast search algorithms are required to support silencer impact assessments in procedures for designing_effective silencer sequences results the article_presents a matching algorithm and data_structures specialized for matching searches including a kernel procedure that addresses a boolean version of the database task called the skyline search besides exact_matches the algorithm is extended to allow for the location specific mismatches applicable in plants computational tests show that the algorithm is significantly_faster than suffix_tree alternatives gene_silencing involves mechanisms to suppress the expression of particular genes these mechanisms also called rna_interference rnai contribute to the development of organisms and to protection against viral attacks they also have important experimental and therapeutic_applications the silencing process studied in this article commences with the formation of doublestranded rna dsrna molecules either as part of an organisms normal functions or via a synthetic_pathway the dsrnas are processed into single_stranded oligomers called microrna mirna or small_interfering sirna depending on the origin of the dsrna mirna is formed from irregular pseudohairpin mirna precursor molecules whereas sirna is formed from long double_stranded or hairpin rna the rna oligomers then are inserted into risc protein_complexes which they guide to matching sites on messenger_rna mrna_molecules encoded by the genome when a match is found between a guiding oligomer and an mrna the risc cleaves the mrna causing its destruction in plants the main focus of the present research the oligomers directly involved in the silencing process are predominantly bases to whom correspondence should be addressed in length in both the mirna and sirna pathways in synthetic rnai applications the rna oligomers are used to suppress the expression of one or more target_genes an important task here is to formulate sequences for the oligomers and in practice their precursors so that they will have substantial impact on the targets while minimizing their impact on non target_genes i e cross silencing one strand of research in this respect concerns the identification of sites in mrna where silencing is likely to occur in addition methods have been developed for assessing the silencing impact expected from any given candidate silencer based on an identification of all matching sites in the mrna these methods use classical energy minimizing rna_folding techniques and are evidently highly_reliable but they are extremely demanding in terms of computational time fast performance in identifying matching sites is important because the search for an effective design may require an assessment of large_numbers of candidates this is so especially in the case of long hairpin silencers where the complexity of the design task is augmented by the spawning of multiple_overlapping oligomers from a single hairpin rna_molecule a matching relationship involves a pairing of the reversecomplement of a silencer candidate with an mrna location with allowance for gu variants and some tolerance for mismatches a widely used technique for finding matches commences by taking the reverse complement of the candidate silencer for which a direct match is then sought in the mrna which allows the use of suffix_tree algorithms the suffix_tree approach has been extended in recent_years in the guugle software which implements a direct search for complementary matches including built in provision for gu matching suffix_tree algorithms have been adapted also to handle a wide_range of mismatches notably in the flexible pattern matching capabilities provided by the stan software this article proposes an alternative to the suffix_tree approach the genome is represented as an in memory map of mers and the matching rules are incorporated in an algorithm that seeks matches within this map the aim has been to develop a fast search_procedure with modest memory_requirements for use especially in optimization procedures for constructing effective hairpin silencers this article has presented techniques to enable rapid prediction of the locations where a given silencer is likely to have impact on a given genome the techniques as implemented in the omo software have been shown to be faster than guugle by a factor of at least and therefore will be valuable where performance is critical e g in optimization procedures omo is thus well suited to applications notably optimizationrequiring large_numbers of searches for ad_hoc queries the overhead associated with initial input of the binary file could be eliminated through a persistent memory implementation e g providing omo as a web_service other notable aspects of the research include the development of a specialized coding scheme for direct testing of matches including gu matches the elucidation of reductions for testing of mismatches and the identification of a fundamental search taska boolean variant of skyline searchwhich apparently has not been addressed previously
