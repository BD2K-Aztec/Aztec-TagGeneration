systems_biology an integrated open framework for thermodynamics of reactions that combines accuracy and coverage motivation the laws of thermodynamics describe a direct quantitative relationship between metabolite_concentrations and reaction directionality despite great efforts thermodynamic data suffer from limited coverage scattered accessibility and non standard annotations we present a framework for unifying thermodynamic data from multiple sources and demonstrate two new techniques for extrapolating the gibbs energies of unmeasured reactions and conditions results both methods account for changes in cellular conditions ph ionic_strength etc by using linear_regression over the g of pseudoisomers and reactions the pseudoisomeric reactant contribution method systematically infers compound formation energies using measured k and pk a data the pseudoisomeric group contribution method extends the group contribution method and achieves a high coverage of unmeasured reactions we define a continuous index that predicts the reversibility of a reaction under a given physiological_concentration range in the characteristic physiological_range m mm we find that roughly_half of the reactions in escherichia colis metabolism are reversible these new tools can increase the accuracy of thermodynamic based models especially in non standard ph and ionic_strengths the reversibility index can help modelers decide which reactions are reversible in physiological_conditions availability freely_available on the web at http equilibrator weizmann ac il website implemented in python mysql apache and django with all_major the framework is open source_code google comthe study of metabolism has recently regained its central role in diverse areas of cell_biology physiology medicine and systems_biology the study of metabolic_pathways and networks aims to better understand the complex behaviour of living_organisms as well as their manipulation for human needs the thermodynamics of biochemical_reactions is of special interest in the analysis and design of metabolic_pathways the change in the gibbs_free g characterizes the thermodynamic balance of biochemical_reactions and dictates the direction of net_flux the difference between forward and backward fluxes in a reaction it is thus useful for the study of a single enzymatic_reaction for analyzing entire metabolic_pathways vojinovicvojinovic and von and for the large_scale modeling of whole cell metabolic_networks a reaction at equilibrium carries no net_flux at equilibrium in a specific ph the apparent reaction quotient q the ratio of product to substrate concentrationsis termed the apparent equilibrium_constant and denoted by k in ideal dilute_solutions the transformed gibbs_energy of reaction is a function of the apparent reaction quotient r g rtln k q the standard transformed gibbs_energy of reaction r g bullet is the value of r g at standard conditions i e when all compound concentrations are m therefore r g bullet rtlnk i r g determines the direction of net_flux in a reaction a negative r g would correspond to a positive forward net_flux and vice_versa cell_physiology imposes constraints on metabolite_concentrations and consequently on q reactions for which r g bullet for any physiological q can only carry a forward flux and are thus called irreversible reactions this classification of reactions is especially important in constraint_based that covers whole cell metabolic_networks and depends on the knowledge of reaction directionality for predicting flux_distributions growth_rates and other large_scale metabolic phenotypes directionality annotations typically rely on phenomenological data and arbitrary definitions of reversibility recent_advances in the field allow incorporating thermodynamic data directly into the model by adding explicit constraints that connect r g concentrations and reaction directionality the nist database for thermodynamics of enzyme_catalyzed nist tecr is the most comprehensive collection of empirical thermodynamic data the advances in metabolic modeling have created a need for accurate genome_wide values for reaction thermodynamic_parameters as metabolic_network models for more organisms and cells emerge it is increasingly important to have correct predictions for acidic and basic environments and for different ionic_strengths this requirement is most prominent when modeling organisms with multi compartmented cells and having to adjust the gs to the conditions in each compartment most data that do exist are hard to access e g in out of print books and cover only a limited part of the scope of required compounds and reactions moreover the attempts to use group contribution to expand this coverage are based on a closed implementation and are not extendable for outside users to add new group definitions or training examples in this article we explored two approaches to estimating free_energies we show that the formation energies obtained using prc achieve a good fit to the observed data rmse kj_mol but do not provide genome_wide coverage of metabolic_reactions of e coli model as an alternative pgc does provide free_energy estimates for the majority of known biochemical_reactions but with larger errors rmse kj_mol therefore a combination of the two methods might be beneficial where prc values are used whenever possible and pgc is used to fill the gaps there is however a potential problem with this approach as combinations of reactions can become inconsistent e g stoichiometrically balanced cycles can have a non zero g the challenge of combining r g bullet estimations from different sources and estimation approaches in a unified and consistent_manner requires an update to the methods described above manuscript under preparation we hope that with time new measurements of reaction equilibrium_constants will be published and used to improve the accuracy and coverage of both these methods pgc and prc we thus join the plea of who published a table of compounds that contain groups with yet unknown contributions we believe that the tools and data that enable thermodynamic_analysis of biochemical_systems should be easily and freely_accessible in addition to supplying r g bullet predictions as a table for use in metabolic_models we created a website_http equilibrator weizmann ac il with a simple user_interface that enables anyone to find reactions by chemical formula or enzyme name the user can adapt the concentration of reactants and the conditions of the reaction the thermodynamics of biochemical_reactions has a key role to play in our understanding and manipulation of metabolic_pathways an integrated and open framework that combines accuracy and coverage will facilitate the wide use of this fundamental constraint by physics on the biochemistry of life
