structural_bioinformatics a mathematical_model the mechanical kinetics of kinesin stepping motivation kinesin is a smart motor_protein that steps processively forward and backward along microtubules mts the mechanical kinetics of kinesin affecting its stepping behavior is not fully understood here we propose a mathematical_model to study the mechanical kinetics of forward and backward stepping of kinesin_motor based on the four state discrete stochastic_model of the motor results results show that the probabilities of forward and backward stepping can be modeled using the mean probabilities of forward and backward kinetic transitions respectively we show that the backward stepping of kinesin_motor starts when the probability of adenosine_diphosphate adp binding to the motor is much higher than that of adenosine_triphosphate atp_binding furthermore our results indicate that the backward stepping is related to both atp_hydrolysis and synthesis with rate_limiting being atp_synthesis low rate of atp_synthesis under high backward loads above pn is also suggested as a reason for the detachment of kinesin_motor from mt in the kinetic state mtkinesinadpp i kinesin which will be referred to as kinesin hereafter is a twoheaded motor_protein that advances unidirectionally along a microtubule mt in discrete nm steps by walking in an asymmetric hand over hand fashion kinesin can processively step_forward and backward along an mt taking approximately steps before detaching from the mt experimental_investigation of kinesin processivity has revealed that kinesin can undergo discrete steps in the presence of fuel i e adenosine_triphosphate atp or in the absence of atp if external load is applied to the motor the significance of studying the mechanical kinetics underlying stepping of kinesin_motor becomes apparent when considering the important roles the motor plays ranging from human_diseases to synthetic nanotechnological applications and the development of novel active nanodevices molecular_biology have revealed critical roles of kinesin_motor in brain wiring and formation neuronal_survival higher brain_function and control of central_nervous it is also evident that the impairment of these functions of kinesin_motor would contribute to neuronal disease_pathogenesis such as alzheimer and hereditary_spastic and other diseases such as cancer kinesin stepping can also exert localized forces on nanostructures this force can be exploited in nanorobotics thus engineers have commenced to invent synthetic nanodevices powered by kinesin_motor that have unique potentials for use in medical_diagnostics as well as engineering applications however precise temporal and spatial control of such nanodevices is a challenging_problem because of the stochastic motion high_complexity and small_size of kinesin even though the biophysical_properties of kinesin_motor have been widely_studied yet little is known about how the mechanical kinetics of kinesin affect its stepping behavior in the complex cellular_environment better understanding of the mechanical kinetics of kinesin stepping may translate into the development of molecular_targeted for various human_diseases and precise motion control for artificial nanomotors with a wide_variety of missions mathematical_modeling can be used to not only conceptualize and characterize kinesin behavior under different experimental_settings but also to make predictions for novel applications one major theoretical_approach for the modeling of kinesin_motor motion is based on a multistate discrete stochastic_model and the assumption that a single stepping of the motor involves passing through a sequence of discrete kinetic states connected by reversible transition_rates here we mathematically model and analyze the mechanical kinetics of atp driven stepping behavior of kinesin_motor over a discrete stochastic_model at various forward negative and backward positive loads and atp concentrations at room_temperature forward and backward steps are taken toward the plus and minus ends of mt respectively we show that our mathematical_model can be used to analyze conceptualize and predict forward and backward stepping of kinesin_motor in different situations
