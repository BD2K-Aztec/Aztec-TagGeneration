data_driven mechanistic analysis method to reveal dynamically evolving regulatory_networks motivation mechanistic_models based_on provide powerful and accurate means to describe the dynamics of molecular_machinery which orchestrates gene_regulation when combined with appropriate statistical_techniques mechanistic_models can be calibrated using experimental_data and in many cases also the model structure can be inferred from time course measurements however existing mechanistic_models are limited in the sense that they rely on the assumption of static network_structure and cannot be applied when transient phenomena affect or rewire the network_structure in the context of gene_regulatory network rewiring results from the net impact of possible unobserved transient phenomena such as changes in signaling_pathway activities or epigenome which are generally difficult but important to account for results we introduce a novel method that can be used to infer dynamically evolving regulatory_networks from timecourse data our method is based on the notion that all mechanistic ordinary_differential models can be coupled with a latent process that approximates the network_structure rewiring process we illustrate the performance of the method using simulated_data and further we apply the method to study the regulatory_interactions during t_helper th cell_differentiation using timecourse rna sequencing_data the computational_experiments with the real_data show that our method is capable of capturing the experimentally_verified rewiring effects of the core th regulatory_network we predict th lineage_specific subnetworks that are activated sequentially and control the differentiation process in an overlapping manner availability_and an implementation of the method is available atduring the past_years several computational_approaches have been proposed to infer the structure and dynamics of gene_regulatory from either steady_state or timecourse measurements the approaches range from statistical and information_theoretic methods to mechanistic_models mechanistic_models are capable of describing the actual molecular_dynamics originating from reaction_kinetics and the underlying network_structure can also be accurately estimated by combining these models with appropriate statistical_techniques see e g typically a mechanistic_model consists of a set of interacting molecular_components and a formal description for the possible mechanisms_affecting the timeevolution of the components while the mechanistically motivated network_inference works well for static network_topologies the standard approach cannot be applied if the molecular_mechanisms depend on transient cellular_processes and in particular if the network_structure is dynamically rewired a good example of such transient processes are epigenetic_modifications that typically are not observed in detail but can have a major effect on regulatory v c the author published_by
