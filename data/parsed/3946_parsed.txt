reference free cell mixture adjustments in analysis of dna_methylation data motivation recently there has been increasing interest in the effects of cell mixture on the measurement of dna_methylation specifically the extent to which small_perturbations in cell mixture proportions can register as changes in dna_methylation a recently_published set of statistical_methods exploits this association to infer changes in cell mixture proportions and these methods are presently being applied to adjust for cell mixture effect in the context of epigenome_wide however these adjustments require the existence of reference datasets which may be laborious or expensive to collect for some tissues such as placenta saliva adipose or tumor_tissue the relevant underlying cell_types may not be known results we propose a method for conducting epigenome_wide analysis when a reference dataset is unavailable including a bootstrap method for estimating standard_errors we demonstrate via simulation_study and several real_data that our proposed method can perform as well as or better than methods that make explicit use of reference datasets in particular it may adjust for detailed cell_type differences that may be unavailable even in existing reference datasets recently there has been increasing interest in the effects of cell mixture on the measurement of dna_methylation specifically the extent to which small_perturbations in cell mixture proportions can register as changes in dna_methylation dna_methylation tightly associated with alterations in the nucleosome dna scaffold and hence chromatin is in part responsible for coordination of gene_expression in individual cells it is now appreciated that differentially methylated_dna regions dmrs distinguish cell_lineages with high_sensitivity and considerable_research is now underway to delineate precise dmrs that define and specify a particular cell_lineage a recently_published set of statistical_methods exploits this association to infer changes in cell mixture proportions solely on the basis of a dna_methylation profile these methods may broadly be conceived as the projection of dna_methylation data from a target dataset s onto a reference dataset s consisting of dna_methylation profiles for isolated cell_types for example s may consist of dna_methylation measured in whole blood from a casecontrol study while s may consist of corresponding dna_methylation profiles from isolated leukocyte cell_types e g cd leukocytes b cell lymphocytes granulocytes as provided by recently some investigators have used these methods to adjust for cell mixture effect in the context of epigenomewide association studies ewas however these adjustments require the existence of reference datasets s and these sets may be laborious or expensive to collect in addition for some tissues such as placenta saliva adipose or tumor_tissue the relevant underlying cell_types may not be known in this article we propose a method for conducting ewas analysis when a reference dataset is unavailable demonstrating that it can perform as well as the methods that make explicit use of a reference dataset
