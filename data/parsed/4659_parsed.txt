three minimal sequences found in ebola virus_genomes and absent from human dna motivation ebola_virus causes high_mortality hemorrhagic fevers with more than cases and deaths in the current outbreak only experimental therapies are available thus novel diagnosis tools and druggable targets are needed results analysis of ebola virus_genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short dna_sequences that appear nowhere in the human_genome we identify the shortest such sequences with lengths between and only three absent sequences of length exist and they consistently appear at the same location on two of the ebola_virus proteins in all ebola virus_genomes but nowhere in the human_genome the alignment_free method used is able to identify pathogen_specific signatures for quick and precise action against infectious_agents of which the current ebola_virus outbreak provides a compelling example ebola_virus ebov is a negative_strand virus from the filoviridae family that causes high_mortality hemorrhagic fevers for which no vaccine or treatment currently exist there are five ebolavirus species namely zaire ebolavirus sudan ebolavirus bundibugyo ebolavirus tai forest ebolavirus and reston ebolavirus with the first and major outbreaks caused by the type species zaire ebolavirus the numbers of the largest ever ebov outbreak are worrying and continue escalating with over cases and deaths from the virus mainly in guinea liberia and sierra_leone according to the world_health the current outbreak is also the first where transmission has occurred outside africa with reported cases in europe spain and america usa promising vaccine_candidate tests are being rushed to face the epidemics and could be available within a few months these yet experimental therapies include for example recombinant viral_vectors or antibodies that target the viral glycoprotein gp but innovative approaches are still needed for the development of diagnosis tools and identification of druggable targets minimal absent words are the shortest sequence_fragments that are not present in the genomic_data of a given organism they have been studied before to describe properties of prokaryotic and eukaryotic_genomes and to develop methods for phylogeny construction or pcr primer_design here we introduce minimal relative absent words raw a concept which has not been used so_far in the context of personalized_medicine but which is deemed useful for differential identification of sequences that are derived from a pathogen genome but absent from its host to identify raws we have developed the eagle tool that implements the method described above supplementary data we have used the full grc human_reference downloaded from the ncbi including the mitochondrial unplaced and unlocalized sequences the sequences of ebov genomes from the current outbreak in sierra_leone and additional ebolavirus genomes have been also downloaded from ncbi supplementary the code used in this analysis is available shows the computation for word sizes and for computer characteristics see supplementary section software and hardware as expected the number of absent words decreases as the k_mer size decreases specifically for k not represented there are no ebov raw on the other hand for k three groups of points emerge raw raw and raw representing the position of a raw in each of the unaligned viral_genomes alignments of ebolavirus sequences including additional ebov genomes from the current outbreak in guinea and from previous outbreaks show that the identified minimal raws fall into conserved protein regions however several mutations can be found in the genomes that discriminate between the different species of ebolavirus and even between ebov sequences from the current and previous outbreaks the identification of these viral_genome signatures is important for quick diagnosis in outbreak scenarios additional analysis with all ebolavirus genomes confirmed these results supplementary in particular raw is conserved within ebov and can distinguish ebov from other ebolavirus species raw is conserved in all sequences from the west_african outbreak in guinea sierra_leone and liberia and only one nucleotide difference_exists between these sequences and unrelated outbreak genomes raw is also conserved at the species level excluding the four ebov genomes and can distinguish between all ebolavirus species supplementary from the three ebov sequence_motifs absent in the human_genome the first raw is included in the virus np while the other two raw and raw fall within the sequence of the viral rnapolymerase l protein previous_studies show that the nterminal region of ebov np participates in both the formation of nucleocapsid like structures through npnp interactions and in the replication of the viral_genome and raw sequence tttcgcccgact is part of this n_terminal region the l protein lp produces the viral transcripts to be translated by host ribosomes and is involved in the replication of the viral_genome as well the lp contains the two additional minimal raws raw tacgccctatcg and raw cctacgcgcaaa both np and lp are critical for the virus_life and constitute good targets_for screening for new antiviral compounds could benefit from knowledge of their protein_structures for ebov most protein_structures are unknown except for the c terminal domain of np gp vp and vp thus we have predicted the structure of the n_terminal regions of the ebov np and lp by homology_modeling supplementary figs s s these structural_models show that the amino_acids corresponding to the raw motif are enclosed within the structure while raw and raw are exposed at the protein surface which can justify its higher degree of conservation the personalized_medicine field is now closer to clinical practice with the advances of next_generation personalized therapeutics are a possibility and their development is essential with the emergence of resistance to current available drugs additionally quick diagnosis is required for emerging pathogens and in epidemics such as the current ebola outbreak here we have detected minimal raws in the human_genome that are present in ebov genomes and identified nucleotide_differences in some of these sequences that can distinguish between ebolavirus species and outbreaks also we show that the corresponding amino_acid are conserved within ebov these results can now be further explored for diagnosis and therapeutics sometimes mentioned as theranostics namely raw nucleotide_sequences can be used in diagnosis to design primers that identify ebolavirus infections or distinguish between ebolavirus species for pcr based_methods longer_sequences and multiplex reactions can be developed to avoid primer binding bias additional nucleotide or protein based strategies for therapeutics can be envisaged as discussed below one problem in developing_efficient ebov treatments is the virus ability to evade the immune system the viral gp is a major target because it mediates attachment and entry into the host_cells however in addition to the surface envelope_protein the gp gene also produces fragment soluble gps that are secreted and direct thethree minimal sequences found in ebola_virus genomesimmune system to produce antibodies for variable and non essential regions of the virus as current efforts based on the viral gp might prove ineffective additional_targets should be sought our results show that the viral np and polymerase lp can be attractive targets as the amino_acid of all three mer raws are conserved within ebov these regions can be used to screen for small_molecule in particular raw is conserved in all ebolavirus np proteins which can indicate a functional or structural role and considering that the protein model_predicts that raw and raw are relatively close in the d structure and in exposed domains these regions can be used to develop novel antibodies also a recently described mechanism shows that the polymerase lp from ebola and marburg viruses is capable of editing transcripts resulting in increased variability in the produced proteins and that the most edited mrnas are the ebola gp and marburg np and lp itself thus the use of combined therapies towards multiple proteins can be more effective as suggested by studies to develop vaccines for lassa_virus that target both np and gp rna based strategies such as rna_interference rnai or antissense therapies are also promising approaches to silence targetspecific gene_expression the raw sequences that we have identified can be used to develop rnai or antisense probes that bind viral transcripts and prevent their translation thus inhibiting viral_replication without blocking the host mrnas translation of these technologies into clinical_applications have been slowed by challenges in the delivery of small_rnas into cells but recent_developments in delivery_systems are bridging the bench to bedside gap among these gold or lipid nanoparticles were shown to be effective against cancer and viral_infections including ebov gold nanobeacons can be applied as a combined diagnosis and therapy tool for effective testing including in low_cost settings and with this purpose advances in peptide_nucleic probes for viral detection are also taking_place whichever the technology the identification of genome signatures for rapid evolving species such as ebola viruses will be useful for the development of both diagnosis and therapeutics
