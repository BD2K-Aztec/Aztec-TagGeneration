designsignatures a tool for designing primers that yields amplicons with distinct signatures for numerous experimental applications pcr_primers must be designed to efficiently amplify a set of homologous dna_sequences while giving rise to amplicons with maximally diverse signatures we developed designsignatures to automate the process of designing primers for high_resolution hrm fragment length polymorphism flp and sequencing_experiments the program also finds the best restriction_enzyme to further diversify hrm or flp signatures this enables efficient comparison across many experimental_designs in order to maximize signature diversity primer_design is a fundamental step to any application of polymerase_chain pcr including high_resolution hrm analysis fragment length polymorphism flp analysis and amplicon_sequencing although these techniques differ_considerably a common design objective is to construct primers that can efficiently amplify many different template variants while maximizing the difference between the resulting amplicon signaturesmelt curve length or sequence depending on the experimental method while many primer design_tools are available there currently does not exist a design tool that brings together different experimental_techniques sharing the objective of maximizing signature diversity moreover no automatic method is available to design primers for hrm analysis instead semi manual design approaches are typically used with the aid of software for melt curve prediction although this approach is reasonable for discriminating single_nucleotide it is unlikely to yield optimal results when the goal is to differentiate more complex variants furthermore when variants are impossible to distinguish with flp or hrm digesting amplicons with a restriction_enzyme can greatly diversify their signatures in such cases an automated solution is highly_desirable for exploring the space of possible primer and restriction_enzyme pairings by accurately predicting results in silico design choices can be efficiently compared to maximize resolving_power and minimize costs we first tested our algorithm for primer_design by comparing its results to those of commonly used primers with the same objective refer to the si text for experimental methods although we would not expect the algorithm to output exactly the same primers we would expect it to target the amplification of similar regions as input we used a set of ribosomal_rna rrna_operons extracted from publically available bacterial_genomes sequences were grouped by their genus of origin because many genomes contain more than one rrna_operon we began by designing primers for amplicon_sequencing with a product length between and base_pairs the top scoring primers overlapped with u f and e r which are commonly used in s based studies of bacterial_diversity next we designed primers for flp analysis using the same input_set this yielded primers surrounding the variable_length internal_transcribed which is the same region used for automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis arisa an flp based method since an equivalently widespread application does not yet exist for hrm analysis we focused on designing primers targeting a variable region of the rna_polymerase subunit b rpob_gene which is commonly used as a phylogenetic marker for bacteria belonging to the genus_streptomyces we first verified our implementation of the algorithm for melt curve prediction using a set of amplicons with diverse melt temperatures t m observed and predicted melt peaks were strongly correlated with an r indicating that t m prediction was very precise however t m values required linear transformation to achieve high_accuracy as is typically observed due to the effects of salt_concentration and intercalating dyes nevertheless repeatable predictive offsets effectively cancel out since hrm analysis occurs on a relative basis to test the hrm algorithm we designed primers for distinguishing the rpob sequences belonging to the genus_streptomyces available from genbank the results indicated that the top scoring primers would not generate sufficiently distinct melting signatures for the purposes of typing new strains in contrast digestion of the amplicons with a restriction_enzyme cviki was predicted to separate most strains we verified these predictions experimentally by using the top scoring primers to amplify the dna of new streptomyces isolates with different rpob sequences followed by digestion of the pcr_products as the outputs had indicated the melt curve signatures after digestion were considerably more diverse than pre digestion this confirmed that designsignatures can assist in challenging experimental_designs by suggesting primers predicting their amplicons signatures and indicating when it may be necessary to use a restriction_enzyme or choose another target_gene to achieve more diverse signatures
