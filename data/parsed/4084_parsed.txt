genome_analysis rsvsim an r bioconductor_package for the simulation of structural_variations rsvsim is a tool for the simulation of deletions insertions inversions tandem_duplications and translocations of various sizes in any genome available as fasta file or data package in r the structural_variations can be generated randomly based on user supplied genomic_coordinates or associated to various kinds of repeats the package further comprises functions to estimate the distribution of structural_variation sizes from real_datasets availability rsvsim is implemented in r and available at http www bioconductor org a vignette with detailed_descriptions of the functions and examples is included next_generation ngs has accelerated the detection of large_deletions insertions inversions tandem_duplications and translocations tremendously during the past_years various methods dealing with the comparison annotation visualization and especially the detection of structural_variations svs were published the simulation of svs is a powerful quick and inexpensive approach to assess their performance and correctness evaluating the performance of programs for sv_detection for instance requires a large number of validated variations of various types with high breakpoint precision depending on the scope of the application certain parts of a genome might be of special interest like coding_regions a subset of genes or regions of low complexity variant detection from real_data may not always comply with these requirements because of limitations of the experiment_design few validated svs or low breakpoint resolution a simulation however can generate a base exact ground_truth consisting of almost any number of svs which can then be used to test the sensitivity and precision of sv detections the output of the algorithm can be compared with the set of simulated svs to see not only how many svs were correctly_identified but also the svs missed and falsely predicted because of limitations of the algorithms rather than laboratory issues a typical workflow for the assessment of an sv algorithm for sv_detection consists of sv simulation read simulation sv algorithm evaluation a fasta file with the simulated rearranged genome can be used by most read simulators e g to generate ngs_datasets from various sequencing_platforms which can then be used to assess an sv algorithm a comprehensive simulation of different sv types of various sizes combined with a variety of read simulations with different numbers of reads insert_sizes for paired_end or read_lengths can give valuable information for the design of sequencing_experiments currently most publications of sv_detection methods restrict the sv simulation to deletions or insertions and implement a known set of svs taken for example from studies of the genome_project or venters genome or a random set into a reference_genome fusim is a more sophisticated approach but specialized on the simulation of fusion_transcripts for rna_seq analysis to our knowledge rsvsim is the first toolkit that covers a wide_range of svs which are detectable by dna_seq data and that incorporates knowledge about size and formation mechanisms of svs for realistic modelling of their breakpoints the r package rsvsim provides functionalities to simulate the five common types of structural_variations within any kind of genome it enables the user to adapt the simulation to the scope of his own application or experiments in terms of type size and position of every single sv artificially rearranged genomes
