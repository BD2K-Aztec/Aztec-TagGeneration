sequence_analysis dapple a pipeline for the homology_based prediction of phosphorylation_sites while many experimentally_characterized phosphorylation_sites exist for certain organisms such as human rat and mouse few sites are known for other organisms hampering related research_efforts we have developed a software pipeline called dapple that automates the process of using known phosphorylation_sites from other organisms to identify putative sites in an organism of interest availability dapple is available as a web_server at http saphire protein_phosphorylation is the most widespread cellular signaling_mechanism in eukaryotes knowledge of an organisms phosphorylation_sites facilitates the study of its cellular_signaling which in turn has many applications in basic and translational_research although online_databases contain many phosphorylation_sites for human rat and mouse little data are available for other species using the cow as a test species we previously_proposed a protocol for making predictions in species with few known sites taking_advantage of sequence_homology between human and bovine proteins this protocol involved manually using known human phosphorylation_sites as blast queries to identify bovine sites if a query and its best match in the bovine proteome had few or no sequence differences the match was considered a putative bovine site while useful several aspects of this protocol could be improved first its manual nature makes it time consuming and also limits the amount of known phosphorylation data that can be used second it uses only known phosphorylation_sites from human it is possible for instance that a given bovine site might be homologous to a known rat site but not to any known human site and by using only known phosphorylation_sites from human this bovine site would be missed this problem would be even more pronounced for species that are distantly_related to human such as plants third the method used in jalal et_al to identify non orthologous_proteins comparing their annotations has several drawbacks including its subjective nature the difficulty of automating these comparisons and the fact that annotations are often inaccurate or incomplete dapple is a software pipeline that addresses these concerns ultimately allowing the user to easily quickly and accurately identify potential phosphorylation_sites in an organism of interest to test dapple phosphorylation_sites in the cow bos_taurus were identified as was done by the files described below were used as input to dapple the phosphositeplus database was downloaded and contained
