mass balanced randomization of metabolic_networks motivation network centered studies in systems_biology attempt to integrate the topological_properties of biological_networks with experimental_data in order to make predictions and posit hypotheses for any topology based prediction it is necessary to first assess the significance of the analyzed property in a biologically_meaningful context therefore devising network null_models carefully tailored to the topological and biochemical constraints imposed on the network remains an important computational_problem results we first review the shortcomings of the existing generic sampling schemeswitch randomizationand explain its unsuitability for application to metabolic_networks we then devise a novel polynomial time algorithm for randomizing metabolic_networks under the bio chemical constraint of mass_balance the tractability of our method follows from the concept of mass equivalence_classes defined on the representation of compounds in the vector space over chemical_elements we finally demonstrate the uniformity of the proposed method on seven genome_scale and empirically validate the theoretical findings the proposed method allows a biologically_meaningful estimation of significance for metabolic network_properties contactthe advances in omics_technologies and algorithmic techniques for analysis of high_throughput data have placed network based integrative studies in the focus of systems_biology the promise of network_analyses lies in the possibility to devise genome_scale representations of biological_systems for predictive analyses however the statistical_significance of any prediction must be validated in a biologically_meaningful context using an appropriate null_model the seminal work of directed complex_networks research toward revealing the unifying properties of biological_networks starting from metabolic to gene regulatory to proteinprotein networks and their integrated variants despite the identification of simple to whom correspondence should be addressed mechanisms by which these networks may arise and evolve such as the preferential attachment of newly added nodes representing genes proteins reactions or metabolites to already highly_connected ones the advantage of such approaches to answering biological_questions remains_debatable nevertheless this direction in network research has resulted in the discovery of salient properties of biological_networks i e properties which show similar trends for a wide_variety of networks from different cells tissues and species some of these properties include scale_free i e power_law degree_distribution large clustering_coefficient small average path_length degreedegree correlation different behavior of various centrality_measures and the distribution and overrepresentation of subnetworks known as motifs the studies following the work of barabsi and albert have attempted to relate the salient properties of biological_networks to their functionality however it is often the case that the detection of novel salient properties of complex biological_networks and determination of their statistical_significance is based on a generic null_model which may result in misleading conclusions and consequently in inappropriate biological reasoning network null_models are essential for establishing the significance of any prediction obtained from a network representation of a biological system a randomization procedure allows for sampling from the usually large space of networks from a null_model and for estimating the statistical_significance empirically a p value of a given property is usually calculated based on the following procedure i determine the chosen property from an investigated biological_network ii sample a large number of random networks which have a similar structure to that of the analyzed network and iii estimate the mean and variance of the property from the simulated networks to calculate a z_score and p value under the assumption of normal distribution without this assumption in principle step iii requires determining the distribution of values for the property under the considered network null_model clearly the p value of a property strongly depends on the sampling procedure and structure of the network null_model therefore any network based analysis is prone to detecting statistically_significant properties due to an ill posed null_model finally a null_model strongly and ultimately depends on the type of analyzed network for instance gene_regulatory include directionality while proteinprotein_interaction networkspage the advances in high_throughput omics_technologies require developing algorithmic techniques for the analysis of large_scale biological_networks however the significance of any networkbased prediction must be validated using a realistic null_model while the method based on switch randomization has been extensively used to study the significance of topological_properties in many different types of networks we argued that it is unsuitable for the analysis of metabolic_networks we presented a new method for randomizing metabolic_networks under the constraint of mass_balance we observed that a null_model should satisfy two important requirements preservation of ubiquitous constraints characterizing the class of analyzed networks and uniformity of the sampling procedure we demonstrated the uniformity of the proposed method theoretically and empirically on seven metabolic_networks from all kingdoms of life by integrating the bio chemical constraint of mass_balance into a network null_model our method allows for a more realistic measure of significance in addition the proposed approach can be used for identifying network_properties which are independent of mass_balance constraints and thus are likely to relate to the evolutionary_history of metabolic_networks for instance in a recent study we applied the method to assess the evolutionary significance of thermodynamic favorability of metabolic_reactions we believe that the integration of mass_balance constraints is a necessary first step toward extracting biologically_meaningful properties of genome_scale
