systems_biology discovering combinatorial interactions in survival data motivation although several methods exist to relate high_dimensional gene_expression data to various clinical_phenotypes finding combinations of features in such input remains a challenge particularly when fitting complex statistical_models such as those used for survival studies results our proposed method builds on existing regularization path following techniques to produce regression_models that can extract arbitrarily complex patterns of input_features such as gene combinations from large_scale data that relate to a known clinical_outcome through the use of the datas structure and itemset mining techniques we are able to avoid combinatorial complexity issues typically encountered with such methods and our algorithm performs in similar orders of duration as single variable versions applied to data from various clinical studies of cancer patient_survival time our method was able to produce a number of promising gene interaction candidates whose tumour related roles appear confirmed by literature from their inception high_dimensional genomic_data such as obtained through genome_wide expression microarrays have been used to identify genes that affects survival or tumour reoccurrence time spans among cancer patients survival data generally contain partially known observations e g when clinical follow_up of the patient ends before a decisive event requiring the use of regression_models that can specifically handle censored_data cox_proportional is one such model that combines advantages of both parametric and non parametric approaches to statistical_inference making it ideally adapted to the type of data obtained in clinical_trials owing to the high_dimensionality and small_sample of gene_expression data it is desirable to add a penalization component in fitting the cox_model with norm often preferred for its ability to drive sparsity of the model and select a concise set of variables gene_expression values mutation types etc different methods have been suggested for fitting penalized cox_model in particular proposed a method to compute the regularization path of penalized cox_model producing a series of cox_models that have different levels of complexity and sparsity as for many models in systems_biology it has been widely shown that the gene regulatory_pathways of cancer involve non linear gene interactions although models based on linear_combinations of gene_expression may accurately approximate more complex interactions for some tasks it can be desirable to specifically identify combinatorial covariates for such purpose as the identification of synthetic_lethal genes however all current methods rely on the ability to enumerate potential input variables although it is computationally_feasible to examine each single gene in such a way even for a large microarray issues of exponential complexity quickly arise when considering interactions between more than one gene at a time in this article we extend the approach in park and hastie to handle combinatorial interactions among genes we deal with issues of combinatorial explosion and computational_complexity by taking_advantage of itemset mining techniques using this approach virtually limitless combinations of genes and phenotypes grouped in itemsets of boolean variables can be used as single predictor_variables in the model our proposed algorithm computes the regularization path of penalized cox_models that account for the effects of combinatorial gene interactions on survival beyond proportional_hazards our itemset based method can be applied to any regression_model with convex loss each time making use of the inputs structure and sparsity to sidestep complexity issues while at the same time guaranteeing that events along the regularization path values of the regularization_parameter for which a change occurs in the model structure are

regularization techniques to work with patterns of discretized input_features instead of single continuous values section details the mathematical basis for our algorithm and illustrates its application to proportional_hazard using coxs partial likelihood as loss function with further detailed proofs as supplementary_material finally section_presents qualitative_and results obtained by applying our method to different survival datasets in this article we presented an algorithm to follow the regularization path of any regularized linear model_fitting using combinatorial interactions as covariates although the path following method has been applied to microarray_data in the past it was until now only able to deal with single valued features ignoring possible higher_order effect of gene interactions our method makes uses of existing frequent itemset mining techniques and novel imports from fractional programming to avoid the intractability issues of combinatorial input and produce a regression_model of accuracy and run time comparable with the linear case by running multiple iterations of the algorithm on subsampled datasets we can produce ordered lists of candidate interactions with strong predicting power the interactions found by applying our method to cancer study survival data include many genes that could not be found through linear_models yet show up in literature as strongly tied to these conditions confirming the crucial importance of taking interaction effects into account to detect some of the weaker signal in gene_expression data although most significant interactions found by our method on experimental_data were limited to two or three genes there are no theoretical limitations to the size of interactions that can be searched at no particularly higher computational_cost setting this method apart from other recent work on penalized selection of interactions in high_dimensional the strong noise inherent to gene_expression microarray likely prevents the detection of weaker signals between more than three genes making it an attractive prospect to work with less noisy types of data where larger interactions might be detectable in the future we plan to extend our field of application to a wider_range of biomedical data such as the identification of snp interactions as well as leverage our models ability to deal with heterogeneous input for example by
