data_and cascade detection for the extraction of localized sequence_features specificity results for hiv_protease and structure function results for the schellman loop motivation the extraction of the set of features most relevant to function from classified biological sequence_sets is still a challenging_problem a central issue is the determination of expected counts for higher_order features so that artifact features may be screened results cascade detection cd a new algorithm for the extraction of localized features from sequence_sets is introduced cd is a natural extension of the proportional modeling techniques used in contingency_table analysis into the domain of feature_detection the algorithm is successfully tested on synthetic data and then applied to feature_detection problems from two different domains to demonstrate its broad utility an analysis of hiv_protease specificity reveals patterns of strong first order features that group hydrophobic_residues by side chain geometry and exhibit substantial symmetry about the cleavage_site higher_order results suggest that favorable cooperativity is weak by comparison and broadly_distributed but indicate possible synergies between negative_charge and hydrophobicity in the substrate structurefunction results for the schellman loop a helix capping motif in proteins contain strong first order features and also show statistically_significant cooperativities that provide new insights into the design of the motif these include a new hydrophobic staple and multiple amphipathic and electrostatic pair features cd should prove useful not only for sequence_analysis but also for the detection of multifactor synergies in cross classified data from clinical studies or other sources a localized sequence feature is defined here as a set of one or more sequence_elements such as amino_acids which occur at particular sequence_positions in a set of equal length sequences classified and aligned with respect to some biological_function such a sequence set might represent a set of peptides recognized and cleaved by a particular protease or a set of peptides that correspond to a particular structural_motif in proteins a first order feature specifies an element at a single position whereas a higher_order feature specifies a set of two or more elements occurring together in a sequence at particular positions a first order feature that is significantly_overrepresented in a sequence set may indicate the presence of an important physical effect in the relevant_biological system involving the features element such as a preference for a negatively_charged amino_acid near a cleavage_site a significantly_overrepresented higher_order feature may represent an important cooperativity in the system such as an electrostatic or hydrophobic_interaction between two or more amino_acid algorithms have been developed for feature_selection in sequence_sets which utilize correlation scans artificial_neural genetic_algorithms support_vector decision_trees markov methods and other techniques for reviews seeand fogel a number of these techniques have been judged effective at the task of feature_selection for sequence classification but less progress has been made in the area of optimal feature_detection for the purpose of analysis of the important effects in the data a central problem which remains is the determination of the abundance that should be expected for a feature in a sequence set that may contain other significant features as well as random variation if expected feature counts are not known then it is not possible to determine_whether an abundant feature represents an important effect occurs by chance or is an artifact which appears because it shares elements with the features that are responsible for the generation of function artifacts provide less than optimally accurate representations of the physical effects in the data artifacts which are of lower order than the generator features which produce them can cause underestimation of complexity whereas artifacts that combine elements of generator features masquerade as synergies a method of screening out artifacts and accurately recovering generator features of all orders must be developed before structure function datasets can contribute fully to accurate biochemical model_building and efficient experimental_design although researchers are now explicitly addressing the issue of dependencies in multivariate_data see e g slow progress on the separation of higher_order features from artifacts in sequence_sets may have delayed experimental work directed toward the detection of cooperative interactions the present work introduces a new algorithm cascade detection cd which computes expected feature counts screens artifacts and identifies statistically_significant localized features of all orders in sets of short_sequences or features of orders up to a specified maximum in longer_sequences the method detects first order features that are either overrepresented or underrepresented and higher_order features that are overrepresented the algorithm
