genetics_and walking the interactome for candidate prioritization in exome_sequencing of mendelian_diseases motivation whole_exome wes has opened up previously unheard of possibilities for identifying novel disease genes in mendelian_disorders only about half of which have been elucidated to date however interpretation of wes data remains_challenging results here we analyze proteinprotein association ppa networks to identify candidate_genes in the vicinity of genes previously implicated in a disease the analysis using a random_walk with restart rwr method is adapted to the setting of wes by developing a composite variant gene relevance score based on the rarity location and predicted pathogenicity of variants and the rwr evaluation of genes harboring the variants benchmarking using known disease variants from disease gene_families reveals that the correct gene is ranked among the top candidates in of cases a figure which we confirmed using a prospective_study of disease genes identified in and ppa data produced before that date we implement our method in a freely_available web_server exomewalker that displays a ranked_list of candidates together with information on ppas frequency and predicted pathogenicity of the variants to allow quick and effective searches for candidates that are likely to reward closer investigation availability_and the identification of causative disease genes in mendelian_disorders has contributed greatly to our understanding of gene_functions and biological_pathways in rare and common disease with the development of whole_exome wes the pace of identification of novel disease genes has accelerated to the extent that groups such as the international rare_disease research consortium has set out the goal of comprehensive discovery of the molecular etiologies of all rare_diseases to enable molecular diagnosis for all affected_individuals by the year before wes most gene_discovery projects made use of linkage_analysis or association studies which typically identified genomic_intervals of cm containing up to genes numerous computational procedures have been developed to prioritize_candidate in the intervals and guide dna sequencing_efforts reviewed in although wes provides sequence_information for the great majority of targeted exon sequences the need for prioritization remains an individual exome typically contains variants as compared with the genomic reference_sequence thousands of which are predicted to lead to nonsynonymous amino_acid alterations of conserved splice_site residues or small_insertions typical analysis strategies have relied on the characteristics of the variants focusing on rare_variants that are predicted to be pathogenic but even after such filtering around candidate disease_causing are found in a single wes dataset and additional methods are needed to predict which of them may have serious functional consequences and prioritize them for validation because each genome harbors genuine loss of function lof variants with genes completely inactivated a purely variant based prioritization of candidate_genes in wes studies will be limited in its ability to correctly identify the true disease gene previous gene_prioritization strategies for prioritizing genes in linkage_studies evaluated one or more characteristics of the ythe authors wish it to be known

attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work genes including functional_annotation gene_expression data or sequence_based features strategies to prioritize_candidate in exome_sequencing can also exploit the variant data itself in an attempt to improve prioritization of mendelian disease genes somatic_mutations in cancer and others a number of tools and pipelines have been developed that exploit sophisticated variant filtering strategies the tools combine filtering steps that exclude common_variants and retain only variants that are predicted likely pathogenic using tools such as mutationtaster and then exploit sequences from multiple unrelated_individuals with the sought after disease to search for genes_mutated in most or all of the individuals as well as linkage or pedigree_analysis recently approaches have been introduced that combine variant impact prediction with gene_prioritization the extasy algorithm uses genomic_data fusion to integrate variant impact prediction haploinsufficiency prediction and phenotype specific gene_prioritization the exomiser implements phive phenotypic interpretation of variants in exomes an algorithm that integrates the calculation of phenotype similarity between human_diseases and genetically_modified mouse_models with evaluation of the variants according to allele_frequency pathogenicity and mode of inheritance funseq intersects regions of the genome that are likely to be sensitive to mutations with an analysis for variants that disrupt transcription_factor each of these algorithms essentially seeks genes or genomic_regions that are both relevant to the disease under investigation and also harbor variants likely to be pathogenic we therefore reasoned that a key factor in exome prioritization algorithms is to intersect the results of variant analysis with a method that can prioritize genes according to their potential_relevance the analysis of protein_interaction has been widely used for computational_analysis of human disease typically proteins do not act in isolation but rather perform their functions cooperatively within a network of functionally_related proteins that is groups of functionally_related proteins may physically interact with one another and thereby form a molecular nanomachine that mediates a particular biological_function at cellular or systems level a proteinprotein_interaction ppi may be defined as a specific physical_contact with molecular_docking between proteins that occurs in cells or in a living organism in vivo de las rivas and currently data on ppis in humans are available derived from experimental methods including the yeast_two system and tandem_affinity in this work we make use of data from the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes proteins string which contains not only ppis but also indirect functional_associations derived from genomic_context high_throughput experiments conserved coexpression and text_mining we will refer to this network as the proteinprotein association ppa network the complete set of all such interactions and associations has been referred to as the interactome and with the increased quantity and quality of such data analysis of the protein interactome offers an important resource for systems level understanding of cellular_processes the interactome has also become an important resource for the computational prioritization of disease genes the main assumption of these methods is that genes linked to diseases with similar or even identical phenotypic manifestations will in many cases code for genes that interact in specific subnetworks within the larger interactome therefore lists of candidate_genes can be prioritized according to the vicinity of the candidates genes within the interactome to other known members of a given disease gene_family initial efforts to rank disease genes exploited the presence of direct_interactions or the length of the shortest_path of interactions leading from a candidate_gene to a known disease gene we have shown that a global network measure of distance in the proteinprotein_interaction obtained by random_walk analysis substantially improves candidategene prioritization including the search for direct neighbors of other disease genes k ohler et_al in fact it was shown that random_walk approaches outperform other geneprioritization methods in this work we test the hypothesis that random_walk analysis of the protein interactome can improve prioritization of candidate_disease in exome_sequencing in this work we have implemented an algorithm for prioritizing candidate_genes in wes studies by searching for rare_variants with predicted pathogenicity in genes_located in the vicinity of phenotypically related genes in a functional interaction_network we constructed a ppa network based on associations among human genes using high_confidence interactions in the string database we implemented a global distance measure based on rwr to define similarity between genes within this interaction_network k ohler et_al the rwr algorithm ranks genes on the basis of their similarity to known or suspected disease genes in our benchmarking we use phenotypic series from the omim resource to define disease gene_families users of exomewalker can either use these same disease gene_families or enter their own list of genes that are known or suspected to be associated with the disease being studied in parallel variants from an exome are annotated and the frequency and predicted pathogenicity are evaluated candidate_genes with rare potentially pathogenic_variants are then prioritized using both the results of variant evaluation and the vicinity in the ppa network of the genes harboring the variants to the seed genes see section for details shows the results of our analysis using string v as the source of interactome data analysis was performed by adding known disease variants to either in house exomes or genome_project exomes and with and without the appropriate inheritance model for the disease being tested the results show a substantial performance increase when including the random_walk measure of proteinprotein_interactions with other genes associated with the disease as compared with either the variant score or the rwr score alone for example of the tested exomes contained the known disease gene as the top hit for the genomes projectbased simulations compared with when just using variant pathogenicity and frequency to assess candidacy this is out of an average of postfiltered genes and of the disease genes are kept during this filtering step this increases to and for the ad and recessive models out of an average of and postfiltered genes respectively similar performance and gains are seen when adding the disease variants to our inhouse exomes that contain many more postfiltered genes on average for no inheritance model the correct gene was present within the top_ranked candidates in nearly of the simulations using in house exomes as shown_inand a large proportion of the performance comes from the random_walk prioritization of the filtered exome candidates with the addition of variant pathogenicity and frequency data adding a further increase string includes text mined associations between genes and it is possible some of these associations may come from publications describing two genes being associated with the same disease rather than the biological associations we are trying to detect with our simulation_studies to allow for this we repeated the analysis with a version of string where all text mined associations had been removed as expected there is a drop in performance compared with including the text mined association but exomewalker still shows a substantial improvement over purely variant based measures of candidacy for example for the genomes performance of exomewalker using string v as the source of interactome data the bars show the percentage of exomes where the true disease gene is identified as the top hit or in the top or results either in house or genomes_project exomes were used all exomes are filtered to remove synonymous intergenic and intronic variants except for those in splice_sites in addition variants with a maf are excluded results are shown without all or with an ad or ar inheritance model applied ranking is either by variant scoring that combines maf and predicted pathogenicity rwr analysis alone or exomewalker scoring that additionally includes evidence of proteinprotein associations with other genes linked to the diseaseproject exomes with no inheritance model the exomewalker performance drops from to having the correct gene as the top hit but this is still higher than with the variant based_scoring alone this strategy of removing all text mined associations will have removed many genuine interactions that would be useful for prioritization of a novel diseasegene association we expect the real performance of exomewalker in such cases to lie somewhere in between that seen inand to gain a realistic estimate of the performance of our method on new data we identified diseasegene associations that had been identified in that belong to one of the phenotypic series and had a known variant in hgmd we tested the performance of our method using a ppa dataset with data before the discovery of any of these genes string v the results are summarized in the true disease_causing gene was present within the top prioritized genes in of cases similar to our results using large_scale simulations computational candidate_gene has matured into a field that has developed and benchmarked scores of algorithms that exploit and integrate complex and heterogeneous datasets including gene_expression sequence annotations data_mining genetic_sequences functional_annotations and proteinprotein_interaction the fundamental algorithms have been improved and extended in many ways such as including tissue_specificity in the analysis of the protein interactome initial computational_analysis of exome_sequence concentrated on filtering variants according to their population frequency predicted pathogenicity and the presence of rare predicted pathogenic_mutations in multiple unrelated_individuals with a certain rare_disease intersection strategy however it has become apparent that it remains difficult to identify novel disease genes or even known disease genes with wes because of the sheer number of candidate_mutations each genome is thought to harbor genuine lof variants with genes completely inactivated therefore filtering on variant characteristics alone is not effective in situations where a single affected individual or only a small number of individuals are being investigated therefore just as positional_cloning approaches were limited by the availability of large well characterized families disease identification studies by wes are often limited by the number of individual exome sequences available for variant intersection for this reason candidate_gene methods have recently begun to be applied to exome_analysis with positional_cloning prioritization would be applied to all genes_located within the linkage interval with exome studies prioritization is applied to all genes that harbor rare potentially pathogenic_mutations in both settings the number of genes may be in the hundreds recently exome prioritization methods have been introduced that exploit data fusion phenotypic_data and model_organism phenotype data random_walk analysis of proteinprotein_interaction data has been shown to be a powerful approach to gene_prioritization in the setting of positional_cloning projects k ohler et_al in this work therefore we have adapted our previous approach and tested its utility for exome_analysis illustrates the gene_prioritization procedure in the case of ddost and dpm components of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex that transfers a glycan chain to nascent proteins congenital_disorders of glycosylation cdg are inherited ar diseases that impair n glycosylation and previously_identified cdg disease genes were used to prioritize_candidate including ddost and dpm in the simulations summarized in it can be seen that ddost has only two direct_interactions with cdg seed genes and is at some distance from the others leading to it only being ranked rd however dpm has multiple direct and second degree interactions with cdg genes leading to it being ranked as the top_ranked candidate in simulations in contrast other genes did not achieve a high rank for instance tmem mutations which were shown to be a cause of type a muscular_dystrophy dystroglycanopathy was placed at rank by our method this gene has only one high_confidence association in the string database with plau plasminogen_activator urokinase which itself has high_confidence associations to other genes none of which is related to type a muscular dystrophydystroglycanopathy therefore although mutations in tmem cause the same disease as mutations in the other genes of this family pomgnt pomgnt ispd fktn pomt pomt fkrp large there is little functional_similarity reflecting this in string thus although ppa analysis offers an effective way of prioritizing disease genes in many cases there are disease genes that do not show a high random_walk score in cases where the causative_gene does not interact with previous members of the disease gene_family or for diseases where there are no previously known genes other approaches will have to be considered we recently described an approach exomiser that uses phenotype comparisons with model_organism data to inform on candidacy extasy is another recently_published solution that uses phenotype comparisons along with consideration of many other data types to contrast and compare these different approaches we applied them to the same set of recently solved cases and report the performance in note that extasy does not perform any variant filtering and so to allow a fair comparison we used vcf files that had already been filtered in the same way as for the exomewalker benchmarking three of the diseases currently have no phenotype annotations available and are therefore not runnable through extasy or particularly amenable to exomiser prioritization extasy can only inform on non synonymous variants and four of the cases involve a small deletion which again was not assessable finally for two of the cases extasy removed the causative variant during analysis so no final ranking was possible for of the remaining cases exomiser and extasy performed better than exomewalker with exomewalker outperforming them in the other cases klhl is a good example where there is minimal evidence for interactions with previously implicated genes but where use of phenotype data allowed identification of the causative variant as the top or second best_hit using extasy or exomiser respectively we have implemented our method in a freely_available web_server called exomewalker users can upload a vcf file and choose one of phenotypic series or enter their own diseasegene family in the form of a list of entrez_gene identifiers these genes may already be known to be associated with the disease or be members of a pathway suspected of being disrupted in the disease or just candidates from in house knowledge if the vcf file contains multiple samples exomewalker will assume that all samples are from the same family and will ask the user to upload a pedigree ped file it will then perform pedigree filtering on the genes and variants represented in the vcf file using the jannovar library it will subsequently rank the candidate_genes and return a list of candidates together with information about the genes importantly it will show all firstand second degree interactions with the seed genes allowing users to quickly eyeball candidate lists to determine if there are genes with multiple functional_associations with the seed genes that would reward closer inspection exome_sequencing remains a difficult endeavor and large_scale exome_sequencing for the identification of mendelian disease_causing have reported success_rates around therefore it is not realistically to be expected that a prioritization method will place the correct gene in the first place or first few places in all cases an advantage of the methodology_presented here is that exomewalker quickly shows whether there are candidate_genes with both predicted pathogenic_variants and multiple functional_associations with other genes in the same disease gene_family if this is not the case users may wish to explore phenotype based or genomic_data fusion prioritization of exome data or if possible sequence additional family samples to enable linkage filtering r odelsperger et_al smith et_al or sequence additional unrelated_individuals for intersection based_approaches the exomewalker server is freely_available compbio charite de
