vhog a multispecies vertebrate ontology of homologous organs groups motivation most anatomical_ontologies are species specific whereas a framework for comparative_studies is needed we describe the vertebrate homologous organs groups ontology vhog used to compare expression_patterns between species results vhog is a multispecies anatomical ontology for the vertebrate lineage it is based on the hogs used in the bgee database of gene_expression evolution vhog version includes terms follows obo principles and is based on the common anatomy reference ontology caro vhog only describes structures with historical homology relations between model vertebrate_species the mapping to species specific anatomical_ontologies is provided as a separate file so that no homology hypothesis is stated within the ontology itself each mapping has been manually reviewed and we provide support codes and references when available availability_and vhog is available from the bgee download site http bgee unil ch as well as from the obo_foundry and the ncbo bioportal websites contact one of the main approaches to understand biological objects has long been comparative_studies from comparative anatomy in the th century to comparative_genomics in the last decade comparative_analysis can notably help identify adaptation as well as functional or structural constraints many of the data which we would like to compare such as gene_expression or phenotypes need to be mapped to anatomy and development of organisms to be of use to facilitate the automatic manipulation of this data there has been an important effort to build ontologies which describe the anatomy of human and of animal model_organisms these ontologies have tended to be species specific resulting in an increasing number of ontologies corresponding to different projects see the obo_foundry and the ncbo this makes the comparison between species difficult since differences in representational schemes and in vocabulary are added to the differences in biology yet automatic comparisons are increasingly necessary with large_amounts of functional data generated in diverse model_organisms an integrated view is advantageous both for a fundamental understanding of animal biology and evolution and for the efficient_transfer of information from model_organisms to human or veterinary_medicine multispecies integration within anatomical_ontologies poses a number of challenges one is the criterion of comparison while comparative_studies can be performed in diverse frameworks homology is the most widely_recognized criterion this raises further problems first homology is always a hypothesis which according to the principle of reality followed by the obo_foundry should not be included within an ontology although see second there exist structures which will not be included in a homology comparison between a given pair of species because they are specific to one or the other and have no homolog third the exclusion of analogous structures might be limiting for some studies e g comparing insect and vertebrate eye_development fourth homologous structures can diverge in function or structure to an extent that representing them together in an ontology might be difficult finally there can be differences between species in the relationships among structures there are several ongoing efforts to create multispecies ontologies for animal groups which have chosen different answers to the challenges outlined above the teleost anatomy ontology tao is a multispecies ontology for teleost fishes the tao is based on the zebrafish anatomy ontology zfa from the zfin database and uses general higher_level terms from the common anatomy reference ontology caro the caro was created to provide a common basis for all future anatomy ontologies and facilitate their interoperability several other efforts follow the same model as the tao and include the amphibian anatomy ontology and the hymenoptera anatomy ontology in each of these cases there is an effort to describe the morphological diversity of the clade consequently each ontology will include terms that are found in several species of the clade the use of a term for several species in the tao does not imply homology a species specific ontology e g zfa is considered a subset of the multispecies ontology e g tao all terms of the vhog ontology were manually_curated to verify that they correspond to groups of homologous organs between vertebrate_species linked by relations of strict historical homology as defined in the hom ontology when the structures are homologous but divergent we use a combination of terms such as limb fin bud vhog relations between the terms were also manually_curated see algorithm in and set either to is a or to part of we aim to provide exactly one is a relation for each term according to obo_foundry guidelines as noted in the tao publication it is at present difficult to implement this guideline in practice for anatomical_ontologies in future versions of the vhog we will continue working toward this aim the terms and relations thus generated were incorporated into the framework of the caro we were careful to implement this in a manner consistent with other anatomical_ontologies using caro tao xao and zfa this especially concerns the relations between vhog terms derived from species specific ontology alignments and higher_level caro terms e g digit is a anatomical cluster the vhog ontology version has terms is a relations and part of relations there are synonyms terms have definitions of terms have only one parent have two parents and the others have three or more there are cross_references xref to other multispecies obo ontologies these do not include the mappings to speciesspecific ontologies as we consider that mappings from multispecies ontologies to species specific ontologies should not be treated as xrefs but should be encoded separately in an association file similar to the gene_ontology mapping this differs from the approach of uberon which includes crossreferences to the source ontologies in the multispecies ontology itself all mappings of terms from the species specific ontologies to the vhog terms were manually_curated there are terms from species specific ontologies mapped to vhog terms which represent hypotheses of homology between vertebrates i e pair_wise relations between structures in different species there are vhog terms with no mappings which correspond to higher_level caro terms e g material anatomical entity the semantics of the mapping is treat xrefs as equivalent for caro and equivalent to treat xref as genus differentia for the mapping to species specific ontologies the mappings were annotated with support codes to provide confidence information means to provide confidence metadata information in support of annotations are currently being discussed in the framework of the evidence code ontology eco and of the international_society for biocuration our objective is to rely on the use of the eco once a standard to address the issue of confidence has emerged in the biocuration and ontology communities in practice the support codes obvious and inferred are essentially used for homology between the two mammals considered in our ontology of all mappings with the code inferred are for human and mouse all mappings with the code obvious are for human and mouse except whole organism which has the code obvious for all ontologies among the vhog groups noted debated several concern bones and the skeletal system due to citations such as the following whether this biomineralization toolkit of genes reflects a parallel co option of a common suite of genes or the inheritance of a skeletogenic gene_regulatory from a biomineralizing common_ancestor remains an open debate more references in the association file another case of debate is the vomeronasal_organ vhog none of the three bibliographical references_cited in the association file is conclusive concerning the existence and homology of thisthe total is more than the number of vhog terms because different mappings to a same vhog term can have different support c a consensus is chosen and presented but the debate is documented d either there is a reference in which the homology is discussed as uncertain and it is provided or this code is used when well established or obvious relations between closely_related e g human and mouse are extended to other species e g zebrafish organ in different tetrapodes kardong p and doving and trotier specify the opinions concerning the presence and functioning of the vomeronasal_organ in humans are controversial conversely of all mappings for zebrafish the most divergent_species included in vhog are well established in the literature still are uncertain as for example the ovary zfa mapped to vhog while it is likely that urbilateria lacked a complex somatic reproductive system it is at present impossible to speculate on whether or not it possessed a true gonad full citation in the association file see also finally it should be noted that terms which represent different developmental_stages of the same organ are mapped together for example presumptive midbrain zfa and midbrain zfa are both mapped to midbrain vhog this leads to some loss of information concerning developmental relations and notably the relation develops from is not implemented in the vhog but it provides a simpler description of vertebrate anatomy which has proven relevant and useful to studying gene_expression e g it is used in the prosite database this has proven especially useful for human and mouse for which different ontologies describe anatomy during development and in the adult vhog and the hogs in bgee provide a high_quality mapping between these ontologies of note for queries on gene_expression in bgee a developmental_stage can be specified which then recovers only data from the correct structure fine_grained yet large_scale comparisons between model_organisms especially vertebrates such as mouse or zebrafish and humans is increasingly important in addition to providing a framework for evolutionary_studies the vhog provides a unique tool for relating humans and model_organisms additionally the association files of vhog and hog are unique resources in providing detailed judgments of homology between anatomical_structures with supporting evidence from the literature
