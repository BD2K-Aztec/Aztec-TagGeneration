a censored beta mixture_model for the estimation of the proportion of non differentially_expressed motivation the proportion of non differentially_expressed is an important quantity in microarray_data analysis although many statistical_methods have been proposed for its estimation it is still necessary to develop more efficient methods methods our approach for improving estimation is to modify an existing simple method by introducing artificial censoring to p values in a comprehensive simulation_study and the applications to experimental_datasets we compare our method with eight existing estimation methods results the simulation_study confirms that our method can clearly improve the estimation performance compared with the existing_methods our method can generally provide a relatively accurate estimate with relatively small variance using experimental microarray_datasets we also demonstrate that our method can generally provide_satisfactory estimates in practice microarray_technology is a powerful_tool complex_diseases and for assessing the effects of drugs at the molecular level it is an experimental method by which thousands of genes can be printed on a small chip and their expression can be measured simultaneously it can be used to detect changes in gene_expression between normal and abnormal cells which enables scientists to detect novel disease related genes many statistical_methods have been developed for this purpose although other advanced genomics technologies such as rna_sequencing have been developed microarrays have been continuously used for broad biomedical_studies furthermore since the structures of data from different genomics technologies are basically to whom correspondence should be addressed similar methods for analyzing microarray_data can also be useful for analyzing other similar genomics data performing statistical_tests for a large_number raises the need for an adjustment for multiple_hypothesis mht a widely used method to address_this is the false_discovery fdr that evaluates the proportion of false_positives among claimed positives fdr control is less stringent than the traditional family_wise fwer control such as the bonferroni_correction and provides more power for discovering differentially_expressed however estimating fdr involves the estimation of the proportion of non differentially_expressed null genes corresponds to the proportion of differentially_expressed a reliable estimate of is also of great_importance to the sample_size for microarray experiment_design a variety of methods have been proposed for estimating proposed qvalue this method uses the ordered p values and a cubic spline and estimates as the value of the fitted spline at a value close to suggested bum a beta uniform mixture_model with the estimate of being the value of the fitted model at convest a method introduced by utilizes a non parametric convex decreasing density estimation method and gives the value of the density at as an estimate of a histogram based method has also been proposed the above methods usually provide conservative estimates of in other words they are expected to give positively biased_estimates this has been considered an advantage since it protects against overestimating the number of differentially_expressed many other methods have also been proposed for estimating proposed a non parametric moment based method coupled with sample splitting to achieve the identifiability and obtained a closed form formula for presented the successive exclusion procedure sep which successively excludes genes until the remaining u values transformed p values are sufficiently close to a uniform_distribution u sep estimates by j m where j is the estimated number of null genes and m is the total number of genes estimated the marginal density of p values using a bernstein polynomial density estimation and gave a closed form expression for their estimator obtained an estimate of through bayesian_inference from a mixture_model which requires the distribution of p values from non null genes to be stochastically smaller than that from null genes in addition to the above methods there are still many other proposed methodspage microarrays have been widely used in biological and medical studies an accurate estimate of the proportion of differentially_expressed is important in false_positive control and experiment_design therefore the improvement of existing estimation methods still remains important our proposed method for estimating provides an effective solution although it is arbitrary the choice of provides an overall satisfactory_performance in our simulation_study the advantage of using our method is clear in the cases of moderate and large_sample and in these cases our method outperforms w r t rmse the other methods considered in this study in the case of small sample bum has a satisfactory_performance our method may be improved if an efficient method for the automatic selection of can be developed this issue will be pursued in our future_research although none of the estimation methods mentioned above considers the effect of gene_networks and interactions dependence among genes is still a difficult issue in microarray_data analysis however as investigated by methods that are based on the independence_assumption perform quite well in general situations of weak positive dependence and a positive dependency_structure is common in many situations a satisfactory_performance under weak positive dependence has also been confirmed in our simulation_studies
