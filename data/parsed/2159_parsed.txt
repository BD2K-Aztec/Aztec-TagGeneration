handalign bayesian multiple_sequence phylogeny and ancestral reconstruction we describe handalign a software_package for bayesian reconstruction of phylogenetic history the underlying model of sequence_evolution describes indels and substitutions alignments trees and model_parameters are all treated as jointly dependent random_variables and sampled via metropolishastings markov_chain mcmc enabling systematic statistical parameter_inference and hypothesis_testing handalign implements several different mcmc proposal kernels allows sampling from arbitrary target distributions via hastings ratios and uses standard file_formats for trees alignments and models availability_and installation and usage instructions are at http biowiki org handalign
