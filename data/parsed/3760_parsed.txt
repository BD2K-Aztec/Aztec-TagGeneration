sequence_analysis proteomic_analysis and prediction of human phosphorylation_sites in subcellular_level reveal subcellular specificity motivation protein_phosphorylation is the most common post_translational ptm regulating major cellular_processes through highly_dynamic and complex signaling_pathways large_scale comparative phosphoproteomic studies have frequently been done on whole cells or organs by conventional bottom up mass spec trometry approaches i e at the phosphopeptide level using this approach there is no way to know from where the phosphopeptide signal originated also as a consequence of the scale of these studies important information on the localization of phosphorylation_sites in subcellular_compartments scs is not surveyed results here we present a first account of the emerging field of subcellular phosphoproteomics where a support_vector svm approach was combined with a novel algorithm of discrete_wavelet dwt to facilitate the identification of compartment specific phosphorylation_sites and to unravel the intricate regulation of protein_phosphorylation our data reveal that the subcellular phosphorylation distribution is compartment type dependent and that the phosphorylation displays site_specific sequence_motifs that diverge between scs availability_and the method and database both are available as a web_server at http bioinfo protein_phosphorylation is a reversible post_translational ptm regulating major cellular_processes such as cell_division growth and differentiation through highly_dynamic and complex signaling_pathways approximately one third of proteins encoded by the human_genome are presumed to be phosphorylated during their life_cycle mass_spectrometry ms has been successfully used to identify protein_phosphorylation in specific pathways and for global phosphoproteomic analysis however phosphoproteomic approaches do not evaluate the subcellular_localization of the phosphorylated forms of proteins which is an important factor for understanding the roles of protein_phosphorylation on a global scale and the function of protein phosphorylations in regulating biological_processes unfortunately this understanding is limited by conventional ms technology to identify protein phosphorylations and their subcellular_localization subcellular phosphoproteomics still represents a major analytical challenge as only a few studies were reported over the past_years although efficient phosphopeptide enrichment_methods were available since this is in stark_contrast to the large number of subcellular proteomics_studies that have been reported over the same time period reviewed by several examples of subcellular phosphoproteomics were chosen to illustrate how this emerging field already uncovered important biological paradigms as shown by although subcellular phosphoproteomics has the potential to uncover new regulatory_pathways the in depth mapping of protein_phosphorylation at the subcellular_level and the further understanding of their biological_significance require independent methods computational_methods for identifying phosphorylation_sites have become increasingly popular which can predict potential targets to significantly reduce the number of candidates that need to be verified by ms a recent review by trost and kusalik described a comprehensive list of these methods most current predictors focus on organism specific or kinase specific phosphorylation_sites and such predictors do not take into account for specific subcellular compartment sc every subcellular context is highly_dynamic because the expressed proteins their abundance and their post_translational including phosphorylation depend on the physiological_state of the cell therefore annotating the subcellular phosphoproteome is important as can be viewed from the following four aspects i it can offer helpful clues or insights about their functions particularly one of the fundamental goals in proteomics and cell_biology is to identify the functions of proteins in the context of a specific compartment ii it can indicate in what kind of and how subcellular contexts the proteins interact with other molecules and with each other this is particularly pivotal for the in depth study of in vivo phosphorylation_networks one of the current hot topics in phosphoproteomics iii it can help our understanding of the intricate phosphorylation pathways that regulate biological_processes at the subcellular_level and hence it is indispensable for many studies in system to whom correspondence should be addressed biology iv it is extremely useful for identifying and prioritizing drug_targets http www biocompare com editorial articles subcellular targeting of proteins and drugs during the process of drug_development to efficiently accelerate development of the highly complex subcellular phosphoproteomic an integrated platform combining experimentally data querying and unknown data annotation is highly demanded here we developed a platform that provides both a searchable online database and a computational_tool to efficiently and reliably accumulate the subcellular phosphoproteome for further experimental_investigation in this work we report the most thorough characterization of subcellular phosphoproteome in humans to date originally reliable experimental phosphoproteomic data with verified information of subcellular_localization in humans were collected from several sources and used to profile subcellular phosphoproteome not only do we find that most phosphorylation proteins are uniquely resided in a specific sc but also we show that the distribution of phosphorylated proteins in scs is compartment specific functional_enrichment and proteinprotein network_analysis reveal that the phosphorylation signaling_pathways of scs have higher specialization moreover our large dataset allows us to delineate type specific phosphorylation sequence_motifs contrary to general phosphoproteome and we show that there are sequence_motifs of specific scs overall our observations highlight compartment specific phosphorylation signaling_pathways which stress the importance of mapping protein_phosphorylation in the physiologically_relevant sc later we developed a bioinformatics tool termed subphospred which combines a novel discrete_wavelet dwt algorithm with a support_vector svm approach to identify phosphorylation_sites for different scs in humans as one innovative character of our method the most attractive character of wavelet_transform is the ability to elucidate simultaneously both the spectral and temporal_information that was used for encoding as features for ptm prediction cross_validation tests show that the dwt algorithm can boost predictive_performance and obtain encouraging prediction results for each compartment additionally the independent test demonstrates that the proposed_method musite when the customized models use the same training_datasets as subphospred for subphospred we have trained eight compartment specific phosphorylation prediction_models cell_membrane cm nucleus nu cytoplasm cy mitochondrion mi
