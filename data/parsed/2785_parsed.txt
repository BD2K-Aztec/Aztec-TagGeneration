maligner a fast ordered restriction map aligner motivation the optical mapping system discovers structural_variants and potentiates sequence_assembly of genomes via scaffolding and comparisons that globally validate or correct sequence assemblies despite its utility there are few publicly_available tools for aligning optical mapping datasets results here we present software named maligner for the alignment of both single_molecule restriction maps rmaps and in silico restriction maps of sequence contigs to a reference maligner provides two modes of alignment an efficient sensitive dynamic_programming implementation that scales to large eukaryotic_genomes and a faster indexed based implementation for finding alignments with unmatched sites in the reference but not the query we compare our software to other publicly_available tools on rmap datasets and show that maligner finds more correct alignments in comparable runtime lastly we introduce the m score statistic for normalizing alignment scores across restriction maps and demonstrate its utility for selecting high_quality alignments optical mapping a single_molecule system constructs genome_wide physical_maps through the acquisition and analysis of large_datasets comprising restriction maps created from very long genomic dna_molecules kb such genome_wide restriction maps through analysis elucidate genomic_structure with a resolution of about kb thereby complementing dna_sequencing which provide relatively short range information at base_pair resolution optical mapping analysis has been used as part of large_scale sequencing_efforts and as a means for discovery of structural_variants in normal human and cancer_genomes despite such promise very few software_tools are freely_available for working with genomic mapping data for large_genomes soma is an open_source for aligning assembled sequence contigs to an optical map but does not scale to large_genomes and often gives incorrect contig placements due to the greedy nature of its alignment algorithm twin is a recently_developed tool for efficiently aligning sequence contigs to an optical map but as we show it does not allow for alignments which have unmatched sites limiting its applicability in noisy experimental_datasets here we present maligner an open_source software_package for aligning single_molecule restriction maps rmaps and in silico maps of contigs from a sequence_assembly to a reference restriction map at speeds that are comparable or faster than currently available tools maligner has two modes of alignment one which uses traditional dynamic_programming malignerdp and a secondindex based mode of alignment that runs orders_of but is more stringent in the alignments that it accepts malignerix in addition we present a novel method for normalizing the alignment scores across queries based on computing the median absolute deviation mad across the best random alignments which allows for the selection of an alignment score cutoff that is applicable across queries thereby obviating the need for a computationally_expensive permutation_test for determining alignment significance in this section we present results demonstrating the utility of the m score statistic in discerning correct alignments from spurious alignments next we compare the maligner software to other available software_tools by aligning in silico digested contigs from an e coli k sequence_assembly to both an in silico digest of the reference_sequence and an optical map we also align e coli k rmaps to the in silico reference_map lastly we demonstrate our methods on a large genome by aligning both sequence contigs and rmaps to an optical map of the budgerigar melopsittacus undulatus an australian parakeet
