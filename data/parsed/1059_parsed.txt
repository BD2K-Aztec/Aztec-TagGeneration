gene_expression compadre an r and web_resource for pathway activity analysis by component decompositions the analysis of biological_networks has become essential to study functional genomic_data compadre is a tool to estimate pathway gene_sets activity indexes using sub matrix decompositions for biological_networks analyses the compadre pipeline also includes one of the direct uses of activity indexes to detect altered gene_sets for this the gene_expression sub matrix of a gene_set is decomposed into components which are used to test differences between groups of samples this procedure is performed with and without differentially_expressed to decrease false calls during this process compadre also performs an over representation test compadre already implements four decomposition methods principal_component pca isomaps independent_component ica and non_negative nmf six statistical_tests t and f test sam kruskalwallis welch and brown forsythe several gene_sets kegg biocarta reactome go and msigdb and can be easily expanded our simulation_results shown in supplementary_information suggest that compadre detects more pathways than over representation tools like david babelomics and webgestalt and less false_positives than plage the output is composed of results from decomposition and over representation analyses providing a more complete biological picture examples provided in supplementary_information show the utility versatility and simplicity of compadre for analyses of biological_networks availability_and compadre is freely_available atthe analysis of biological_networks has become essential to study functional genomic_data for this the pathway activity index initially proposed to identify altered pathways is a method that has been successfully_applied recently for example it has also been used to detect pathways related to circadian_rhythm to predict cancer classification and survival and to identify chemical_features of drug_toxicity nevertheless there is no current software that facilitates pathway activity estimations one of the wide uses of the activity indexes is the detection of altered gene_sets emmert for this other methods that depend on a list or rank of interesting or differential expressed genes deg such as gsea david babelomics and webgestalt attempt to identify those gene_sets that are statistically over represented or under represented in such list because of the list dependency these tools may limit the number of associations found and could miss other subtle relations therefore approaches that consider all genes in a pathway should be theoretically more powerful and such analysis can be complementary because small but coordinated changes of several genes in a pathway would be also biologically_interesting plage is one of the approaches that consider all genes in a gene_set using dimensionality_reduction applying singular_value svd to detect differential expressed pathways however there is no tool currently available to perform this type of analyses since the transformation performed by svd can be seen as decomposition by principal_component pca we hypothesized that other linear_and decompositions that have also been used to analyse gene_expression may also detect coordinated differential expressed gene_sets for example independent_component ica non linear isomaps and non_negative nmf nevertheless such decompositions may be biased by deg for example pca designates components by the magnitude of the explained_variance consequently top components may reflect the variance of few deg instead of coordinated alterations of several genes results shown in supplementary_material demonstrate that some gene_sets that would be called significant by plage and that contain non significant numbers of deg are no longer significant after its removal suggesting that those significant gene_set calls were false_positives moreover we observed that several gene_sets can be detected as altered even when deg have been removed from the analysis therefore we developed compadre component pathway analysis of differential to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com expressed genes removed an r package for bioinformaticsminded users that implements gene_set decomposition to generate activity indexes in addition we implemented a web_application for biologists to detect differential expressed gene_sets we provide an r package and web_tool to estimate gene_sets activity indexes and to detect altered gene_sets the simplicity of use allows easy incorporation to bioinformatics_pipelines real_data examples shown in supplementary examples for breast_cancer circadian_rhythm and class_prediction illustrate the versatility and usability of compadre supplementary simulation_results suggest that compadre detects more pathways than over representation tools like david babelomics and webgestalt and less false_positives than plage results also imply that our novel analysis before and after deg removal is critical to decrease gene_sets false_positives in terms of true and false_positives pca was the best thus it is recommended for a first approach if results are scarce ica nmf or isomaps may be useful we conclude that compadre is a valuable_tool to estimate activity indexes and to detect differentially_expressed pathways from functional_genomics data
