geist a pipeline for mapping integrated dna elements there are several experimental contexts in which it is important to identify dna integration sites such as insertional_mutagenesis screens gene and enhancer_trap applications and gene_therapy we previously_developed an assay to identify millions of integrations in multiplexed bar coded samples at base_pair resolution the sheer amount of data produced by this approach makes the mapping of individual sites non trivial without bioinformatics support this article_presents the genomic integration_site tracker geist a command_line pipeline designed to map the integration sites produced by this assay and identify the samples from which they came geist version a more adaptable version of our original pipeline can identify integrations of murine leu kemia virus adeno_associated tol transposons or ac ds transposons and can be adapted for other inserted elements it has been tested on experimental_data for each of these delivery vectors and fine_tuned to account for sequencing and cloning artifacts availability_and geist uses a combination of bash shell scripting and perl geist is available at http research nhgri nih gov software geist the technique of identifying the sites at which foreign_dna integrates into a genome has many uses in genomic_research with the approach for identifying these sites taking numerous forms insertional_mutagenesis can be used as a powerful forward_genetic gene_therapy can be tested to establish the expected level of insertional mutagenic_activity gene and enhancer traps are important tools for tagging and studying genomic_elements in each case it is important to have a means of identifying the integration sites preferably at as high a resolution as possible for small_scale studies this may be accomplished through inverse pcr or through linker mediated pcr lm pcr subcloning and sanger_sequencing at a larger scale a high_throughput approach is preferable we developed a method capable of identifying millions of integrations from a single run of high_throughput lm pcr sequencing to maximize efficiency the method uses bp dna_barcodes that can be used to multiplex samples or discriminate between independent integration_events the large_volume of data produced by this approach means that an unassisted interpretation of the sequencing output is nontrivial therefore we have developed the genomic integration_site tracker geist to address this geist accepts a bam or fastq file of paired_end lm pcr sequences and a file indicating the association between samples and barcodes the software returns a bam_file of the sequences at each integration junction a browser_extensible bed file for easy visualization of the integration patterns and a summary of how often each barcode was detected published_by this work is written by us government employees and is in the public_domain in the us
