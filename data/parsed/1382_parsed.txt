systems_biology differential_network for the identification of condition specific pathway activity and regulation motivation identification of differential expressed genes has led to countless new discoveries however differentially_expressed are only a proxy for finding dysregulated pathways the problem is to identify how the network of regulatory and physical_interactions rewires in different conditions or in disease results we developed a procedure named dina differential_network which is able to identify set of genes whose co regulation is condition specific starting from a collection of condition specific gene_expression dina is also able to predict which transcription_factors tfs may be responsible for the pathway condition specific co regulation we derived tissue_specific gene_networks in human and identified several metabolic_pathways as the most differentially_regulated across the tissues we correctly_identified tfs such as nuclear_receptors as their main regulators and demonstrated that a gene with unknown function yeats acts as a negative_regulator of hepatocyte metabolism finally we showed that dina can be used to make hypotheses on dysregulated pathways during disease_progression by analyzing gene_expression across primary and transformed hepatocytes dina identified hepatocarci noma specific metabolic and transcriptional pathway dysregulation availability we implemented an on line web_tool http dina tigem it enabling the user to apply dina to identify tissue_specific pathways or gene_signatures gene_expression geps measured in different conditions and cell_types via microarrays or more recently next_generation have been extensively used in computational_systems to reverse_engineer gene_regulatory the main use of reverse_engineering has been the identification of unknown regulatory or functional interactions among genes micrornas and proteins from large_datasets state of the art reverse_engineering methods model gene_networks as static processes i e regulatory_interactions among genes in the network such as direct physical_interactions or indirect functional interactions do not change across different conditions or tissue_types however different cell_types or the same cell_type but in different conditions may carry out different functions and it is expected that their regulatory_networks reflect these differences several methods have been proposed to identify active subnetworks across different conditions from changes in gene_expression one of the first attempts is a general method to search for active sub networks connecting genes with unexpectedly high levels of differential_expression this method requires in input a single network and it identifies a set of genes i e subnetwork whose expression changes across two conditions however changes in expression may be mild or absent even when the subnetwork is active hence looking only at the differential_expression levels of genes could be not sufficient therefore more recent_approaches attempted to identify differential co regulation dc of genes in the subnetwork by differentially co regulated dc genes we mean set of genes which are co regulated only in a specific condition but not in others the main differences among all of these approaches are in how the genes to be tested are selected how co regulation is measured i e pearson_correlation or mutual_information and how dc across the conditions is quantified some of the most advanced methods go beyond pair_wise co regulation and aim at automatically identifying de_novo subnetwork s containing genes whose co regulation changes the most across two or more conditions this is achieved by advanced optimization techniques such as genetic_algorithms which however are computationally_intensive as they require checking all of the possible subnetworks to identify the ones that are most dysregulated hence these methods are limited in the number of different conditions that can be compared and they may require fine_tuning of the algorithm parameters to whom correspondence should be addressed
