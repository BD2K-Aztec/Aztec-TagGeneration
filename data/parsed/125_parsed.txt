structural_bioinformatics a detailed investigation of accessibilities around target_sites of sirnas and mirnas motivation the importance of rna sequence_analysis has been increasing since the discovery of various types of non_coding transcribed in animal cells conventional rna_sequence analyses have mainly focused on structured regions which are stabilized by the stacking energies acting on adjacent base_pairs on the other hand recent_findings regarding the mechanisms of small_interfering sirnas and transcription_regulation by micrornas mirnas indicate the importance of analyzing accessible regions where no base_pairs exist so_far relatively few studies have investigated the nature of such regions results we have conducted a detailed investigation of accessibilities around the target_sites of sirnas and mirnas we have exhaustively calculated the correlations between the accessibilities around the target_sites and the repression levels of the corresponding mrnas we have computed the accessibilities with an originally developed software_package called raccess which computes the accessibility of all the segments of a fixed_length for a given rna_sequence when the maximal distance between base_pairs is limited to a fixed size w we show that the computed accessibilities are relatively insensitive to the choice of the maximal span w we have found that the efficacy of sirnas depends strongly on the accessibility of the very end of their binding_sites which might reflect a target_site recognition mechanism in the rna_induced we also show that the efficacy of mirnas has a similar dependence on the accessibilities but some mirnas also show positive correlations between the efficacy and the accessibilities in broad regions downstream of their putative_binding which might imply that the downstream regions of the target_sites are bound by other proteins that allow the mirnas to implement their functions we have also investigated the off target effects of an sirna as a potential rnai therapeutic we show that the off target effects of the sirna have similar correlations to the mirna repression indicating that they are caused by the same mechanism availability the c source_code of the raccess software is available at http www ncrna org software raccess the microarraythe energy scales of the secondary_structure formations of rna_molecules are rather high compared with those of many biological_interactions and processes for example the free_energy of a single gc cg stacking is kcal_mol this value is about half of the kcal_mol of atp_hydrolysis atpadp ppi which is the basic energy unit of most biological_processes such as transcription and translation therefore the secondary_structure can strongly influence biological_processes involving rna_molecules recently a few studies that measure the regulatory_activities of mirnas and sirnas have revealed the importance of accessibility around the target_regions to these functional rnas an mirna represses the expression of its target_mrnas by recognizing the seed sequences in the target_genes which are about bp in length and are complementary to the end of the mirna sequence the repression will be inefficient if the seed sequences are buried within a strong secondary_structure of the target_mrna so that the corresponding rna_induced risc cannot access them because of a high energy_barrier an sirna represses the expression of the target_mrna that has the sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the sirna the accessibility around the target_sites has also been shown to influence the efficacy of sirnas despite the importance of the accessibility of interacting rna_molecules there have been few studies_investigating the regions of rna_sequences that do not form any base_pairs in this article we investigate the accessibilities around the off target_sites of sirnas and mirnas we define the accessibility
