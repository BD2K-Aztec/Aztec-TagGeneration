bioinformatics_discovery lengthening of utr increases with morphological complexity in animal evolution motivation evolutionary expansion of gene regulatory_circuits seems to boost morphological complexity however the expansion patterns and the quantification relationships have not yet been identified in this study we focus on the regulatory_circuits at the post_transcriptional level investigating whether and how this principle may apply results by analysing the structure of mrna_transcripts in multiple metazoan species we observed a striking exponential correlation between the length of untranslated_regions utr and morphological complexity as measured by the number of cell_types in each organism cellular diversity was similarly associated with the accumulation of microrna genes and their putative targets we propose that the lengthening of utrs together with a commensurate exponential expansion in post_transcriptional regulatory_circuits can contribute to the emergence of new cell_types during animal evolution for the past_decade of genome exploration research into the evolution of organismal diversity and morphological complexity has shifted its focus from raw genome_size to gene regulatory complexity multicellular_organisms may contain a variety of widely differing and specialized cell_types the morphological complexity thus can be defined as the number of distinct cell_types within a species generation of new cell_types may require exploring and reshaping the expression landscape that relies on expansion or rewiring of extant regulatory_circuits leading to a variety of cell_specific patterns complex gene regulatory_circuits may allow a greater variety of potential combinations of gene_expression thereby facilitating the generation of novel cell_types this principle has been studied mainly at the transcriptional level that is the regulatory_circuits of transcription_factors tfs and corresponding cis_regulatory on dna however recent_studies that the post_transcriptional is believed to be widespread also extensive co regulation and crosstalk between the transcriptional and the post transcriptional_levels have been suggested thus it is of great interest to examine whether and to what extent this principle may also apply at the post_transcriptional level
