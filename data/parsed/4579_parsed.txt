databases_and the cabig life_science business architecture model motivation business architecture models bams describe what a business does who performs the activities where and when activities are performed how activities are accomplished and which data are present the purpose of a bam is to provide a common resource for understanding business functions and requirements and to guide software_development the cancer biomedical_informatics grid cabig life_science bam ls bam provides a shared understanding of the vocabulary goals and processes that are common in the business of ls research results ls bam includes goals and people and groups within use case and activity unified modeling language uml diagrams here we report on the models current release ls bam its utility and usage and plans for future use and continuing development for future releases business architecture is defined as a blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding oforganization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands it provides clear concise descriptions of what an enterprise does its business capabilities who performs the activities within the enterprise organizational hierarchy and governance structures how activities are accomplished business processes which data are present within the enterprise business to whom correspondence should be addressed knowledge and where activities and processes occur these characterizations are documented within business models such as use case descriptions of goals activity and class diagrams the open each of which provides a different view of the enterprise business models can be used to i identify gaps dependencies or redundancies in personnel procedures and software ii standardize how enterprises operate and train people who lack domain expertise iii define business rules and logic and iv prioritize business goals and match business priorities with information_technology solutions due to these and other benefits the models have been successfully used within domains as diverse as accounting information_technology food service supply_chain management and telecommunications these domains have robust mature processes supporting software requirements gathering and development efforts that can be leveraged by informatics teams within the biomedical_domain indeed international_standards bodies such as the clinical data interchange standards consortium cdisc and healthlevel and the federal_government including the national_cancer nci united_states federal have begun adopting the models to support their informatics efforts for life_sciences lss and clinical research cr the community of researchers clinicians vendors and patient advocates taking part in the nci cabig initiative is developing a standards based informatics framework with the goal of establishing a shared and standardized infrastructure that will facilitate software interoperability platform independent interoperability i e software communication independent of operating system and computer language is crucial to creating a collaborative information network driving the exchange of data regardless of who collected them or how they are stored such interoperability will help accelerate the discovery of new approaches for cancer_diagnostics detection and therapeutics biomedical data_sharing is widely_held as athe four most general use cases as ovals that represent the activities that life_scientists undertake one supporting use case which can occur at the enterprise level of an organization or within subdivisions of the enterprise is shown in the inset the small icon in the bottom right corner of the use cases indicates that the use case is a composite i e it has one or more child use cases key_component to accelerate scientific progress reduce costs and decrease the time to move discoveries from the bench to the bedside thus paving the way to the discovery of new approaches for diagnostics detection and therapeutics to exchange data between independently built systems cancer research software must utilize common semantics to combat ambiguity data elements must have precise meanings conveyed by standard terminologies and must be set in the context of well described research processes to define how the software should function what data should be collected and when and with whom these data can be shared business models can support and facilitate the goal of software interoperability by providing a standard context describing ls research goals and activities to this end members of the cabig ls community have developed the ls business architecture model ls bam the ls research domain encompasses hypothesis and discovery based basic and pre cr spanning disciplines that include genetics biochemistry cell and molecular_biology and bioinformatics ls research is aimed at understanding biological_mechanisms processes and disease_states discovering disease_biomarkers and potential_drug and facilitating translational_research the ls bam documents the people organizations goals and processes that are part of the ls research domain enterprise through use cases and actors use cases are textual descriptions of tasks that are performed to achieve specific goals while actors are the entities that carry out or are otherwise associated with the goals defined in the use cases actors can be individuals e g principal investigators or graduate_students groups or committees e g the institutional_review or core facilities or entire institutions the model is composed of a use case diagram which depicts the compositional relationship between use cases and activity diagrams which logically order use cases and actors the ls bam describes goals that are common to all ls research sub domains including how ls research is planned and performed the organizations resources and methodologies involved how data and materials are controlled and analyzed and how outputs are disseminated the model provides a framework for understanding the business of ls research through a common set of ls use cases and vocabulary that when used to define requirements for information systems supporting ls work will facilitate data_exchange and integration the ls bam may further be useful for staff_training standards development and software validation for software_development efforts in the public_and here we report on the models current release ls bam use case unified modeling language uml model pdf and internet explorer viewer https wiki nci nih gov x ofnyaq activity diagram its real_world applications and plans for its usage continuing development and integration with other models to create a translational_medicine bam the cabig community welcomes feedback on this model http bit ly dysx the ls bam contains a use case diagram and an exemplar activity diagram the use case uml consists of use cases and actors https wiki nci nih gov x ofnyaq as part of future efforts the actors will be integrated into the use case diagrams the ls bam activity diagram logically orders seven use cases into a workflow associates three actors to the appropriate goals and is also available for download http bit ly bqyslv the cabig ls bam provides a blueprint of the business capabilities business processes and business knowledge common to the ls domain the scope of the ls bam use case diagram was established such that it is not an exhaustive description of the details of all institutional governance structures or the business capabilities processes and knowledge of each ls sub domain but rather those entities that are common across the ls domain indeed if the goal of the ls bam were to exhaustively describe all details of biomedical_research it could of course expand indefinitely as areas of priority are identified by nci governance teams for software_development or other business needs future ls bam releases will be extended as required to meet these needs thus the ls bam should provide enough detail to meet the current informational needs of stakeholders by documenting goals common among all ls research with the anticipation of further use case decomposition as needed specific examples of how the ls bam is currently being used for software_development and requirements traceability are described below
