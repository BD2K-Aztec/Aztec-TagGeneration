viralpro a tool to identify viral_capsid and tail sequences motivation not only sequence_data continue to outpace annotation_information but also the problem is further exacerbated when organisms are underrepresented in the annotation databases this is the case with non human pathogenic viruses which occur frequently in metagenomic_projects thus there is a need for tools capable of detecting and classifying viral_sequences results we describe viralpro a new effective tool for identifying capsid and tail protein_sequences which are the cornerstones toward viral sequence_annotation and viral_genome classification availability_and the data software and corresponding web_server are available from http scratch proteomics ics uci edu as part of the scratch suite as of april of the protein_sequences referenced in uniprotkb trembl are predicted protein_sequences for the non predicted sequences only have been confirmed through biological evidence while the remaining is inferred by homology and this imbalance will continue to worsen in the foreseeable_future the situation is even worse for specific classes of important organisms in particular viruses the majority of which lack proper annotation for instance it is typical to encounter only of annotated sequences in marine viral samples although these viruses play_key the ecosystem it is for instance estimated that marine viruses kill up to of the living biomass in the oceans daily and this organism turnover may play_a in the global carbon_cycle in short new computational_tools are needed to help identify and annotate unknown viral_sequences one criterion for virus classification is the genomic_organization and sequence of the genes coding for structural proteinsi e the proteins that compose the virion in particular capsid and tail proteins capsid_proteins in particular are present in all viral_genomes and as suggested in the capsid genes may be used as an equivalent of s rrna for prokaryote identification in genomes and metagenomes previously a tool called ivireons has been introduced to detect structural proteins in phagesi e viruses that infect bacteria the tool uses a single inputthe average amino_acid of the query sequencewhich is fed into three classification neural_networks one for all structural proteins one for tail proteins and one for capsid_proteins as stated by the authors the tool performs well at detecting phage capsids but its performance degrades when used to detect capsids in other viruses the structural protein predictor has a reasonable sensitivity to all capsids but its specificity is too low to address these problems we develop viralpro
