data_and compounds in literature cil screening for compounds and relatives in pubmed searching for certain compounds in literature can be an elaborate task with many compounds having several different synonyms often only the structure is known but not its name furthermore rarely_investigated compounds may not be described in the available literature at all in such cases preceding searches for described similar compounds facilitate literature mining highlighted names of proteins in selected texts may further accelerate the time consuming process of literary research compounds in literature cil provides a web_interface to automatically find names structures and similar structures in over million_compounds of pubchem and more than million citations provided by the pubmed service cils pre_calculated database contains more than million parent compoundabstract relations found compounds relatives and abstracts are related to proteins in a concise heat map like overview compounds and proteins are highlighted in their respective abstracts and are provided with links to pubchem and uniprot availability an easy to use web_interface with detailed_descriptions help and statistics is available fromthe search for certain compounds in pubmed http www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed as the largest repository of biomedical citations is an elaborate task for several reasons i the vast and rapidly_growing number of citations leads to time consuming searches particularly if researchers do not want to solely rely on mesh http www nlm nih gov mesh indexing and author given keywords furthermore information on compounds may be hidden in the context because the authors did not mention them exclusively as key_words ii compounds can have a variety of different synonyms more than in of all pubchem compounds and each synonym should be searched to achieve a comprehensive result iii if researchers do not know the exact name a structure search has to be conducted first iv a compound is newly_discovered or developed and therefore not or only rarely described in literature thus preceding similarity_searches can find compounds giving hints on potential biological_actions v to assess the biological_context of the compound i e interacting_proteins large_parts of the texts have to be read vi considering such points the problem of search duration arises but the result is desired instantly several published approaches exist for text_mining and information_retrieval for compounds proteins and combinations the publicly_available compound resource pubchem http pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov contains options for d similarity_searches some of the existing_tools cannot be seamlessly integrated in the desired workflow while others lack a concise and comprehensive result overview thus compounds in literature cil was developed a webserver that combines the related_tasks of compound and literature screening an extended computer infrastructure specialized algorithms and data_structures were used to provide a user_friendly for compoundrelated research cil results provide a heat map like overview comprising compounds similar compounds proteins and citations with highlighted found entities using this kind of structured and comprehensible information cil allows for analyses of obvious and hidden potential biological_functions of compounds
