data_and ct d tracking microglia motility in d using a novel cosegmentation approach_motivation cell_tracking is an important method to quantitatively analyze time lapse microscopy data while numerous methods and tools exist for tracking cells in d time lapse images only few and very application specific tracking tools are available for d time lapse images which is of high relevance in immunoimaging in particular for studying the motility of microglia in vivo results we introduce a novel algorithm for tracking cells in d time lapse microscopy data based on computing cosegmentations between component trees representing individual time frames using the so_called tree assignments for the first time our method allows to track microglia in three_dimensional confocal time lapse microscopy_images we also evaluate our method on synthetically generated data demonstrating that our algorithm is robust even in the presence of different types of inhomogeneous background_noise availability our algorithm is implemented in the ct d package which is available undercapturing the motility of cells using time lapse microscopy has become an important approach to understanding processes such as the cell_cycle neuronal division and migration immune_response or the development of cancer based on phase contrast confocal or two photon microscopy such live_cell protocols are now commonly established and corresponding equipment is commonly available this has triggered the need for computational_methods to quantitatively analyze timelapse microscopy data in this context identifying individual cells and tracking their identities over time is one of the basic ingredients for computational_analysis hence cell_tracking algorithms have attracted considerable attention in recent_years here we introduce a novel algorithm for cell_tracking that allows to track cells in particular zebrafish microglia in d two photon image_sequences over time the majority of cell_tracking algorithms as surveyed byor miura deals with cell_tracking in d over time methods range from linking cells identified in individual frames using different segmentation approaches to active_contour or level set algorithms the challenges imposed by the nature of the images to be analyzed lie in phenomena such as cell_divisions cells entering or leaving the displayed area or a large number of cells that needs to be tracked simultaneously in addition cell_tracking is often complicated by background inhomogeneity for instance due to uneven illumination and cells touching each other while these issues have been addressed extensively for tracking cells in d surprisingly few approaches have addressed cell_tracking in d besides naive thresholding approaches there are only few advanced approaches such as the active_contour based method proposed by recently several authors proposed reliable_methods for tracking centrosomes in caenorhabditise legans embryos yet these approaches are tailored toward tracking small bright and circular objects which e g resemble a gaussian spot of a specific size such assumptions however are not satisfied by the complex and highly_variable shapes of microglia under consideration here cell_tracking is also relevant in the context of tracking cell_populations in vitro which has_attracted recently the lack of methods for tracking cells in d has been reported as a limiting_factor for instance in the context of immunoimaging despite the well established protocol to capture microglia innate_immune in the central_nervous in d using two photon microscopy following the seminal works by motility analysis has been performed by and limited to manual estimations derived from d projections in the numerous studies following these protocols in fact tracking microglia cells is complicated by several aspects microglia tightly contact specific brain_structures in their resting_state often making_it to clearly separate them from their surroundingpage we evaluated our algorithm on two types of data first we applied it to an in vivo time lapse sequence of d two photon images of zebrafish midbrain displaying the motility of microglia second we applied ct d to synthetically generated data for quantifying the accuracy of our cell_tracking results evalutation on in vivo data was accomplished by comparison with manually_annotated trajectories of specific microglia in three datasets note that manual_annotation is limited to trajectories whereas boundaries of the cell volumes are almost impossible to obtain in d beside systematic problems with manual annotations hence we additionally created synthetic ground_truth data to further evaluate the performance of our method we followed the procedure used in generating noise perturbed elliptical objects of average_intensity i o above poisson distributed background_noise of intensity i b in addition to the procedure from we created perturbed images with different types of background inhomogeneities as shown in in a second set of data we introduced a multiplicative vignetting effect to the data following the vignetting model byunder different focal lengths f and off axis illumination parameters in a third set of data we introduced an additive linear gradient along the x axis of different slopes each time series consists of time frames each of size pixels on these data we ran ct d with size cutoffs min and max and a single_node cutoff of pixels in the resulting sequences all cells whose identity could be traced through the complete_sequence were kept while all other cells were discarded using the at d tool
