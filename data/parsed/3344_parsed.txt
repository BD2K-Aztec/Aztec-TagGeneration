genome_analysis on the simultaneous association analysis of large_genomic a massive multi_locus association test motivation for samples of unrelated_individuals we propose a general analysis framework in which hundred thousands of genetic_loci can be tested_simultaneously for association with complex phenotypes the approach is built on spatial clustering methodology assuming that genetic_loci that are associated with the target phenotype cluster in certain genomic_regions in contrast to standard methodology for multilocus analysis which has focused on the dimension_reduction of the data our multilocus association clustering test profits from the availability of large_numbers of genetic_loci by detecting clusters of loci that are associated with the phenotype results the approach is computationally fast and powerful enabling the simultaneous association testing of large_genomic even the entire_genome or certain chromosomes can be tested_simultaneously using simulation_studies the properties of the approach are evaluated in an application to a genome_wide for chronic_obstructive we illustrate the practical relevance of the proposed method by simultaneously testing all genotyped loci of the genome_wide and by testing each chromosome individually our findings_suggest that statistical methodology that incorporates spatial clustering information will be especially useful in whole_genome studies in which millions or billions of base_pairs are recorded and grouped by genomic_regions or genes and are tested jointly for association in the search for disease susceptibility_loci dsls genome_wide gwas have been a successful instrument for the identification of replicable genetic_associations for most complex_diseases and phenotypes they discovered numerous genetic_associations that can be validated in independent populations although the genetic effect_sizes of the loci are relatively small despite the large number of detected loci gwas association_signals are only able to explain a small fraction of the overall predicted heritability i e the phenomenon of missing_heritability one possible explanation for this phenomenon is synthetic associations simulation_studies theoretical_considerations and empirical_evidence suggest that genetic_associations as they are detected by gwas can be caused by multiple rare_variants rvs because common_variants are poor proxies for rvs or are not in linkage_disequilibrium ld with rare diseasecausing variants it may be difficult to identify or characterize rare dsls in gwas data another plausible explanation for the phenomenon of missing_heritability is insufficient statistical_power due to the multipletesting problem in a gwas millions of genetic_loci are tested individually for association with the target phenotype and the test results have to be adjusted for multiple_comparisons leading to extremely_small p value thresholds for overall statistical_significance the standard approach has been aimed to increase the sample_size of gwas as much as possible for example several meta_analyses of gwass have contained the data of study subjects however such large_sample hold the danger of increased study heterogeneity and do not necessarily lead to increased statistical_power the fundamental issue with the standard analysis approach to gwas single locus association testing and adjustment for multiple_comparisons is that an increase in genomic resolution i e adding more and more genetic_loci to the analysis does not increase the probability to detect dsls but diminishes the statistical_power of the approach to address_this multilocus tests have been suggested for example gene based analysis has been advocated to complement allelic_association analysis of single locus this is motivated by the idea that causal_variants for one disease tend to reside in proximity to each other and variants in adjacent regulatory_regions are more likely to have functional_relevance plink to whom correspondence should be addressed the versatile gene based test vegas test and the lasso regression_method for gwas have been proposed later on proposed a gene wide significance gwis test which estimates the number of independent effects within a gene for next_generation data methods that aggregate over a set of rvs to search for associated genomic_regions with the disease status are shown to be more powerful than single locus approaches e g the cohort allelic sums test cast the combined multivariate and collapsing cmc method the weighted_sum statistic by madsen and browning the kernel_based adaptive clustering kbac test the sequence_kernel skat replication based test rbt and so forth there are several advantages of such gene based tests over single loci tests first collapsing the small effects across the variants within a gene could give larger effect_size to detect the association second due to the smaller number of genes to be tested the multiple_testing is reduced moreover the associations of genes across different populations can be directly compared even though there could be different ld patterns within the genes across the populations however most of the approaches can handle only a limited number of genetic_loci i e typically none of them is able to incorporate the information about the physical location of the loci and their clustering in this article we are proposing a novel approach_called the bin test that can test a large genomic_region for association with the target phenotype by taking_into the physical location of the variants that show evidence for association and their physical clustering the genomic_region can refer to one gene a specified segment of the genome a pathway an entire chromosome or the complete genome the approach is computationally fast and applicable to binary and complex phenotypes the methodology is evaluated in simulation_studies using a gwas dataset from the copdgene study and is applied to several collaborating chronic_obstructive copd genetic_studies the simulation_studies and the application results suggest that the approach has sufficient power to test simultaneously all genotyped loci on the entire_genome or a specific chromosome we assessed the performance of the ks test and the bin test using simulations based on the genotypes of the african_american aa samples in the gwas dataset of the copdgene study also the bin test was applied to the copd status of several collaborating copd genetic_studies to look for copd susceptibility_loci in the application section
