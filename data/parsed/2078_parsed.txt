structural_bioinformatics glycodigest a tool for the targeted use of exoglycosidase digestions in glycan structure_determination sequencing oligosaccharides by exoglycosidases either sequentially or in an array format is a powerful_tool to unambiguously determine the structure of complex n and o link glycans here we introduce glycodigest a tool that simulates exoglycosidase digestion based on controlled rules acquired from expert_knowledge and experimental_evidence available in glycobase the tool allows the targeted design of glycosidase enzyme mixtures by allowing researchers to model the action of exoglycosidases thereby validating and improving the efficiency and accuracy of glycan analysis availability_and http www glycodigest org protein_glycosylation plays_a in a wide_range advances in glycansequencing technology show that glycoproteins and glycolipids exist in many glycosylated variants or glycoforms which can differ substantially in their biochemical_properties and functions glycans are structurally_diverse incorporating a wide_range of monosaccharide residues and glycosidic_linkages given that protein_glycosylation is involved in numerous_cellular and is implicated in disease_progression the ability to accurately characterize glycan_structures and substructures and the determination of the function of these modifications is increasingly important however the difficulty associated with oligosaccharide sequencing has resulted in researchers using only their knowledge of the biosynthetic_pathways for protein_glycosylation to report proposed glycan_structures various analytical platforms are available for the sensitive and efficient analysis of n and o glycans such strategies_include chromatographic and electrophoretic separations with fluorescence_detection mass_spectrometry ms and a combination of both however each particular methodology has its strengths_and especially in terms of the information content structural_features that can be readily measured for example limitations in material the lack of fragments and resolution separation of peaks may yield only partial structures whereby the linkage the identity or sequence of residue s cannot be fully identified the use of orthogonal methodologies for structural and functional glycomics overcomes these constraints but often necessitates the integration of results from multiple complementary tools
