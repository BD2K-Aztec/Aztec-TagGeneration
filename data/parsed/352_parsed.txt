an integer_programming framework for inferring disease complexes from network data motivation unraveling the molecular_mechanisms disease calls for methods that go beyond the identification of single causal_genes to inferring larger protein assemblies that take part in the disease process results here we develop an exact integer_programming based method for associating protein_complexes with disease our approach scores proteins based on their proximity in a protein_protein to a prior set that is known to be relevant for the studied disease these scores are combined with interaction information to infer densely interacting protein_complexes that are potentially disease associated we show that our method outperforms previous ones and leads to predictions that are well supported by current experimental_data and literature knowledge availability_and the datasets we used the executables and the results are available atthe association of genes with disease is a fundamental problem with important medical_applications gene_prioritization techniques are based on different types of data ranging from sequence and homology_information to function and molecular_interactions see bromberg for a review state of the art methods for prioritization employ proteinprotein_interaction ppi_information based on the empirical finding that genes that cause similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in the ppi_network many methods have been developed following this reasoning score a candidate_gene in a linkage interval according to the clinical overlap between the phenotypes associated with its interactors and the disease in question perform a random_walk on the ppi_network starting at the known disease genes and rank candidate_genes by the steady_state probabilities induced by the walk apply a propagation algorithm that starts at causal_genes weighted by the phenotypic similarity of the disease they cause and a query disease and compute a strength ofassociation function that is smooth over the network focused on the tissue where a given disease is manifested and executed the same propagation algorithm over a tissue_specific network that was inferred by gene_expression data another approach for performing gene_prioritization is via inference from existing functional_annotations for example rank candidate_genes by the semantic_similarity of their go annotations to the go terms associated with the known disease genes this approach however relies on the availability of gene_annotations and thus could miss related genes with yet unknown function a related line of works relies on the description and comparison of phenotypes using ontologies in particular computed all the pairwise similarities between phenotypes in several organisms as well as phenotypes associated with human_diseases a model_organism phenotype that exhibits_high similarity to a human phenotype may suggest the corresponding genotype as a candidate for the human disease integrated this approach with exome sequence_analysis by considering both the phenotypic relevance of a gene as well as evidence from its sequence reflecting the rarity and pathogenicity of the genes variants despite the availability of numerous methods for exposing the genomic basis_underlying human_diseases most of these methods are limited to the discovery of individual genes many studies however link diseases to dysfunctions of assemblies of proteins working in concert a well known example is the leigh_syndrome an inherited neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiencies in mitochondrial complexes
