bioinformatics_discovery sequence_analysis aragonite associated biomineralization proteins are disordered and contain interactive motifs motivation the formation of aragonite mineral in the mollusk shell or pearl nacre requires the participation of a diverse set of proteins that form the mineralized extracellular_matrix although self assembly processes have been identified for several nacre proteins these proteins do not contain known globular proteinprotein binding_domains thus we hypothesize that other sequence_features are responsible for nacre matrix proteinprotein assembly processes and ultimately aragonite biosynthesis results of mollusk aragonite associated protein_sequences contain at least one region of intrinsic_disorder or unfolding with the highest percentages found in framework and pearl associated proteins relative to the intracrystalline proteins in some instances these intrinsically_disordered were identified as bind fold sequences and a limited number correlate with known biomineral relevant sequences interestingly of the aragonite associated protein_sequences were found to contain at least one occurrence of amyloid like or cross strand aggregation_prone supersecondary motifs and this correlates with known aggregation and aragonite formation functions in three experimentally tested protein_sequences collectively our findings indicate that aragonite associated proteins have evolved signature_sequence traits of intrinsic_disorder and aggregation_prone regions that are important for their role s in matrix assembly and mineralization the nacre layer of the mollusk shell and pearl deposit are both high performance composites consisting of the calcium_carbonate polymorph aragonite and polysaccharides and proteins the protein and polysaccharide macromolecular components form a d lamellar network around each single_crystal aragonite tablet that contributes to the architecture organization and molecular_properties of the nacre layer although we are still in the early_stages of understanding the role s that proteins play in nacre construction it is clear that some proteins are self associative and participate in the formation and stabilization of fracture resistant single_crystal aragonite whereas other proteins have different responsibilities such as enzyme catalysis protease activities and cell receptor_binding thus far three different classes of nacre associated proteins have been identified in mollusks the framework or interlamellar protein_family is associated with the chitin polysaccharide containing water_insoluble tri layer matrix that surrounds each aragonite tablet in contrast the intracrystalline protein_family is extracted as a water_soluble and is intercalated or found in organic inclusions within aragonite lastly there is a family of proteins associated with the formation of the nacre pearl deposit collectively few of these nacre proteins possess known globular binding_domains that are typically associated with protein assembly hence there must be other sequence_features that drive nacre protein matrix assembly which in turn drives aragonite formation recent bioinformatics studies revealed that intrinsically_disordered and aggregation_prone domains exist within the diverse set of human extracellular_matrix protein hecmp sequences these domains are believed to be responsible for observed matrix assembly and hierarchal ordering of the hecm we hypothesize that similar sequence_features must be at work in the aragonite extracellular_matrix protein aecmp scenario as well with this in mind we initiated a bioinformatics study of aecmp sequences arising from seven different molluscan species supplementary these sequences were analyzed at the global level for intrinsic_disorder and aggregation propensities our study indicates that all aecmp sequences possess one or more disordered sequence_regions with predicted to possess one or more bind fold_recognition regions interestingly of the aecmps were found to possess aggregation_prone amyloid or prion like cross strand supersecondary motifs we conclude that as per the human ecm intrinsically_disordered and aggregation_prone sequences are key molecular_features that contribute to the formation and function of mollusk nacre to whom correspondence should be addressed in this study we confirm that of the studied nacre proteins contain one or more regions of intrinsic_disorder supplementary and of these same proteins possess one or more interactive regions such as bind fold or amyloid like motifs hence we conclude that like their hecmp counterparts the aecmps have evolved signature molecular traits of intrinsically_disordered and aggregation_prone interactive sequences that enable matrix assembly as expected each nacre protein class possesses distinguishing_features framework and pearl associated classes possess the highest percentages of intrinsic_disorder bind fold regions and amyloid like sequences and supplementary conversely the intracrystalline class possesses lower percentages of intrinsic_disorder supplementary and fewer bind fold and aggregation_prone sites figs and thus proteins with higher percentages of interactive regions such as the framework or pearl subclasses may be involved with multiple_targets e g silk like fibroin proteins chitin polysaccharide and other framework proteins and thus require longer length and or more numerous interactive regions to participate in intermolecular_interactions with diverse targets conversely the intracrystalline proteins may be designed for a limited number of protein matrix interactions within organic inclusions and hence require fewer interactive regions to achieve this we believe that the presence and extent of intrinsic_disorder and interactive sites in a given aecmp are related to i the functional_attributes of a given protein and ii the number and nature of potential matrix targets that a given protein interacts with the most unexpected finding was the presence of amyloid like cross strand supersecondary motifs a class of aggregation_prone sequences that have been linked with the evolutionary development of protein_folding and assembly hypothetical scheme for aecmp self assembly via aggregationprone and intrinsically_disordered domain interactions we assume that there are complementary domain pairings and that both types of domains are simultaneously active during assembly but this may not be universally true similar to what we observed for intrinsically_disordered the occurrence of tango identified aggregation_prone regions i e average number of motifs follows the relationship frame pearl intra we conclude that although amyloid like motifs are important for the function of all aemcps they appear to be critical for the framework specific lamellar layer possibly playing major roles in proteinpolysaccharide recognition proteinprotein assembly and elastomeric behavior under force in conclusion we believe that the sequence location and number of intrinsically_disordered and amyloid like supersecondary motifs may be important for aggregation protein orientation and assembly stability and may also play a role in the recognition and interaction of a given protein with other specific matrix_component s during the nacre biomineralization process these sequence_features will now become the subject of experiments aimed at confirming their functional_roles in nacre assembly
