a fast mathematical programming procedure for simultaneous fitting of assembly components into cryoem density maps motivation single_particle cryo_electron cryoem typically produces density maps of macromolecular assemblies at intermediate to low_resolution by fitting high_resolution structures of assembly components into these maps pseudo atomic_models can be obtained optimizing the quality of fit of all components simultaneously is challenging due to the large search_space that makes the exhaustive_search over all possible component configurations computationally unfeasible results we developed an efficient mathematical programming algorithm that simultaneously fits all component structures into an assembly density_map the fitting is formulated as a point_set matching problem involving several point sets that represent component and assembly densities at a reduced complexity level in contrast to other point matching algorithms our algorithm is able to match multiple point sets simultaneously and not only based on their geometrical equivalence but also based on the similarity of the density in the immediate point neighborhood in addition we present an efficient refinement method based on the iterative closest point registration algorithm the integer quadratic_programming method generates an assembly configuration in a few seconds this efficiency allows the generation of an ensemble of candidate solutions that can be assessed by an independent scoring_function we benchmarked the method using simulated density maps of protein assemblies at and an experimental cryoem map at resolution our method was able to generate assembly structures with root_mean errors which have been further reduced to by the local refinement procedure availability the program is available upon request as a matlab_code package to understand biological_mechanisms of cellular_processes highresolution structures of macromolecular assemblies are needed single_particle cryo_electron cryoem and image_processing typically produces d density maps of large assemblies at intermediate to low levels of resolution although the number of maps at subnanometer resolution is increasing significantly in recent_years allowing the identification of secondary_structure to whom corresponding should be addressed and even the tracing of the backbone for most cryoem maps the level of resolution is still not sufficient to directly determine the structure at atomic detail however a pseudo atomic picture of the entire macromolecule can be determined by integrating information about the atomic_structures of the individual components with the density_map of the assembly this integration is done via a process called density fitting where structures are fitted into the density maps by optimizing a quality of fit measure between the cryoem map and the density of the probe structure at a corresponding level of resolution a considerable challenge is the fitting of multiple components into the density_map of an assembly if no a priori_knowledge about the location of the components is available sequential fitting of components often fails when they cannot be unambiguously placed in the density_map as is often the case for maps of resolution and for assemblies with a large number of components in such cases all components must be fitted simultaneously into the map to identify the global optimum of the quality of fit measure the simultaneous fitting of components is difficult as the large search_space makes an exhaustive_search protocol that uniformly samples over all degrees_of computationally unfeasible to overcome this problem uses discrete sampling in combination with an inference optimizer and expands the quality of fit measure by additional information such as shape_complementarity between interacting components other fitting strategies simplify the search problem by reducing the complexity of the d volumetric density and structures in one method the initial density_distribution of assembly and components are approximated by a small set of gaussian functions to efficiently use gradient based optimization_methods for the structural optimization of component orientations gmfit other methods reduce the complexity of density maps to a small set of feature points so_called codebook vectors that are meant to best reproduce the density maps gross features such as its shape and mass_distribution the optimal positions of feature points can be determined by the vector quantization vq technique the fitting problem then effectively reduces into a common point_set matching problem this matching has been achieved by an exhaustive_search method
