data_and automatic identification of mixed bacterial_species fingerprints in a maldi_tof mass_spectrum motivation matrix_assisted ionization_time has been broadly adopted by routine clinical_microbiology for bacterial_species identification an isolated colony of the targeted microorganism is the single prerequisite currently ms based microbial_identification directly from clinical_specimens can not be routinely performed as it raises two main challenges i the nature of the sample itself may increase the level of technical variability and bring heterogeneity with respect to the reference_database and ii the possibility of encountering polymicrobial samples that will yield a mixed ms fingerprint in this article we introduce a new method to infer the composition of polymicrobial samples on the basis of a single mass_spectrum our approach relies on a penalized non negative linear regression_framework making use of species specific prototypes which can be derived directly from the routine reference_database of pure spectra results a large spectral dataset obtained from in vitro mono and bi microbial samples allowed us to evaluate the performance of the method in a comprehensive way provided that the reference matrix_assisted ionization_time fingerprints were sufficiently distinct for the individual species the method automatically predicted which bacterial_species were present in the sample only few samples were misidentified and bi microbial samples were correctly_identified in up to of the cases this method could be used in routine clinical microbiology practice availability_and the complete dataset including both the reference_database and the mock up mixture spectra is available atmatrix assisted laser desorption ionization_time maldi_tof has been introduced as a genuine paradigm shifting technology in microbiology between and this has been facilitated by the release of commercial_systems integrating instrument reference bacterial spectral databases and user_friendly reporting software although maldi_tof identification still requires to isolate bacterial colonies on solid culture_media it provides clear advantages i it requires a small amount of reagents reducing cost and waste per sample and ii of the isolates are identified within h after inoculation versus for classical techniques identifying a species on the basis of a new maldi_tof spectrum is a complex multiclass prediction_problem current commercial_systems can identify several hundreds of bacterial_species and a significant number of fungi this depends on efficient algorithms that ensure reliable identification results to address this classification task first approaches relied on similarity based ranking algorithms but the application of machine_learning such as support_vector and random_forests has more recently been reported as well every classification algorithm requires a reference or training database including multiple spectra from bacterial reference_strains and species the ongoing improvement of maldi_tof methods and databases should drive the introduction of innovative ms based applications into clinical microbiology this may include direct sample testing microbial typing and antimicrobial_susceptibility maldi_tof for the detection of pathogens directly from clinical_specimens is possible but only for a limited number of primary specimens and species improvement of such methods would constitute a major breakthrough in bacteriology currently these approaches suffer from difficulties in sample_preparation resulting in a low sensitivity and difficulties with polymicrobial samples the available algorithms tailored to identify bacteria from a pure colony are not able to characterize a bacterial mixture only a limited number of methods have been proposed to overcome_this and their performance has not been studied in detail we propose a new method for automatic bacterial mixture characterization from a single spectrum using a reference_database developed for routine bacterial_identification and evaluate it using an original in vitro spectral dataset results obtained on the actual dataset analyzed at the hybrid level as previously_defined are shown in the most striking observation we made was a drop of in the overall identification_performance with respect to the simulation_study versus we noted moreover that this gap was even more serious for mixed spectra versus hence a drop of whose proportion was lesser in the actual dataset versus to better understand this issue we resorted to a second simulation_study meant to reproduce the actual mixture dataset to do so each mixture of the in vitro dataset was reproduced a hundred times two strains were considered each time and the grid of relative concentrations considered to build the in vitro dataset was used which therefore provided a simulated dataset of spectra see supplementary_materials section s results obtained on this dataset are shown in the panel b of we noted that the identification_performance could be expected to be lower as a drop of almost in the identification_performance of mixed spectra was observed with respect to the previous simulation_study versus although the grids of concentration_ratios considered were slightly different nevertheless a drop of in terms of mixed spectra identification versus remained between the actual and this second simulated dataset results obtained for the various mixtures considered are shown in the middle column of we noted that the performances obtained on the actual dataset were relatively consistent with those obtained by simulation for six of the eight mixtures analyzed as such for the two remaining mixtures however strong discrepancies were observed in the case of mixture g we noted a much higher rate of erroneous identifications than expected it turned out however that these errors were within genus errors involving prediction of the species jnh flh instead of or together with the species jnh zij actually present in the sample as described in the supplementary_materials section s it seemed that the jnh zij strains involved in the mixtures were less specific to this species than were the majority of the strains of the reference dataset therefore this suggested that the reference dataset did not capture the full extent of biological_variability existing between strains of this species we noted moreover fromthat the level of separability between these jnh species was only slightly_higher above the threshold considered to define low discrimination between species fingerprints within a genus yields lower identification_performance at the species level but such cases are expected to be rare in routine settings a impact of the level of species separability within a genus on the decomposition performance the x axis shows the level of separability between the species of a given genus this quantity reflects the extent to which species of a genus can be discriminated based on their ms fingerprints and was obtained by comparing each individual spectrum to the prototype of its reference species and to the prototypes of the species of the same genus the y axis shows the proportion of spectra involving a component of a given genus for which this component was misidentified at the species level but correctly_identified at the genus level i e the corresponding species was mistaken for another species of the same genus or predicted together with other species of the same genus these two quantities were computed from the simulated dataset as described in detail in the supplementary_materials section s we noted that the proportion of erroneous decomposition greatly varied across genera and tended to decrease whereas the separability between species of the genus increased a minimum separability threshold of seemed to be required to reasonably identify a mixture component at the species level b hybrid identification_performance this figure shows the performance obtained when the simulated dataset was analyzed at a hybrid level where species for which the within genus separability was a threshold defined empirically from panel a were analyzed at the genus level c impact of the hybrid strategy on the actual mixture database each mixture was represented according to the level of within genus separability of its components shown on the x axis of panel a the horizontal_and gray lines show the threshold of used in this study to define a hybrid decomposition level and the color code illustrates the level of resolution considered to analyze each mixture mixtures a d h and j ended up being analyzed entirely at the genus level mixtures b c and e at the species level and mixtures f g and i at a hybrid level with one component defined at the species level and the other one at the genus level illustrated the difficulty of analyzing mixture d at the species level for instance d pairwise species separability in a large bacterial panel used for routine identification the level of pairwise species separability was computed from the species reference dataset involved in this study and from a larger dataset involving bacterial_species that was extracted from the database embedded in the vitek ms system data not shown the resulting distributions are shown as pairs boxplots gathering the values obtained for species belonging to the same genus orange or to distinct genera green the hybrid level therefore this suggested that these two species might have been analyzed at the genus level if the reference dataset captured more biological_variability regarding mixture h we noted a much higher rate of partial identification than expected this mixture involved a component of each gram type and it turned out that the gram_negative component was systematically detected whereas the grampositive component was often absent see supplementary_materials section s to explain this behavior we postulated that the mixture preparation which relied on optical density_measurements might have suffered from species specific_biases leading to either an underestimation or an overestimation of their actual concentrations to validate this hypothesis the pure bacterial suspensions used to generate the mixed_samples were numerated by flux cytometry and plate counting as described in the supplementary_materials section s it turned out that for the same level of optical_density mcfarland five to seven times more cells were present in the gram_negative suspension than in the gram_positive one this could be explained by the fact that the mcfarland standard is known to be accurate to estimate concentrations of gramnegative bacteria such as escherichia_coli and that the cells of the gram_positive species were larger than those of the gramnegative one see supplementary_materials section s as a consequence of this overestimation of the gram_positive concentration a mixed sample thought to be balanced was actually a five seven to one mixture in favor of the gram_negative component therefore this meant that a higher proportion of mixed spectra could be expected to lie below the mixture limit of detection which led to a higher rate of partial identification we noted also that while the performances obtained on the actual and simulated_datasets were relatively consistent for same genus mixtures b and c mixture b could be identified in more than half of the cases whereas a much higher rate of partial identification was observed for mixture c interestingly we noted fromthat the level of species separability within mixture b was much higher than within mixture c therefore this highlighted once again that the level of species separability had a direct impact on the rate of partial identification as discussed previously and in the supplementary_materials section s finally right shows the identification_performance obtained for mixed spectra depending on the relative concentrations of the species involved we noted an overall discrepancy between the simulated and the actual performances which could be explained in part by the poor results obtained for mixtures g and h for the reasons described earlier in the text we noted however that the gap increased when the mixtures were more unbalanced which therefore suggested that the simulation_model considered was optimistic for unbalanced mixtures we emphasize however that the performances obtained on the real_dataset were highly_consistent with those obtained by simulation for balanced mixtures and that of mixed spectra could be identified in this case we have developed a fully_automatic procedure to characterize a polymicrobial sample on the basis of a single mass_spectrum that uses the same reference_database as the one used to identify pure_cultures in clinical_routine therefore this method could be used in routine clinical microbiology practice when evaluated on a in vitro mock up dataset the procedure exhibited an encouraging performance when the reference bacterial fingerprints were distinct enough which is the case for most of the species of clinical real_dataset mixture identification_performance panels a and b respectively show the mixture identification performances obtained on the actual dataset and on the second simulated dataset when they were analyzed at the hybrid level defined from the left_hand figures show the mixture identification performances obtained globally and on mixed and pure spectra the center and right figures respectively detail the identification_performance obtained for mixed spectra within each mixture and according to the relative concentration on the major species at the hybrid level mixtures a and d were considered to be pure because they involved pairs of species of the same genera that were considered to be too similar interest few spectra were misidentified and mixtures were always at least partially identified more than of the mixtures were detected and correctly_identified the method was first evaluated by an extensive simulation_study which helped us in turn to optimally set its parameters this simulation_study revealed that the reference_panel and the mock up dataset considered in this study were relatively challenging interestingly we noted also that the results obtained on the actual dataset were consistent with those obtained by simulation some discrepancies were observed for two mixtures but they could be traced back an insufficient biological coverage of the reference_database in the first case and a bias in the sample_preparation that lead to an overestimation of the concentration of a gram_positive species for these reasons we believe that the performance truly attainable for this particular mixture panel lies between those obtained on the actual and simulated_datasets and would be higher for a less challenging panel in terms of perspective a natural question raised by this study is that of mixtures involving more than two species although we could not evaluate our method on real spectra in this setting a simulation_study described in suppplementary materials section s suggested that the approach could work reasonably well for balanced mixtures involving two to five species fingerprints the proportion of mixtures correctly or partially identified was of more and only a single component was missed in most cases of partial identification we note also that an estimation of the relative concentrations c i of the bacterial_species i k predicted to be present in the sample can be empirically_derived from the model_parameters estimated by the lasso according for instance to b c i i p k j j this possibility was not investigated in this work but the results obtained suggested that when a mixture was correctly_identified this estimation could be reasonably accurate in some cases see supplementary_materials section s our future work will be to evaluate the relevance of this approach for blood_culture or urine_samples without preculture this set up is likely to bring new challenges because the number of candidate bacterial_species may be larger and a stronger heterogeneity between the culture based reference_database and the spectra to analyze can be expected due to the matrix_effects of blood or urine although these barriers have still to be overcome the lessons_learned in this study and the simulation framework proposed will be valuable assets toward this goal therefore we think that our method provides an encouraging step toward future automated applications in clinical microbiology based on direct sample mass_spectrometry conflict of interest the authors are employees of biomerieuxbiomerieux a company creating and
