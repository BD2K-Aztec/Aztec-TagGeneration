rna skim a rapid method for rna_seq quantification at transcript_level motivation rna_seq technique has been demonstrated as a revolutionary means for exploring transcriptome because it provides deep coverage and base_pair level resolution rna_seq quantification is proven to be an efficient alternative to microarray_technique in gene_expression study and it is a critical component in rna_seq differential_expression most existing rna_seq quantification tools require the alignments of fragments to either a genome or a tran scriptome entailing a time consuming and intricate alignment step to improve the performance of rna_seq quantification an alignment_free method sailfish has been recently_proposed to quantify transcript_abundances using all k_mers in the transcriptome demonstrating the feasibility of designing an efficient alignment_free method for transcriptome quantification even though sailfish is substantially faster than alternative alignment dependent methods such as cufflinks using all k_mers in the transcriptome quantification impedes the scalability of the method results we propose a novel rna_seq quantification_method rna skim which partitions the transcriptome into disjoint transcript clusters based on sequence_similarity and introduces the notion of sig mers which are a special_type of k_mers uniquely associated with each cluster we demonstrate that the sig mer counts within a cluster are sufficient for estimating transcript_abundances with accuracy comparable with any state of the art method this enables rna skim to perform transcript quantification on each cluster independently reducing a complex optimization_problem into smaller optimization tasks that can be run in parallel as a result rna skim uses of the k_mers and of the cpu time required by sailfish it is able to finish transcriptome quantification in min per sample by using just a single thread on a commodity computer which represents speedup over the state of the art alignment_based while delivering comparable or higher accuracy availability_and the software is available at http www csbio rna_seq technique has been demonstrated as a revolutionary means for examining transcriptome because it provides incomparable deep coverage and base_pair level resolution though rna_seq sequencing exhibits itself as an efficient alternative to microarray techniques in gene_expression study it also brings unprecedented challenges including but not limited to how to rapidly and effectively process the massive data produced by the proliferation of rna_seq high_throughput how to build statistical_model for accurate quantification of transcript_abundances for transcriptome etc most of current rna_seq tools for rna_seq quantification contain two main steps an alignment step and a quantification step various aligners tophat splicemap mapsplice are devised to infer the origin of each rna_seq fragment in the genome the alignment step is usually time consuming requiring substantial computational_resources and demanding hours to align even one individuals rna_seq because there are multiple variations of rna_seq sequencing_techniques e g single_end sequencing and paired_end to facilitate the discussion in this article we simply refer to the read or the pair of reads from a rna_seq fragment as a fragment more importantly a significant percentage of the fragments cannot be aligned without ambiguity which yields a complicated problem in the quantification step how to assign the ambiguous fragments to compatible transcripts and to accurately estimate the transcript_abundances to tackle the fragment multiple assignment problem an expectation_maximization em_algorithm is often used to probabilistically resolve the ambiguity of fragment assignments at each iteration it assigns fragments to their compatible transcripts with a probability proportional to the transcript_abundances and then updates the transcript_abundances to be the total weights contributed from the assigned fragments until a convergence is reached the em algorithms simplicity in its formulation and implementation makes it a popular choice in several rna_seq quantification_methods scripture rsem express because all fragments and all transcripts are quantified at the same time in the em_algorithm it usually requires considerable running time some studies mmseq reduced the scale of the problem by collapsing reads if they can be aligned to the same set of transcripts it is also worth mentioning that rnaseq quantification is an important first step for differential analysis on the transcript_abundances among different samples the alignment step is a vital step in the rna_seq assembly study and has become the computational bottleneck for rna_seq quantification tasks if users are only interested in rna_seq quantification of an annotated transcriptome aligning rna_seq fragments to the genome seems cumbersome not only do the rna_seq aligners

quantification results from another perspective the annotation databases of transcriptome e g refseq and ensembl play_an in rna_seq quantification for example tophat cufflinks supports a mode that allows users to specify the transcriptome by supplying an annotation database a gtf file rsem uses bowtie a dna_sequence alignerto align fragments directly to the transcriptome aligning rna_seq fragments to transcriptome avoids the computation to detect novel splice_junctions in fragments and eliminates the non transcriptome regions in the genome from further examination and thus reduces the total running time of the quantification_method and the number of erroneous alignments in the results to further improve the performance the utility of k_mers was recently_proposed the concept of k mersshort and consecutive sequences containing k nucleic acidshas been widely used in bioinformatics including genome and transcriptome_assembly error_correction in sequence_reads etc because the number of k_mers in the genome or transcriptome is enormous when k is large e g k the need to store all k_mers impedes their counting most of existing_methods save memory_usage during the computation by using sophisticated algorithms and advanced data_structures bloom_filter lockfree memory_efficient hash_table suffix_array or relying on disk_space to compensate memory space thanks to the recent_advances in both annotated transcriptome and algorithms to rapidly count k_mers the transcriptomebased alignment_free method sailfish requires times less running time and generates comparable results with alignment dependent quantification_methods sailfish is a lightweight method it first builds a unique index of all k_mers that appear at least once in the transcriptome counts the occurrences of the k_mers in the rna_seq fragments and quantifies the transcripts by the number of occurrences of the k_mers through an em_algorithm regardless of being alignment dependent or alignment_free all methods need to recover the fragment depththe number of fragments that cover a specific locationacross the whole transcriptome as one of the initial steps however none of the existing_methods exploit the strong redundancy of the fragment depth in rna_seq more specifically shows a strong correlation between the fragment depth of any two locations that are a certain distance apart on the transcriptome varying the distance from to bp even when the two locations are bp away from each other the pearson_correlation score is still as high as in other words if an rna_seq quantification_method that is able to recover the fragment depths for every bp and quantify the abundance levels based on such information there should be no significant accuracy loss in the result recently uziela and honkela developed a method that simply counts the number of alignments that covers the locations of hybridization_probes used in the gene_expression studies though these probes only represent a sparse sampling on every transcript in the transcriptome the method still provides reasonably accurate results the observation and the method inspire us to ask the following question what is the minimum information we need to achieve comparable accuracy in rna_seq quantification to the state of the art methods more specifically does there exist a subset of k_mers that can provide accurate transcriptome quantification and if so how do we identify and use them to quantify transcriptome efficiently to answer_these we introduced a special_type of k_mers called sig mers which only appear in a small subset of transcripts in the transcriptome based on these sig mers we developed a method rna skim which is much faster than sailfish and also maintains the same level of accuracy in the results rna skim includes two stages preparation and quantification in the preparation stage rna skim first partitions transcripts into clusters and uses bloom filters to discover all sig mers for each transcript cluster from which a small yet informative subset of sig mers is selected to be used in the quantification stage in the quantification stage a rolling hash method is developed to rapidly count the occurrences of the selected sig mers and an em_algorithm is used to properly estimate the transcript_abundance levels using the sigmer counts because no sig mer is shared by two transcript clusters the task can be easily divided_into many small quantification problems which significantly_reduces the scale of each em process and also makes it trivial to be parallelized while rna skim provides similar results to those of alternative_methods it only consumes of the computational resources_required by sailfish in this article we first describe the rna skim method then discuss how we compared rna skim with other methods followed by the experimental_results using both simulated_and in this section we first compared alternative partition algorithms and how they impact sig mer selections in rna skim and then furnish a comparison with four alternative_methods on both simulated_and at last we demonstrated that rnaskim is the fastest method among all considered methods
