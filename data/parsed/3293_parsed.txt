sequence_analysis novel sequence_based method for identifying transcription_factor in prokaryotic_genomes motivation computational_techniques for microbial genomic sequence_analysis are becoming increasingly important with next_generation and the human_microbiome underway current sequencing capacity is significantly_greater than the speed at which organisms of interest can be studied_experimentally most related computational work has been focused on sequence_assembly gene_annotation and metabolic network_reconstruction we have developed a method that will primarily use available sequence_data in order to determine prokaryotic transcription_factor tf binding_specificities results specificity determining residues critical residues were identified from crystal_structures of dnaprotein complexes and tfs with the same critical residues were grouped into specificity classes the putative binding regions for each class were defined as the set of promoters for each tf itself autoregulatory and the immediately_upstream and downstream operons meme was used to find putative motifs within each separate class tests on the laci and tetr tf families using regulondb annotated sites showed the sensitivity of prediction and respectively there are more bacterial_species than from any other kingdom but only a few have been studied in much detail their relatively small_genomes make them readily amenable to sequencing and they now constitute the most abundant genome_sequences in the public_databases projects such as the human_microbiome and other metagenomic sequencing_projects promise to significantly increase the amount of genomic_sequence from bacterial_species for most of these species the genome_sequence is the only available information so computational_approaches are essential to learning more about their characteristics and capabilities most current computational_analyses focus on sequence_assembly the phylogenetic distributions of species functional to whom correspondence should be addressed classification of gene and metabolic network_reconstruction many of these analyses are accomplished through the identification of homologous_proteins with known function and the inference of functional_conservation in the newly_sequenced species as of yet there has been little computational work focused on transcriptional_regulation in these prokaryotic systems in this article we present a novel sequence_based method to infer the specificities of prokaryotic transcription_factors tfs through the comparisons of their dnabinding domains and applying a motif_finding algorithm to likely binding regions most prokaryotic tfs contain a helix_turn hth fold where the second helix also known as the recognition helix primarily contacts dna using crystal_structures of proteindna complexes we can determine a set of residues that is important for defining the specificity of the protein the critical residues commonly these hth tfs bind as homodimers with palindromic dna specificities previous_studies have utilized those features to identify regulatory_motifs in related bacterial_species but in those cases the tf that binds the motif was not identified except in cases where the motif corresponded to one for a known tf in general when the binding_motif for a specific tf is known and orthologous tfs are identified in other species one can transfer the knowledge about the motif and predict genes that are regulated by the tf in the new species making connections between novel motifs and the tfs that bind them can also be accomplished by taking_into additional information in that study the most useful information for identifying the tf that bound to a specific motif was the proximity of the tf within the genome to the locations of the predicted binding_sites in a similar approach motifs for orthologous tf were predicted based on the assumption of autoregulation in an earlier study of the escherichia_coli transcriptome of the tfs analyzed were estimated to be autoregulated martnez antonio and our analysis using regulondb indicates that this value increases to if one also includes the promoters of neighboring operons motif finders typically depend on having at least one of two types of data in a phylogenetic_footprinting approach one has orthologous_genes from a set of species and attempts to find the conserved binding_site motifs that control their expression using such data one can often findbetween releases and genbank contained complete bacterial_genomes and wgs datasets as well as plasmid and phage_genomes in this study we have focused on the laci pf and tetr pf pfam hth subfamilies the values shown are the number of sequences with the exception of the first values that are the number of domains and within the parentheses are the number of specificity clusters briefly usps are promoter sets that have been filtered to remove redundancy see section for more detail hamming_distance hd is a measure of similarity the number of substitutions required to change one string into another these two subfamilies comprise roughly of the hth domains in the pfam clan cl from that set of dna_sequences for laci there are domains when filtered to remove gaps in restricted positions multiple domains and missing promoter_sequences there are tfs remaining and we defined the critical residues based on three laci family proteins that have structures bound to dna laci pdb codes efa jwl pe ccpa pdb codes rzr zvv and purr pdb codes bdh bdi jfs jft jh pnr qp qp qp qpz qqa qqb vpw wet zay pua pub puc pud pue puf pug based on those structures we determine that there are critical residues positions in the respective pfam hmm domain pf using those positions to define the specificity classes there are a total of classes there are tetr domains which after the same data filtering as above lead to tfs in tetr we defined the critical residues based on three proteins that have structures bound to dna in the pdb tetr pdb code qpi qacr pdb code jt cgl pdb code yvh based on those structures we determine that there are seven critical residues from the respective pfam hmm domain pf using those seven positions to define specificity classes there are a total of classes the distribution of the sequences into these specificity clusters is shown in the identity of the residues at the critical residue positions defines a sequence tag for example the cluster tetr spkgsyh refers to the set of all proteins that are classified as belonging to the tetr family of hth proteins and have residues s p k g s y h in respectively for motif_finding the promoter_sequences with potential_binding were inferred using the computationally derived operons taking the promoter of the operon containing the tf and the upstream and downstream operon promoters as well these three promoters were concatenated into a super promoter which likely contained at least one binding_site for the tf there are a large number of similar genomes that have been sequenced many times these are simply different strains of model prokaryotic organisms this introduces the issue of similar sequence due to a similar lineage which could be resolved using a phylogenetic_tree however there is also the potential issue of horizontal_gene as well in order to resolve the potential promoter redundancy issue if the promoters were too similar they were reduced to one exemplar sequence the matches in regulondb are coded as follows y means a match to any site n means no matches and means no regulondb site the autoreg column is a if there is a match to the super promoter and if there is no match using primarily genomic sequence_data augmented with structural priors we are able to determine putative motifs for a number of bacterial tfs in two families the method described is capable of working not only with fully sequenced_genomes but also with sufficiently_long contigs allowing for the use of assembled metagenomic_reads using the meme program putative motifs were determined for laci and tetr classes of tfs representing of the sequences of each of these tf families for validation classes that had an excluded e coli usps were selected laci and tetr of these selected classes laci and tetr had known regulatory_sites in regulondb the majority of these motifs for laci and for tetr were consistent with the known regulatory_sites defined based on regulondb validating this approach even some of the motifs that did not match to known sites with scores exceeding our stringent threshold still had fairly_high scores and are likely to be very similar to the true motifs for those classes while this approach has proven to be useful there are several modifications to the method we describe in this article that should offer further improvements in our ability to determine binding_motifs for bacterial tfs the current protocol assumes a fixed width gap between the half_sites of the motif however there is no guarantee that proteins with similar critical residues must have similar gaps in the spacer region between the half_sites as the regions of the protein that determine these variable gaps are generally outside of the dna_binding even within the test_set we can see evidence of multiple widths in tetr spkgsyh in the first and third motif there is a tagacc half_site separated by a or base spacer from the complementary ggtcta for tetr npkgsyh these spacers are
