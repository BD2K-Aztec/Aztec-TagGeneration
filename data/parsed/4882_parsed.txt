structural_bioinformatics vsdocker a tool for parallel high_throughput virtual_screening using autodock on windows based computer clusters vsdocker is an original program that allows using autodock for optimized virtual ligand screening on computer clusters or multiprocessor workstations this tool is the first implementation of parallel high performance virtual_screening of ligands for ms windows based computer systems availability vsdocker is freely_available use at http www bio nnov ru projects vsdocker virtual_screening is a process of searching for small biologically active_molecules ligands from large compound databases by means of computer_assisted techniques virtual_screening is based on molecular_docking which currently plays_an both in the study of macromolecular structure and interaction and in drug_design however molecular_docking is extremely demanding for computing_resources on the other hand modern research often requires analysis of a large set of small ligands at acceptable time this reason determines a wide use of high_throughput computing clusters and algorithms autodock is one of the most widely used instruments for molecular_docking but it is not adapted for parallel working on a multiprocessor cluster an example of autodock adaptation for linux cluster system is dovis however there was no similar utility for ms windows systems to date to address this problem we have developed a new software_tool termed vsdocker this software possesses several features ensuring the increased performance of a screening process vsdocker provides automation of all virtual_screening steps including ligand and receptor preparation docking itself and analysis of results balanced distribution of cluster resources allows parallel screening of a large number of ligands vsdocker works both on multiprocessor computing clusters and to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address ifom the firc institute for molecular oncology foundation via adamello milan italy multiprocessor workstations operated by windows this makes possible an execution of virtual_screening tasks even on a single high performance multicore desktop that can be found virtually in every laboratory
