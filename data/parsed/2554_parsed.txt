gene_expression intron centric estimation of alternative_splicing from rna_seq motivation novel technologies brought in unprecedented amounts of high_throughput sequencing_data along with great challenges in their analysis and interpretation the percent spliced in psi metric estimates the incidence of single exonskipping events and can be computed directly by counting reads that align to known or predicted splice_junctions however the majority of human splicing_events are more complex than single exon_skipping results in this short report we present a framework that generalizes the metric to arbitrary classes of splicing_events we change the view from exon centric to intron centric and split the value of into two indices and measuring the rate of splicing at the and end of the intron respectively the advantage of having two separate indices is that they deconvolute two distinct elementary acts of the splicing reaction the completeness of splicing index is decomposed in a similar way this framework is implemented as bam ssj a bam fileprocessing pipeline for strand specific counting of reads that align to splice_junctions or overlap with splice_sites it can be used as a consistent protocol for quantifying splice_junctions from rna_seq because no such standard procedure currently exists availability the c code of bam ssj is open_source and is available at https one major_challenge in the analysis of high_throughput rna sequencing_data is to disentangle relative_abundances of alternatively_spliced many existing quantification_methods do so by using considerations of likelihood parsimony and optimality to obtain a consolidated view of cdna_fragments that map to a given transcriptional unit the advantage of such integrative approaches is that they provide robust estimators for transcript_abundance by reducing sampling errors as they effectively consider samples of larger_size in contrast because all the reads from the same transcriptional unit are combined into one master model there is no guarantee that the inclusion or exclusion of a specific exon is estimated independently of co occurring splicing_events the quantification of alternatively_spliced based on the metric captures more accurately the local information related to splicing of each particular exon we followin considering only the reads that align to splice_junctions and ignoring the reads that align to exon bodies position specific read_counts are not considered is defined aswhere the factor of two in the denominator accounts for the fact that there are twice as many mappable positions for reads supporting exon_inclusion as exon exclusion equation defines an unbiased estimator for the fraction of mrnas that represent the inclusion isoform under the assumption that splice_junction reads are distributed_evenly can also be derived from the expression values of whole isoforms for instance as the abundance of the inclusion isoform as the fraction of the total abundance however the non uniform read_coverage not only between but also within transcripts makes such estimates generally detrimental the metric can be generalized beyond the class of singleexonskipping events by counting inclusion and exclusion reads regardless of exon adjacency dashed arcs although this definition helps to reduce the undercoverage bias by taking_into splice_junctions that are not present in the reference annotation it often assigns misleading values to metric for instance in the case of multiple exon_skipping where the amount of support for exon exclusion does not reflect the true splicing rate of each individual intron
