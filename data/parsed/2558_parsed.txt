invertfregene software for simulating inversions in population_genetic data inversions are a common form of structural_variation which may have a marked effect on the genome and methods to infer quantities of interest such as those relating to population_structure and natural_selection however due to the challenge in detecting inversions little is presently known about their impact software to simulate inversions could be used to provide a better understanding of how to detect and account for them but while there are several software_packages for simulating population_genetic data none incorporate inversion polymorphisms here we describe a software_package modified from the forward in time simulator fregene which simulates the evolution of an inversion polymorphism of specified length location frequency and age in a population of sequences we describe previously_unreported signatures of inversions in snp data observed in invertfregene results and a known inversion in humans availability c source_code and user_manual are available for download from http www ebi ac uk projects bargen under the gpl licence an inversion mutation both reorientates and flips over the strands of a stretch of dna_sequence recombinations are typically only viable between sequences in the same orientation leading to the separate evolution of inverted and non inverted sequences at the locus while sequencing may distinguish inverted and non inverted sequences directly genotyping cannot because i unlike copy_number the allele intensity is unaltered and ii the alleles on the inverted sequence are mapped to their location on the reference_genome rather than their actual location however their effect on recombination may leave a discernible pattern on local linkage_disequilibrium ld while most research on inversion polymorphisms has been performed in drosophila recent analyses of sequence and snp data indicate that inversions are a common form of structural_variation in the human_genome studies have shown that inversions may effect genome_wide recombination_rates and be associated with natural_selection and disease antonaccil to whom correspondence should be addressed there has also been concern that inversions may bias statistical_methods for inferring quantities of interest such as those relating to population_structure and recent selection therefore statistical_methods have been developed to detect inversion polymorphisms from population snp data and methods for inferring population_genetic parameters may need revising to account for their presence however to test methods for detecting inversions and assess the robustness of population_genetic methods to the presence of inversions software to simulate genetic data incorporating inversions is required to our knowledge the only strategy adopted to simulate data with inversions consists of reorientating a proportion of sequences at a locus in the hapmap data while this strategy is simple and should produce data that reflects some features of inversion loci reorientating contemporary genetic data does not model the evolution of the inversion through time in particular the suppression of recombination between inverted and non inverted sequences which results in their subsequent independent segregation is not modelled but has specific effects on the data section fregene is a software_package that simulates population sequence_data forwards through time by simulating every meiotic and mutation event in a population of sequences over a fixed number of generations by simulating data forward in time fregene allows complex scenarios of demography and recombination to be modelled simultaneously this enables the generation of data closely matching the features of data from the major genotyping projects here we modify the software to produce an affiliated program invertfregene this is the first software_package to simulate genetic data with inversions and exploits the forward in time approach to model the fundamental_features of an inversion as it segregates using invertfregene we simulated a kb inversion at the centre of a mb region with a target inverted sequence frequency of displays a plot of minor_allele maf by physical position for the simulated region the inversion is spanned by a set of snps with maf close to forming a visible line at the inversion locus this feature occurs because mutant_alleles present on the original inverted sequence that were otherwise absent or very rare in the population should be present in every subsequent inverted sequence but not in non inverted sequences because there are no recombinations between sequences in opposing orientation these alleles therefore tag the inversion and have population frequency equal to that of the inversion the corresponding snps are perfectly correlated with each other the well established inversion at the mapt locus on chromosome has an estimated frequency of in europeans displays the maf plot at this locus forposition
