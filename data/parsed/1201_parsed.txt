crispr era a comprehensive design tool for crispr mediated gene_editing repression and activation the crispr_cas system was recently_developed as a powerful and flexible technology for targeted genome_engineering including genome_editing altering the genetic sequence and gene_regulation without altering the genetic sequence these applications require the design of single guide rnas sgrnas that are efficient and specific however this remains_challenging as it requires the consideration of many criteria several sgrna design_tools have been developed for gene_editing but currently there is no tool for the design of sgrnas for gene_regulation with accumulating experimental_data on the use of crispr_cas for gene_editing and regulation we implement a comprehensive computational_tool based on a set of sgrna design rules summarized from these published_reports we report a genome_wide sgrna design tool and provide an online web_site for predicting sgrnas that are efficient and specific we name the tool crispr era for clustered_regularly mediated editing repression and activation era availability_and http crispr erathe bacterial adaptive_immune crispr clustered_regularly was recently_developed as a powerful and multi purpose technology for genome_engineering including editing modifying the genomic_sequence and regulation repressing or activating expression of genes the system is highly programmable utilizing a single protein the nuclease cas for editing or the nuclease deficient dcas for regulation a single guide rna sgrna is required for precise and programmable dna targeting effective and specific genome_engineering requires careful design of sgrnas which remains_a computational_tools have been used to facilitate the design of sgrnas for crispr editing but not for other applications such as transcriptional_regulation these computational_tools should enable automated sgrna design and offtarget site validation a major_goal of our designer tool is to address the discrepancy for designing sgrnas that allow efficient and highly_specific repression or activation of genes and for generating genome_wide sgrna libraries for genetic_screening in different organisms
