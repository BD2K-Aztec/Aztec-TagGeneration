sequence_analysis cd_hit accelerated for clustering the next_generation data cd_hit is a widely used program for clustering biological_sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses in response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing_data produced by the next_generation we have developed a new cd_hit program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to cores and a quasi linear speedup for up to cores the enhanced cd_hit is capable of handling very large_datasets in much shorter time than previous versions availability http cd_hit org sequence_analysis has played_a in computational_biology with the advancement of the next_generation the amount of available sequencing_data is growing_exponentially removing redundancy from such data by clustering could be crucial for reducing storage space computational time and noise interference in some analysis methods etc cd_hit was originally developed to cluster protein_sequences to create reference_databases with reduced redundancy and was then extended to support clustering nucleotide_sequences since its release cd_hit has become very widely used for a large variety of applications ranging from non redundant dataset creation protein_family classifications artifact identification metagenomics annotation rna analysis to various prediction studies with sequencing_data rapidly_growing in public data_repositories as well as in individual laboratories there has been strong demand for an enhanced cd_hit with greater_efficiency in response to such demand we have developed this enhanced and parallelized version of cd_hit to exploit the fact that multi core machines have become very common in ordinary laboratories a computer cluster based parallelization procedure for cd_hit has been proposed in though not fully parallelized this procedure provides good speedup using computer cluster since computer clusters are not as easily available as multi core machines here we propose an alternative parallelization technique which assumes shared memory model and works well on multi core machines to see how much performance improvement has been achieved we tested the new cd_hit v and the old cd_hit v on a set of datasets including two protein sequence_datasets swiss_prot m sequences nr m sequences and two dna sequence_datasets humangut mh m reads and twinstudy srp m reads both the swiss_prot and the nr datasets were downloaded from ncbi ftp ftp ncbi nih gov blast db fasta on october we also compared cd_hit with a similar program uclust v from edgar these tests were done on a debian linux server with four core amd opteron processors equivalent parameters were used for different programs whenever possible details and additional_tests are available in supplementary_material compares the efficiency of the enhanced cd_hit to the previous version of cd_hit and the latest uclust the results demonstrate that the new cd_hit without using multi core is significantly more efficient than the old one and is comparable to or more efficient than uclust as well when multi cores are used the new cd_hit is much more efficient than either of them to test the effectiveness of the parallelization in the new cd_hit the full datasets were clustered using different number of cores the time speedups are shown in which indicates the parallelization has good speedup for up to cores with a quasi linear speedup for up to cores besides speed improvements the new cd_hit also has better clustering quality than the old cd_hit and uclust supplementary_material and
