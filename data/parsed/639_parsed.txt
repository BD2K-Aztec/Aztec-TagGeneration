a zero inflated poisson_model for insertion tolerance analysis of genes based on tn_seq data motivation transposon_insertion sequencing tn_seq is an emerging technology that combines transposon_mutagenesis with next_generation for the identification of genes related to bacterial_survival the resulting data from tn_seq experiments consist of sequence reads_mapped to millions of potential transposon insertion_sites and a large portion of insertion_sites have zero mapped_reads novel statistical_method for tn_seq data analysis is needed to infer functions of genes on bacterial_growth results in this article we propose a zero inflated poisson_model for analyzing the tn_seq data that are high_dimensional and with an excess of zeros maximum_likelihood of model_parameters are obtained using an expectationmaximization em_algorithm and pseudogenes are utilized to construct appropriate statistical_tests for the transposon_insertion tolerance of normal genes of interest we propose a multiple testing procedure that categorizes genes into each of the three states hypo tolerant tolerant and hyper tolerant while controlling the false_discovery we evaluate the proposed method with simulation_studies and apply the proposed method to a real tn_seq data from an experiment that studied the bacterial_pathogen campylobacter_jejuni availability_and we provide r code for implementing our proposed method attransposons are genetic_elements that can be inserted into genomes mediated by enzymes called transponsases an application of transposons in genomic studies is insertional_mutagenesis which refers to the construction of a library of bacterial_strains each being a mutant generated by random insertion of a transposon transposon_mutagenesis has facilitated our understanding of gene_functions through identifying the phenotypes of the corresponding mutants with the recent advent_of ngs_technologies it is possible to sequence many transposon insertional_mutants simultaneously and the resulting technique that combines transposon_mutagenesis with ngs_technologies has been referred to as transposon sequencing tn_seq the tn_seq technique generates huge amount of data and allows genome_wide analysis of gene_functions through mutagenesis four different transposon sequencing_technologies were proposed independently in and have been reviewed in van they all share similar ideas of sequencing the dna v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com sequences flanking the transposon insertion_site we conducted a tnseq experiment to identify genes involved in the growth of a highly virulent_strain ia of the bacteria campylobacter_jejuni which has been reported to be the major cause of sheep abortion and implicated in human gastroenteritis in the united_states by randomly inserting tn transposons into locations within the genome we generated a library of mutant bacterial_strains details of our tn_seq experimental_procedure are described in section s of the online supplementary_material in summary the genomic_dna was extracted from the library of mutants after growth in a liquid_medium after shearing the extracted dna into fragments and amplifying the fragments with transposon specific_primers we applied illumina_sequencing to obtain sequence_reads flanking the transposon insertion_sites by mapping the sequence_reads to the genome of c jejuni ia we identified locations of transposon insertions and measured the relative_abundance of mutants containing a transposon at each possible insertion_site by enumerating the sequence reads_mapped to the corresponding site the transposon used in our experiment tn can randomly insert into any locations of the target dna but was reported to insert at the end of the sequence a gntywranc t with a slight bias other transposons may have different sequence preferences of the insertion_sites for example the himar transposon inserts randomly between t and a in ta dinucleotides an important research objective in a tn_seq experiment such as ours is to classify genes according to their tolerance to transposon_insertion mutagenesis or equivalently to classify genes with respect to their effects on bacteria fitness growth a gene can be tolerant of disruption if the transposon_insertion into the gene does not affect the growth of bacteria on the other hand a gene is hypo tolerant of transposon_insertion if the inactivation of the gene by transposon_insertion suppresses the growth of bacteria such a gene may provide an essential or core function in bacteria survival a gene can also be hyper tolerant of transposon_insertion suggesting that the inactivation of the gene may provide a growth_advantage a successful antimicrobial_treatment needs to avoid inactivation of such hypertolerant genes the above classification has been discussed inand is adopted throughout our article in tn_seq data the count of reads corresponding to each possible insertion_site provides a measurement of the abundance of mutants containing a transposon at that location a gene may have zero counts of sequence_reads either because the gene is hypo tolerant to transposon_insertion and essential in bacteria survival or because no transposons were inserted into any location in this gene just by chance an appropriate statistical_model should take into consideration both the probability of transposon_insertion and the abundance of bacterial mutants in case that a transposon_insertion happens another challenge in tn_seq data analysis is the high_dimensionality usually thousands of genes are simultaneously studied in one tn_seq experiment whereas each gene contains up to thousands of locations for potential transposon insertions the outcomes of tn_seq experiments the read_counts are measured at the level of insertion locations which suggests the development of statistical_models at the same level to avoid loss of information besides statistical_models need to take into account of the variation among insertion locations within a gene as well as variation among genes there have been a few statistical_methods proposed for the analysis of tn_seq data and they deal with different levels of data summary some researchers proposed to first reduce the data from the level of locations to the level of genes using the count of locations with zero mapped_reads for each gene and then model such counts using discrete distributions such as poisson distributions or negative_binomial distributions such models ignore the magnitudes of the read_counts for locations with non zero counts which measures the abundance of the corresponding mutants and hence contains important information about gene tolerance status divided the genome into contiguous overlapping windows with width base_pair and then employed a non parametric test to assess tolerance status to bacterial_growth for each of these windows dejesus and loerger described a four state hidden_markov and used geometric distributions for the count_data at each location to model the conditional distribution of read_counts given different states and then each gene was assigned to a tolerance state according to the most frequent state found within the boundaries of the gene sequence presented a tn_seq data analysis_pipeline named artist one arm of artist el artist implements the method proposed bythat uses the results from the method proposed byas training_set for the hmm algorithm and reports the estimate of state of genes as essential domain essential sick or neutral all of these methods are applicable to tn_seq data with transposons inserted only into specific target locations such as transposon himar that only inserts into ta dinucleotides when using transposons say ez tn that could insert into any genome locations the resulting tn_seq datasets typically are unsaturated and contain excess zeros these methods have difficulty in dealing with such tn_seq datasets because they do not model the possibilities that no transposons are inserted into certain locations of genes during the construction of transposon mutant libraries in this article we propose a zero inflated poisson zip model to deal with the excess of zeros for the analysis of tn_seq data at the level of locations to account for the two possible reasons that give rise to zero read_counts at a given location we apply a mixture_model with a point mass at zero and a poisson_distribution the component of point mass at zero corresponds to the case when there is no transposon inserted at the location and hence there should be zero reads_mapped to the corresponding location this component is associated with a mixing probability that models the chance of not having a transposon_insertion at a location and this probability may vary across different locations depending on the genomic_sequence or potentially other covariates that may affect the chance of insertion the poisson_distribution component models the count of reads_mapped to the given location when a transposon is inserted there and the mean of the poisson_distribution provides a measurement of the abundance of mutants for the corresponding gene this model reflects how the count_data of tn_seq are generated at the location level and allows us to estimate the chance of having transposon_insertion and the abundance of mutants corresponding to different genes and the latter allows us to identify genes involved in bacterial_growth our tn_seq experiment studied one specific growth condition of the mutant library to classify genes with respect to their effects on bacterial_growth we utilize data of pseudogenes observed in the same experiment pseudogenes are dysfunctional relatives of genes that have lost their protein_coding abilities pseudogenes are still important in genomic studies because they provide a record of how the genomic_dna has been changed without evolutionary_pressure and can be used as a model for determining the underlying rates of nucleotide_substitution insertion and deletion in the genome in our model we consider pseudogenes to be tolerant of disruption as they have already lost their protein_coding abilities before mutagenesis thus comparing the normal non pseudo genes with pseudogenes provides information about the tolerance status of the normal genes more specifically the genes with mean abundance of mutants not significantly different from the mean abundance of pseudogenes mutants will be classified as tolerant and those genes with mean abundance of mutants significantly below above the mean abundance of mutants for pseudogenes are hypo tolerant hypertolerant we apply an expectationmaximization em_algorithm to estimate_parameters of the zip model including the mixing probability of insertion and mean abundance of mutants for thousands of genes then we estimate the asymptotic variancecovariance matrix of all estimated parameters and perform a wald_test for each gene to assess whether each gene is tolerant of transposon_insertion or not by comparing the mean abundance of mutants of this gene with that of the pseudogenes the method byis applied to control the false_discovery fdr as an error criterion in the multiple_testing at the end we classify all normal genes into three different classes hypo tolerant tolerant and hyper tolerant which reflects their tolerance to transposon_insertion the remainder of the article is organized as follows section_presents our zip model for tn_seq data our method to estimate model_parameters and our procedure for the multiple_hypothesis to identify the tolerance status for genes in section and section we present a simulation_study and a real_data analysis respectively section concludes the article with discussions a zip model is proposed in this article to model the excess of zeros observed in the tn_seq data the mixture_model of point mass at zero and a poisson_distribution are constructed specifically according to the way tn_seq data are generated multiple testing procedures are applied to classify genes into different categories with respect to transposon_insertion tolerance hence identify genes whose functions are closely_related to bacterial_growth we evaluated the proposed method using both simulation_studies and analysis of two real_datasets simulation_studies in section demonstrates that our proposed method_performs in terms of both the estimation of parameters and the classification of genes in the main text we discuss an application of our proposed model to the tn_seq data with the tn transposons which could be inserted possibly into any site within the genome our model can also be used in the analysis of tn_seq data from experiments where transposon insertions are restricted for example experiments using himar transposons that insert into ta dinucleotides only an application of our method to a himar dataset is presented in section s of the online supplementary_material investigation of the distributions of read_counts across gene coding_regions indicates that the resulting tolerance statuses classified by the proposed method are reasonable for both datasets to validate the results experiments with knock_out genes can be conducted if a gene is truly hypo tolerant or even essential disruption of this gene would reduce growth fitness or even cause death of the strain similarly knockout of a hyper tolerant gene would induce advantages for corresponding bacterial_growth the real_data we obtained only studied one growth condition and we propose to use pseudogenes as an internal_standard to set the threshold that classifies normal genes into hypo tolerant tolerant and hyper tolerant categories the threshold depends on the reliability of the list of pseudo genes and gene_annotations pseudogenes are a regular feature of bacterial_genomes which are dna_sequences that are closely_related to functional_genes but have mutations that destroy the function they are usually identified by comparison with the functional sequence in a close_relative allele if in the same species homlog if in another species the mutations in pseudogenes introduce premature stop_codon or frame_shift and then prevent normal translation of a functional protein in terms of nucleotide_composition and length they are similar to other genes in their genomes among different strains of c jejuni we found that the number of pseudogenes ranges from i e in ia to a few hundreds which account for about of the open_reading of their genomes in other taxa pseudogenes were commonly found to be at the similar ratio as revealed in staphylococcus pyogenes vibrio_vulnificus vibrio_parahaemolyticus yersinia_pestis and salmonella in experiments where several growth conditions are included our method can be easily generated to those applications by involving growth conditions as factors in modeling the insertion probability and the poisson mean our proposed method allows incorporation of covariates into the zip model and accommodates factors that might affect the insertion rate in the real_data analysis we quantified the increased insertion probability for the insertion_sites matching the target_sequence of the tn transposon such quantification provides insights into the mechanism of transposon_insertion besides matching with target_sequence other factors that may potentially_affect the transposon_insertion rate can also be fit into the zip model and tested for significance factors that may affect the mean abundance l g may also be incorporated into the model through poisson_regression large sample theory is implemented in our method while applying the wald_test in our tn_seq data we have more than one million locations which justifies the large sample assumption is satisfied the estimated_values of mean abundance have been used to classify normal genes into the three tolerance groups in addition the magnitude of the estimated_values of mean abundance measures how important the corresponding genes are with respect to bacterial_growth if the estimated mean mutants abundance of a normal gene is far above that of pseudogenes this suggests that the inactivation of this normal gene by transposon_insertion provides an obvious growth_advantage on the other hand if the estimated mean mutants abundance of a normal gene is far below that of pseudogenes or even close to zero this normal gene may have essential function on bacterial_growth to test for finite sample behavior of our method we also tried a simulation_study in which only several genes were simulated and we varied the number of possible insertion locations for each gene to check when our method is applicable and it turns out that the result is good enough as long as the number of possible insertion locations is or more conflict of interest none declared
