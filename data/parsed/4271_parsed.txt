sipan simultaneous prediction and alignment of protein_protein downloaded from motivation network prediction as applied to proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks has_received within the last decade because of the limitations of experimental_techniques for interaction detection and network construction several computational_methods for ppi network_reconstruction and growth have been suggested such methods usually limit the scope of study to a single network employing data based on genomic_context structure domain sequence_information or existing network_topology incorporating multiple species network data for network_reconstruction and growth entails the design of novel models encompassing both network_reconstruction and network_alignment since the goal of network_alignment is to provide functionally orthologous_proteins from multiple_networks and such orthology information can be used in guiding interolog transfers however such an approach raises the classical chicken or egg problem alignment_methods assume error_free networks whereas network prediction via orthology works affectively if the functionally orthologous_proteins are determined with high_precision thus to resolve this intertwinement we propose a framework to handle both problems simultaneously that of simultaneous prediction and alignment of networks sipan results we present an algorithm that solves the sipan problem in accordance with its simultaneous nature bearing the same name as the defined problem itself the sipan algorithm employs state of the art alignment and topology based interaction confidence construction algorithms which are used as benchmark methods for comparison purposes as well to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network_reconstruction via sipan we consider two scenarios one that preserves the network sizes and the other where the network sizes are increased through extensive tests on real_world biological data we show that the network qualities of sipan reconstructions are as good as those of original networks and in some cases sipan networks are even better especially for the former scenario an alternative state of the art network_reconstruction algorithm random_walk with resistance produces networks considerably worse than the original networks and those reproduced via sipan in both cases in proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks nodes represent the proteins and the edges correspond to interactions between pairs of proteins the ppi_networks are quite central in understanding cell regulatory_mechanisms extracting protein functions and in disease diagnosis several high_throughput techniques gave rise to extraction of large_scale ppi_networks for many organisms however experimental prediction of ppi_networks is usually time consuming and expensive thus many approaches based on a wide_range of computational_techniques have been suggested for the problem of ppi_network prediction existing computational_methods vary depending on the type of information they employ for predictions these include methods based on genomic_context structure domain or sequence_information see for useful reviews a crucial problem with the predicted networks is that the extracted set of interactions may provide erroneous_results in terms of false_positives therefore several methods have been developed for network reconstructions that are based solely on network_topology such methods usually rely on making new interaction predictions or identifying spurious interactions by examining node neighborhoods of a given network parallel to the growth in produced experimental_data several problem formulations and computational_methods have been developed for the comparative_analysis of genome_wide ppi_networks as well in particular biological network_alignment has been of particular interest in general terms given two or more ppi_networks from different species the network_alignment is to align the nodes of the networks or subnetworks within them functional orthology is an important application that serves as the main motivation to study the alignment problems as part of a comparative_analysis of ppi_networks a successful alignment could provide a basis for deciding the proteins that have similar functions across species such information may further be used in predicting functions of proteins with unknown_functions or in verifying those with known functions in detecting common orthologous pathways between species or in reconstructing the evolutionary_dynamics of various species network_alignment incorporate the interaction data and the evolutionary_relationships represented possibly in the form of sequence_data based on the assumption that the interactions among functionally orthologous_proteins should be conserved across species such an incorporation is usually achieved by aligning proteins so that both the sequence_similarities of aligned_proteins and the number of conserved interactions are large the problems of network prediction and network_alignment are intertwined the alignment_methods make use of the predicted interaction networks to produce output alignments with large interaction conservation and sequence_similarities on the other hand orthology detection maybe used in network prediction reconstruction however such an intertwinement creates a so_called chicken or egg problem the alignment_methods produce the orthologies based on the assumption that the interaction networks are correct and the interaction prediction detected from network alignments assume the proteins or the functional complexes are aligned correctly this intertwinement is especially evident with the topology based network prediction reconstruction methods which usually rely on a definition of similarity between node pairs the similarity might be a measure of direct neighborhood similarity such as sharing many common neighbors or some indirect neighborhood similarity usually described in some form of a graph_theoretical distance between nodes likewise one of the objectives of many alignment_methods is to provide alignments where the neighborhoods of aligned nodes are also similar in the sense that nodes in the neighborhoods are also aligned so as to provide large interaction conservation thus rather than considering the two problems independently we propose a new problem formulation encompassing both components simultaneously that of simultaneous prediction and alignment of networks sipan to the best of our knowledge this is the first study providing a model for capturing the simultaneous nature of the problems of network_reconstruction and alignment employing data from relevant databases we design two experimental_settings one where the network densities are preserved and one where network densities are increased we show that the network qualities of sipan reconstructions are as good as those of original networks and in some cases sipan networks are even better especially for the former scenario an alternative state of the art topology based network_reconstruction algorithm random_walk with resistance rws produces networks considerably worse than the original networks and those reproduced via sipan in both cases under most of the quality_metrics
