a method for identifying haplotypes carrying the causative allele in positive natural_selection and genome_wide methods for detecting positive_selection relied on finding evidence of long haplotypes to identify candidate_regions under selection however these methods generally do not identify the length and form of the selected haplotype results we present hapfinder a method which can find the common longest haplotype under three different settings from a database which is relevant in the analysis of positive_selection in population_genetics and also in medical_genetics for finding the likely haplotype form carrying the causal allele at the functional_polymorphism availability a java program implementing the methods described in hapfinder together with r scripts and datasets for producing the figures presented in this article are publicly_available athaplotypes refer to the specific combinations of alleles at different locations on a chromosome diploid organisms such as humans carry two copies of chromosomes and thus two haplotypes are present for each individual when considering the chromosomal arrangement of the alleles at several variant sites such as single_nucleotide snps at the fundamental level the haplotype carries most of the genetic_information particularly for the assessment of allelic correlation in the genome and in situations where the exact sequence arrangement on the chromosome is important however the technical ease of assaying a single base position in the genome means it is more common to obtain the aggregate information across the two chromosomes of an individual also known as the genotype the advent of affordable largescale genotyping technologies has permitted the genotypes of up to a million positions across the human_genome to be assayed simultaneously facilitating the studies on the genetic_etiology of to whom correspondence should be addressed common diseases and complex_traits across thousands of samples when only genotype_information is available resolving the exact arrangements of the alleles on the two haplotypes for an individual requires sophisticated_statistical machinery in a process known as haplotype_phasing a number of statistical_procedures have been formulated for inferring the haplotype phases from genotype data such as phase fastphase and beagle public_databases like the international_hapmap human_genome diversity project and singapore genome_variation project have generated reference genotypes for a considerable number of populations globally with statistically inferred haplotypes also available for a number of these populations generally the lengths of common shared ancestral segments of chromosomes in a population are short since recombination acts over time to break down long haplotypes an exception is in genomic_regions experiencing positive evolutionary_pressure of natural_selection where greater fitness in survival and procreation results in a higher propensity that offsprings in subsequent generations will increasingly carry the advantageous mutations this can increase the frequency of an advantageous allele and due to the hitch hiking effects of neighbouring alleles and insufficient time for recombination to occur result in haplotypes that are uncharacteristically long for a given haplotype frequency a number of sophisticated statistical_methods for example xp ehh and ihs have relied on finding such genomic_signatures of long haplotypes for identifying candidate_regions that are experiencing positive_selection however these methods generally do not identify the length and form of the selected haplotype the presence of linkage_disequilibrium ld in the human_genome implies that there will be numerous snps that are correlated with each other in large_scale genotypephenotype association studies the discovery of a trait associated region is often accompanied by a list of neighbouring snps displaying similar degrees of statistical_evidence due to the nature of ld most if not all of the identified alleles carried on these snps are likely to be found on a haplotype that also carries the functional allele at the unknown causal_variant this would be useful for narrowing the likely candidate_region where the functional_variant may be located particularly when evidence from multiplepage we have introduced a strategy for finding haplotypes under three scenarios that are relevant to the analysis of positive natural_selection and gwas the classical example of the sickle_cell locus was also used to highlight the utility of the method both in finding the selected haplotype and at estimating the likely frequency of the selected allele by simulating casecontrol data around an artificial causal snp for each of the three hapmap panels the method is able to identify the haplotype forms that carry the detrimental alleles at the associated snps that had emerged from the association analysis in each population separately all three haplotype forms identified from the respective hapmap populations correctly carried the functional allele at the simulated causal_variant further simulations indicate at least power in identifying the haplotype form which the functional allele resides on our method is able to identify the longest haplotype at a specified core frequency around a focal position theoretically this can be applied across the genome at every available snp and across a range of core haplotype_frequencies for a particular core frequency one may expect the lengths of the identified haplotypes to be distributed within a specific range and haplotypes that are uncharacteristically long for a particular core frequency could be the result of positive natural_selection happening within those genomic_regions this may provide another strategy in searching for candidate signals of positive_selection although there is a need to account for local effects of ld that may potentially bias the analysis work in progress the field of medical_genetics is now focusing its attention towards the fine_mapping of the functional_polymorphisms that explain the biological_mechanisms and underpin the genotype phenotype association_signals emerging from gwas however while ld has benefitted the initial examination for implicated regions in the genome long stretches of high_ld have paradoxically confounded the fine mapping_process by yielding numerous near perfect surrogates of the unknown causal_variant this complicates the process of distinguishing the causal_variant from neighbouring correlated markers when gwas data and high_resolution haplotypes e g those from the genomes_project http www genomes org for multiple_populations are available our method can identify the haplotype forms that are carrying most of the implicated detrimental alleles in the different populations by framing such trans population analysis within a rigorous statistical_framework it may be possible to identify the genomic_regions that are consistent with the association findings and the population specific reference haplotype_structure this could subsequently be developed to localize the candidate positions of the functional_polymorphism work in progress the popularity of genome_wide studies coupled with fast haplotype_phasing software like fastphase and beagle means it is realistically possible to statistically construct the haplotypes from the genotype data of thousands of samples this is likely to be extremely useful in both population and medical_genetics as second order information involving the arrangement of alleles on a chromosome can be more informative than first order information like the allele_frequencies from genotypes of individual snps particularly in understanding genomic_diversity across multiple_populations in fact several major population_genetics studies have relied on the haplotype diversity plots as empirical_evidence on the extent of inter population dissimilarities we thus introduce hapfinder a novel methodological development specifically_designed to find haplotypes within a population setting which complements statistical_tools for detecting positive natural_selection and facilitates progress in medical_genetics by locating the likely haplotype_structure that the functional allele will sit on this method has been implemented in a java program which is packaged together with scripts for producing graphical displays in r and is freely_available from http www nuscme org sg sgvp software hapfinder html this url also contains an interactive application for submitting online queries to find haplotypes from populations in phase of the hapmap and the singapore genome_variation project
