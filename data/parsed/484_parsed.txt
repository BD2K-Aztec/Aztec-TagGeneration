gene_expression arraylasso a network based_approach to microarray interconversion robust conversion between microarray_platforms is needed to leverage the wide_variety of microarray expression studies that have been conducted to date currently available conversion methods rely on manufacturer annotations which are often incomplete or on direct alignment of probes from different platforms which often fail to yield acceptable genewise correlation here we describe arraylasso which uses the lasso penalized generalized_linear to model the relationships between individual probes in different probe_sets we have implemented arraylasso in a set of five open_source r functions that allow the user to acquire data from public sources such as gene_expression train a set of lasso models on that data and directly map one microarray_platform to another arraylasso significantly predicts expression levels with similar fidelity to technical_replicates of the same rna pool demonstrating its utility in the integration of datasets from different platforms availability_and all functions are available along with descriptions at https a pressing issue in translational biology is the ability to reference and utilize historical microarray_datasets for large_scale discovery programs the appeal of using historical datasets includes capturing previous investment to construct larger cohorts despite interest in both industry and academia few groups have attempted to tackle the problem of platform integration current approaches primarily rely upon passing different microarray_platforms through a common identifier system such as entrezgene ids using specially_designed packages or online tools while these systems work well in cases where manufacturers have maintained annotations of their microarray databases id based conversion methods_fail for deprecated and undermaintained microarray_platforms another approach to convert between platforms is sequenced based wherein each sequence tag is aligned to the genome or transcriptome and annotated unfortunately it is often the case that de_novo annotations do not capture the complexity of the transcriptome e g for genes with alternative_splice to address the shortcomings of both annotation and sequencebased conversion methods we have developed arraylasso a lassoregression based network model our method directly predicts the probe expression levels of the target platform to demonstrate the accuracy of our method we show that predictions made using arraylasso are of similar accuracy to technical_replicates from the same mrna pool our methodology allows users to utilize currently available methodologies for integrating cross experiment microarray_datasets and allow for the construction of large cohort retrospective_studies to explore the performance of arraylasso we began by comparing our methods ability to predict expression to the biological_variation between replicates on the same platform we assessed the degree to which arraylasso could accurately_predict platform interconversions in three datasets representative of different experimental_systems organisms and platforms for the five platforms tested arraylasso predictions are within the technical variation of each microarray_platform when compared with technical_replicates from the same cdna pool even when subjected to multiple sequential conversions supplementary in addition once built arraylasso models can be used between experimental_conditions using the models_built on gse we predicted expression levels in gse with no significant loss of signal pearsons product moment correlation p while the results presented here do not guarantee similar results for all training and testing datasets these analyses serve as a promising proof_of furthermore our success with a relatively small dataset suggests that arraylasso may reach even higher levels of performance as the size of the datasets involved increases implementation in this investigation we propose a data_driven method for integrating across high_throughput genomic measurement modalities that avoids the use of annotation or sequence_alignment based tools we have implemented a lasso regressionbased modeling_approach to model the expression_level of each sequence tag in a target microarray as a linear combination of all sequence_tags in a source microarray our implementation represents a straightforward easy to use and open_source methodology for conversion between microarray_platforms limitations one drawback of our method is the need for extant or newly_generated matched_samples in the source and target platforms in our experience however there are a large number of datasets available that have matched_samples with replicates for a number of popular microarray_platforms a second limitation to our method is in conversion which lack overlap in gene coverage in these cases as with currently available methodologies our method will fail to provide_meaningful conversions lastly while we have shown in one case that interexperiment conversions are feasible we caution that systematic technical error in a single experiment may lead to the creation of a biased model in general however when coupled with one of several cross experiment dataset integration tools arraylasso will enable mining of the remarkable and untapped historical pool of microarray_datasets for large_scale metastudies for well powered discovery systems_biology in drug_safety and metabolism integration of microarray real_time and enzyme approaches
