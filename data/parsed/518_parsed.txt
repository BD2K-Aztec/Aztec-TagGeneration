assessing allele_specific across multiple tissues from rna_seq read data motivation rna_sequencing enables allele_specific ase studies that complement standard genotype expression studies for common_variants and importantly also allow measuring the regulatory impact of rare_variants the genotype tissue expression gtex project is collecting rna_seq on multiple tissues of a same set of individuals and novel methods are required for the analysis of these data results we present a statistical_method to compare different patterns of ase across tissues and to classify genetic_variants according to their impact on the tissue wide expression_profile we focus on strong ase effects that we are expecting to see for protein truncating variants but our method can also be adjusted for other types of ase effects we illustrate the method with a real_data example on a tissue wide expression_profile of a variant causal for lipoid_proteinosis and with a simulation_study to assess our method more generally availability_and advancements in sequencing_technologies are enabling unprecedented possibilities to study the transcriptome in rna_sequencing studies it is possible to distinguish between transcripts from the two haplotypes of an individual using heterozygous sites this approach called allelespecific expression ase analysis allows an alternative way to quantify cis_regulatory variation complementary to eqtl_analysis in addition ase has been utilized to analyze transcriptome effects of nonsense_mediated nmd triggered by predicted lossof function variants the genotype tissue expression gtex project is establishing a resource database and tissue bank for the scientific_community to study the relationship between genetic_variation and gene_expression in human tissues with an aim to to date some methods have been proposed for the analysis of ase data but these methods largely focus on a single tissue although some could be applied also to multiple tissues the multi tissue aspect is important for interpreting disease association findings since eqtl and early ase studies suggest widespread tissue_specific effects of cis_regulatory variants currently more sophisticated methods for cross tissue eqtl_analysis are emerging however eqtl_analysis requires large_sample while ase analyses can be conducted with significantly_smaller datasets in this article we present novel statistical_methods for analyzing ase patterns from rna_seq across multiple tissues our main motivation is phenomena such as nmd that can lead to a substantial imbalance of transcripts from the two alleles in and can vary_considerably between cell_types from a statistical point_of an advantage of prominent ase is that it can be detected even with a single individual and with as small a read_count as see middle panel offor the first question a standard frequentist version of the binomial_test is commonly used however an interpretation of such a test depends on factors like the read_count and simultaneous analysis of multiple tissues is very challenging hence we require that our statistical_framework allow a simultaneous comparison between several cross tissue models for observed data for example we want to weigh relative support of the model where all tissues show ase to the models where only a single tissue shows ase and to the null_model where none of the tissues show ase for this purpose we adopt a bayesian_model comparison framework among its favorable_properties are natural ways to compare models with differing number of parameters and to fully account for the amount of available data when evaluating relative support of the models we first assess performance of gtm on simulated_data and compare it with a standard heterogeneity measure second we illustrate gtm on a real_data example taken from the gtex project results of gtm are presented in supplementary_information the reference allele read_count for each tissue s was sampled from binn s h s where h s is for group n for group m and for group s we have introduced a statistical_framework to assess similarities and differences in ase between tissue_types a motivation for our work comes from ongoing rna sequencing_projects such as the gtex project that generates data on up to tissue_types per individual with read_counts per tissue and per site starting from around we have chosen a bayesian_approach because it leads to a consistent probabilistic quantification of the support that the data provide for each of the competing_models we see this as an advantage over a series of separate analyses such as for example would be needed by an approach that first assessed heterogeneity using the qstatistic and if no statistically significant_heterogeneity was observed would further classify the dataset into one of the homogeneous states previously two excellent studies on bayesian_models for expression data have been published byconsider a three stage hierarchical_model for allele read_counts from genome_wide rna_seq of one individual they observe allele counts at each heterozygous snv st level which are assigned to genes nd level whose common properties are controlled by genome_wide parameters rd level their model would be directly applicable also to multi tissue rna_seq where tissue_specific allele counts replace snv specific allele counts and sites replace genes at the second level of the model suppose for example that we had multi tissue rna_seq on a set of individuals who are heterozygous for at least one ptv the model ofwould produce posterior_distribution on the global proportion of the ptvs that show ase in at least one tissue type as well as variant specific posterior_probability of ase however it would not give as refined characterization of ase at each ptv as our hierarchical_model gtm supplementary_information and it would not do inference on tissue_specific group indicator parameters c s that allow probabilistic_model comparison between different patterns of ase developed a method for a joint eqtl_analysis across multiple tissues they work with micro array expression data using a linear_model that is not directly applicable to the datasets we have in mind read count_data from several tissues of a single individual they use tissue_specific binary indicator parameters that tell whether a variant is an eqtl in each tissue and introduce three ways to assign prior probabilities to different configurations of the indicators their lite model gives positive prior on only those configurations whose distance from homogeneity is at most their bma model is similar to what we have used in that the prior of a configuration depends only on its distance from homogeneity and that the total prior probability corresponding to each value of distance is the same finally their most complex bma hm model treats the weights of the configurations as random_variables and estimates them across genes using a hierarchical_model similar hierarchical_model that would learn joint ase patterns between tissues by a simultaneous analysis of a set of genetic_variants e g ptvs is also an important topic for further development of our hierarchical_model gtm even though hierarchical_models such as our gtm and those of are conceptually attractive we believe that gtms ability to analyze one ptv at a time has its merits from a practical point_of it is quick to run easy to understand and requires read count_data on only one variant heterogeneity measures our model assumes that all tissues in a same group have the same reference allele read frequency h in practice we expect that our model is robust to some heterogeneity within each group since the priors for different groups are so clearly separable from each other and supplementary our main interest is to assign tissue_types into three broad categories of ase and consequently we call a dataset heterogeneous only if some pair of tissues show fairly strong difference in the non reference allele_frequency standard heterogeneity measures such as q ask a slightly different question of whether parameters h s have exactly the same value across the tissues a frequentist answer to this latter question is given by an empirical p value of heterogeneity measures q or phetjy estimated under the null_hypothesis that all tissues have the same value for h parameter which is estimated from the data by this approach heterogeneity p values in the ecm example ofare and by using q and phet jy respectively as a test_statistic while these p values point to general heterogeneity between the tissue_types our gtm analysis leads to more detailed information considering the type of heterogeneity we see heterogeneity where at least one tissue type escapes ase our het state our heterogeneity probabilities are based on a lower_bound of the true marginal likelihoods of the heterogeneity states we showed that in a large majority of our datasets with tissues the approximation is accurate but the approximation may not always work as well with larger number of tissues therefore in addition to the heterogeneity probabilities we also compute for each pair of tissues a posterior expectation of the distance between them here we define the distance between two tissues to be if they belong to a same group and otherwise maximum of all pairwise_distances gives an indication whether there is heterogeneity between tissues by further defining the distance between the ase groups m and s to be we have a measure for particular kind of heterogeneity het where at least one tissue belongs to the no ase group n
