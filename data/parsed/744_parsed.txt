data_and biocontext an integrated text_mining system for large_scale extraction and contextualization of biomolecular events motivation although the amount of data in biology is rapidly increasing critical information for understanding biological_events like phosphorylation or gene_expression remains locked in the biomedical_literature most current text_mining tm approaches to extract information about biological_events are focused on either limited scale studies and or abstracts with data extracted lacking context and rarely available to support further research results here we present biocontext an integrated tm system which extracts extends and integrates results from a number of tools performing entity recognition biomolecular event_extraction and contextualization application of our system to million medline_abstracts and open_access full_text from pubmed central yielded over million mentions representing million distinct events event participants included over distinct genes proteins that are mentioned more than million times and linked where possible to entrez_gene identifiers over a third of events contain contextual_information such as the anatomical_location of the event occurrence or whether the event is reported as negated or speculative the amount of information available in the biomedical_literature is increasing rapidly with over articles_published daily http www nlm nih gov bsd index stats comp html while the information available in these articles now exceeding million in number represents a vast source of knowledge its sheer size also presents challenges to researchers in terms of discovering relevant_information efforts in biomedical_text tm seek to mitigate this problem through systematic extraction of structured data from literature to date progress in biomedical tm research has primarily focused on tools for entity recognition locating mentions of species genes diseases etc and the extraction of gene protein relationships recently there has been increasing interest to develop tm tools for the extraction of information about a wider array of biological and molecular_processes often referred to as events such as expression phosphorylation binding and regulation of genes and proteins community challenges have shown that extracting such events is often difficult because of the complex and inconsistent ways in which such processes are reported in the literature in addition most efforts to extract events have been restricted to limited scale studies or abstracts although some event_extraction tools are now publicly_available their usefulness for supporting biological discovery is still unknown given the difficulties in applying and integrating data from these systems on a large_scale in this article we present biocontext an integrated tm system which extracts extends and integrates results from a number of tm tools for entity recognition and event_extraction the system also provides contextual_information about extracted events including anatomical association and whether extracted processes have been reported as speculative or negated i e not taking_place in addition to making the integration platform available under an open_source we also provide the data resulting from processing the whole medline and the open_access subset of pubmed central pmc for batch download and online browsing in this article we present an integrated tm system biocontext and the data produced by it when applied to million abstracts in medline and full_text in the open_access subset of pmc the data contain million event mentions representing million distinct events describing processes such as gene_expression transcription catabolism localization phosphorylation binding and regulation of genes and proteins over a million of additional event mentions were created through enumerated entity mentions event participants are whenever possible linked to entrez_gene identifiers the data contain contextual_information regarding the associated anatomical locations and whether events are reported as negated or speculative the process of generating and integrating this huge volume of data proved challenging and differences observed between the output of individual tools indicate that the identification of events in text is not always easily reproducible on a large_scale nevertheless differences among tools in recognized entity and event mentions can be useful when deciding the balance between precision and recall for different applications as expected we find that for both gene protein ner and event_extraction the intersection of multiple tools shifts the balance towards increased precision while the union favours increased recall we have made the data available at www biocontext org both for batch download and for browsing through a web search interface giving biologists not only more comprehensive access to data in the literature but allowing bioinformaticians to run more powerful integrative analyses using information extracted from literature we also provide the entire set of intermediary data_files as well as the integration framework textpipe which can be used either for completely new tm projects or to construct and deploy modified versions of the system described here several tasks remain for future work data interfaces could be enhanced by allowing restrictions on which documents results are returned for the search interface or by importing and integrating the biocontext data into a pubmed ensembl style biological data_mining portal we would also like to improve the accuracy through improved filtering techniques further as protein_complexes currently are not linked to any reference source we would like to enable normalization of these entities either to their constitutive genes or directly to protein complex databases finally a more detailed analysis of the extracted data is also warranted which will hopefully shed new light on biomolecular events at an unprecedented scale of global understanding
