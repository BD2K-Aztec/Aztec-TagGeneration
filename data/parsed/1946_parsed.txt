genome_analysis gee fu a sequence version and web_services database tool for genomic assembly genome feature and ngs_data scientists now use high_throughput and short_read assembly methods to create draft genome_assemblies in just days tools and pipelines like the assembler and the workflow management environments make it easy for a non specialist to implement complicated pipelines to produce genome_assemblies and annotations very quickly such accessibility results in a proliferation of assemblies and associated files often for many organisms these assemblies get used as a working reference by lots of different workers from a bioinformatician doing gene prediction or a bench scientist designing primers for pcr here we describe gee fu a database tool for genomic assembly and feature data including next generation sequence_alignments gee fu is an instance of a ruby on rails web_application on a feature database that provides web and console interfaces for input visualization of feature data via annoj access to data through a web_service interface an api for direct data access by ruby scripts and access to feature data stored in bam_files gee fu provides a platform for storing and sharing different versions of an assembly and associated features that can be accessed and updated by bench biologists and bioinformaticians in ways that are easy and useful for each ngs_technologies easy to use bioinformatics pipelining and workflow management_tools like galaxy that lower barriers to access to powerful_tools for genome_assembly such as velvet have made it possible for individual laboratories to create draft quality genome_assemblies in very short timescales projects describing fragmented but valuable assemblies have provided many new insights laboratories whose main expertise is molecular_biology can have difficulty managing the large_datasets that they have created bioinformatic and bench based analyses generate new sequence and feature annotations and laboratories can easily lose track of the many changes to their sequence and annotated features thus the amount of data generated in ngs experiments is driving a need for automation and sustainable to whom correspondence should be addressed storage solutions for assembly and feature data we have created an application called gee fu that stores genomic_sequence and feature information and provides a platform to allow groups with diverse levels of bioinformatics and computing skills to easily store track versions edit and visualize feature data and keep track of versions share and visualize basic sequence_data there are many genome_browsers and annotation editors including gbrowse and apollo gee fu extends and integrates into this eco system by providing a light_weight database version system that can import from and export to other annotation systems and genome_browsers if needed it provides access and utility to bioinformaticians who want to access data programatically and others who prefer a graphical_interface in one central repository that allows changes made by one worker to be reflected to others instantly gee fu has been useful in our next generation sequence_based assembly and annotation efforts
