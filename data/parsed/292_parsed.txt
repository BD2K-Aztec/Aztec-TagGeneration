databases_and an apn model for arrhythmic beat classification motivation changes in the normal rhythm of a human_heart may result in different cardiac_arrhythmias which may be immediately fatal or cause irreparable damage to the heart sustained over long_periods of time therefore the ability to automatically identify arrhyth mias from ecg_recordings is important for clinical_diagnosis and treatment in this article classification by using associative petri_net apn for personalized ecg arrhythmia pattern identification is proposed for the first time in literature results a rule_based classification model and reasoning algorithm of apn are created for ecg arrhythmias classification the performance evaluation using mit_bih shows that our approach compares well with other reported studies heart_disease is an umbrella_term for a number of different diseases which affect the heart such as arrhythmia myocardial_ischemia and myocardial_infarction as of it is also one of the leading causes of death in the world and especially according to the american_heart one american is dying in every s because of this disease changes in the normal rhythm of a human_heart may result in different cardiac_arrhythmias which may be immediately fatal or cause irreparable damage to the heart when sustained over long_periods of time electrocardiogram ecg is an important routine_clinical for continuous_monitoring of cardiac activities since ecg_signals vary_greatly for different individuals and within patient groups ecg pattern_recognition is a difficult problem even with the aid of a computer while normal sinus_rhythm originates from the sinus_node of heart arrhythmias have various origins and indicate a wide_variety of heart problems same symptoms of arrhythmia produce different morphologies due to their origins such as premature_ventricular for effective diagnostics the study of ecg pattern and heart_rate signal may have to be carried_out over several hours thus computer based analysis and classification of diseases can be very helpful in diagnostics guer and u beyli a number of methods have been proposed to classify ecg heartbeat patterns based on the features extracted from ecg_signals apns have knowledge representation ability and could be translated into production rule systems in addition the apn formalism also is a graphical and mathematical tool for design specification simulation and verification of systems therefore apn can be widely used in computer knowledge based systems process control decision_making as well as other kinds of engineering applications in this article classification of ecg arrhythmias by using associative petri_net apn is proposed for the first time in the literature and is compared with several pioneering studies for arrhythmias detection we have proposed a methodology for the detection of ecg arrhythmia using a generalized apn model in this article the performance evaluation using mit_bih inshows that our approach compares well with other reported studies the experimental_results strongly suggest that our proposed apn model can help doctors in the diagnosis of ecg arrhythmia and may applied to other symptom decision field in the future an applicable decision system for the clinical_diagnosis of ecg arrhythmias can developed based on our provided apn model and the health_care can be aware of typesan apn model for arrhythmic beat classification of cardiac_arrhythmias and give early treatment to reduce deterioration apn is a powerful method for representing knowledge and logic reasoning in the domain of decision_support unlike other petri_net model apn model has a systematic procedure in model construction the reasoning path of expert systems can be reduced to simple sprouting trees if apn based reasoning algorithms can be applied however there still drawbacks exist in apn such as state explosion and no hierarchy concepts we shall overcome all these drawbacks in the near future
