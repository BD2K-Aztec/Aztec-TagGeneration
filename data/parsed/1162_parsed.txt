cooperative development of logical modelling standards and tools with colomoto downloaded from the identification of large regulatory and signalling_networks involved in the control of crucial cellular_processes calls for proper modelling approaches indeed models can help elucidate properties of these networks understand their behaviour and provide testable_predictions by performing in silico experiments in this context qualitative logical frameworks have emerged as relevant approaches as demonstrated by a growing number of published models along with new methodologies and software_tools this productive activity now requires a concerted_effort to ensure model reusability and interoperability between tools following an outline of the logical modelling framework we present the most important achievements of the consortium for logical models and tools along with future objectives our aim is to advertise this open community which welcomes contributions from all researchers interested in logical modelling or in related mathematical and computational developments contact contact colomoto org motivation the rapid development of novel biomolecular technologies has fostered the study of complex regulatory_systems during the last decade mathematical_models have become invaluable tools for understanding the dynamical behaviour of such systems there are various types of formalisms which differ in the level of detail and model_complexity de jong karlebach and shamir logical or logic discrete models comprise the most abstract dynamic_models and constitute nowadays a popular modelling framework for reviews see bornholdt saadatpour and albert samaga and klamt in logical models components are represented by discrete variables with a small range of possible values with the most extreme case being boolean models where each component can be either active or inactive kauffman the rapid development of novel biomolecular technologies has fostered the study of complex regulatory_systems during the last decade mathematical_models have become invaluable tools for understanding the dynamical behaviour of such systems there are various types of formalisms which differ in the level of detail and model_complexity logical or logic discrete models comprise the most abstract dynamic_models and constitute nowadays a popular modelling framework for reviews see in logical models components are represented by discrete variables with a small range of possible values with the most extreme case being boolean models where each component can be either active or inactive regulatory_effects are defined by logical rules or lookup tables the relative simplicity of these models provides several advantages over more complex modelling formalisms such as systems of differential_equations in particular logical models do not require precise knowledge of kinetic_parameters which makes them suitable for large models comprising up to several hundreds of components due to their qualitative nature it is possible to incorporate various kinds of information in logical models for example natural_language statements from publications or expert_knowledge on regulatory_interactions can easily be transformed into logical rules although logical models provide a rough approximation of concentration levels they can reproduce the behaviour of many biological_systems as illustrated in examples of case studies later the discrete step functions resulting from simulations of logical models constitute a plausible simplification of typical sigmoidal response curves thomas and d biomolecular measurements can be analysed in the discrete framework by applying specialized discretization procedures logical models have been successfully_applied to a wide_range of regulatory and signalling_systems in a variety of organisms examples_include yeast_cell pathogenhost interactions development of the sea_urchin development of drosophila_melanogaster s nchez and mammalian cell_cycle murine cardiac_development determination of cell_fates in human multiscale signal_transduction in human epithelial_cells human t cell receptor signalling and t cell_differentiation the consortium for logical models and tools colomoto http colomoto org was informally launched during a meeting at instituto gulbenkian de cincia portugal in november to gather interested scientists and promote the cooperative development of shared standards and tools this meeting was followed by a second one at the european_bioinformatics united_kingdom in march which focused more specifically on a common standard for the exchange of logical model the systems_biology sbml level qualitative models or qual package see later the third meeting was held at the university of lausanne switzerland in april bringing together participants from different institutions it included sessions devoted to scientific presentations covering methodological and computational developments as well as models for real case applications in addition the participants discussed several topics requiring community consensus including the development of standards collaborative tools and model repositories colomoto is an international open community that brings together modellers curators and developers of methods and tools it aims at the definition of standards for model representation and interchange and the establishment of criteria for the comparison of methods models and tools finally colomoto seeks to promote these methods tools and models we first outline the logical modelling approach to then present the recent_achievements of the consortium as well as the outcomes of the last meeting regarding future_directions
