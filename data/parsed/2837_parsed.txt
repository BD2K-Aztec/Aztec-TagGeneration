data_and measuring gene_functional based on group wise comparison of go terms motivation compared with sequence and structure similarity functional_similarity is more informative for understanding the biological_roles and functions of genes many important_applications in computational molecular_biology require functional_similarity such as gene clustering protein_function protein interaction evaluation and disease_gene gene_ontology go is now widely used as the basis for measuring gene_functional some existing_methods combined semantic similarity_scores of single term pairs to estimate gene_functional whereas others compared terms in groups to measure it however these methods may make error_prone judgments about gene_functional it remains a challenge that measuring gene_functional reliably result we propose a novel method called sora to measure gene_functional in go context first of all sora computes the information content ic of a term making use of semantic specificity and coverage second sora measures the ic of a term set by means of combining inherited and extended ic of the terms based on the structure of go finally sora estimates gene_functional using the ic overlap ratio of term sets sora is evaluated against five state of the art methods in the file on the public platform for col laborative evaluation of go based semantic_similarity measure the carefully comparisons show sora is superior to other methods in general further analysis suggests that it primarily benefits from the structure of go which implies expressive information about gene function sora offers an effective and reliable way to compare gene function availability the web_service of sora is freely_available in recent_years gene_functional has become a main hotspot in biology research because it is important for a variety of applications such as gene clustering protein interaction prediction and evaluation gene_function and disease_gene moreover compared with sequence and structure similarity functional_similarity is more informative for understanding the biological_roles and functions of genes gene_ontology go is a controlled_vocabulary of terms for describing behavior of genes and their products which is valuable to measure gene_functional gene and its products which are collectively called gene to simplify in this article are usually annotated with multiple terms functional_similarity between genes can be inferred from the semantic relationships of their terms it is considered that two genes are similar in function if their terms are similar in semantics accordingly many methods based on semantic_similarity have been put forward to estimate gene_functional these methods could be generally classified into two categories pairwise and group wise pairwise methods measure gene_functional through two steps the first step is measuring semantic similarity_scores of term pairs using term comparison techniques the most typical term comparison techniques used by these methods are resniks lins jiang and conraths the second step is computing gene_functional based on the semantic similarity_scores calculated in the first step some rules such as average rule avg maximum rule max and bestmatch average rule bma are used in the last step the methods based on avg regard the average of semantic similarity_scores of all term pairs as gene_functional the methods based on max take the maximal semantic similarity_score of all term pairs as gene_functional the methods based on bma find all the best matches between the term sets and take the average of semantic similarity_scores of these best matches as gene_functional asmade use of go and avg to estimate gene_functional great efforts have been made in this field introduced methods like lords but they used max and bma rather than avg meanwhile many variants of aforementioned typical term comparison techniques like grasm wangs and pozos were proposed recently exploited dishin to update grasm andimproved the semantic_similarity between two terms by considering their common_ancestors and descendants although pairwise methods are used widely for measuring gene_functional they suffer from some limitations of combining rules methods based on avg will underestimate gene_functional for instance if two genes both are annotated with two same terms which are unrelated to each other their functional_similarity is by these methods in fact they are exactly matched and their functional_similarity should be methods based on max will overestimate gene_functional an example is that the functional_similarity between genes which share_common terms is regardless of the different terms of them unlike the methods aforementioned methods based on bma make a balance between them nevertheless the pairwise methods are affected by how well the semantic_similarity of single term pair is measured the detailed discussion of these methods can be referred to several reviews group wise methods estimate gene_functional by comparing the terms in groups these methods are categorized as follwos set based graph_based and vector based set based_methods put terms and their ancestors into term set to denote gene firstly then they compute semantic similarity_score between the term sets using tverskys ratio model finally the semantic similarity_score between the term sets is regarded as gene_functional graphbased methods make use of go sub graph to describe gene in which nodes are terms and arcs represent relationships between terms these methods estimate gene_functional by means of graph_matching vector based_methods represent each gene as a vector where each dimension corresponds to a term and means the specific term occurs while otherwise they measure the gene_functional through calculating the cosine similarity of vector or the probability of co occurrence of the terms to our knowledge the group wise methods also have some shortcomings the set based and vector based_methods ignore some valuable information implicit in the semantics and relationships of terms the graph based_methods are limited by the complexity of graph_matching in general some error_prone judgments about gene_functional may be raised by existing_methods in our views it primarily results from the inappropriate computing of the information content ic of terms and unreasonable conversion from semantic_similarity into functional_similarity for the effective comparison of gene function we design a novel method based on semantic overlap ratio of annotations namely sora section illustrates the details of our method and the experimental_results are shown and discussed in section finally section_presents some concluding_remarks in this article we put forward a novel method namely sora to measure gene_functional it was evaluated against typical pairwise and group wise methods on cessm from the experimental_results sora is a more effective and reliable way to estimate gene_functional than other tested methods the success of sora may be related to the following characteristics first sora makes use of semantic specificity and coverage to measure the ic of the term the term ic is determined by its location in the go hierarchy rather than the number of proteins annotated with it thus it can overcome the limitation of goa corpus bias which affects the corpus based_approach heavily with the help of both semantic specificity and coverage our strategy could reflect the differences in semantics of terms more objectively than the structural ic second sora computes the ic of annotating term set by combining the inherited and extended ic of the terms based on the structure of go it can effectively avoid repeated summing of the shared ic of terms which is the key point for estimating the ic of the term set correctly third sora uses simple reciprocal icor between the term sets as gene_functional it is an appropriate description of functional relationship between genes as discussed before sora measures semantic_similarity in a single step regardless of the number of annotations per protein which is essential for combining similarities of term pairs in pairwise approach this strategy has positive_impacts on gene function comparison moreover from the results of our experiments all of the methods performed better with e terms than without we consider that sometimes the e terms may provide new knowledge about protein_function which has not been confirmed by manual means high_quality computational inferring of annotations would promote the gene function comparison which is one of our interests in the future the best results are in bold
