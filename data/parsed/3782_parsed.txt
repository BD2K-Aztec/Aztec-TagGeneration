psifr an integrated resource for prediction of protein_structure and function in the post genomic era the annotation of protein_function facilitates the understanding of various biological_processes to extend the range of function_annotation methods to the twilight zone of sequence_identity we have developed approaches that exploit both protein tertiary_structure and or protein_sequence evolutionary_relationships to serve the scientific_community we have integrated the structure prediction_tools tasser tasser lite and metatasser and the functional inference tools findsite a structure based algorithm for binding_site gene_ontology molecular_function inference and ligand screening eficaz a sequence based_approach to enzyme_function inference and dbd hunter an algorithm for predicting dna_binding and associated dna_binding residues into a unified web_resource protein_structure and function prediction resource psifr availability_and psifr is freely_available for use on the web atover the past_decade the success of genome_sequencing has produced a large number of gene_products with unknown structure and function the description of protein_function ranges from its biochemical role to its role in determining phenotypical response thus the complete functional_annotation of a protein is a time consuming process that involves data curation from both computational and experimental_studies most computational function_annotation tools use protein_sequences to detect evolutionary_relationships between proteins of unknown and known function that provide functional clues for of the gene_products in a given proteome however these methods begin to fail as the sequence becomes more distant from proteins of known function since protein tertiary_structure is more conserved than sequence structure can play_an in functional_annotation however experimental determination of protein_structure
