systems_biology immune system simulation online motivation the recognition of antigenic_peptides is a major event of an immune_response in current mesoscopic scale simulators of the immune system this crucial step has been modeled in a very approximated way results we have equipped an agent_based of the immune system with immuno informatics methods to allow the simulation of the cardinal events of the antigenic recognition going from single peptides to whole proteomes the recognition process accounts for b cell epitopes prediction through parker scale affinity estimation class i and ii hla peptide prediction and binding through position_specific based on information from known hla epitopes prediction_tools and tcr binding to hlapeptide complex calculated as the averaged sum of a residueresidue_contact potential these steps are executed for all lymphocytes agents encountering the antigen in a wide reaching monte_carlo availability http www cbs dtu dk services c immsim computational_methods for the study of the immune system have grown to embed a great level of sophistication usually the level of description adopted is that of cells discrete mathematical_models like cellular_automata or agent based have shown to be more suitable for representing the details of the immunological processes models of the immune system include lymphocytes and antigens like viruses or bacteria but they usually keep the description of the molecular recognition_events at a very simplified level this however is the triggering event in the onset of the immune_response seeking for an adequate solution to this problem we have enhanced our agent_based of the immune system celada and seiden by embedding different in sillico methods for epitope recognition based on statistical_methods derived from machine_learning and trained on experimental_data the overall simulation is based on three events i b cell epitopes binding ii class i and ii hla epitope binding and iii tcr binding to hlapeptide complexes these events are independently executed by cells represented by agents and populating a given simulated biological volume to whom correspondence should be addressed the outcome is a fully detailed tracking of the dynamics of cell_populations together with molecules involved in the epitope recognition process including those immune_complexes exposed on the surface of antigen processing cells the immune system simulation server described here offers the chance to test the overall immunogenicity of a generic protein_sequence in the form of its amino_acids sequence it is based on an agent_based of the immune system coupled with epitope prediction_tools derived from the field of immuno informatics and novel methods to assess proteinprotein binding_affinity on the basis of the work performed by miyazawa and jernigan on protein potentials that provides us with a method for assessing the chances of direct_interactions among proteins in the simulation the proposed methods for assessing epitope discovery and binding are embedded in the architecture in a modular way and as such can be upgraded or substituted by more accurate methods should one become available we have implemented as a web_service a tool to calculate the immune_response to a generic pathogenic secondary_structure the user inputs a sequence or a set of sequences comprising the interested pathogen as fasta sequences or by means of uniprot identifiers then specifies the injection schedule in terms of time and dosage the simulator will generate a virtual injection schedule and the corresponding immune_response if any to the peptides identified in the secondary sequences specified in input other parameters are customizable such as the simulated volume and the random seed determining the specificity of the initial population of lymphocytes since the method is of the monte_carlo type a larger_volume will result in more accurate data moreover for the same reason more simulations will allow for better statistical_power
