the minimum evolution problem is hard a link between tree_inference and graph_clustering problems motivation distance methods are well suited for constructing massive phylogenetic_trees however the computational_complexity for rzhetsky and neis minimum evolution me approach one of the earliest methods for constructing a phylogenetic_tree from a distance_matrix remains_open results we show that rzhetsky and neis me problem is np complete and so probably computa tionally intractable we do this by linking the me problem to a graph_clustering problem called the quasi clique decomposition problem which has recently also been shown to be np complete we also discuss how this link could potentially open up some useful new connections between phylo genetics and graph_clustering one of the earliest distance based_approaches introduced to construct a phylogenetic_tree is the minimum evolution me method it was first suggested by kidd and sgaramella zonta and consists of two main steps first branch_lengths are assigned to tree_topologies based on a distance_matrix and then a topology is selected which minimizes the sum of the branch_lengths there are several variants of this approach which are reviewed in e g and desper and gascuel although model based tree construction methods such as likelihood and bayesian approaches are tending to supersede distance based_methods in the literature me methods still remain popular this is in part due to the fact that large_scale sequencing_applications such as metagenomics involve constructing massive trees for which distance based_methods are well suited see e g in this article we are interested in the me approach introduced by this is based on ordinary_least ols estimates of branch_lengths served as a motivation for the neighbor_joining method and is implemented byin the popular fastme software it is commonly believed that just as the optimization_problems arising from the parsimony and the likelihood approaches this version of the me method also leads to an np complete problem and so is probably computationally_intractable however even though this has been stated to be the case in some of the literature probably because tree construction based solely on ols for integer branch_lengths is to our best knowledge this fact has not been formally proven it should also be noted however that the closely_related and more recently_introduced balanced me bme problem in which branch_lengths are estimated by a special_case of weighted_least has been shown to be np complete here we shall show that the me problem is np complete for trees with integer branch_lengths in particular to prove our main_result we show that the me problem is closely_related to the so_called quasiclique decomposition problem a special example of a graph_clustering problem see e g which has recently been shown to be np complete by we believe that the link that we describe could open up some interesting and useful new connections between the fields of phylogenetics and graph_clustering a burgeoning area with several applications including pedigree construction and community_structure detection the rest of the article is organized as follows in the next section we show that certain ols weightings for trees relative to a distance_matrix are related to clique properties in a graph that can be associated to the distance_matrix in the following section we then show that a rooted version of the me problem is np complete and explain how a technique used in day can be used to show that the me problem is np complete we provide the full proof for this in the supplementary appendix as it is quite technical in nature in the last section we discuss a link between phylogenetics and graph_clustering which arises from our approach to the me problem and some possible future_directions to prove that the me problem is np complete we first showed that the ume problem is np complete by relating it to the semi clique decomposition problem interestingly this is a special example of a more general link between tree_inference and graph_clustering problems in particular we can link the following two types of problem for a set x i given a distance_matrix d on x and a tree scoring_function r d on the set t x of all rooted x trees find a tree that optimizes r d ii given a graph g with vertex set x and a cluster scoring_function j g p x r that assigns to each partition in the set p x of all partitions of x a real number j g find a partition of x that optimizes j g more specifically this correspondence is obtained by restricting any given tree_inference problem to the set of rooted trees in t x where every leaf is adjacent to a vertex that is adjacent to the root the tree in for example has this structure to edge weightings that assign to every edge_weight and to distance_matrices that have only off diagonal entries that are or in this restricted type of rooted tree every vertex u adjacent to the root induces a cluster of elements in x namely the leaves that are adjacent to u and clearly for every partition p of x there exists a unique such tree t p that induces precisely the clusters in p thus given any graph g with vertex set x and the distance_matrix d d g on x which is induced by g we obtain the cluster scoring_function j g from the scoring_function r d by putting j g p r d t p to give another example of this correspondence consider the l fit problem see e g in this problem given a distance_matrix d the aim is to find a rooted x tree t which minimizes the score r d t which is equal to the minimum of x x y x jdx y d x x yj taken over all weightings x of t for this example the corresponding graph_clustering problem is known as the correlation clustering problem where the cluster scoring_function j g assigns for a given graph g with vertex set x to any partition p in p x the number of element subsets i e edges a a rooted graph_theoretical tree t with root q and leaf set x fx x x g for the edge weighting x that assigns weight to every edge of t the shortest_path distance dxx x b a graph g with vertex set x fx x x g that is partitioned into the clusters c c and c indicated by the shaded boxes e fu vg of x that violate p that is either e is an edge of g but u and v do not lie in the same cluster in p or e is not an edge of g but u and v both lie in the same cluster of p for the partition p fc c c g of the graph g in for example this cluster scoring_function yields a score of it is not hard to check that the l fit of the tree infor the distance_matrix d g derived from the graph g is too note that minimizing the cluster scoring_function corresponding to the l fit is equivalent to computing the minimum number of edge deletions and insertions that suffice to transform g into a disjoint union of complete graphs when adopting this latter view correlation clustering is usually referred to as cluster editing see e g b cker et_al it would be interesting to explore which tree_inference problems are related in a similar way to other graph_clustering problems and conversely this could yield useful new insights into these inference problems and possibly new algorithms for their solution or approximation
