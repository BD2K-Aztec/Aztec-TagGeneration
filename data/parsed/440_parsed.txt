application of learning to rank to protein_remote motivation protein_remote is one of the fundamental problems in computational_biology aiming to find protein_sequences in a database of known structures that are evolu tionarily related to a given query_protein some computational_methods treat this problem as a ranking problem and achieve the state of the art performance such as psi_blast hhblits and protembed this raises the possibility to combine these methods to improve the predictive_performance in this regard we are to propose a new computational_method called protdec ltr for protein_remote which is able to combine various ranking_methods in a supervised manner via using the learning to rank ltr algorithm derived from natural_language results experimental_results on a widely used benchmark_dataset showed that protdec ltr can achieve an roc score of and an roc score of outperforming all the individual predictors and some state of the art methods these results indicate that it is correct to treat protein_remote as a ranking problem and predictive_performance improvement can be achieved by combining different ranking approaches in a supervised manner via using ltr availability_and for users convenience the software_tools of three basic ranking predictors and learning to rank algorithm were provided atusing sequence_similarity between protein pairs to detect evolutionary_relationships is one of the central tasks in bioinformatics which can be applied to the protein d structure and function prediction unfortunately remote homology protein pairs have similar structures and functions but they lack easily detectable sequence_similarity because the protein tertiary_structure is more conserved than protein_sequence therefore it is often difficult to detect protein remote homology by computational_approaches some effective computational_methods have been developed to address this challenging_problem which can be mainly divided_into two groups including discriminative methods and ranking_methods the first group discriminative methods treat protein_remote as a classification_problem using both the positive_and samples to train the classification_models and then they are used to predict unseen samples among this kind of approaches the methods based_on svms achieve the state of the art performance with appropriate kernel functions which measure the similarity between any these methods_employ various features to represent the protein_sequences such as svm fisher svm pdt svm pairwise svm la and some profilebased methods in contract the second group ranking_methods treat protein_remote as a ranking task or database_searching task where the query_protein is searched against a protein database with known structures and functions and a ranking list of the proteins in the database is returned according to their identified evolutionary_relationships to the query_protein early ranking_methods were based on sequence_alignment such as smith_waterman algorithm later some more efficient algorithms were proposed so as to trade reduced accuracy for improved_efficiency such as basic_local blast and fasta because the evolutionary relations of remote homology proteins cannot be easily detected by sequence_similarity these methods can only achieve limited performance the predictive_accuracy was significantly_improved by using the profile_based alignment_algorithms e g psi_blast method iteratively builds a probabilistic profile of a query_sequence and therefore a more sensitive sequence comparison score can be calculated several ranking methods_employed the generative_models iteratively trained by using positive samples of a protein_family or superfamily and achieved better performance e g hhblits generates a profile hidden_markov profile hidden_markov hmm from the query_sequence and iteratively searches through a large database recently some ranking_methods based on graph_theory or semantic embedding techniques were proposed e g motivated by the successful applications of googles pagerank algorithm an unsupervised algorithm called rankprop was proposed which is a network_based method later this method was further improved by a semi_supervised approach using labeled samples to learn a new network based on the similarity between protein_sequences and natural languages the techniques derived from the field of natural_language were applied to protein remote homology e g protembed converts a large_scale embedding of protein feature_vectors into a low_dimensional semantic space therefore evolutionarily_related proteins are embedded in close_proximity in this semantic space the aforementioned ranking_methods are based on different theories and achieve the state of the art performance in the field of protein_remote therefore it is interesting to explore whether these approaches can be combined to further improve their performance however how to combine these ranking_methods into one predictor is a challenging_problem because they are based on different techniques and their predictive results are often different to address this problem we employed the learning to rank ltr algorithm to combine different ranking_methods in a supervised fashion ltr is a supervised algorithm for training the model in a ranking task which has been successfully_applied to information_retrieval natural_language data_mining etc e g ltr is severing as one of the key algorithms in many well known searching engines such as bing yahoo and google in this study we proposed a new computational_method called protdec ltr which combines three state of the art ranking_methods by using ltr including psi_blast hhblits and protembed to our best knowledge protdec ltr is the first computational predictor that can combine various ranking_methods via using a supervised framework
