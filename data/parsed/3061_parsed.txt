sequence_analysis modpepint an interactive web_server for prediction of modular domain peptide interactions modpepint modular domain peptide interaction is a new easy to use web_server for the prediction of binding_partners for modular protein_domains currently we offer models for sh sh and pdz_domains via the tools sh pepint sh pepint and pdzpepint respectively more specifically our server offers predictions for sh human domains and sh human domains via single domain models and predictions for pdz_domains across several species via multidomain models all models are based_on with different kernel functions ranging from polynomial to gaussian to advanced graph_kernels in this way we model non linear interactions between amino_acid results were validated on manually_curated datasets achieving competitive_performance against various state of the art approaches availability_and the modpepint server is available under theproteinprotein interactions are often mediated by modular protein_domains in eukaryotes and play_an in diverse_biological such as signal_transduction cellular_growth and cell_polarity modular domains that specifically bind with short linear_peptides are known as peptide recognition modules each domain_family recognizes peptides with specific characteristics for example phosphotyrosine py containing peptides proline_rich peptides and c terminus peptides are recognized by sh sh and pdz_domains respectively however individual_domains from the same family show different binding_specificity accurate_models that can help understand the mechanisms responsible for the highly_selective binding_affinity are therefore of interest recently several high_throughput techniques such as protein microarray phage_display and spot synthesis have been developed which can detect the binding_specificity of various modular domains however efficient bioinformatics_tools are needed to extract meaningful knowledge from the enormous amount of data produced to this end we used state of the art machine_learning to build support_vector models that can accurately_predict binding_specificity we have collected into a unified web_based system called modpepint modular domain peptide interaction three different tools sh pepint sh pepint and pdzpepint for three different modular domains namely sh sh and pdz currently we offer single domain models for sh human and sh human domains and multidomain models for pdz_domains across human mouse fly and worm to assess the quality of our models we have used manually_curated interaction data achieving competitive_performance against various state of the art approaches in summary modpepint unique features include i a domain peptide prediction system for sh sh and pdz in a single_platform and ii the largest number of modeled domains see supplementary modpepint collects three proteinprotein_interaction predictive_models that can be efficiently tuned using data derived from various high_throughput and thus do not require structural_information as in the resulting models exhibit significant performance improvement in comparison with other existing_tools the main sources of performance improvement are due to the following i non linear modeling and advantage over linear pwm models ii balanced discriminative training and iii datasets pooling sh pepint uses polynomial kernels and it is trained on additional high_confidence negatives obtained via semisupervised techniques sh pepint uses graph_kernels on a complex representation of both the peptide_sequence and the aligned domains the adoption of a graph type representation allows the inclusion of the physico_chemical of amino_acids which increases the generalization capacity of the models furthermore the method does not need any prior alignment of the peptides this is a big advantage because poly proline_rich peptides are hard to align pdzpepint uses gaussian kernels and it is trained on interaction data from additional highly related domains using pooling from closely_related domains allows to leverage the limited information available for some domains and to extrapolate to unseen but alignable novel domains once trained all models can be used to efficiently scan entire proteomes to identify novel interactions with typical runtimes of few minutes in addition we offer a meta web_server to be used in nonexpert mode that submits the input simultaneously to all tools and displays a summary of the main results for performance_comparisons details on the novelty of the methods and description of the meta web_server see supplementary_information
