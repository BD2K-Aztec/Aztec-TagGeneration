inferring gene_targets of drugs and chemical_compounds from gene_expression motivation finding genes which are directly perturbed or targeted by drugs is of great interest and importance in drug_discovery several network filtering_methods have been created to predict the gene_targets of drugs from gene_expression data based on an ordinary_differential of the gene_regulatory grn a critical step in these methods involves inferring the grn from the expression data which is a very challenging_problem on its own in addition existing network filtering_methods require computationally_intensive parameter_tuning or expression data from experiments with known genetic_perturbations or both results we developed a method called deltanet for the identification of drug_targets from gene_expression data here the gene target predictions were directly inferred from the data without a separate step of grn_inference deltanet formulation led to solving an underdetermined linear regression_problem for which we employed least angle regression deltanet lar or lasso regu larization deltanet lasso the predictions using deltanet for expression data of escherichia_coli yeast fruit_fly and human were significantly more accurate than those using network filtering_methods namely mode of action by network identification mni and sparse simultaneous equation model ssem furthermore deltanet using lar did not require any parameter_tuning and could provide computational speed up over existing_methods knowing the molecular_targets of a drug or chemical compound is crucial in the drug_discovery for among other things identifying therapeutic_properties and side_effects understanding the mechanism of action of a drug finding alternative compounds with similar or greater_efficacy and exploring new applications of a drug for treatment of other diseases drug_repositioning in this regard advances in high_throughput omics technology have been playing a crucial_role in providing the data for elucidating cellular entities which interact with drug and chemical_compounds cellular wide response such as whole_genome gene_expression to genetic_perturbations and chemical_compounds can now be measured easily and cheaply furthermore large amount of omics_data are available from the ever growing public biological_databases because such data are typically of high_dimensionality the use of computational_methods has become necessary in their analysis for example in the inference of gene_regulatory computational_systems has provided many tools to analyze gene_expression for drug_target predictions a summary of different methods in this topic can be found in a review article briefly there exist two main strategies comparative_analysis and network_analysis in comparative_analysis the gene_targets are determined by comparing the gene_expression under drug_treatments of interest with those from experiments with known genetic_perturbations this strategy generally involves gathering a compendium of expression_profiles from genetic_perturbations and chemical compound treatments with known mechanisms followed by an association analysis of the expression_profiles from drugs e g using clustering distance or connectivity score a strong degree of association suggests a high similarity between the molecular_targets of a drug of interest and the known perturbations in network_analysis strategy a model of the grn is employed to predict grn perturbations caused by drugs the perturbation analysis requires constructing a network model of gene transcriptional_regulation one class of network_analysis called network filtering is based on an ordinary_differential ode model of the gene_transcription process by taking the steady_state assumption the inference of grn and drug_targets reduces to solving a multivariate_linear problem see methods and materials for more details algorithms from this class of network_analysis include network identification by multiple_regression nir mode of action by network identification mni and sparse simultaneous equation model ssem here the gene target predictions are obtained by first inferring the grn using a library of gene_expression data from the same species or cell_line subsequently the inferred grn is used to filter the expression data of drug_treatments more precisely genes with expressions which could not be explained by the transcriptional_activity of their regulators are scored more likely to be direct_targets of the drug another type of network_analysis methods rely on statistical_test or enrichment_analysis of the gene_expression to identify drug_targets one strategy called reverse causal reasoning uses literature mined gene_regulatory to generate hypotheses which are subsequently scored against the gene_expression another set of methods_employ a transcription_factor tf enrichment_analysis followed by an upstream analysis which involves a search for proteins that are highly_connected to enriched tfs in signal_transduction or protein_protein meanwhile a method called master regulatory inference algorithm marina applies gene_set using a transcriptional_regulatory to identify tfs whose regulons are enriched for differentially_expressed finally a recent algorithm named detecting mechanism of action by network dysregulation demand uses an input grn and expression data from control and drug_treatments to identify target_genes based on dysregulated gene interactions despite the differences in how grns are used in network_analysis methods the accuracy of the target predictions naturally depend on the fidelity of the grn model unfortunately the inference of grn is known to be very challenging as the problem has been shown to be underdetermined in this work we developed a network_analysis method called deltanet for predicting the genetic_perturbations caused by a drug or chemical compound using gene_expression deltanet is also based on an ode model of the grn but does not require a separate step of grn_inference instead the target predictions are obtained directly from the data while the grn is only inferred implicitly deltanet relies on the least angle regression lar and the lasso regularization to tackle the curse of dimensionality of the underlying regression_problem we demonstrated the advantages of deltanet over z scores and other network filtering_methods namely mni and ssem using compendia of gene_expression data from escherichia_coli saccharomyces_cerevisiae drosophila_melanogaster and homo_sapiens we developed a method called deltanet for predicting the molecular_targets of drugs or chemical_compounds from gene_expression data many applications of great interest and importance in drug_discovery including elucidating the mode of action moa of drugs and the mechanisms of diseases fall within the problem that is addressed by this work deltanet formulation uses an ode model of gene_transcription process under steady_state condition we employed two strategies for solving the resulting underdetermined linear regression_problem least angle regression deltanetlar and lasso regularization deltanet lasso one can relax the assumption in deltanet which sets a kk to zero by treating the predicted p ki as the sum between the self regulatory feedback and the perturbations caused by the treatment in such a case instead of using the magnitude of the perturbation coefficients p ki to rank genes we could use the q values of p ki however for the case studies above we did not observe any improvement in the prediction_accuracy when using gene ranking according to the q values see_supplementary and supplementary the output of deltanet comprises a ranked_list of gene target predictions such a list is amenable for further enrichment_analysis to identify other type of molecular_targets such as tfs in the second case study above an upstream analysis can also be applied to find protein_partners of enriched tfs for example by using expression kinase and enrichr beyond tf and protein targets one can also apply functional_enrichment to obtain the functional_relevance of the gene target predictions several web_server tools exist for such a purpose notably toppcluster analysis which provides categories of human ortholog gene_annotations such as gene_ontology pathways micrornas and human phenotype deltanet uses the same ode model of the gene_transcription process as the methods mni and ssem but with a key difference in the manner by which the target predictions are inferred from the data the first phase of mni and ssem involve the identification of the grn matrix a using a compendium of gene_expression data the perturbation matrix p is subsequently obtained for the treatment samples of interest by network filtering which in essence uses the difference p c ca in mni the matrix a is estimated from training data together with the unknown matrix p using a procedure that resembles expectation_maximization di the convergence of this procedure is however not guaranteed and the solution often varies with the initial starting guess also the performance of mni is known to sensitively depend on the tuning of method parameters which often leads to numerically intensive optimization not to mention mni also requires data from known genetic_perturbations for parameter_tuning in contrast ssem uses lasso regularization to identify the matrix a using the complete gene_expression data where the perturbation matrix p is initially set to zero by doing so ssem ignores the treatment or perturbation_effects when inferring the grns the matrix p is subsequently obtained from the residuals of the regression above the lasso regularization enforces a limit on the model_complexity an assumption which is based on the observed sparsity of grns the implementation of lasso requires selecting the appropriate constraint parameter t for model_complexity as the optimal value is not known a priori and is also problem dependent a crossvalidation is often used for setting t as shown in analyses using lasso including deltanet lasso and ssem were the slowest among the methods considered here the majority of the computational time was contributed by the cross_validation step one can view deltanet as a hybrid between mni and ssem the inference of the matrices a and p in deltanet is performed_simultaneously which resembles the first step of mni but like ssem we employed a grn sparsity assumption by way of lar and lasso regularization to tackle the underdetermined problem nevertheless deltanet does not involve an explicit network filtering step instead the perturbation matrix p for the treatment samples is obtained together with the other samples in the compendium we could therefore fully use the information contained in the available data training and treatment sets in predicting the effects of a treatment as demonstrated in the case studies deltanet offers a significant_improvement in the accuracy of target prediction over mni and ssem furthermore deltanet lar has better numerical efficiency and robustness with respect to parameter_tuning over deltanet lasso mni and ssem we therefore recommend deltanet lar using a threshold parameter d r of since in our experience this setting provides a good balance between target prediction_accuracy and computational performance while the difference between deltanet and the existing network filtering_methods may appear slight this deviation is nevertheless important and fundamental there were two key_factors motivating the single step inference in deltanet first the inference of grns from the typical gene_expression has been shown to be underdetermined thus any method relying on the solution of such an inference problem could be sensitive to the associated uncertainty second despite the underdetermined issue it is often possible to predict the effects of a network perturbations from existing gene_expression data with reasonable accuracy we formulated deltanet based on the premise that the available gene_expression data while lacking information for the accurate inference of grn have enough information to identify the network perturbations caused by a treatment the differences between the gene target predictions from deltanet lasso and ssem are quite interesting considering that both methods_employ the same lasso regularization in the first case study we noted that for yeast and e coli datasets deltanetlasso produced sparser grns than ssem see supplementary this trend is expected since in comparison to ssem deltanet formulation has additional degrees_of that come from the perturbation vector however the network sparsity between deltanet and ssem in the drosophila dataset did not differ significantly we further looked at the set of known gene_targets among the top predictions from deltanet lasso but not from ssem for these gene_targets n and for e coli yeast and drosophila respectively deltanet lasso clearly produced fewer non zero coefficients than ssem for all three datasets see supplementary the observations above indicated a possibility of overfitting in ssem as the regression_problem did not consider perturbations on the genes finally time series expression data have become routine and increasingly available in public_databases applying deltanet and similar methods such as ssem and mni to time series data should be done with caution because of the underlying steady_state assumption in the method formulation in the case studies we included time series data as a part of the training_dataset excluding time series data however did not affect the accuracy of deltanet predictions significantly see supplementary an extension of deltanet to take advantage of time series data is currently being developed the results of which will be reported in a separate publication
