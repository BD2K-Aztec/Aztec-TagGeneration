phage_display can select over hydrophobic sequences that may impair prediction of natural domain peptide interactions motivation the phage_display peptide selection approach is widely used for defining binding_specificities of globular_domains pdz_domains recognize partner proteins via c terminal motifs and are often used as a model for interaction predictions here we investigated to which extent phage_display data that were recently_published for human pdz_domains can be applied to the prediction of human pdzpeptide interactions results promising predictions were obtained for one third of the pdz_domains for the other two thirds we detected in the phage_display peptides an important bias for hydrophobic amino_acids that seemed to impair correct predictions therefore phage_display selected peptides may be over hydrophobic and of high_affinity while natural interaction_motifs are rather hydrophilic and mostly combine low_affinity with high_specificity we suggest that potential amino_acid bias should systematically be investigated when applying phage_display data to the prediction of specific natural domainlinear motif interactions many protein_complexes that function in cellular_regulation and signalling are assembled by multiple linear motifglobular domain interactions which are mostly specific yet of low_affinity one well studied example of such interactions consists of the pdz_domains which mainly recognize linear motifs at the extreme c terminus of partner proteins pdzs are implicated in the regulation of cell_polarity tight_junctions intercellular_communication and neuronal synapses the last residue referred to as position p in pdz binding_motifs usually is val or leu the third last peptide residue position p can be either thr or ser hydrophobic or glu or asp thereby defining three main categories of pdz binding_motifs these characteristics make pdzbinding motifs relatively easy to predict however the correct prediction of pdz_domain binding_specificities i e prediction of which pdz binding_motif will bind to which pdz_domain remains_challenging and numerous approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem hui and to whom correspondence should be addressed most predictors rely on prior experimental knowledge about binding_preferences between peptides and globular_domains phage peptide display has been widely used to provide such information this approach is based on selecting out of a library of billions of peptides expressed on the surface of bacteriophages a limited number of peptides that bind strongly to a given protein attached to a solid_support several phage_display studies have been performed on particular pdz_domains derived from the proteins magi inadl pdzrhogef and larg mupp and dlg ptp bl van den erbin htra and htra applied phage_display in a highthroughput manner to determine and compare binding_preferences of caenorhabditis_elegans and homo_sapiens pdz_domains the data obtained in this study represent a highly_valuable resource that allows to test the general application of phage_display data to predictions of natural pdzprotein interactions using positionspecific scoring_matrices pssms this approach was validated on a few pdz_domains in the study of and the phage_display data were subsequently used in several recent_studies for predictions of natural pdzpeptide interactions pdz phage_display data have also been used as test data in the dream peptide recognition domain specificity prediction challenge thus phage_display is supposed to capture accurately the binding_specificities of domainlinear motif interactions here we performed and evaluated predictions of human pdzpeptide interactions using the phage_display data of promising predictions were obtained for one third of the pdz_domains in contrast for the other two thirds of the pdz_domains we detected important bias for hydrophobic amino_acids in the phage_display peptides that will probably impair the correct prediction of naturally_occurring pdz binding_peptides we suggest that utilization of phage_display data for prediction of natural binders should systematically involve prior analysis of potential sequencial bias in the data here we addressed the problem of predicting natural pdzpeptide interactions using phage_display data we observed that phagepeptide lists ofcan be classified on the basis of their hydrophobic_character human c termini matched better to the sequence_profiles defined by the phage peptides when they were hydrophilic more specifically human c termini that are identical to phage peptides could be found more frequently for hydrophilic phage peptides in addition we realised that in average the phage peptides were much more hydrophobic than published natural pdz binding sequences as well as human c termini in general in particular the phage_display data showed a very strong preference for the largest aromatic_amino trp at peptide position p all these results indicate that prediction of interactions between pdzs and naturally_occurring peptides perform better when based on hydrophilic phage peptides it should be noted that short_linear interaction_motifs slims have been found to display a particular amino_acid which distinguishes them from both folded and disordered_regions the least conserved positions in slims are usually non hydrophobic whereas the highest conserved positions are very often occupied by hydrophobic and charged amino_acids indeed published pdz ligands generally agree with this trend since the canonical pdz binding_motif pattern consists of a hydrophobic usually not aromatic_amino at peptide position p and thr ser hydrophobic usually not aromatic or glu_asp at position p the phage_display procedure of tonikian et_al often selected such characteristics at positions p and p but the other less conserved positions p p and p were for two thirds of the pdz_domains tested very frequently hydrophobic thereby deviating from sequence characteristics of slims biological_interactions are characterized both by their affinity and specificity affinity represents absolute interaction_strength whereas specificity is a relative property derived from the comparison of interaction strengths of different interacting_partners for instance if a pdz_domain binds with higher but not necessarily high_affinity to a few peptides than to all others it will be specific molecular_dynamic studies have indicated that hydrophobic_interactions are the most important force contributing page
