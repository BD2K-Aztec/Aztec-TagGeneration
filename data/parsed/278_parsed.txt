analysis of aggregated cell cell statistical distances within pathways unveils therapeutic resistance_mechanisms in circulating_tumor motivation as omics biotechnologies accelerate the capability to contrast a myriad of molecular measurements from a single_cell they also exacerbate current analytical limitations for detecting meaningful single_cell dysregulations moreover mrna_expression alone lacks functional_interpretation limiting opportunities for translation of single_cell transcriptomic insights to precision_medicine lastly most single_cell analytic approaches are not designed to investigate small_populations of cells such as circulating_tumor shed from solid_tumors and isolated from patient blood_samples results in response to these characteristics and limitations in current single_cell methodology we introduce an analytic framework that models transcriptome dynamics through the analysis of aggregated cellcell statistical distances within biomolecular pathways cellcell statistical distances are calculated from pathway mrna fold changes between two cells within an elaborate case study of circulating_tumor derived from prostate_cancer patients we develop analytic_methods of aggregated distances to identify five differentially_expressed pathways associated to therapeutic_resistance our aggregation analyses perform comparably with gene_set and better than differentially_expressed followed by gene_set however these methods were not designed to inform on differential pathway expression for a single_cell as such our framework culminates with the novel aggregation method cell centric statistics ccs ccs quantifies the effect_size and significance of differentially_expressed pathways for a single_cell of interest improved rose plots of differentially_expressed pathways in each cell highlight the utility of ccs for therapeutic_decision the advent of single_cell scrna_seq enables discovery of transcriptional patterns at the most fundamental unit of life in contrast conventional rna_seq technologies only provide an average rna expression across many cells concealing much of the transcriptional heterogeneity understanding individual cell uniqueness within a multicellular context offers new insights into the biological underpinning of organ ontogeny immune_response and cancer etiology progression and drug_resistance particularly scrna_seq has become increasingly adopted to resolve intra_tumor and analyze rare tumor_cell such as circulating_tumor ctcs originating from primary solid_tumors however analyzing whole_genome rna expression from individual cells remains_challenging these challenges include the poor_sensitivity of conventional methods for studying a limited number of cells and the absence of methods for generating statistical_significance at a single_cell transcriptome improvements in scrna_seq experimentation through the additional quantitative standards of spike in external control rna and unique_molecular identifiers as well as computational methodologies have reduced the impact of noisy measurements in single_cell rna expression however these methods rely on expensive technologies and require many single_cell transcriptomes to adequately model noise and infer sources of variation which preclude analysis of individual cells to establish significance of patterns observed at a single_cell one could in theory compare cellular mrnas with a consensus mrna_expression atlas however the notion that there is a consensus transcriptome is questionable as expression levels and kinetics vary over time and across tissues in response to these shortcomings we introduce a novel analytic framework the analysis of aggregated cellcell statistical distances within pathways we hypothesized that we could aggregate many analyses of pairs of single_cell transcriptomes to predict differentially_expressed pathways deps in principle this approach could even produce cell centric statistics ccs that may scale down to analyze deps in a single_cell despite the lack of true reference transcriptome and circumvent sample_size requirements intrinsic to group based statistics by quantifying gene_sets pathways rather than individual mrnas our framework is designed ab_initio to reduce the noise intrinsic to scrna_seq measurements while providing functional_interpretation of dynamic changes between cells our aggregation framework begins by quantifying transcription dynamics for a pair of cells through the application of a gene_set scoring procedure n of pathways mahalanobis_distance md that we recently_developed to predict deps using a single pair of transcriptomes md produces pathway level significance that is readily interpretable biologically and potentially clinically actionable for pathway targeting therapies originally we applied md to measure dynamic changes of mrna within a single subject by exploring differential pathway expression from a baseline to a case sample i e dysregulation in this manner two transcriptomes from a patient could be transformed into a personal pathway dysregulation profile these patient specific profiles are predictive of clinical_outcomes including survival and response to therapy in cancer and viral_infection moreover n of pathways md can also be used to measure differential pathway expression between any pair of samples we have shown that this approach unveils deps between groups when traditional statistics are underpowered in this study we introduce and validate our aggregation framework using rna_seq derived from prostate_cancer ctcs as a proof_of and implicate mechanisms of resistance to androgen inhibition therapy deps are identified at the individual cell level using the ccs component of the framework emerging biological_systems properties of pathway resistance are illustrated at the level of individual cells as well as aggregated at the level of individual patient and at the treatment group level the accuracy of our aggregation method in prioritizing deps across treatment groups is contrasted to that of conventional methods such as gene_set gsea single_cell differential expressed genes scde followed by gene_set deg enrichment and weighted_least wls regression further novel single_cell visualization of dep transcriptome dynamics is developed to demonstrate the utility of ccs for predicting therapeutic_resistance based on a single ctc scrna_seq offers insight into transcriptional diversity of individual cells and presents unprecedented actionable opportunities in biology and medicine the described methodologies of aggregation of cell cell statistical distances within pathways including ccs and cellcentric visualizations bridge an analytical gap between cohort based statistics and single_cell expression signals we provide evidence that our framework accurately identifies deps in an individual cell specifically treatment resistance pathways of individual ctcs were differentially_expressed in distinctive patterns when comparing prostate_cancer subjects treated with ezt to those treated without it furthermore single ctcs of some patients never exposed to ezt presented a higher heterogeneity of treatment resistance pathway expression with some ctcs strikingly similar to those of resistant subjects as many therapies target pathways these single_cell analyses may provide biologically_meaningful interpretations and clinically actionable metrics these observations suggest the utility of ccs to identify subjects likely to present resistance to future_therapies as well as transcriptome dynamics of resistance over time
