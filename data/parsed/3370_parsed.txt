gene_expression optimal timepoint sampling in high_throughput gene_expression experiments motivation determining the best sampling rates which maximize information yield and minimize cost for time series high_throughput gene_expression experiments is a challenging optimization_problem although existing_approaches provide insight into the design of optimal sampling rates our ability to utilize existing differential_gene data to discover optimal timepoints is compelling results we present a new data integrative model optimal timepoint selection ots to address the sampling_rate problem three experiments were run on two different datasets in order to test the performance of ots including iterative online and a top up sampling approaches in all of the experiments ots outperformed the best existing timepoint selection approaches suggesting that it can optimize the distribution of a limited number of timepoints potentially leading to better biological_insights about the resulting gene_expression time series high_throughput gene_expression experiments can measure the expression levels of tens_of of genes in a biological_sample over time and provide dynamic information which can be used to construct regulatory_networks and infer regulatory_relationships among genes although there are several thousand time series microarray_and datasets on the gene_expression geo database as of june most of these contain very few timepoints shows that of these datasets in which time has been set as a subset variable type in geo contain five or fewer timepoints given that researchers are often limited to being able to sample very few timepoints it is extremely_important to choose the most appropriate timepoints for observing strong target gene_expression pattern changes with a fixed number of samples researchers can choose between i a very densely sampled short time series experiment in which important gene_regulation events that do not occur quickly may be missed or ii a sparsely sampled long time series experiment where improperly positioned timepoints can lead to missing rapid but important regulation events and can also lead to temporal aggregation bias which reduces the ability to infer actual regulatory_relationships determining the best sampling timepoints for sparsely sampled time series high_throughput experiments is a challenging optimization_problem that is frequently discussed in the biological_literature an active_learning algorithm has been developed for iteratively choosing timepoints to sample using the uncertainty in the interpolation of the currently estimated time dependent curve as the objective_function the performance evaluation in this study showed that this algorithm can find optimal timepoints such that majority cycling yeast genes can be identified however to capture the differential gene_expression the interpolation step requires a minimum of five timepoints according to their online documentation so it would not have been applicable for of the existing datasets in geo and would have only been able to predict very few timepoints in almost all of the existing datasets furthermore active_learning is based only on the differential_gene data in the dataset to which a new timepoint will be added and existing time series datasets using similar treatments which may be high_resolution and contain useful differential_gene information cannot be applied in the algorithm although other advanced gene_expression prediction or interpolation methods can utilize sequence_information and biologically_plausible constraints on gene_expression estimates these approaches do not address the complicated issue of timepoint selection among large groups of genes and also cannot utilize existing data in this article we present a new model called optimal timepoint selection ots to identify optimal sampling timepoints for new microarray_and experiments based to whom correspondence should be addressed on gene_expression data in existing datasets we build ots based on three observations gene_expression experiments can be sampled in an online fashion i e samples can be treated and collected at a high rate and then stored at a relatively low_cost and particular samples can be measured at a later time after deciding which timepoint will be optimal a researcher is usually interested in capturing the expression_patterns of a subset of genes which may be grouped into several clusters with similar expression_patterns associated with a given treatment condition and differential gene_expression from previous_experiments performed under similar treatments conditions can provide information valuable for defining an optimal timepoint for sampling even if the sampling rates are different from the new experiment based on these observations a straightforward approach to choosing the best timepoint is to find unsampled timepoints at which there are significant upregulation or downregulation events for the genes of interest in the existing datasets this approach is based on the assumption that the differential expression_patterns for the genes of interest in existing datasets are similar to each other and are similar to the dataset to which a timepoint will be added however in practice this assumption may be violated in many cases due to large differences in the dynamic ranges between platforms e g rna_seq technology has a dynamic range several orders_of higher than microarray_technology inconsistency among different datasets either due to different growing conditions different treatments or lab signatures which result in differences in differential gene_expression among different laboratories even after attempts to reproduce conditions exactly high noise rates in expression values particularly for microarray_datasets and sparse sampling rates in existing data to address these data_integration problems we have developed ots which includes a novel method of combining differential gene_expressions from existing datasets training_datasets based on their similarity to the experiment to which timepoints will be added current dataset ots is novel in the following ways projection of differential_gene to threshold space in contrast to existing differential_gene prediction_algorithms the goal of our method is to predict the best timepoints to add to a high_throughput experiment therefore rather than focusing on specific expression_patterns we are instead interested in how many genes are significantly_differentially at each timepoint and how significant the overall expression values are in a categorized fashion consequently we project the differential_gene values to threshold space to better capture important regulatory timepoints explained in section data_normalization and scaling instead of averaging or pooling all of the training data together we first weight each training datas contribution to the overall result based on their similarity to the current dataset then we adjust the weighted_average values with a shifting function for local fitting explained in section timepoint selection with multi_objective moo we adopt a moo model to select the overall optimal timepoint for all of the clusters moo is superior to the sampling voting method because timepoints chosen by moo benefit all or the majority of clusters while the sampling voting method may be biased to one or a few clusters explained in section the overall experimental approach for ots is shown in supplementary figure s and section s first a biological experiment is performed and samples are preserved at dense timepoints a subset of timepoints including at least the last timepoint in the range of interest and one other timepoint is sampled then time series training_datasets are collected it is not necessary for the training_datasets to be collected using the same technology i e pcr microarray or rna_seq experiments but they should use treatments or conditions that are expected to affect target treatmentresponse genes in the same way as in the current dataset ots produces a ranked_list of the optimal timepoints to be selected next the optimal timepoint s can then be sampled and added to the current dataset for the identification of the next optimal timepoint this process can then be continued iteratively until all of the samples or all of the resources available for sampling are used up this online sampling_approach is advantageous when studying organisms for which the sample_collection step is significantly less expensive than the gene_expression measurement step for difficult or costly experiments including clinical experiments it is more logical to measure the gene_expression in every available sample in the performance experiments in this study ots was applied using high_throughput time series datasets for two different organisms yeast and arabidopsis utilizing different platforms microarray_and noisy sparsely sampled and poorly matched datasets were used as training in all the experiments ots clearly outperforms the existing_approaches we have demonstrated that ots can out perform existing algorithms at finding optimal timepoints for defining true differential gene_expression for large groups of target_genes we have shown that this algorithm is robust to the use of sparsely sampled poorly matched and cross_platform data as well as to noise in the datasets because it utilizes existing data effectively ots can be applied on datasets starting with as few as two timepoints in contrast to the active_learning algorithm which requires a minimum of five timepoints as input as high_throughput gene_expression measurement technologies continue to be developed high_resolution sampling may eventually become cost_effective for example nanostrings are a recently_developed medium throughput gene_expression measurement technology capable of measuring up to genes at once at a relatively low_cost however using this technology not all of the genes in the organism can currently be sampled and the gene_list needs to be pre defined since ots simply uses gene differential_expression values as input it would be possible and very advantageous to use the results from nanostring or real_time experiments as training data for ots to select optimal timepoints for rna_seq technology highly multiplex sampling is becoming increasingly accurate allowing for denser timepoint sampling with a moderate increase in cost as more time series datasets are produced due to these advances in technology more and better training_datasets for ots will be produced and the demand for better knowledge based timepoint selection methods will increase in this article ots was tested only using differential_gene values but it could also be extended to use other types of data including raw transcript number counts relative protein quantities or any type of measurement that can be sampled in an online fashion overall ots can be used to significantly improve the results from biological_experiments by allowing researchers to optimize the distribution of timepoints when there is a limit on the number of samples that can be measured across a time series dataset the estimation power of extrapolation of time_series is much less than for interpolation particularly for relatively simple linear extrapolation methods for this reason ots is currently limited to selecting timepoints within the time range available in training_datasets eventually more sophisticated extrapolation methods such as the non linear differential_equation models outlined in haye et_al may be integrated to improve the predictive_power of ots
