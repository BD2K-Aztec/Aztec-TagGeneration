admit a toolbox for guaranteed model invalidation estimation and qualitative quantitative modeling often competing_hypotheses for biochemical_networks exist in the form of different mathematical_models with unknown_parameters considering available experimental_data it is then desired to reject model hypotheses that are inconsistent with the data or to estimate the unknown_parameters however these tasks are complicated because experimental_data are typically sparse uncertain and are frequently only available in form of qualitative ifthen observations admit analysis design and model invalidation toolbox is a matlab tm based tool for guaranteed model invalidation state and parameter_estimation the toolbox allows the integration of quantitative measurement data a priori_knowledge of parameters and states and qualitative information on the dynamic or steady_state behavior a constraint satisfaction problem is automatically generated and algorithms are implemented for solving the desired estimation invalidation or analysis tasks the implemented methods built on convex relaxation and optimization and therefore provide guaranteed estimation results and certificates for invalidity availability admit tutorials and illustrative_examples are available free of charge for non commercial use atdata based mathematical_modeling can help to improve the understanding of complex biological_networks e g by analyzing and identifying core elements or by predicting the networks behavior however usually the data are uncertain and come from heterogeneous sources this then results in competing model hypotheses and hence an incomplete understanding of the underlying network_structure and biological_mechanisms in iterative cycles of mathematical_modeling and biological experimentation model hypotheses are tested and rejected if inconsistent with the experimental_data for the remaining hypotheses the parameters can be estimated e g to allow for quantitative predictions depending on the available data and the assumed uncertainty description one can distinguish between several approaches for parameter_estimation to obtain optimal parameter_estimates by minimizing a cost_function of nonlinear models and measurements to whom correspondence should be addressed data with statistical uncertainty descriptions methods using global or local optimization can be considered e g efficient implementations of such methods are available in software_tools e g however finding a suitable threshold that classifies a model as consistent with the data is challenging a complementary_approach is based on an unknown but bounded or set based uncertainty description e g milanese and walter and piet because entire sets can be directly taken into account theoretically definite statements can be made which therefore allows a rigorous perspective on parameters and model consistency we present admit a matlab tm based toolbox that uses a set based uncertainty description and convex relaxation and optimization framework for model invalidation and parameter_estimation besides unknown butbounded measurement data qualitative information such as temporal or causal ifthen observations or discrete state_variables can be used the toolbox automatically constructs a convex constraint satisfaction problem that incorporates all available data and the model equations using convex relaxation and optimization_methods outer bounds of the consistent parameters or states can be determined by solving the constraint satisfaction problem for this purpose either the solvers implemented in admit or more efficient external state of the art numerical solvers for mixed integer linear programs can be used
