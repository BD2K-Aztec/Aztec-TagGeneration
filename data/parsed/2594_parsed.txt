sequence_analysis janus a comprehensive tool investigating the two faces of transcription motivation protocols to generate strand specific transcriptomes with next_generation have been used by the scientific_community roughly since strand specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher_resolution of expression_profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations however applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce results here we present a tool janus which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active_regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense antisense pair which could hint to regulatory_mechanisms janus is able to make use of single_nucleotide snv and methylation data if available and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation janus interrogates positions of heterozygous snvs to identify strand specific allelic_imbalance availability janus is written in c c and freely_available www ikmb uni kiel de janus janus html under terms of gnu_general for both linux and windows although the bin aries will work without additional downloads the software depends on bamtools https github com pezmaster bamtools for compilation a detailed tutorial section is included in the first section of the supplemental material and included as brief readme txt in the tutorial archive contactthe ancient greek historian plutarch writes about janus for this janus whether in remote antiquity he were a demigod or a king was certainly a great lover of civil and social unity and one who reclaimed men from brutal and savage living for which reason they figure him with two faces to represent the two states and conditions out of the one of which he brought mankind to lead them into the other plutarchus a c e we decided to call our tool janus as it observes transcription of the double_stranded which often happens in opposite_directions at a given locus we term the transcription occurring on the strand opposite to the template_strand antisense_transcription antisense_transcripts may have a regulatory effect on the expression of the sense transcript which has been reported for several sense antisense s as pairs before for example in the x chromosomal inactivation involving xist and tsix another example is given by morris et_al who reported that expression of the p antisense transcript mediates methylation of the p sense promoter by recruitment of epigenetic regulatory complexes and showed that this effect was reversible by small_interfering sirna induced knockdown of the antisense transcript published_data about antisense_transcription are sometimes contradictory underlining the high_complexity of the matter published an article in which they investigated s as patterns in different human cell_lines using the illumina ga detecting a high_abundance of antisense tags within exons in contrast in an article published byused the solid system only few antisense tags were detected in the coding_regions of genes however both articles agree on an abundance of antisense_transcription occurring in promoter and terminator regions to the best of our knowledge no publicly_available tool has been released to the scientific_community to easily_identify s as pairs using next_generation data to address this we developed janus it allows identification of s as pairs on the genome_wide level using common input_formats of sequencing_data from strand specific experiments and detects differences between multiple samples it is capable of including methylation data in the results and investigates s as ratios at single_nucleotide snv positions janus was developed to work under linux and windows but is restricted to bit environments owing to the memory_requirements to whom correspondence should be addressed simulated_data have been used to assess the performance of janus see_supplementary for generation of simulated_data using a coverage threshold of per base for the detection of antisense events of simulated as events were detected with exact start and end position supplementary an additional of simulated as events were detected with exact start or end position and did not match any of the simulated ends exactly however these include as events that are within simulated as events but do not fit the simulated start and end exactly also some as events were generated with less than three coverage per base and thus will not bedetected therefore the given above is a conservative estimation additionally we estimated the effect of different parameters on the detection of as events by janus supplementary the most important filter in the simulated dataset is the coverage per base threshold using a higher_coverage threshold effectively reduces the number of false_positive antisense events however it also removes lowly covered true_positive events using a length cutoff and using the noise filter had only limited consequences on the detection of simulated antisense events this is partially due to the minimum_length requirement during simulation that is at least two times the read_length for sense transcripts and bp for the antisense_transcripts also besides mismapped reads no additional noise was added by the simulation therefore the effect of these parameters will be bigger in real_datasets janus performance to identify s as transcript pairs with allelic_imbalance was also assessed using simulated_data see_supplementary for data generation data were only simulated for chromosome which resulted in transcript pairs that shared overlapping regions supplementary in these regions snvs were introduced with varying numbers of alternative allele reads resulting in transcript pairs that showed a different major allele valid allelic_imbalance events aie janus identified a total of aie including valid simulated aie the remaining valid aie were generated with low numbers of alternative alleles and for the as transcript respectively which were not detected owing to mapping problems twenty two of the aie detected by janus showed a p value below including six of the valid aie of the remaining aie can be traced back to mapping problems close to splice_junctions supplementary where reads containing only one to five bases of the neighboring exons are mapped partially into the intron the remaining false_positive aie with p value below is caused by other types of mismapping although janus identifies most of the simulated aie it is important to consider the results with care as mismapping especially close to splice_junctions can easily lead to a falsepositive aie detection solid rnaseq_data from real experiments see next section for more details about this data was mapped using different tools to assess the effect of different mappers on the analysis of janus the bioscope software of applied_biosystems performed best when comparing the number of mapped_reads of all mappers used bioscope bwa bowtie tophat supplementary the number of identified antisense events is highly dependent on the number of mapped sequences and thus the data mapped with bioscope yields more antisense events supplementary the run time of janus shows an almost linear increase with higher read numbers supplementary and the overlap of detected antisense events from the different mappings shows that there is almost complete overlap between different bioscope mappings but far less overlap with the other two mappers supplementary therefore the bioscope software seems to work best for the investigated color_space libraries for which also methylation data based on infinium humanmethylation beadchips illumina san_diego usa was available these data were mapped against the human hg reference and the corresponding gene_annotation knowngenes from the ucsc was used see_supplementary for mapping parameters also stranded data for two different mouse cell_types small_intestine colon was investigated geo accession_number gse that has been mapped against the mm reference duplicates in bam_files were marked using picard tools the two technologies solid wtak and illumina ga iix displayed different patterns the illumina data show a high_abundance of antisense tags in exonic_regions that follow the intron exon structure of the sense transcript we estimated a failure_rate of for illumina ga iix strand specific data and failure_rate for solid wtak whole transcriptome_analysis kit strand specific data to demonstrate the biological impact of janus we focused the following analysis on the solid data as it exhibits less background_noise for each sample a large amount of antisense events was detected one example for each s as class is presented in supplementary many unannotated transcripts were detected by janus one such example is given in supplementary antisense_transcription occurring in promoter and terminator regions here defined as kb before and after the transcript start and end site was investigated of hg chl data and hg lcl data annotated transcripts an average of promoter and terminator regions hg and promoter and terminator regions hg showed antisense_transcription with a minimum_length of bp and a mean coverage per base of at least five supplementary a comparison of identified antisense events in promoter and terminator regions for different coverage limits is shown in supplementary considering all occurring transcription terminator and promoter_regions show a high_abundance of sense tags by filtering for promoter and terminator regions which show an antisense event of a certain size here bp the amount of sense tags is dramatically_reduced and the amount of antisense tags increases which is not surprising however by further filtering for minimum antisense coverage the amount of antisense tags increases stronger in the terminator regions relative to the promoter_region for both sets of human samples genomes individuals chl cell_lines we were able to identify s as pairs that show mutually_exclusive expression of either transcript in the lcl only one lucid pair sepp ccdc supplementaryand supplementary could be identified in contrast despite being also derived from b cells the chl cell_lines showed multiple such events that could indicate that asmediated gene_silencing plays a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors supplementaryand supplementary figs s s supplementaryshows tissue_specific examples of differentially_expressed antisense_transcripts in the investigated mouse libraries in the genomes samples several s as pairs that show a positively correlated expression pattern could be detected by the default_parameters of the program supplementaryand supplementary figs s s three examples for s as pairs that correlate in expression in the chl dataset are shown in supplementary figures s s supplementaryillustrates an example of a tissue_specific co expressed s as pair in the investigated mouse libraries one probably falsepositive example of a positive correlated s as pair is shown in supplementary the pair is occurring in a repeat region and has roughly the same size_and on both strands and thus it is unlikely to be real expression on both strands the repeat region shows strong expression in the l dataset but not in the other samples interestingly it has been shown that derepression of a terminal repeat can lead to the activation of a proto_oncogene in human lymphoma one case with a slight correlation of cpg_methylation degree and differential_expression of s as pairs was detected in the chl data supplementary the mean methylation beta values at two distinct locations near the zscan promoter range from to for l and u ho and to in km h supplementary expression of a short antisense transcript occurs only in km h while the sense transcript is only expressed in the other two cell_lines allele_specific data of known snvs did not show any s as pairs with both transcripts expressed from different homologs exclusively however we identified some cases of allelic_imbalance between the transcripts on the first and second strand supplementary figs s and s the first example shows expression of ncaph and sco while most reads corresponding to ncaph expression show the g allele and only few show the t allele the opposite was found for reads corresponding to sco expression the second example shows expression of fan and mtmr reads corresponding to fan expression show both snv alleles t c while the reads corresponding to mtmr expression show the c allele only janus also identified several snvs in the approach without a priori_knowledge of snv positions where both alleles are exclusively_expressed on either strand supplementaryshows one such example the region transcribed in antisense direction is overlapping a vega annotated pseudogene overlaps partially a non repeat masked duplication and the identified snvs are not included in the well characterized snv list of the genomes_project and thus this example represents likely a false_positive considering antisense events with low coverage in the promoter and terminator regions the amount of antisense tags in promoter_regions is higher than in terminator regions while this shifts toward more antisense tags in terminator regions when considering only higher covered antisense events this could be caused by a higher mismapping in promoter_regions maybe due to conserved_motifs of transcription_factor and tata like sequences which generates a higher noise_level another explanation is that there is more low_level antisense_transcription occurring in promoter_regions and stronger antisense_transcription in terminator regions also it is possible that s as pairs in head tohead conformation show lower expression than s as pairs in tail to tail conformation among the huge amount of detected s as pairs there are some pairs that show mutually_exclusive expression of one strand in some samples and expression of the other strand in others the low number of these s as pairs suggests that they are rare_events in the population and or affect only a small proportion of transcripts it remains_unclear if there is an inhibitory_effect of one transcript on its counterpart or if other mechanisms such as epigenetic_modifications are involved as has been shown for the highly imprinted gnas locus in mice we could identify several s as pairs that are co expressed and show an equal expression rate of both transcripts but differ in expression between samples it could be argued this is caused by different library performance i e this region was just unlucky in some samples or a coverage bias might persist despite normalizing for the total coverage per sample however as shown in supplementaryshows a similar expression rate in all samples while trim and the unknown antisense event show a positively correlated expression which differs between samples it is unlikely that the observed co expression is due to coverage effects suggested that long_non might be involved in s as pairs reasoned by a higher number of s as pairs detected by random primed cap analysis gene_expression cage compared with oligo dt primed cage it could be speculated that the identified as event upstream of trim might present such a non coding rna as no exonintron structure is visible interestingly in the same article katayama et_al reported a frequent concordant regulation of s as pairs another study byprovides further evidence of a high occurrence of positively correlated s as pairs the reason for this remains_unclear but it could be due to the fact that transcription of one strand makes the other strand more accessible as well linked to this palindromic sequences in regulatory_regions such as promoter_regions might be used by both strands in this case the observed transcript could be nonsense transcription which ends by the first possible encountered transcription end signal this might explain why antisense_transcripts in promoter_regions are often described as short and long_non however it is not unlikely that these antisense_transcripts have some function as they do not occur in all promoter or terminator regions of every expressed gene multiple studies showed that non_coding might alter chromatin conformation or lead to a local change of methylation if they are located within promoter_regions using the data available to us we could not link sense and antisense_transcription to methylation of cpg islands except weakly for one case which might be coincidental it is possible that the limited number of cpg islands interrogated by the chip
