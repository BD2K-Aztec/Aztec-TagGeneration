ccmpred fast and precise prediction of protein residue residue_contacts from correlated_mutations motivation recent breakthroughs in protein residueresidue contact_prediction have made reliable de_novo prediction of protein_structures possible the key was to apply statistical_methods that can distinguish direct couplings between pairs of columns in a multiple_sequence from merely correlated pairs i e to separate direct from indirect_effects two classes of such methods exist either relying on regularized inversion of the covariance_matrix or on pseudo likelihood_maximization plm although plm based_methods offer clearly higher_precision available tools are not sufficiently optimized and are written in interpreted languages that introduce additional overheads this impedes the runtime and large_scale contact_prediction for larger protein_families multi_domain and proteinprotein_interactions results here we introduce ccmpred our performance optimized plm implementation in c and cuda c using graphics cards in the price range of current six core processors ccmpred can predict contacts for typical alignments times_faster and with the same precision as the most accurate published_methods for users without a cuda capable graphics card ccmpred can also run in a cpu mode that is still times_faster thanks to our speed ups http dictionary cambridge org dictionary british speed up contacts for typical protein_families can be predicted in s on a consumer grade gpu and min on a six core cpu evolutionary_pressure to maintain a stable protein_structure gives rise to correlated_mutations between contacting residue pairs these correlated_mutations can be observed in a multiple_sequence msa of the protein_family and can be used to predict residueresidue contacts a recent breakthrough was achieved by applying methods from statistics and statistical physics that aim at disentangling direct couplings from mere correlations between msa columns this has resulted in a boost in contact prediction_accuracy thanks to which it is now possible to reliably_predict protein_structures using only sequence_information if enough homologous_sequences are available currently of pfam families meet a reasonable criterion of having three homologous_sequences per residue in the chain see supplementary section for details modern contact prediction_methods differ by their strategy in the disentangling step the most accurate class of methods such as plmdca and gremlin learn the direct couplings as parameters of a markov_random by maximizing its pseudo likelihood which has runtime complexity of o nl where n is the number of homologous_sequences in the msa and l its number of columns the less accurate methods based on sparse covariance_matrix inversion such as psicov or mean field direct coupling analysis use the sequence_information only in a preprocessing_step while the main computation in o l is independent of n this makes them fast for short alignments small l but slow for large_alignments whereas most protein_families used for benchmarking so_far have been relatively short in practice longer alignments are more relevant for example to predict interdomain or even interprotein contacts still existing_methods would take cpu years to complete large_scale studies such as the computation of contact predictions for the of pfam with sufficient sequence_coverage see supplementary section ccmpred implements the approach taken in plmdca and gremlin which is based on maximizing the pseudolikelihood of an l regularized markov_random see supplementary_information for details after successful optimization the couplings are ranked by the frobenius norms of the pairwise potentials and the average product correction is applied to compute the final score as explained in the supplementary_information the task of computing the gradient of the pseudo likelihood represents an almost ideal use case for gpus as the computations can be run to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work efficiently in parallel on the thousands of gpu processors with little idling due to memory access limitations we compare the runtimes and precisions of ccmpred with two other pseudo likelihood_maximization plm based tools plmdca plmdca symmetric plmdca asymmetric and gremlin version and with the covariance_matrix inversion based tool psicov the recently_published freecontact software is much faster than psicov but clearly less accurate than plmdca and gremlin and was not included here ccmpred is a fast gpu and cpu implementation of a top performing plm based contact_prediction approach that runs in a fraction of the time of comparably accurate methods the speed increase is particularly important for long proteins and large_scale applications because ccmpred is free_and we hope that it also can serve as a basis for further methods development in this field
