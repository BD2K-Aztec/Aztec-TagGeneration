paving the future finding suitable ismb venues downloaded from the international_society for computational_biology iscb organizes the largest event in the field of computational_biology and bioinfor_matics namely the annual international conference on intelligent systems for molecular_biology the ismb this year at ismb in long beach iscb celebrated the th anniversary of its flagship meeting iscb is a young lean and efficient society that aspires to make a significant impact with only limited resources many constraints make the choice of venues for ismb a tough challenge here we describe those challenges and invite the contribution of ideas for solutions contact assistant rostlab org ismb evolved the largest scholarly meeting event in computational_biology is the annual_conference of the international_society for computational_biology the iscb namely the international conference on intelligent systems for molecular_biology ismb the ismb meeting series began in in bethesda maryland usa and aimed to connect computational experts to address challenges in molecular_biology that first meeting was so successful that it spawned a series of annual conferences with increasing participation the th ismb in at ucsd in san_diego was the first ismb that brought together over participants due to its increased size it was also the last ismb that could be held at a university the th ismb and the first joint meeting with the european conference on computational_biology eccb in glasgow attracted over attendees at that point the concept of a single track with only about talks was no longer sustainable and ismb went parallel beginning with a double track the th ismb in fortaleza brazil was the last time that most of the organization was shouldered significantly by local scientists beginning with the th ismb and the nd ismb eccb in vienna in iscb took full responsibility for the organization it has been a great challenge for iscb to move from the position of what was essentially an advisory observer to that of completely managing the event over the course of six meetings taking the leading role in the organization of the conference provides iscb with many possibilities to simplify and to evolve a signature style as a result the organization of each new ismb has increasingly moved toward an orchestration of tasks carried_out autonomously each of which follows some specific template and is driven by track chairs conference organization is guided by a steering committee sc composed of the meeting and track chairs staff and key contractors the committee holds biweekly telephone conferences during which organizational issues are discussed and decisions taken ismb involves the participation of over scientists it runs on a total budget exceeding million dollars and it was presented for the th time this year in long beach ca those who contemplate these three numbers may assume that the new organizational structure is an evident necessity this might seem so but the realization of this structure was by no means straightforward today massively_parallel big event today ismb is an event of impressive proportions this leads to immense challenges in every respect other conferences societies meet many of those challenges but no other society with limited resources similar to those of iscb successfully takes on such a particular combination of tasks meetings of comparable complexity and size typically operate on a budget that is significantly more comfortable in other words they spend much more money and involve several times the staff at the ismb in long beach july we realized a total of approximately participants as is now customary for ismb a number of smaller special interest groups sigs and satellite meetings were organized prior to the main ismb conference some of these are in their own right the most important annual_meetings for particular research_areas the keynote addresses were followed morning or preceded afternoon by a h session of talks within each of parallel events tracks for
