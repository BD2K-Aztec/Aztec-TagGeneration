tertiary_structure based prediction of conformational b cell epitopes through b factors motivation b cell epitope is a small_area on the surface of an antigen that binds to an antibody accurately locating epitopes is of critical importance for vaccine_development compared with wet_lab methods computational_methods have strong potential for efficient and large_scale epitope_prediction for antigen candidates at much lower cost however it is still not clear which features are good determinants for accurate epitope_prediction leading to the unsatisfactory performance of existing prediction_methods method and results we propose a much more accurate b cell epi tope prediction method our method uses a new feature b factor obtained from x_ray combined with other basic phy sicochemical statistical evolutionary and structural_features of each residue these basic_features are extended by a sequence window and a structure window all these features are then learned by a two stage random_forest to identify clusters of antigenic residues and to remove isolated outliers tested on a dataset of epitopes from tertiary_structures we prove that our method significantly_outperforms all three existing structure based epitope predictors following comprehensive analysis it is found that features such as b factor relative accessible_surface and protrusion index play_an in characterizing b cell epitopes our detailed case studies on an hiv antigen and an influenza antigen confirm that our second stage learning is effective for clustering true antigenic residues and for eliminating self made prediction_errors introduced by the first stage learning availability_and source codes are available on request b cell epitope is the binding_site of an antibody on an antigen it can be recognized by a specific b lymphocyte to stimulate an immune_response if both the antigen and its binding antibody are known the epitope site can be accurately_determined by wet_lab such as by x_ray however it takes a great_deal of time and labor to identify the epitope s of an unknown antigen and its specific_antibody computational_methods have strong potential for efficient and large_scale epitope_prediction for many antigen candidates at much lower cost early computational_prediction have focused on the identification of linear epitopes which are simple forms of b cell epitopes a linear epitope is composed of a single continuous sequence segment the early prediction_methods have assumed that there should be a good and simple correlation between certain propensities and linear epitope residues and attempted to predict linear epitopes through one or two propensities for example hydrophilicity was used by hopp and woods and flexibility by karplus and schulz protrusion index pi by antigenic propensity by amino_acid pair by and turns by to enhance the robustness of the prediction various ideas of sliding_windows have been proposed and applied in linear epitope_prediction however the sliding_window approach is oversimplified and the prediction_performance was not improved_significantly in blythe and flower derived amino_acid propensity scales from the aaindex and found that even the best set of scales and parameters performed only marginally better than random methods they recommended the use of more sophisticated methods for epitope_prediction other research_works have tried to use machine_learning such as hidden_markov recurrent neural_network and support_vector to improve performance for linear epitope_prediction the other form of b cell epitope is called conformational epitope a conformational epitope consists of discontinuous stretches of residues that are tightly connected after folding in d space as over of epitopes are conformational and an increasing number of protein_structures have recently become available close attention has been shifted to the problem of conformational epitope_prediction discotope is one of the first methods to study conformational_epitopes based on structural data it combines the structural proximity sum of sequentially smoothed log odds_ratios with contact numbers to derive a prediction score another novelty of the method is that it uses the concept of structural window to smooth the physicochemical propensities a later method called ellipro takes_advantage of the pi and makes use of a residue clustering_algorithm to predict both linear and conformational b cell epitopes for a protein_sequence or protein_structure ellipro does not have a training_process but the parameter thresholds must be set before implementation the seppa method introduces a novel concept of unit patch of residue triangle to describe the local spatial context to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com of the protein surface it also incorporates clustering coefficients to describe the spatial compactness of surface_residues for epitope_prediction a more recent work in this area is the antibody specific b cell epitope_prediction this method can accurately_predict the more useful antibody specific epitopes rather than antigenic residues but it requires more prior information e g antibody structure or sequence_information it is not applicable to a new virus when its antibody is unknown in spite of intensive_research the prediction_performance by all of these methods still needs much improvement in this work we propose a much more accurate epitope_prediction method_named ceepre conformational epitope_prediction two new ideas are adopted by ceepre first ceepre uses a new feature b factor in the learning_process combined with many other physicochemical statistical evolutionary and structural_features of the residues these features are also extended by a sequence window and a structure window to derive composite features b factor is an important parameter of protein x_ray it measures the flexibility rigidity of residues atoms in a protein d structure a higher b factor score implies more flexibility of the atom residue it has been found that low b factors are usually distributed at the core of unbound interfaces the second new idea is that ceepre is a two stage model under the random_forest learning_process in the first stage the original features are used to predict the potential antigenic residues in the second stage the predicted class_labels from the first stage are added to the feature_space to cluster nearby antigenic residues to form epitopes and remove isolated antigenic or non antigenic residue predictions this idea is based on the hypothesis that the aggregated antigenic residues are more likely to constitute epitopes while the isolated antigenic residues are probably wrongly predicted this idea is effective to eliminate self made prediction_errors to obtain really meaningful final results ceepre is tested on a set of epitopes from tertiary antigen structures the result shows that ceepre significantly_outperforms all existing structure based epitope predictors discotope ellipro and seppa with a comprehensive analysis of the important features suggested by random_forests in the epitope_prediction it is found that b factor relative accessible_surface rsa and pi play_an in improving prediction_performance our analysis also confirms that whether a residue is involved in an epitope is affected by nearby residues both in sequence and in space and thus it is a good idea to use both the sequence and structure window to construct the feature_vector in this article we have proposed ceepre for conformational b cell epitope_prediction ceepre has a two stage learning_strategy for the random_forest algorithm to identify clusters of antigenic residues it incorporates various basic_features as well as extended composite features through a sequence window and a structure window of these features b factor is used for the first time for b cell epitope_prediction it has been found to be effective in epitope_prediction to be practically useful a tertiary_structure dataset has been constructed for the training of our prediction method and has also been used in the evaluation of ceepre compared with three widely used structure based epitope prediction_models our ceepre shows a significant_improvement in prediction_performance for deep case studies ceepre has been applied to the epitope_prediction for two antigens that are distantly_related to our training data one antigen is an hiv antigen the other is an influenza antigen it has been found that ceepre not only obtains more accurate_predictions of epitope residues but also forms more meaningful epitope predictions by clustering adjacent residues
