systems_biology meta storms efficient_search for similar microbial_communities based on a novel indexing scheme and similarity_score for metagenomic_data background it has long been intriguing scientists to effectively compare different microbial_communities also referred as metagenomic_samples here in a large_scale given a set of unknown samples find similar metagenomic_samples from a large repository and examine how similar these samples are with the current metagenomic_samples accumulated it is possible to build a database of metagenomic_samples of interests any metagenomic_samples could then be searched against this database to find the most similar metagenomic sample s however on one hand current databases with a large number of metagenomic_samples mostly serve as data_repositories that offer few functionalities for analysis and on the other hand methods to measure the similarity of metagenomic_data work well only for small set of samples by pairwise_comparison it is not yet clear how to efficiently search for metagenomic_samples against a large metage nomic database results in this study we have proposed a novel method meta storms that could systematically and efficiently organize and search metagenomic_data it includes the following components i creating a database of metagenomic_samples based on their taxonomical annotations ii efficient indexing of samples in the database based on a hierarchical taxonomy indexing strategy iii searching for a metage nomic sample against the database by a fast scoring_function based on quantitative phylogeny and iv managing database by index export index import data insertion data deletion and database merging we have collected more than metagenomic_data from the public_domain and in house facilities and tested the meta storms method on these datasets our experimental_results show that meta storms is capable of database creation and effective searching for a large number of metagenomic_samples and it could achieve_similar accuracies compared with the current popular significance testing based_methods conclusion meta storms method would serve as a suitable database management and search system to quickly identify similar meta genomic samples from a large_pool of samples microbes are everywhere around us on the planet and the total number of microbial cells on earth is huge a rough estimation of their number is microbes usually live in communities and each of these communities has different community_structures and functions as such microbial_communities would serve as the largest reservoir of genes and genetic functions for a vast number of applications in bio related disciplines including biomedicine in healthcare bioenergy bioremediation and biodefense national_research u s committee on metagenomics challenges and functional applications and national academies press u s because of the strains in a microbial_community could not be isolated and cultivated the metagenomic methods have been used to analyze the microbial_community as a whole understanding the taxonomical structure of a microbial_community alpha diversity and the differences in taxa among microbial_communities beta diversity have been two of the most important problems in metagenomic research in contrast to alpha diversity which measures how many kinds of microorganisms are there in a single community beta diversity measures how community membership varies over time and space and is especially important for finding the complex relationships among a large_numbers of samples understanding the beta diversity is critical for studying microbial_ecology for example human_microbiome projects and related efforts to study microbial_communities occupying various human_body habitats have shown a surprising amount of diversity among individuals in skin gut and mouth ecosystems furthermore the microbial_communities would differ significantly even for those from types of similar environment next_generation techniques have enabled the fast profiling of a large number of metagenomic_data thus a rapidly increasing number of metagenomic profiles of microbial_communities have been archived in public_repositories and research labs around the world as such it is becoming more and more important to compare microbial_communities in large_scale to whom correspondence should be addressed with the fast accumulation of metagenomic_samples and sequencing_data their comparison becomes very important to illustrate their similarities and differences as such the database_search for metagenomic_samples is becoming more and more important however current metagenomic_data are not organized well thus they are only data_repositories but not yet modernized and manageable database and current metagenomic sample comparison methods are generally based on pairwise_comparisons thus only comparable in small_scale and difficult with large_scale analysis without efficient index supporting therefore we have designed the meta storms system as a system for database creation indexing and searching for similar metagenomic_samples meta storms is not only a database builder and searcher but a search_engine based metagenomic sample comparison system that could organize the database well and could perform quick and accurate search although it is one of the first systems of its kind meta storms has already been proved to perform well in similarity_search for a large_numbers of samples its main advantages include ability to handle large number of samples in an integrated system fast indexing and candidate retrieval accurate scoring_function for comparison etc first meta storms has advantages in system integrity it can take input of the s rrna pyro sequencing_data or wgs_data thus is independent of any other method to retrieve the community_structure of the metagenomic_samples additionally the database could be built based on more than metagenomic_samples making it one of the first systems that could handle such a large number of samples second its index is simple yet quite fast and accurate in clustering different samples the fast speed comes out of the simple categorization by only using phyla with high_abundance as the index key therefore such indexing scheme would be useful especially when there are many samples for organizing samples in a metagenomic database third for sample comparison it was noted that significance_tests such as the p test and the fast unifrac replicated permutation become decreasingly useful as the depth of coverage and the number of samples increase however although our methods based on scoring b phylogenetic_tree of human_microbiome samples and query results which were matched to the right body sites numbers on left part are samples that were matched to the body sites indicated by the corresponding arrows function does not need complex computation it is as accurate as those based on significance_tests with fast speed therefore our scoring_function might be a better alternative to the traditional time consuming significance_test functional comparison of different metagenomic_samples have also shown the ability of meta storms to accurately and efficiently identify microbial_communities of similar functions and also help to shed new light onto the functional_diversity of the microbial_communities with the advance of wgs of metagenomic_samples it is anticipated that the functional profiling and comparison of metagenomic_samples would become more and more important for which meta storms would be of greater_importance in conclusion meta storms would provide key methods for metagenomic_projects to facilitate the research in metagenomics and more broadly microbial_communities including human_microbiome projects earthmicrobiome project etc current meta storms method could be updated in index efficiency and consistence first current indexing strategy is suitable for searching samples with dominant genomes which are always the case against large database for query samples without dominant phyla or when samples in the database are quite similar to each other e g from the same source we recommend the exhaustive_search for high_reliability rather than indexed query second the statistical_model for the database_search could be improved by integrating a mixture_model by these refinements it is expected that the overall performance of meta storms could improve further all of these issues are expected to be addressed in our future work
