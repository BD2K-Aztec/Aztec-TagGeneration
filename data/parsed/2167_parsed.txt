hard wired heterogeneity in blood stem_cells revealed using a dynamic regulatory_network model motivation combinatorial interactions of transcription_factors with cis_regulatory control the dynamic progression through successive cellular_states and thus underpin all metazoan development the construction of network models of cis_regulatory therefore has the potential to generate fundamental insights into cellular fate and differentiation haematopoiesis has long served as a model system to study mammalian differentiation yet modelling based on experimentally informed cis regulatory_interactions has so_far been restricted to pairs of interacting_factors here we have generated a boolean_network based on detailed cis_regulatory functional data connecting haematopoietic stem_progenitor hspc regulator genes results despite its apparent simplicity the model exhibits surprisingly complex behaviour that we charted using strongly connected components and shortest_path analysis in its boolean state_space this analysis of our model_predicts that hspcs display heterogeneous expression_patterns and possess many intermediate states that can act as stepping stones for the hspc to achieve a final differentiated_state importantly an external perturbation or trigger is required to exit the stem_cell state with distinct triggers characterizing maturation into the various different lineages by focusing on intermediate states occurring during erythrocyte differentiation from our model we predicted a novel negative regulation of fli by gata which we confirmed experimentally thus validating our model in conclusion we demonstrate that an advanced mammalian regulatory_network model based on experimentally_validated cis regulatory_interactions has allowed us to make novel experimentally testable_hypotheses about transcriptional_mechanisms that control differentiation of mammalian stem_cells the remarkable power of small combinations of transcription_factors to program and reprogram cellular_phenotypes is exerted through their ability to modulate the expression levels of their target_genes typically in the range of a few hundred to a few thousand genes despite the power of single transcription_factors to influence cell_fate it is clear that the transcriptional state of any given cell_type is the result of interactions within wider transcriptional_regulatory these regulatory_networks are composed of both the transcription_factors tfs and the cis_regulatory they are bound to regulatory network_reconstruction therefore requires the identification of cis_regulatory as well as the upstream factors that bind them haematopoiesis blood formation has long served as a model process for studying stem_cells and represents the best characterized adult_stem system with sophisticated purification strategies and functional stem_cell assays transcriptional_regulation is a key factor_controlling haematopoiesis miranda saavedra and gottgens a fact underlined by the large number of tf genes that play_key normal haematopoiesis and or the development of leukaemia however relatively little is known about the way key_regulators interact with each other in forming the transcriptional_networks controlling haematopoiesis identification and subsequent characterization of gene_regulatory is central to the reconstruction of transcriptional_regulatory because these elements dictate the connectivity and topology of transcriptional_regulatory regulatory_elements can be analysed using a variety of assays such as transfection assays of luciferase_reporter or chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_analysis to identify upstream_regulators however the identification of true in vivo activities of mammalian regulatory_elements requires the use of transgenic_mouse systems regulatory_elements from gene_loci active in haematopoietic stem_progenitor hspcs have been validated using all the aforementioned assays including transgenic_mice to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative_commons http creativecommons org_licenses which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com this wealth of data therefore represents a unique_opportunity to re construct transcriptional_network models for developing blood stem_cells network modelling is increasingly_recognized as a powerful approach to deal with the complexity of biological_processes including the intricate interactions between tfs most of the current experimental data_describing the function of haematopoietic tfs are of a qualitative nature e g gata and scl together activate scl expression which limits the choice of possible modelling approaches however the accumulated knowledge of regulatory_interactions contains experimentally_validated information on the topology of regulatory sub circuits including positive_and which are important for maintenance of both the stem_cell phenotype and differentiation into different mature blood cell_types an important challenge for regulatory network_reconstruction is to devise models that can represent the dynamic interactions between important sub circuits and represent the changes in gene_expression when cells are undergoing differentiation importantly experimentally defined regulatory hierarchies based on regulatory_elements up to now largely represent a static view which in the case of blood stem_cell formation is centred on a single time point in transgenic_mouse assays activity within the dorsal aorta region and foetal liver of the midgestation mouse_embryo here we have generated a network model based on extensive experimental_data with the goal to better understand how core stem_cell network circuits are incorporated into the wider dynamic system of blood stem_cell development and differentiation through the modelling of steady_states and dynamic_network behaviour we were able to identify specific genes and feedback_loops within the network that are likely key_players in cellular decision_making such as the dynamic_processes of stem_cell and or differentiation moreover our analysis revealed heterogeneous gene_expression states within undifferentiated blood stem_cells as well as accurately captured perturbations required to differentiate hspcs along a specific lineage importantly based on our modelling results we made a hypothesis that gata negatively_regulates fli which we validated experimentally using transcriptional assays thus providing new insights into the dynamic nature of regulatory_networks controlling differentiation of blood stem_cells into erythroid_cells the construction of accurate regulatory_network models is an essential prerequisite towards gaining a systems level understanding of the transcriptional_control of complex cellular behaviour here we have generated a regulatory_network model for hspcs based on comprehensive experimental_data which represents the most complex mammalian network model to date anchored on cis_regulatory functional data this experimentally_validated network_topology generated three stable_states one of which was composed of interconnected internal_states including the one that matched the stem_cell expression pattern binary on off expression of an gene network could theoretically generate possible expression states the fact that we identify only states thus highlights how network modelling based on experimental_data can serve to reduce the complexity of analysing multi gene interactions analysis of state_space transitions identified potential triggers that might mediate exit from the stem_cell state and highlighted a previously_unrecognized inhibition of fli by gata which was subsequently validated experimentally
