structural_bioinformatics memory_efficient rna energy_landscape exploration motivation energy_landscapes provide a valuable means for studying the folding dynamics of short rna_molecules in detail by modeling all possible structures and their transitions higher abstraction levels based on a macro state decomposition of the landscape enable the study of larger systems however they are still restricted by huge memory_requirements of exact approaches results we present a highly parallelizable local enumeration scheme that enables the computation of exact macro state_transition models with highly reduced memory_requirements the approach is evaluated on rna_secondary landscapes using a gradient basin definition for macro states furthermore we demonstrate the need for exact transition models by comparing two barrier based_approaches and perform a detailed investigation of gradient basins in rna energy_landscapes availability_and source_code is part of the c energy_landscape library available atthe driving_force of disordered systems in physics chemistry and biology is characterized by coupling and competing interaction of microscopic components at a qualitative level this is reflected by the potential_energy and often results in complex topological_properties induced by individual conformational degrees_of it seems fair to say that it is practically impossible to compute dynamic and thermodynamic_properties directly from the hamiltonian of such a complex system however analyzing the underlying energy_landscape and its features directly provides a valuable alternative here we focus on rna_molecules and their folding kinetics rnas are key_players in cells acting as regulators messengers enzymes and many more roles in many cases a specific structure is crucial for biological specificity and functionality the formation of these functional structures i e the folding_process can be studied at the level of rna energy_landscapes rna is composed of the biophysical alphabet a c g u and has the ability to fold back onto itself by formation of discrete base_pairs thus forming secondary_structures the latter provide a natural coarse_graining for the description of the thermodynamic and kinetic_properties of rna because in contrast to proteins the secondary_structure of rna captures most of the folding_free this is accommodated by novel approaches for predicting d rna_structures from secondary_structures formally an rna_secondary is defined as a set of base_pairs between the nuclear bases complying with the rules i only a u g c and g u pairings are allowed ii any base is involved in maximal one base_pair and iii the structure is nested i e there are no two base_pairs with indices i j k l with i k j l summation over the individual base_pair binding_energies and entropic contributions for unpaired bases defines the energy function e the degeneracy of this energy definition is countered via a structure ordering based on their string encoding we refer to the literature for more details in this work we study the folding kinetics of rna_molecules by means of a discrete energy_landscape approach while stochastic folding simulations based on solving the master_equation are limited to relatively short sequence_lengths a common approach to studying biopolymer folding dynamics is using a coarse_grained model that partitions the energy_landscape into distinct basins of attraction thus assigning macro states to each basin the basin decomposition and computation has been described in different contexts including potential energy_landscapes rna kinetics and lattice protein_folding given appropriate transition_rates between macro states optionally composed of rates among micro states that form a macro state the dynamics can be modeled as continuous_time process and solved directly by numerical integration while suitable for system sizes up to states improvements to this approach are currently subject to our research allowing

step in the procedure sketched above is to obtain the transition_rates between macro states global methods for complete or partial enumeration of the energy_landscape are not applicable to large systems because of memory restrictions on the other side sampling with high_precision requires long sampling_times therefore approximating the energy_landscape by a subset of important local_minima gained via sampling approaches or spectroscopic_methods and transition paths between them no e and has been investigated in the past we propose a novel highly parallelizable and memoryefficient local enumeration approach for computing exact transition_probabilities while the method is intrinsically generic and can be readily applied to other discrete systems we exemplify the concept in the context of energy_landscapes of rna_secondary based on the turner energy_model as implemented in the vienna rna package and the energy_landscape library ell we evaluate the memory_efficiency and dynamics quality for different rna_molecules and report features of gradient basin macro states in rna energy_landscapes we have introduced a local flooding scheme for computing the exact macro state transition_rates for arbitrary discrete energy_landscapes provided some macro state assignment is available the approach has been evaluated on rna_secondary energy_landscapes in the context of modeling coarse_grained rna_folding kinetics based on gradient basins we have demonstrated the need for exact macro state_transition models via comparison with a simpler barrier tree based arrhenius like model the latter resulted in significantly different dynamics measured by mean fpt we showed that the local flooding scheme requires several orders_of less memory compared with the standard global flooding scheme furthermore it is intrinsically open to vast parallelization which should also result in significant runtime reduction given that the global flooding can not be easily parallelized finally we performed a thorough investigation of gradient basins in rna energy_landscapes because they are commonly used as macro state abstraction in the field gradient basins have been shown to be generally small which is the reason for the tremendously reduced memory requirement of the local flooding scheme the basin of the unstructured state has been shown to be special as it is the largest most connected macro state and covers the energetically highest micro states independent of their size most basins contain micro states of almost the entire energy_range above their respective local minimum the majority of the gradient basins covers only states with positive energy we found a low average connectivity between gradient basins the existence of few highly_connected hub nodes and a high correlation of connectivity with basin size
