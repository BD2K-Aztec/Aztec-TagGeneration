gene_expression w chipeaks a comprehensive web_application tool for processing chip_chip and chip_seq chip based technology is becoming the leading technology to globally profile thousands of transcription_factors and elucidate the transcriptional_regulation mechanisms in living_cells it has evolved rapidly in recent_years from hybridization with spotted or tiling microarray chip_chip to pair end tag sequencing chip pet to current massively_parallel chip_seq although there are many tools available for identifying binding_sites peaks for chip_chip few of them are available as easy accessible online web_tools for processing both chip_chip and chip_seq for the chip based user community as such we have developed a comprehensive web_application tool for processing chip_chip and chip_seq our web_tool w chipeaks employed a probe based or bin based enrichment threshold to define peaks and applied statistical_methods to control false_discovery for identified peaks the web_tool includes two different web interfaces pelt for chip_chip belt for chip_seq where both were tested on previously_published experimental_data the novel features of our tool include a comprehensive output for identified peaks with gff bed bedgraph and wig formats annotated_genes to which these peaks are related a graphical interpretation and visualization of the results via a_user chip based technology is becoming the leading technology to globally profile thousands of transcription_factors and elucidate the transcriptional_regulation mechanisms in living_cells it has evolved rapidly in recent_years from hybridization with spotted or tiling microarray chip_chip to pair end tag sequencing chip pet to current massively_parallel chip_seq despite the fact that microarray_based chromatin immuneprecipitation chip method chip_chip is gradually being replaced by the emerging sequencing based method such as chip_seq both methods are currently being used in many laboratories as to whom correspondence should be addressed a major tool to survey transcription_factor binding_patterns study various histone_modifications in an unbiased manner currently available tools for the chip_chip data are exemplified and comprehensively compared in the spike in data chip_seq technology and related computational_tools are also reviewed in park cisgenome provided an integrated analyzing software system for both technologies while we appreciate the accuracy and efficiency of these tools few of them are available as easy accessible online web_tools for processing both chip_chip and chip_seq for the chip based user community as such we have developed a comprehensive web_application tool for processing chip_chip and chip_seq our web_tool w chipeaks employed a probe based or bin based enrichment threshold to define peaks and applied statistical_methods to control false_discovery for identified peaks the web_tool includes two different web interfaces probebased enrichment threshold level pelt for chip_chip and belt bin based enrichment threshold level for chip_seq where both were tested on previously_published experimental_data
