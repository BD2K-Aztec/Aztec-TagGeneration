gene_expression alfq an r package for estimating absolute protein quantities from label_free lc_ms proteomics_data motivation the determination of absolute quantities of proteins in biological_samples is necessary for multiple types of scientific_inquiry while relative quantification has been commonly used in proteomics few proteomic_datasets measuring absolute protein quantities have been reported to date various technologies have been applied using different types of input_data e g ion intensities or spectral counts as well as different absolute normalization strategies to date a user_friendly and transparent software supporting large_scale absolute protein quantification has been lacking results we present a bioinformatics tool termed alfq which supports the commonly used absolute label_free protein_abundance estimation methods topn ibaq apex nsaf and scampi for lc_ms proteomics_data together with validation algorithms enabling automated data analysis and error estimation availability_and alfq is written in r and freely_available under the gplv from cran http www cran r project org instructions and example data are provided in the r package the raw_data can be obtained from the peptideatlas raw_data repository pass a variety of quantitative_proteomic methods have been established to measure the relative_abundance of proteins across samples although relative quantification_methods are useful to compare the same proteins between multiple biological_samples they do not provide the possibility to directly compare the data with other datasets or compare different proteins within a dataset with each other and they by definition do not provide absolute quantitative data further specific applications such as differential_equation based modeling of biological_systems or determination of subunit stoichiometry of protein_complexes depend on absolute protein quantities the current gold_standard for lc_ms msbased absolute protein quantification is the use of stable_isotope standard sis peptides or proteins in precisely determined concentrations these standards are spiked into the biological_sample of interest and the absolute_concentration of the endogenous peptides and proteins can directly be determined by calculating the ratio of the measured intensities of the spikedin heavy and the endogenous light forms for economic reasons usually only few proteins are quantified using sis peptides in a single study to overcome_this multiple absolute label_free methods have been developed in recent_years which allow the estimation of absolute protein abundances for all or a significant fraction of the identified proteins for a recent discussion and comparison of the methods see ahrnet al what these methods have in common is that they either use the linear loglog correlation between absolute protein_abundance and experimentally estimated protein intensity or an estimate of the total protein concentration of the sample however they differ in their protein intensity inference strategy and to date each requires its own computational framework here we provide alfq an open_source implementation of algorithms supporting the estimation of protein quantities by any of the aforementioned methods and additionally provide automated workflows for data analysis and error estimation alfq enables automated absolute label_free protein_abundance estimation based on input_data from various mass_spectrometric measurement modes and analysis software_tools different quantification_methods can be applied in a single framework and thanks to its implementation in the statistical programming_language r it is accessible to a wide audience of biologists and bioinformaticians thus alfq enables easy and fast comparison and selection of the most suitable quantification_method and additionally provides an estimation of the absolute abundance estimation error topn peptide model_selection to mediate estimation of protein_abundance using sis peptides import generates a generic alfq input data_structure proteininference different protein intensity estimation methods can be used to infer protein intensities from measured peptides and transitions absolutequantification using sis peptides a model is built and cross_validation is conducted to examine the performance alf different models for varying numbers of transitions and peptides are generated and evaluated and the model with the smallest mfe is selected
