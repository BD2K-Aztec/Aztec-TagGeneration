scale_space measures for graph topology link protein network architecture to function motivation the network architecture of physical protein interactions is an important_determinant for the molecular_functions that are carried_out within each cell to study this relation the network architecture can be characterized by graph topological characteristics such as shortest_paths and network hubs these characteristics have an important shortcoming they do not take into account that interactions_occur across different scales this is important because some cellular_functions may involve a single direct protein interaction small_scale whereas others require more and or indirect interactions such as protein_complexes medium scale and interactions between large modules of proteins large_scale results in this work we derive generalized scale aware versions of known graph topological measures based on diffusion kernels we apply these to characterize the topology of networks across all scales simultaneously generating a so_called graph topological scale_space the comprehensive physical interaction_network in yeast is used to show that scale_space based measures consistently give superior_performance when distinguishing protein functional_categories and three major types of functional interactionsgenetic interaction co expression and perturbation interactions moreover we demonstrate that graph topological scale spaces capture biologically_meaningful features that provide new insights into the link between function and protein network architecture availability_and matlab tm code to calculate the scale aware topological measures stms is available at http bioinformatics tudelft nl tssaunderstanding the living_cell as a system of interconnected components is one of the key_challenges of the post genomic era to address this many high_throughput screening_techniques are used that chart the physical protein_interaction pin of the living_cell e g yeast for instance has one of the most comprehensive experimentally_verified physical pins the interactions captured in these pins entail the full range of chemical bonds between cellular_components ranging from protein complex formation and kinase signaling activity to transcription_factor binding and dna_modifications physical_interactions give rise to functional interactions these can be broadly categorized into i serial function interactions such as the causal_effects of a gene perturbation on downstream transcription i e regulatory_network interactions ii parallel function interactions such as those arising from synthetic_lethality a genetic_interaction and iii collaborative function interactions such as co expression in protein_complexes although some functional interactions are the result of a single physical_interaction most functional interactions arise as a result of a complex_interplay between a collection of physical_interactions consequently analysis of the network architecture is important for understanding the functionality that it orchestrates for this purpose several graph topological measures have been proposed these topological characterizations have for instance been used to uncover homology relations between proteins or make predictions on protein_function moreover it has been demonstrated that deletion of hub proteinsi e proteins with high network degreeis more often lethal than deletion of nonhub proteins this observation was explained by the observation that essential genes cluster in hub enriched essential modules similarly bottleneck proteinsi e proteins with high network betweennesswere found to be more essential and evolutionary_conserved and exhibit different expression dynamics than proteins with low betweenness common graph topological measures such as shortest path_length jaccard_index clustering_coefficient and centrality_measures only capture topology in the direct vicinity of the node under investigation they thus operate at a fixed zoom level i e they do not take topological scale into account this also holds for measures that characterize the centrality of a node with respect to the whole network these include closeness centrality betweenness_centrality subgraph centrality katz centrality and eigenvector centrality the concept of topological scale is however important for studying how functional interaction emerges from the structure of the physical pin for instance at the smallest scale links in the pin may directly implicate a functional relation between two proteins at a medium scale one could find functional_relations that are characterized by a number of physical_interactions such as a small signaling_cascade in terms of graph to whom correspondence should be addressed which permits non commercial re use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup com topology this could be captured by a small linearly connected graph_structure finally at larger scales the network_topology that describes complete protein_complexes and pathways is important and should be captured to relate proteins functionally at a module level the topology that describes this scale may consist of several densely_connected subgraphs because network_topology occurs across a range of scales traditional topological measures are inadequate to capture functional_relations in the network instead measures that include some kind of zoom parameter on topological scale are required measures that characterize meso scale topology have been proposed before of particular interest is the scale aware version of the subgraph centrality proposed by estrada that resulted in superior_ability to identify essential proteins however the method used to incorporate scale does not extend to other topological measures and moreover was discrete in nature here we address_this by introducing a scale invariant description of the topology around or between proteins these scale aware topological measures stms are built on the framework of diffusion kernels which can be seen as a network smoothing operation by means of diffusion the level of smoothing determines the scale and can be tuned using a scale parameter application of kernel diffusion to a physical interaction_network for a range of scales yields a graph topological scale_space in spirit such a scale_space is similar to image scale spaces used in computer vision applications there smoothing is used to obtain a family of derived images that describe the relevant image structure across all scales we derive a range of stms that can be applied to this graph topological scale_space stms can be defined to characterize a single protein such as the degree centrality stm as well as to characterize the network connecting two proteins such as the shortest_path stm as our main focus is on functional interactions we additionally derive link descriptors from the nodebased stms in the remainder of this article we explore the use of stms when applied to the comprehensive physical pin of saccharomyces_cerevisiae yeast using supervised_learning to predict three classes of functional interactions i e geneticintuitive explanation of the shortest_path stm for the stm behaves similar to the standard shortest_path measure for higher values of it will start to take into account the number of shortest_paths bundle of paths that connect x and y moreover when increases paths that are longer than just the shortest_path are considered in this way the overall network_connectivity between two nodes is characterized for the measure will approach the logarithm of the number of nodes in the graph component containing x and y d the jaccard measure which normally determines the fraction of common neighbors of two nodes will take into account more extended neighborhoods with increasing scale e similar to the jaccard the centrality and clustering_coefficient do not just take into account their direct neighbors but with increasing scale also the neighbors of neighbors f the betweenness_centrality measure measuring the number of shortest_path going through a specific node is expanded so that it with increasing scale also takes_into longer paths that is although node z has a betweenness value of zero using the standard measure the stm version still captures its role in linking x and y throughout a non shortest_path i interactions perturbation interactions and co expression interactions we find that non linear classifiers trained on stm features can reach area_under roc_curve auc performances as high as moreover we demonstrate that clustering based on stm features reveals a pronounced substructure within each of the functional interaction classes that exhibit clearly distinct characteristics with biologically_meaningful interpretations
