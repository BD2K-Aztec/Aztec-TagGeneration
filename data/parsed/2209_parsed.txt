sequence_analysis hitc exploration of high_throughput 'c' experiments the r bioconductor_package hitc facilitates the exploration of high_throughput c based data it allows users to import and export c data to transform normalize annotate and visualize interaction maps the package operates within the bioconductor framework and thus offers_new for future development in this field availability_and the r package hitc is available from the bioconductor website a detailed vignette provides additional documentation and help for using the package the three_dimensional organization of chromosomes and the physical interactions_occurring along and between them play_an in the regulation of gene activity over the past_years the development of chromosome_conformation c based techniques has changed our view of nuclear organization with the emergence of next_generation high_throughput conformation capture techniques such as circular c c c carbon copy c or more recently hi c have been developed to study the physical_interactions between many loci in parallel while the use of high_throughput c techniques is expected to increase in coming_years bioinformatic_methods and software to analyze such data are still lacking here we present the r bioconductor_package hitc that enables users to visualize and explore high_throughput c data one advantage of the hitc package is that it operates within the open_source bioconductor framework and thus offers_new for future_developments in this field the hitc package is aimed at biologists interested in investigating their data and at biostatisticians involved in the development of new statistical_methods which can be applied to c data
