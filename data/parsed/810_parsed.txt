boolnet an r package for generation reconstruction and analysis of boolean_networks artistic license motivation as the study of information_processing in living_cells moves from individual pathways to complex_regulatory mathematical_models and simulation become indispensable tools for analyzing the complex behavior of such networks and can provide deep insights into the functioning of cells the dynamics of gene_expression for example can be modeled with boolean_networks bns these are mathematical_models of low complexity but have the advantage of being able to capture essential properties of gene_regulatory however current implementations of bns only focus on different sub aspects of this model and do not allow for a seamless_integration into existing preprocessing pipelines results boolnet efficiently integrates methods for synchronous asynchronous and probabilistic bns this includes reconstructing networks from time series generating random networks robustness analysis via perturbation markov_chain simulations and identification and visualization of attractors availability the package boolnet is freely_available from the r project at
