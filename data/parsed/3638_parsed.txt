systems_biology predicting drug_target from chemical and genomic kernels using bayesian matrix_factorization motivation identifying interactions between drug_compounds and target_proteins has a great practical importance in the drug_discovery for known diseases existing databases contain very few experimentally_validated drugtarget_interactions and formulating successful computational_methods for predicting interactions remains_challenging results in this study we consider four different drugtarget_interaction from humans involving enzymes ion_channels g_protein and nuclear_receptors we then propose a novel bayesian formulation that combines dimensionality_reduction matrix_factorization and binary_classification for predicting drugtarget_interaction using only chemical similarity between drug_compounds and genomic similarity between target_proteins the novelty of our approach comes from the joint bayesian formulation of projecting drug_compounds and target_proteins into a unified subspace using the similarities and estimating the interaction_network in that subspace we propose using a variational approximation in order to obtain an efficient inference scheme and give its detailed derivations finally we demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in three different scenarios i exploratory_data using low_dimensional projections ii predicting interactions for the out of sample drug_compounds and iii predicting unknown interactions of the given network availability software and supplementary_material are available atthe functions of pharmaceutically useful target protein_families such as enzymes ion_channels g_protein gpcrs and nuclear_receptors can be modulated by interacting them with drug_compounds our knowledge about the genomic space of target_proteins and the chemical_space of drug_compounds is piling up as a result of high_throughput experimental projects that analyze the genome and high_throughput chemical compound screening with biological_assays unfortunately our knowledge about the relationship between these two spaces remains quite limited to whom correspondence should be addressed due to laborious and costly experimental_procedures existing databases such as chembl drugbank kegg drug and supertarget contain information about a small number of experimentally_validated interactions hence successful computational_methods for identifying interactions between drug_compounds and target_proteins make genomic drug_discovery significantly efficient and effective computational_approaches can be used to guide experimentalists towards new predictions and to provide_supporting for their experimental_results traditional computational_methods can be grouped into three categories i docking_simulations ii ligand based_approaches and iii literature text_mining docking_simulations require structural_information of target_proteins which is not mostly available for some protein_families such as gpcrs ligand based_approaches compare a candidate ligand with the known ligands of a target protein and may not perform well for target_proteins with a small number of known ligands literature text_mining based on keyword_search cannot be used to detect unknown interactions and suffers from the redundancy due to non standard naming practice for drug_compounds and target_proteins recently there are many machine_learning proposed for predicting drugtarget_interactions using the chemical_properties of drug_compounds the genomic properties of target_proteins and the known interaction_network the main assumption of these studies is that similar drug_compounds are likely to interact with similar target_proteins these similarities between drug_compounds and target_proteins are often encoded using kernel functions designed specifically for chemical_compounds and protein_sequences respectively the most basic statistical_approach is to formulate the interaction network_inference problem as a binary_classification task between drugtarget_pairs using pairwise kernel functions however this approach can be computationally quite heavy due to the high number of drugtarget_pairs supervised bipartite_graph inference maps drug_compounds and target points into a unified space i e pharmacological space using the chemical and genomic similarities and tries to estimate the interaction_network using a distance based procedure in that subspace local models are also used to predict drugtarget_interaction after their successful applications for proteinprotein_interaction metabolicin order to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method called kernelized bayesian matrix_factorization with twin kernels kbmf k we present the results of three experimental scenarios i exploratory_data using low_dimensional projections ii predicting interactions for the out of sample drug_compounds and iii predicting unknown interactions of the given network in this study we consider four different drugtarget_interaction from humans involving enzymes ion_channels gpcrs and nuclear_receptors we then propose a novel bayesian formulation that combines kernel_based nonlinear dimensionality_reduction matrix_factorization and binary_classification for predicting drugtarget_interaction using only chemical similarity between drug_compounds and genomic similarity between target_proteins the novelty of our approach comes from the joint bayesian formulation of projecting drug_compounds and target_proteins into a unified subspace using the similarities and estimating the interaction
