gene_expression halo a java framework for precise transcript half_life determination recent improvements in experimental_technologies now allow measurements of de_novo transcription and or rna decay at whole transcriptome level and determination of precise transcript half_lives such transcript half_lives provide_important the regulation of biological_processes and the relative_contributions of rna decay and de_novo transcription to differential_gene in this article we present halo half_life organizer the first software for the precise determination of transcript half_lives from measurements of rna de_novo transcription or decay determined with microarrays or rna_seq in addition methods for quality_control filtering and normalization are supplied halo provides a graphical_user command_line and a well documented java application_programming api thus it can be used both by biologists to determine transcript half_lives fast and reliably with the provided user_interfaces as well as software_developers integrating transcript half_life analysis into other gene_expression pipelines availability source_code executables and documentation are available attranscript levels in a cell are determined by a constant turnover driven by de_novo synthesis by polymerases and degradation by nucleases while constant transcript_levels are due to an equilibrium between rna_synthesis and decay changes in transcript_levels reflect alterations in either of them while standard gene_expression methods now allow measurements of total_rna levels on a genome_wide scale they cannot distinguish whether changes in total_rna levels are due to changes in de_novo transcription or rna decay previously rna decay_rates have been determined by arresting transcription and subsequently monitoring ongoing rna decay over time this is based on the assumption that rna decay is not affected to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as by transcription inhibition however it has been shown that a stress_response such as e g induced by transcriptional arrest can lead to a substantial stabilization of individual transcripts alternatively nuclear run on assays have been used to measure de_novo transcription and the relative_contributions of transcription_rate and mrna_decay to steady_state mrna_levels recently new methods have been introduced for the non disruptive quantification of de_novo transcription based on biosynthetic labeling rna tagging of newly transcribed rna with thiouracil tu or thiouridine su after labeling newly transcribed rna total_rna can be separated into the labeled newly transcribed rna and the unlabeled preexisting rna and de_novo transcription and decay can be quantified in a single experimental_setting using any of these methods transcript half_lives i e the speed of rna turnover can be determined for individual genes and the relative_contributions of transcription_rate and rna decay to gene_expression regulation can be evaluated in this way alterations of rna decay have been confirmed as an important regulatory_mechanism for many genes moreover as transcript half_lives are correlated to gene function and regulation they can provide_interesting insights into differential regulatory_mechanisms for closely_related genes and the regulation of protein_complexes in this article we present halo half_life organizer a software environment for the calculation of transcript half_lives from measurements of total_rna levels de_novo transcription or rna decay obtained with any of the above described methods as it is independent of the quantification_method used in the process it can be applied both to microarray_and measurements in addition it provides methods for filtering and normalization of data and quality_control of the microarray or rna_seq experiments moreover these algorithms are not restricted to rna half_lives recent improvements in proteomics technologies particularly stable_isotope with amino_acids silac will soon be suitable to measure protein half_lives based on newly_synthesized to total protein ratios to support these developments halo has been designed to be easily extendable to new methods thus it will prove valuable for further studies on the role of half_lives in the regulation of many biological_processes halo is an extensible java framework providing state of theart methods for transcript half_life calculation as well as quality_control filtering and normalization it can be used as a standalone tool or can be integrated into other gene_expression frameworks the intuitive gui makes it accessible for users without programming_skills aiming to calculate transcript half_lives in a fast and straightforward way from new measurements of de_novo synthesis and or decay both for microarrays or rna_seq in addition researchers developing new software programs and methods can easily incorporate and extend the available methods of halo in their own programs thus halo will be a valuable_tool for the analysis of transcript half_lives and thus an important prerequisite for the analysis of the regulation of biological_systems
