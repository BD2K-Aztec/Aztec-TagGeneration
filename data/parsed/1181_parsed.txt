sequence_analysis correction of sequencing_errors in a mixed set of reads motivation high_throughput produce large sets of short_reads that may contain errors these sequencing_errors make de_novo challenging error_correction aims to reduce the error_rate prior assembly many de_novo sequencing_projects use reads from several sequencing_technologies to get the benefits of all used technologies and to alleviate their shortcomings however combining such a mixed set of reads is problematic as many tools are specific to one sequencing_platform the solid sequencing_platform is especially problematic in this regard because of the two base color coding of the reads therefore new tools for working with mixed read sets are needed results we present an error_correction tool for correcting substitutions insertions_and in a mixed set of reads produced by various sequencing_platforms we first develop a method for correcting reads from any sequencing_technology producing base space reads such as the solexa illumina and roche life_sciences sequencing_platforms we then further refine the algorithm to correct the color_space reads from the applied_biosystems solid sequencing_platform together with normal base space reads our new tool is based on the shrec program that is aimed at correcting solexa illumina_reads our experiments show that we can detect errors with sensitivity_and if the combined sequencing_coverage of the sets is at least we also show that the error_rate of the reads is greatly_reduced availability the java source_code is freely_available atthe high_throughput sequencing_machines such as solexa illumina applied_biosystems solid and roche life_sciences produce millions of short_reads in a single run the reads may contain errors which continues to present a challenge to de_novo assemblers the error_rate of the reads can be reduced with trimming and by correcting the reads the different sequencing_platforms have their own benefits and shortcomings for example the distribution of error types varies from one platform to another the dominant error type in solexa illumina and solid reads is substitution reads produced by the roche platform tend to have many insertions_and because of the technologys inability to assess the length of homopolymer runs correctly and the dominant error type in helicos reads is deletion translation from bases to colorswhile most sequencing_platforms produce base space reads i e the reads are sequences of bases a c g and t the solid platform produces reads in color_space the solid sequencer interrogates bases in overlapping pairs so that each base is sequenced twice the pairs are coded with four colors as shown in due to different characteristics of the sequencing_platforms it is an attractive idea to combine reads produced by several platforms this kind of mixed read sets could improve the results of both error_correction and de_novo there are not many tools that can take full benefit from a mixed set of reads especially if part of the reads are solid color_space reads we present this kind of tool for error_correction in this article many tools for error_correction of reads from second generation sequencers use the spectral alignment_method first introduced in the euler sr assembler this method first computes the spectrum of the reads which consists of all l tuples that are frequent enough in the read set then a string r is computed for each read r such that all l tuples in r are in the spectrum and the distance between r and r is minimized the distance measure can be e g the hamming_distance allowing only substitutions or edit_distance allowing both insertions_and a similar approach is taken in several error_correction tools such as solid accuracy enhancement tool saet http solidsoftwaretools com gf project saet and as preprocessing in many assemblers such as allpaths and soapdenovo in the alignment approach multiple_alignments are computed for the reads and then errors are detected and corrected based on the columns of these alignments this approach has been used with reads from the classical sanger_sequencing examples of such tools are mised and the preprocessing_step in arachne the problem of this approach is that it is not feasible to compute the multiple_alignments for millions of reads produced by the newer sequencing_technologies recently the error_correction tool shrec extended this approach to solexa illumina_reads bypage we have presented a tool for the hybrid correction of a mixed set of reads produced by several sequencing_platforms including the solid sequencing_technology that produces color_space reads we showed that our method can detect errors with high_sensitivity and also the error_rate of the reads is reduced we also showed that low coverage read sets clearly benefit from hybrid correction with other read sets
