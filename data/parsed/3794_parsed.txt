pumper phylogenies updated perpetually new sequence_data useful for phylogenetic and evolutionary_analyses continues to be added to public_databases the construction of multiple_sequence and inference of huge phylogenies comprising large taxonomic_groups are expensive tasks both in terms of man hours and computational_resources therefore maintaining comprehensive phylogenies based on representative and up to date molecular sequences is challenging pumper is a framework that can perpetually construct multi gene alignments with phlawd and phylogenetic_trees with examl or raxml light for a given ncbi taxonomic_group when sufficient numbers of new gene sequences for the selected taxonomic_group have accumulated in genbank pumper automatically extends the alignment and infers extended phylogenetic_trees by using previously inferred smaller trees as starting topologies using our framework large phylogenetic_trees can be perpetually updated without human intervention importantly resulting phylogenies are not statistically significantly_worse than trees inferred from scratch availability_and pumper can run in stand alone mode on a single server or offload the computationally_expensive phylogenetic searches to a parallel_computing cluster source_code documentation and tutorials are available at https github com fizquierdo perpetually updated trees sequence_data continues to accumulate in public_databases at an increasing pace with the addition of new data for species and individuals or genes existing phylogenies of taxonomic_groups need to be updated reinitiating phylogenetic inferences from scratch every time new data are added to public_databases represents wasted effort in the form of man hours and energy_consumption computations nonetheless adding new taxa or genes to a phylogenetic_tree may also unravel new evolutionary_relationships that were not supported by previous smaller datasets we present the pumper framework and make available a phylogenetic analysis_pipeline that can automatically update existing huge reference phylogenies and alignments by new sequence_data without the need to recompute everything from scratch we call this procedure a perpetual tree update other pipelines such as stap have used publicly_available databases and packages like blastn clustalw and phyml to automate the process of alignment construction and phylogenetic_inference the mor pipeline implements the automated extension of phylogenetic_trees with new taxa albeit with the specific focus of producing automated taxonomies of homobasidiomycetes
