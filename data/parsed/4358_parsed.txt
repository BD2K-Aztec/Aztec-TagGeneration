systems_biology specl an r bioconductor_package to prepare peptide_spectrum for use in targeted_proteomics motivation targeted data_extraction methods are attractive ways to obtain quantitative peptide information from a proteomics experiment sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra swath and data_independent dia methods increase reproducibility of acquired data because the classical precursor selection is omitted and all present precursors are fragmented however especially for targeted data_extraction ms coordinates retention time information precursor and fragment masses are required for the particular entities peptide ions these coordinates are usually generated in a so_called discovery experiment earlier on in the project if not available in public spectral library repositories the quality of the assay panel is crucial to ensure appropriate downstream_analysis for that a method is needed to create spectral_libraries and to export customizable assay panels results here we present a versatile set of functions to generate assay panels from spectral_libraries for use in targeted data_extraction methods swath dia in the area of proteomics availability_and specl is implemented in the r language and available under an open_source gpl in bioconductor since bioc r http www bioconductor org trachsel et_al a vignette with a complete tutorial describing data import export and analysis is included in the package and can also be found as supplement material of this article targeted_proteomics is a fast evolving field in proteomics and was elected as method of the year in by the nature journal methods such as selected_reaction srm sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra swath ms and dia represent promising perspectives for the identification and quantification of peptides and proteins in these targeted_proteomics methods a predefined set of fragment_ion signals transitions are extracted over the chromatographic time all methods have in common the need for precise ms coordinates composed of precursor mass fragment masses and retention time these coordinates are stored in spectral_libraries spectral_libraries are generated from shotgun ms_ms data a protocol on how to build high_quality assay libraries can be found in starting from one spectral library different assays can be extracted according to the requirements of different types of mass_spectrometers here an r bioconductor_package is presented which creates specific assay panels from peptide_identification results e g from bibliospec files or mascot result files specl is a versatile set of functions that
