bayesian_inference of signaling network_topology in a cancer cell_line motivation protein signaling_networks play_a in cellular function and their dysregulation is central to many diseases including cancer to shed light on signaling network_topology in specific_contexts such as cancer requires interrogation of multiple proteins through time and statistical_approaches to make inferences regarding network_structure results in this study we use dynamic_bayesian to make inferences regarding network_structure and thereby generate testable_hypotheses we incorporate existing biology using informative network priors weighted objectively by an empirical_bayes approach and exploit a connection between variable_selection and network_inference to enable exact calculation of posterior_probabilities of interest the approach is computationally_efficient and essentially_free of user set tuning parameters results on data where the true underlying_network is known place the approach favorably relative to existing_approaches we apply these methods to reverse_phase time course data from a breast_cancer to predict signaling links that we independently validate using targeted_inhibition the methods proposed offer a general approach by which to elucidate molecular_networks specific to biological_context including but not limited to human_cancers availability http mukherjeelab nki nl dbn code and data protein signaling plays_a in diverse_cellular and aberrations in signaling are implicated in almost every aspect of cancer_biology indeed an emerging literature suggests that signaling_networks may be rewired in specific_contexts including cancer that is the network may differ in a cancer cell compared with a normal cell for example due to genetic_alterations yet the manner in which genomic_alterations in specific cancers are manifested at the level of signaling_networks is not currently well understood elucidating signaling_networks in a data_driven manner specific to a context of interest such as a cell_line or tissue type requires the ability to probe post_translational states in multiple proteins through time and across samples however proteomic analyses on this scale remain challenging at the same time the modeling of signaling connectivity poses statistical challenges noise both intrinsic and experimental is ubiquitous in this setting and network_components may interact in a complex non linear manner candidate networks may differ with respect to model dimension which in turn means that analyses that do not account for this run the risk of preferring networks that are over complex yet not predictive this makes the trade_off between fit to data and model parsimony a crucial one in network modeling in this article we present a data_driven approach to the characterization of context specific signaling_networks we exploit reverse_phase technology to interrogate dynamic signaling_responses in a defined set of phospho proteins we use directed graphical_models known as dynamic_bayesian dbns to probabilistically describe relationships between variables dbns have previously been applied to gene_expression data for inference of gene_regulatory but to the best of our knowledge have not been applied to inference of protein signaling_networks static bayesian_networks bns have previously been employed to infer both protein signaling_networks and gene_regulatory but unlike dbns do not incorporate an explicit time element we perform inference regarding network_topology within a bayesian_framework with existing signaling biology incorporated through an informative prior_distribution on networks following mukherjee and speed see model averaging over network_structures is to whom correspondence should be addressed used to score network_features highlighting those links that are common to many relatively high_scoring topologies the calculations required for model averaging are performed exactly this is done by exploiting a connection between variable_selection and network_inference echoing work in undirected graphical_models an empirical_bayes approach is used to objectively weight the contribution of the prior relative to proteomic_data this is related to the approach proposed byin which full bayesian_inference for the prior weighting is performed using markov_chain mcmc we perform a simpler maximum marginal likelihood empirical_bayes analysis but do so within an exact framework that is computationally fast at the moderate data dimensions that are typical of phospho proteomic_data we follow recent work in using a continuous formulation thereby avoiding lossy thresholding of data we use a variant of the bayesian prior known as the g prior to obtain a closed form score marginal likelihood for the networks in contrast to the widely used bge score this gives an analysis that is essentially_free of user set parameters and invariant to data rescaling further we permit interactions between parents through product terms a number of authors including sachs et_al and have used statistical_approaches to explore signaling network_topology this article is in this vein however we note that statistical network_inference approaches typically use linear_models that are a coarse approximation to the underlying chemical kinetics when network_topology is known ordinary_differential odes offer a powerful framework for modeling signaling our work complements ode based_approaches by providing a tractable way to explore large spaces of candidate network_topologies in a data_driven manner in principle statistical network_inference can be explicitly based on biochemically plausible ode_models however due to severe computational constraints such approaches are currently limited to investigating only a handful of hypothesized networks and not the large number of possible networks considered here a recent study also proposes a method for inference of cancer signaling_networks from reverse_phase time series data after external perturbation of network_components this work is similar in spirit but differs methodologically in that it uses dbns bayesian_model averaging and network priors to incorporate existing biological_knowledge thus we combine protein array technology with dynamic network_inference to shed light on signaling_networks in samples of interest we apply these approaches to the breast_cancer mda_mb is an adenocarcinoma originally from a year_old patient belonging to the well characterized basal breast_cancer subtype the line is egfr amplified and pten rb smad and p mutant we learn a network model that is specific to this line focusing on an individual cell_line allows us to generate hypotheses that are coupled to a specific well defined genomic_context and are readily testable we predict a number of known and unexpected signaling links which we validate using independent inhibition experiments
