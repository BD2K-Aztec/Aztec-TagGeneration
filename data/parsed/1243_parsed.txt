genome_analysis d m detection of differential distributions of methylation_levels motivation dna_methylation is an important epigenetic_modification related to a variety of diseases including cancers we focus on the methylation data from illuminas infinium_humanmethylation one of the key_issues of methylation analysis is to detect the differential methylation_sites between case and control_groups previous_approaches describe data with simple summary_statistics or kernel_function and then use statistical_tests to determine the difference however a summary_statistics based_approach cannot capture complicated underlying_structure and a kernel_function based_approach lacks interpretability of results results we propose a novel method d m for detection of differential distribution of methylation based on distribution valued data our method can detect the differences in high order moments such as shapes of underlying distributions in methylation profiles based on the wasserstein metric we test the significance of the difference between case and control_groups and provide an in terpretable summary of the results the simulation_results show that the proposed_method promising accuracy and shows favorable results compared with previous methods glioblastoma_multiforme and lower grade glioma data from the cancer_genome show that our method supports recent biological advances and suggests new insights dna_methylation is an epigenetic chemical alternation in which a methyl_group is attached to a carbon of a cytosine c base it is closely_related to gene_expression silencing and genomic_imprinting including oncogenesis typically methylation is explained as occurring in cytosine phosphate guanine cpg_sites in mammals the methylation of promoter_regions in particular silences cancer suppressor genes we focus on the methylation data from illuminas infinium_humanmethylation one of the key_issues for methylation analysis is to detect differentially_methylated sites i e a significant_difference in methylation_levels between the case and the control_groups at a site when comparing groups we often summarize or aggregate data in summary_statistics such as mean and variance and then investigate the difference between the groups for example ima detects the differentially_methylated sites by t test empirical_bayes eb method or by mannwhitneywilcox mww test diffvar detects the sites by testing significant_difference of variance other nonparametric approaches exist such as the kolmogorovsmirnov test ks or in particular since ks and mmd consider the underlying distribution structure they are better suited for use with complicated distributions than methods based on summary_statistics these approaches are insufficient from some perspectives underlying distributions are complicated by being skewed heavy tailed and multimodal in particular since cancer_cells include heterogeneities measurements of the methylation_levels potentially include complex distribution shapes this observation indicates that we need to consider the underlying_structure the disadvantage of ks and mmd is infeasible interpretability of results because they measure the maximum and kernel distances of distributions respectively which are difficult_to corresponding to the actual difference of underlying distributions we develop a method to detect differential methylation_sites with distribution valued data distribution valued data are an example of symbolic data analysis this framework can treat complex data such as functional tree set interval and histogram values the proposed method describes case and control_groups using distribution values we measure the differences between distributions using the wasserstein metric we detect the differential methylation_sites using a statistical_test of significant differences of distribution functions here we summarize the advantages_and of d m diffvar as well as mmd these methods are designed for detecting differential methylation_levels focusing on cancer heterogeneity which is caused by epigenetic instability and diversity cancer heterogeneity can often be confused with outliers for example diffvar fails to detect simulation case as differential_methylation even though we set the variance but not the mean and the shapes to be the same for the two groups this is because diffvar deals with minority distributions as outliers and evaluates only those in the majority in general the significance of an outlier depends on the context of analysis when an outlier arises from measurement_error not relevant to signals of interest we must remove them prior to analysis in contrast when an outlier arises from an unusual event including new findings that we seek we use them for further analysis in this case cancer heterogeneity could be regarded as an abnormal event compared with normal cases and thus must be included in the analysis mmd was originally developed as a distribution free two sample test based on a kernel both the wasserstein metric and mmd are family of integral probability metrics designed to capture not only such basic difference as those between the means but also such higher_order differences as those between the distribution shapes of the groups from the simulation in section we see that mmd shows good detection performance in cases except cases and d m shows good performance over all eight cases specifically d m shows excellent_performance in cases and in the study of sample_size effect in section s using the same simulation_model as in section the result indicates that the superiority of d m to other methods are reduced compared to large sample case although all the methods decrease in power supplementaryd m can be flexibly applied to differential_methylation problems simulation_results indicate that d m can detect not only shape_differences but also summary_statistics differences as effectively as eb and diffvar i e natural results from the decomposition this suggests that if we cannot obtain sufficient power using a simple summary_statistics approach we have other options to add shape_information if we would like to simultaneously check the results of variance and shape_differences we remove the mean from the data using x ex in each group at a site before applying d m this option is provided with r package d m in the function d m d m the logical parameters of rm mean and rm var exists if we would like to see the variance and shape_differences at the same time we just set the rm mean t and rm var f the statistical_test of d m relies on resampling and requires computational time to calculate p values however we could reduce the resampling time using a semi_parametric approach a current limitation of d m is that it deals with univariate distributions in a case of the study of large_sample we can deal with covariates such as age_and but our method currently does not incorporate them into the model and the user needs to remove the effects of covariates for example using residuals with regression_analysis prior to the analysis the extension of d m to multivariate distribution relies on the estimation of the wasserstein metric between the empirical multivariate distributions the approximation of the wasserstein metric between the multivariate distributions has been studied recently in and we could derive the null distributions based on that approximation d m does not support a spatial_correlation of methylation_levels within the cpg_island in the current form the spatial_information will enhance the power of detection for differential methylated sites this could be accomplished by spatially weighted_average of wasserstein distance over a fixed range of locus these extensions of d m will be covered in a future study in this study we proposed a novel method d m for detecting differential methylation_sites based on distribution valued data we showed that distribution shape includes interesting information other than that found using mean and variance based_methods a simulation_study indicated that d m is capable to detect various situations in the application to the gbm and lgg dataset in the tcga cohort we identified sites with the smallest q values most of the sites detected by d m show strong heterogeneity and tend to be hyper and hypo methylated in lgg and gbm respectively as found in previous_studies since the gbm and lgg dataset contains a large number of significantly different sites including and sites for eb diffvar ks and d m respectively at the fdr it is difficult to understand the methylation_levels at these sites in the future it would be of interest to develop a method that describes the diversity of methylation_levels
