gene_expression comparison of global tests for functional gene_sets in two group designs and selection of potentially effect causing genes motivation an important object in the analysis of high_throughput is to find an association between the expression_profile of functional gene_sets and the different levels of a group response instead of multiple testing procedures which focus on single genes global tests are usually used to detect a group effect in an entire gene_set in a simulation_study we compare the power and computation times of four different approaches for global testing the applicability of one of these methods to gene_expression data is demonstrated for the first time in addition we propose an algorithm for the detection of those genes which might be responsible for a group effect results we could detect that the power of three of the approaches is comparable in many settings but considerable_differences were detected in the computation times our proposed gene selection_algorithm was able to detect potentially effect causing genes in artificial sets with high power when many genes were altered with a small effect while classical multiple testing was more powerful when few genes were altered with a large effect availability an r package called repeatedhighdim which implements our new global test procedures is made available from http cran ra typical problem in genomic analysis is the comparison of gene_expression levels recorded by dna_microarrays in two distinct groups of patients for example therapy responders or non responders usually the comparison comprises the search for differentially_expressed by means of multiple_hypothesis potentially resulting in a list of significant genes multiple testing procedures conduct a statistical_test for each single gene and adjust the resulting p values for a desired error_rate e g the false_discovery to avoid too much false_positives the biological or medical interpretation of the resulting list of differentially_expressed is however a difficult and tedious task furthermore expression changes in single genes could easily be missed for example due to small_sample and limited_power of the analysis therefore it can be beneficial to whom correspondence should be addressed to search directly for significant group effects in gene_sets e g differential pathways or functional_groups gene_sets defined by signaling_pathways e g cell_proliferation or apoptosis or other certain functional_groups e g transcription_factors tyrosine_kinase are often in the special focus of disease research this allows for a direct association between the particular gene_set and the levels of the group response this will not only make the biological_interpretation of the data easier but also reduce the multiplicity problem to a more overseeable number of gene groups to test further a global group effect might also become detectable via a group test when many genes within a group are just slightly differential but none of them is significant in an individual gene test by itself many approaches for gene_set exist in principle they can be grouped in two different categories i approaches that perform the individual significance_test for each gene first and then test for enriched_gene based on either a cutoff or on the gene_order approaches that perform a global test for each gene_set directly in principle these different categories test completely different null_hypotheses and are appropriate for different biological_questions a more detailed categorization and discussions about the utility of these approaches can be found inand in here we will focus on the latter global test approaches in particular the purpose of this article is first to compare different global test methods for functional gene_sets in two group designs and secondly to provide a method for detecting those genes of a functional set which might be responsible for a detected group effect a first suggestion for global testing in microarray_experiments was given bywho use a permutation based_approach in order to deal with the high_dimensionality of gene_expression data developed a global test globaltest using a logistic regression_approach where the dichotomous response y represents two clinical or biological groups and genes are the predictors they study thus the hypothesis that the phenotype is independent from the gene_expression x d is the matrix of normalized gene_expression levels with d genes and n samples the test_statistic of this method employs the low_dimensional nn covariance_matrix between samples instead of the large d d covariance_matrix between the genes thus the method avoids long computation times and does not require a large working space under the null_hypothesis the test_statistic has asymptotically a normal distribution however for small_sample a permutation_test is provided and recommended proposed a test that is based on the distribution of gene wise test_statistics at first the two sample t test is performed per gene and than either the one sample t test or the one sample wilcoxon_test is applied on the set of gene wise test_statistics the idea of this procedure is that the distribution of the test_statistics is biased under a global group effect and that this bias is detected by the one sample tests the authors called their procedure test of test_statistics tots further an ancova model for global testing globalancova was proposed by mansmann and meister and was extended by in this ancova model the null_hypothesis is tested that the gene_expression is independent of the group level i e h p p in this method the high_dimensionality is handled by assembling the residual sums of squares rss of gene wise models to the rss of a global model the combined rss are used in the test_statistic which has asymptotically a distribution under h like globeltest globalancova provides a permutation_test for small_sample finally brunner presented a test for group effects in highdimensional repeated_measures data where the repeated_measures factor is allowed to have more levels than the number of available samples this approach allows the covariance_matrices to be of an arbitrary structure here we demonstrate for the first time the applicability of this approach in the setting of global tests for gene_sets by regarding the genes as the levels of the repeated_measures factor since this test is still unnamed we call it repeatedhighdim the test of brunner does not use a permutation algorithm to assess the correlation between genes instead the correlation information is incorporated using the representation theorem of a quadratic form and boxs approximation thus it is likewise not necessary to estimate the large covariance_matrix between genes this new approach is further detailed in the section we compare the attained significance_levels the power and computation times of globaltest tots globalancova and repeatedhighdim in simulation_studies considering different settings of covariance_matrices sample_sizes and dimensions as described by after global testing it can be important to step downwards to the level of individual_features therefore we additionally propose a procedure for detecting the relevant_genes of a potential group effect lists of genes detected with this procedure are compared with lists resulting from of a classical procedure of multiple_hypothesis furthermore we apply the three tests to a functional gene_set of genes associated with cell_proliferation the samples were taken from normal and tumor_tissues of patients with colorectal_cancer we have compared the attained level the power and computation times of four different test procedures for global group comparisons in microarray_experiments in the case of functional gene_sets noticeable differences in the attained level and power were especially observed when the asymptotic results of globalancova and globaltest were compared to repeatedhighdim within this setting globaltest becomes sometimes too conservative and globalancova too liberal whereas repeatedhighdim maintains the preassigned significance_level accurately the permutation results of globalancova and globaltest maintained the preassigned level very well too the tots approach clearly exceeded the prespecified significance_level in all simulation_settings here we showed only the results of tots when applying the one sample t test on the set of test_statistics however the simulated levels were very similar when using the one sample wilcoxon_test we have additionally studied some situations with non normally distributed data and found that the repeatedhighdim procedure is quite robust against deviations from the normal distribution i e with regard to maintenance of the preassigned significance_level see_supplementary accordingly to the level simulations the power was largest for the asymptotic result of globalancova and smallest for the asymptotic result of globaltest when using their permutation results the power curves of these two methods nearly approached that of repeatedhighdim differences in power were also observed for the different types of covariance_matrices but neither for different numbers d of genes nor for the different numbers of samples sizes the analysis of computation times of the latter three methods yielded that repeatedhighdim is much faster than the permutation or asymptotic tests performed with globalancova and globaltest this plays a particular role in the proposed detection algorithm where a global test is carried_out up to d times under this regard and with the results of section one can conclude that the selection_algorithm takes about min in combination with repeatedhighdim and several more minutes in combination with the two other global test approaches depending on the size d of the gene_set the asymptotic result of globaltest is also obtained very fast but has the drawback of a rather low power therefore repeatedhighdim is preferable for being combined with the proposed algorithm this speed comparison is of course only based on the available software there may be faster implementations possible for each method in principle the introduced algorithm for the detection of effectcausing genes can be applied with all three testing approaches although the average_power rate of this new algorithm sometimes outperforms that of classical multiple testing it has the drawback of too high fdr levels in these cases we therefore intent to work further on the improvement of this algorithm with regard to the power rate of our selection_algorithm one can further argue that researchers perhaps tend to take adjusted p values for the classical multiple testing approach from the whole dataset and not just from the functional set in that case our algorithm would even have a larger power rate in other situations than in those observed in our simulations an alternative idea was given by srivastava and kubokawa who use akaikes information criterion to select components of the mean vector in high_dimensional in this article we have shown the applicability of the approach proposed byto microarray_data in the two group setting globalancova and globaltest provide also the possibility to test other experimental factors in general study_designs with more than one group factor on two levels can also be tested with repeatedhighdim by constructing an appropriate contrast matrix h while in this article we focused on the comparison of the new models bywith three of the most popular global test methods a certain number of other global test approaches exists which were not included to our simulations for example proposed the sam gs method which was also compared to globalancova and globaltest bywith similar results for the latter two approaches than ours another approach based on hotellings t statistic was proposed by
