structural_bioinformatics petcofold predicting conserved interactions and structures of two multiple_alignments of rna_sequences motivation predicting rnarna_interactions is essential for determining the function of putative non_coding existing_methods for the prediction of interactions are all based on single sequences since comparative_methods have already been useful in rna structure_determination we assume that conserved rnarna_interactions also imply conserved function of these we further assume that a non negligible amount of the existing rnarna_interactions have also acquired compensating base changes throughout evolution we implement a method petcofold that can take covariance information in intra_molecular and inter molecular base_pairs into account to predict interactions and secondary_structures of two multiple_alignments of rna_sequences results petcofolds ability to predict rnarna_interactions was evaluated on a carefully curated dataset of bacterial small_rnas and their targets which was manually extracted from the literature for evaluation of both rnarna_interaction and structure_prediction we were able to extract only a few high_quality examples one vertebrate small_nucleolar and four bacterial small_rnas for these we show that the prediction can be improved by our comparative_approach furthermore petcofold was evaluated on controlled data with phylogenetically simulated sequences enriched for covariance patterns at the interaction sites we observed increased performance with increased amounts of covariance availability the program petcofold is available as source_code and can be downloaded from http rth dk resources petcofold contact non_coding ncrnas are receiving rapidly_growing attention they are present in large_numbers as observed by the encode_project consortium and the fantom project and they appear in many unexpected cases e g the potential of functional ncrnas is further supported by the observation that the amount of nonprotein coding_dna increases with organismal complexity whereas the amount of protein coding_dna is relatively constant a substantial number of putative ncrnas has emerged from several genomic in silico screens for rna_structure taking compensatory base_pair changes into account deep sequencing_approaches are another growing source of ncrnas e g one step towards assigning functions to these putative ncrnas is to consider rna interactions an important class of these are rnarna_interactions many ncrnas base_pair with other rnas such as the majority of characterized bacterial small_regulatory srnas besides the well known examples of micrornas mirnas and small_interfering sirnas there are also many longer eukaryotic ncrnas that act via rnarna_interaction examples are small_nucleolar snornas of which the main function is to guide the editing of ribosomal_rna however there is growing evidence that other long ncrnas might act via base_pair interactions as well for example it is likely that certain long ncrnas modulate the activity of mirnas by forming rnarna_interactions even though most screens for ncrna candidates involve mammalian_genomes we predominantly found with the exception of a few snorna examples bacterial examples of verified rnarna_interactions involving the structure of both rnas this pattern might be the reason that many of the existing_methods for the prediction of rnarna_interactions have been designed to work on bacterial srnashere we presented petcofold the first comparative method for the prediction of a joint secondary_structure of two interacting rnas the method identifies evolutionary_conserved structures and can exploit the information from compensating base changes in the intra molecular_structures of the two rnas and the interactions between them furthermore petcofold allows for the prediction of pseudoknots between intra_and molecular base_pairs we have shown in controlled runs on simulated_data that the covariance information improves the prediction ability for rnarna_interactions we have also shown both for a vertebrate snorna and for four bacterial srnas that the addition of evolutionary_information from multiple_sequence improves the performance in comparison to methods based on single sequences this implies that single_sequence based_methods could perform better if the comparative information is also taken into account as for other rna_structure prediction_methods making use of sequence_based alignments it is well documented that these work best with an average pairwise sequence_identity above in the process of cleaning up the already sparse bacterial data we took this into account by removing more distant sequences to keep the balance of accurate assignment and covariance patterns of base_pairs many genomic screens for ncrnas predict secondary_structures with compensatory base_pair changes on rna alignments these intra molecular_structures can be used as input of step of the petcofold pipeline to identify highly_reliable substructures which are then constrained for step for example petcofold could be applied to predict rnarna_interactions on the cmfindergenerated structure based alignments of de_novo predicted rna motifs in the encode regions the sparse amount of known examples of sequences with rnarna_interactions and the paucity of covariations were the reasons why we introduced simulated_data some of the known examples of rnarna_interactions e g from bacterial srna mrna and eukaryotic mirnamrna interactions tend to be rather conserved even in cases with little or no compensating base_pairs in interaction sites or in the intra molecular_structure any given variation will collectively contribute to the calculation of the reliabilities and thereby to the overall structure of the interaction complex hence in the complete lack of covariation petcofold reduces to an improved energy folding approach which also has impact on matching up the interacting base_pairs the srna mrna interactions studied here exhibit only a small number of compensatory base_pair changes which might be because srna sequences often show poor conservation across distant bacterial_species thus the regulators might be recently acquired and rapidly_evolving nevertheless many of the homologous ncrnas and mrnas have been found based on sequence_similarity which leads to highly identical_sequences and thereby also to highly_conserved interactions petcofold considers sequence_conservation but its full power is only revealed when the input_data contains structural covariance in the future we expect that deep sequencing_approaches will give rise to many more page
