genetics_and seqsimla exact simulate multiple disease sites in large_pedigrees with given disease status for diseases with low prevalence it is difficult for current simulation tools to simulate sequence_data in a pre specified pedigree structure and pre specified affection status previously we developed a flexible tool seqsimla for simulating sequence_data in either unrelated case control or family samples with different disease and quantitative_trait models here we extended the tool to efficiently simulate sequences with multiple disease sites in large_pedigrees with a given disease status for each pedigree member assuming that the disease_prevalence is low availability_and seqsimla exact is implemented with c and is available atfamily studies based on next_generation ngs have become important in complex disease studies because a sufficient number of rare alleles that co segregate with the disease can be observed in pedigrees to evaluate the statistical_power for family based disease studies using ngs it is necessary to simulate sequencing_data in a given family_structure with disease status moreover as multiple_variants can contribute to the disease it is crucial to simulate the joint effects of multiple_variants on the disease we searched the genetic simulation resources website which provides a comprehensive catalog of simulation tools for genetics studies and identified four tools forsim nemo simupop and seqsimla that can simulate sequence_data in families with affection status forsim nemo and simupop use forward time algorithms which dynamically determine pedigree structures during the simulation therefore it may not be easy to obtain pre specified pedigree structures from the simulation_results seqsimla uses a genedropping algorithm to easily simulate pedigrees with pre specified structures however it is very time consuming for the genedropping algorithm to simulate exactly the same affection status as the pre specified status for every family_member particularly in large_pedigrees and diseases with low prevalence another simulation tool simrare which shares some properties with seqsimla can simulate multiple disease_loci in sequence_data however simrare only simulates unrelated case control data in order to efficiently simulate genotypes conditional on the family_structure and disease status a retrospective likelihood which is the probability of observing genotypes in each family_member given the disease status needs to be calculated however calculating the retrospective likelihood is typically based on computationally_intensive algorithms such as elstonstewart and markov_chain mcmc algorithms for example tools such as fastslink sup simwalk and morgan have implemented or extended one of the aforementioned algorithms for simulating genotypes given the trait data due to the computational_complexity these tools can simulate only one disease_locus moreover although multiple_markers not associated with the disease_locus can be simulated simwalk and morgan assumehere we extended seqsimla to seqsimla exact for simulating sequence_data given the pedigree structures and disease status for all family_members when the disease_prevalence is low we show that the retrospective probability can be efficiently approximated without using computationally_intensive algorithms an efficient algorithm to simulate sequence_data given the family_structure and affection status for every family_member was developed and implemented our simulation_results suggested that the tool properly simulated multiple disease variants with the desired odds_ratios when the disease_prevalence was less than which is the case for many complex_diseases such as schizophrenia autism and age_related that have prevalences of and in caucasians respectively as shown_inand the run time for seqsimla exact increased exponentially with either the number of disease_loci or the number of recombination_hotspots this can be attributed to calculating the probabilities in eqs and which requires enumeration of all possible haplotypes for individuals who have not been simulated under all possible recombination patterns and the number of possible haplotypes and the number of recombination patterns increase exponentially with the number of disease sites and recombination_hotspots respectively however these calculations are only required in the first batch of the simulations the results can subsequently be saved in memory and used in the following batches of simulations in our simulations a logistic penetrance function was used to simulate multiple independent disease_loci with additive_effects on the disease however different disease_models can also be simulated using seqsimla exact a penetrance table with penetrance functions for all possible combinations of genotypes at the disease sites can be provided to seqsimla exact these penetrance functions can be specified based on any type of disease model including the incorporation of interacting loci moreover different directions of effects of the disease_loci can be simulated using the logistic penetrance function or the penetrance table for example specifying positive_and values for the log odds_ratios in the logistic penetrance function can simulate the risk and protective_effects of the disease_loci respectively at present seqsimla exact assumes that the affection statuses for all family_members are given to account for missing phenotypes the probability in eq can be extended to ph x u jx c where x u is a vector of the affection statuses of individuals whose affection statuses were not given we hope to implement this function in seqsimla exact in the near future in conclusion seqsimla exact will be useful to simulate sequence_data with multiple disease sites in large_pedigrees when the disease_prevalence is low seqsimla exact is implemented in seqsimla with the exact option which is available from http seqsimla sourceforge net persons haplotypes such as h i each term in eq a except the last term can be written as
