a probabilistic_model of nuclear_import of proteins motivation nucleo cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins is a core regulatory_process that sustains the integrity of the nuclear space of eukaryotic_cells via an interplay between numerous factors despite progress on experimentally characterizing a number of nuclear_localization their presence alone remains an unreliable indicator of actual translocation results this article introduces a probabilistic_model that explicitly recognizes a variety of nuclear_localization and integrates relevant amino_acid and interaction data for any candidate nuclear protein in particular we develop and incorporate scoring_functions based on distinct classes of classical nuclear_localization our empirical results show that the model accurately_predicts whether a protein is imported into the nucleus surpassing the classification_accuracy of similar predictors when evaluated on the mouse and yeast proteomes area under the receiver_operator of and respectively the model also predicts the sequence position of a nuclear_localization and whether it interacts with importin nucleo cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins is a core regulatory_process that involves traversing large membrane_structures termed nuclear_pore npcs the translocation of cargo macromolecules through the pore is facilitated by a number of nuclear_transport factors termed karyopherins to shed light on the mechanisms that are employed by individual nuclear_proteins this article proposes a probabilistic_model of nuclear_import that leverages recent_experimental to accurately and transparently recognize biologically relevant_features the main determinant of nuclear_localization of proteins is the nuclear_localization nls the best characterized nls is the classical nuclear_localization cnls which is recognized to whom correspondence should be addressed by the carrier protein importin karyopherin importin acts as an adaptor_protein binding in turn to importin karyopherin which docks the trimeric complex to the nuclear_pore for further transport into the nucleus the cnls contains one mono partite or two bi partite clusters of basic amino_acids structural studies have shown that peptides bind along a groove in importin with charged amino_acids at minor and major binding_sites along this groove a recent study subdivided cnlss further into six groups in addition to the classical nuclear_import pathway several alternative import pathways have been characterized features of the targeting signal have been identified in the case of the proline tyrosine py nls pathway which employs the carrier karyopherin at present the definition of an nls common to different cargoes used by a single carrier has only been possible for the classical and karyopherin mediated_pathways many nuclear_proteins do not contain any known nls many predictors identify homologs of a query_protein and assign their subcellular_location to it without explicitly considering if a localization signal is present as a consequence such predictors fail to provide both mechanistic explanations of predicted translocation and reliable output in the absence of well characterized homologs predicting which proteins are imported on the basis of targeting signals without resorting to homology is a major_challenge simple sequence_matching using known nls patterns renders many false positives_and to explain why import sometimes goes awry in biological terms we require models that transparently capture and appropriately weigh in relevant aspects of nuclear_import e g interaction with karyopherins and cnls recognition a number of predictors are available to identify novel nuclear_proteins from known localization features against which new models should be benchmarked for reasons explained below we use nlstradamus and cnls mapper as representatives for the current state of the art on technical and biological grounds respectively predictnls explicitly matches a protein_sequence against entries in the nlsdb database nucpred also uses sequence_matching complemented by genetic_programming to recognize new putative nlss according to its authors nucpred is more accurate than predictnls loctree and bacello evaluated the performance of localization signal predictors finding that they do not perform well on truly novel examples which suggests that current methods are unable to identify the features relevant to import they developed nlstradamus in response to this observation nlstradamus is a hidden_markov that predicts localization signal sites more accurately than those benchmarked against in their study its high_accuracy is potentially due to the flexibility in signal recognition afforded by the probabilistic_model it is trained on alignments of yeast nlss but extends well to other species generated and experimentally screened random peptide_libraries to identify importin binding sequences using yeast plant rice and mammalian human importin proteins six different groups of mono and bi partite cnlss were identified by cluster_analyses of the sequences of the bound and imported peptides the authors developed a computational_method cnls mapper that incorporates a sequence scoring_matrix based directly on the statistics gathered from the collected peptides cnls mapper is more accurate than psort ii and predictnls on several yeast positive only datasets cnls mapper identified mono partite and bi partite cnlss in the yeast proteome the yeastgfp fusion localization database byidentifies of these as nuclear yeastgfp records nuclear_import status confirmed by microscopy for yeast_strains tagged_with gfp experimentally demonstrated that out of false monopartite positives indeed exhibited nls activity attesting to the high_specificity of their predictor nlss appear to operate similarly across species indeed only one group in kosugi and colleagues study was deemed specific to a single species rice it is thus of general interest to gauge the ability of nuclear_import models to deal with not only yeast but also a mammalian system we note that nucprot offers a complementary resource for developing and evaluating models of nuclear_import nucprot maps the mouse nuclear proteome identified primarily from experimental assays enriched using computational_methods to enhance a models ability to recognize species specific_targeting signals in sequence_data we develop probabilistic scoring_functions from experimentally_determined sequence_patterns matched to actual sequences from the proteome under consideration as a result these functions accurately_reflect the proteome specific distributions we use data from the studies byto develop and evaluate our model protein interaction data offer a complementary view of how cargoes interface with the import machinery thus to improve further on their recognition we extract data indicating interaction with importin and the gtp_binding ranall of which are essential for the translocation of proteins through the npc finally to increase the sensitivity to non classical import signals we incorporate matching of all patterns stored in nlsdb we also use a support_vector svm to detect more subtle sequence_similarities we develop a model that recognizes nlss links interactions to localization signals and incorporates sequence_similarity we demonstrate that the model_predicts the protein_import into the nucleus more accurately than both nlstradamus and cnls mapper it identifies interactions with core npc members and correctly identifies cnlss for novel proteins in both mouse and yeast our probabilistic_model is transparent and provides biologically_meaningful explanations for predictions we present a model that incorporates three different types of features to predict nuclear_localization and responsible localization signals and interactions the model_predicts whether a protein is imported into the nucleus with an accuracy surpassing that of comparable predictors on the mouse and yeast proteomes the mcc is and for mouse and yeast respectively and the auc is and to understand the importance of explicitly recognizing nlss for nuclear_import prediction we compare our approach with localization predictors that do not incorporate such features directly nucleo has previously been shown to outperform six different predictors in terms of classifying import status of proteins and falls predominately into this category by re using the independent dataset developed for evaluating nucleo we are able to show that our bayesian_network model outperforms the other predictors mcc is on the species combined data with nucleo as a clear second the explicit recognition of nls is thus not critical for predicting import accuratelyat least when limited to the dominant but far from exclusive classical nlss by testing our model on a dataset with low sequence redundancy we show that the generalization performance of our model is not the simple result of matching homology a key benefit of our model in relation to most models including nucleo is that it transparently indicates the influence of relevant_variables thereby it allows biologists to dissect predictions to find which features are responsible for importing each individual protein we illustrate this principle by also using the model to predict the most probable cnls for the mouse and yeast nuclear proteomes we establish on a smaller dataset that the model accurately recognizes nlss and interactions with the import machinery we verify that the predicted nlss match and of known independent yeast and mouse nlss respectively additionally by hiding functional nlss from the model and observing a significant decrease in support we confirm that the model is sensitive to this biologically essential_feature our bayesian_network based model can thus enable biologists to identify the nuclear_localization responsible for binding with karyopherins by integrating proteinprotein_interaction data biologists are able to tap into an emerging data source it is clear from our tests that interaction data contributes to prediction_accuracy in the absence of reliable interaction data the model is flexible enough to operate with these variables unspecified and to predict several novel importin interactors we validate our top predictions using the literature and argue that the model assists in identifying novel importin interactions anecdotal_evidence offers additional support for of our top importin interaction predictions considering the sparsity of training and test interaction data we find the accuracy of predicting importin interactions encouraging auc is and for mouse and yeast respectively the current model is easy to extend with recently_discovered localization signals for example the py nls cross_referenced with the appropriate data we believe that predicted nlss can be used to further characterize proteome specific nlss both structurally and functionally
