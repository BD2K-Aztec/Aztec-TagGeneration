genome_analysis snostrip a snorna annotation_pipeline motivation although small_nucleolar form an important class of non_coding no comprehensive annotation efforts have been undertaken presumably because the task is complicated by both the large number of distinct small_nucleolar families and their relatively rapid pace of sequence_evolution results with snostrip we present an automatic annotation_pipeline developed specifically for comparative_genomics of small_nucleolar it makes use of sequence_conservation canonical box motifs as well as secondary_structure and predicts putative targets availability_and the snostrip web_service and the download version is available atsmall nucleolar rnas snornas are one of the most abundant and evolutionarily ancient groups of functional non_coding ncrna dating back at least billion years to the last common_ancestor of archaea and eukarya they fulfill an impressive variety of cellular_functions ranging from specifying the locations of chemical_modifications in several ncrna classes and nucleolytic processing of rrnas to the synthesis of telomeric_dna and an involvement in genomic_imprinting and alternative_splicing reviewed e g by they broadly fall into two classes distinguished by secondary_structure and characteristic sequence boxes after which they are named box c d and box h aca snornas a variety of computational_tools has been devised to identify snornas de_novo in searches of genomic_dna see e g homologous snornas are often hard to find because of their small_size poor sequence_conservation andin the case of box c d snornaslack of a conserved secondary_structure so_far no specific tool for homology_based snorna search has been devised at the same time the rfam database covers only a subset of the known snornas and many of the seed alignments contain only few independent sequences of the snorna alignments contain sequences available snorna databases on the other hand mainly focus on single organisms e g snornalbme db on human and the umass database on yeast lacking overall sequence_conservation and structural_elements combined with characteristic sequence_motifs makes it hard to detect snornas by means of sequence_homology i e ncbi_blast only
