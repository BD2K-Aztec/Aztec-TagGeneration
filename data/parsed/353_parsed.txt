genetics_and an integrated approach to reduce the impact of minor_allele and linkage_disequilibrium on variable_importance measures for genome_wide data motivation there is growing momentum to develop statistical_learning sl methods as an alternative to conventional genome_wide gwas methods such as random_forests rf and gradient_boosting machine gbm result in variable_importance measures that indicate how well each single_nucleotide snp predicts the phenotype for rf it has been shown that variable_importance measures are systematically affected by minor_allele maf and linkage_disequilibrium ld to establish rf and gbm as viable_alternatives for analyzing genome_wide data it is necessary to address this potential_bias and show that sl methods do not significantly under perform conventional gwas methods results both ld and maf have a significant impact on the variable_importance measures commonly used in rf and gbm dividing snps into overlapping subsets with approximate linkage equilibrium and applying sl methods to each subset successfully reduces the impact of ld a welcome side effect of this approach is a dramatic reduction in parallel_computing time increasing the feasibility of applying sl methods to large_datasets the created subsets also facilitate a potential correction for the effect of maf using pseudocovariates simulations using simulated snps embedded in empirical data assessing varying effect_sizes minor_allele and ld pat ternssuggest that the sensitivity to detect effects is often improved by subsetting and does not significantly under perform the armitage trend_test even under ideal_conditions for the trend_test genome_wide gwas have successfully detected numerous single_nucleotide snps associated with a variety of phenotypes but the identified loci at best explain a modest proportion of the heritable variance estimated by twin and family studies recent estimates of the heritable variance explained by all snps however indicate that genome_wide snp data does offer substantial explanatory_power this gap of missing_heritability between heritability_estimates and the snps detected by gwas has led to increasing concern over the performance of gwas with attention focused on low power due to the multiple testing burden and small effect_sizes as well as the omission of rare_disease alleles and epistatic_effects among other issues these shortcomings of gwas have encouraged the application of statistical_learning sl methods as an alternative for analyzing genome_wide data sl methods are designed specifically for the task of identifying meaningful predictors in high_dimensional relying on data_driven algorithms rather than conventional parametric modeling numerous sl methods have been proposed for use with snp dataincluding random_forests rf multifactor_dimensionality and the lasso generally with encouraging_results rf has received significant attention in the genetics literature with surprisingly less attention given to gradient_boosting machine gbm despite its similarity to rf both rf and gbm build an ensemble of non parametric prediction_models with each model constructed iteratively using all available snps gbm additionally applies boosting to build each model with a focus of improving model_fit for cases fit poorly in the previous iteration importantly the iterative tree building approach of rf and gbm accounts for conditional relationships and complex causal_mechanisms including epistasis and covariate_effects without a priori specification individual snps are then evaluated using variable_importance measures which quantify each snps total contribution to the prediction of the phenotype such variable_importance measures can be used to rank_order snps by importance identifying potentially informative snps among genome_wide data studies of rf with snp data have yielded promising results simulations suggest that rfs power to detect causal_snps exceeds fishers_exact when epistasis is present and is still comparable with fishers_exact when detecting main effects only to whom correspondence should be addressed rf maintains this advantage even if many noise snps are present applying rf to genome_wide data is feasible though computationally burdensome with empirical genome_wide data rf is capable of replicating gwas results and identifying additional candidate snps although these results are encouraging further study is necessary to establish rf and gbm as viable_alternatives to gwas methods few studies of sl methods account for linkage_disequilibrium ld utilize realistic effect_sizes or compare the sensitivity of the sl method to gwas considered more realistic ld and effect_sizes but only focused on rf as a second stage analysis meanwhile gbm merits further consideration based on its strong performance relative to rf studies show gbm performs even better than rf for many data types but evaluation of its performance with genome_wide snp data is still needed in addition concerns have been raised about the impact of minor_allele maf and ld on the variable_importance measures used by rf and gbm to rank_order snps with respect to ld importance scores for correlated functional snps are inflated when using variable_importance measures based on the gini criterion whereas importance scores for functional snps correlated with uninformative predictors are deflated correlated predictors do not induce bias in permutation_based importance measures though the variability of importance scores is decreased maf may also influence importance scores with higher maf being associated with higher gini importance values for all snps and higher permutation importance values for functional snps the influence of maf may be attributed at least in part to the tendency of the rf algorithm to prefer predictors with higher variability taken together such effects may increase the difficulty of detecting disease_causing located in ld blocks or with low maf especially when using gini based importance measures methods for controlling the impact of maf and ld on variable_importance have been proposed to address the effect of ld introduced a modified rf algorithm and accompanying importance measure that account for the competition between correlated snps for inclusion in rf models developed a conditional permutation scheme for the variable_importance that successfully addresses the impact of correlated predictors alternatively pseudocovariates pcvs may be added to the data to simultaneously address the effect of all structure in the data that are unrelated to the phenotype although each of these methods have been demonstrated to potentially reduce the impact of ld and maf all three increase the computational_burden beyond what is feasible for genome_wide data specifically note that their method does not scale to be feasible with genome_wide data the current_implementation of the conditional methods proposed byalso have substantially larger memory_requirements than conventional rf correction with pcvs is similarly infeasible effectively doubling the size of the data and requiring a number of replications of the analysis to establish stable estimates in sum to establish rf and gbm as viable methods for genome_wide snp data it will be necessary i to address concerns over the impact of ld and maf while maintaining computational feasibility and ii to provide a direct comparison with conventional gwas methods under realistic conditions in this study we propose and evaluate a procedure designed to reduce the impact of ld on rf gbm or related sl methods for genome_wide data the proposed method creates overlapping subsets of snps from a genome_wide dataset under the constraints that snps within a set are not in ld and that each snps is represented in at least a user specified number of subsets see methods the sl method of choice can then be performed on the subsets without concern for ld followed by an aggregation of results over subsets next we show that the proposed subsetting procedure is computationally_feasible for genomewide data dividing the data into subsets makes analysis of each piece more manageable and facilitates parallel computation across multiple cores or on a high performance grid for a drastic_reduction of computing time third we evaluate a correction for the impact of maf adapted from the methods proposed by which is computationally_feasible in combination with the subsetting procedure specifically in each subset we generate a small set of independent pcvs with zero association with the phenotype coded as snps with maf ranging from to variable_importance estimates for the pcvs in each subset are aggregated to provide a stable estimate of variable_importance attributable to maf this estimate can then be used to correct the importances of the empirical snps finally we provide a rigorous direct comparison of the sensitivity of rf and gbm to the armitage trend_test att the test utilized most frequently in conventional gwas analyses under realistic data conditions using simulated snps embedded in empirical genetic data we show that the sensitivity of rf and gbm is broadly consistent with the att for snps explaining as little as of the phenotypic_variance even under conditions that do not leverage the advantages of rf and gbm i e a linear additive_model without dominance or epistatic_effects sl methods such as rf and gbm are a viable alternative to conventional parametric testing of individual snps in a gwas however there are valid concerns over the impact of ld and maf on variable_importance measures that must be addressed in response this study presents an integrated approach to meaningfully reduce the effect of ld and maf on variable_importance in rf and gbm the results of this study show that the proposed subsetting algorithm can successfully reduce or eliminate the effect of ld on the variable_importance measures of rf and gbm the process of aggregating results over the subsets is not biased by the number of subsets containing a given snp and in many cases may aid the detection of effect snps in particular the use of ld subsetting can be expected to aid rf and gbm is identifying effect snps within ld blocks since ld subsets are constructed prior to analysis the procedure could also be applied to other sl methods importantly gbm provides detection_rates for the functional snps within sampling_variation of detection_rates for the att this result for gbm is especially encouraging given that this study uses an additive genetic model that precisely matches the type of effect anticipated by the att sl methods may be expected to provide_substantial improvement over the att for detecting correlated effect snps and snps with non additive and epistatic_effects alternatively rf and gbm may act as an initial screen to reduce genome_wide data to a set of candidate snps small enough to make thorough modeling of their complex relationships feasible using penalized_regression or other appropriate methods the ld subsetting approach also facilitates the introduction of pcvs as proposed by which may potentially be used to correct for the effect of maf on variable_importance measures the proposed pcv correction evaluated in this study provides a marked reduction in the effect of maf on non effect snps caution is necessary in applying pcvs however given a moderate effect of maf remains and the effect of maf on the importance of functional snps may be magnified with uncertain implications supplementary_information still pcvs at minimum provide the option of emphasizing sensitivity to snps with low maf which may contain the majority of heritable variance for some phenotypes such as high_density hdl_cholesterol and can be difficult to detect with conventional methods finally in addition to pcvs numerous covariates for comorbid_disorders environmental_factors and other influential variables may be included in the analysis with a much lower computational_cost than for popular gwas software a number of factors may be considered in seeking to improve the approaches evaluated by this study more careful tuning of the metaparameters for the ld subsetting algorithm including the selection of k b and t may enhance the effectiveness of the correction alternative_methods to improve the use of pcvs to correct for the effect of maf may also be explored the correction proposed here is only one possible application of pcvs other versions may improve the effectiveness of pcvs or carry different advantages tailored to the preferences of the researcher finally these results show strong results for gbm that are consistent with the more widely known rf additional work should be performed to evaluate gbm as a viable tool for analyzing genome_wide data especially given its lighter computational_burden although our approach does not fully eliminate the impact of ld and maf on variable_importance measures the proposed corrections provide a satisfying improvement importantly ld subsetting also facilitates analysis in a parallel environment improving the computational feasibility of these methods for genome_wide data continuing efforts to establish the validity reliability and feasibility of sl methods such as rf and gbm with genome_wide data will be crucial to establishing these methods as viable_alternatives to conventional gwas analyses
