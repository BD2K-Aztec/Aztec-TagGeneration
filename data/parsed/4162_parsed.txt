searching for virus phylotypes motivation large phylogenies are being built today to study virus evolution trace the origin of epidemics establish the mode of transmission and survey the appearance of drug_resistance however no tool is available to quickly inspect these phylogenies and combine them with extrinsic traits e g geographic_location risk group presence of a given resistance mutation seeking to extract strain groups of specific interest or requiring surveillance results we propose a new method for obtaining such groups which we call phylotypes from a phylogeny having taxa strains annotated with extrinsic traits phylotypes are subsets of taxa with close phylo genetic_relationships and common trait_values the method combines ancestral trait reconstruction using parsimony with combinatorial and numerical criteria measuring tree shape characteristics and the diversity and separation of the potential phylotypes a shuffling procedure is used to assess_the of phylotypes all algorithms have linear time complexity this results in low computing times typically a few minutes for the larger data_sets with a number of shuffling steps two hiv data_sets are analyzed one of which is large containing strains of hiv subtype c collected worldwide where the method shows its ability to recover known clusters and transmission_routes and to detect new ones availability this method and companion tools are implemented in an interactive web_interface www phylotype org which provides a wide choice of graphical views and output_formats and allows for exploratory_analyses of large_data phylogenetic tools are commonly used to study virus evolution trace the origin of epidemics establish the mode of transmission survey the apparition of drug resistances or determine virus origin in different body compartments the process involves the construction of phylogenetic_trees their visualization e g and their interpretation ancestral character reconstruction methods aid the interpretation as extrinsic traits and their evolution can be mapped on the tree parsimony has been one of the first approaches to reconstruct ancestral characters this method is remarkably fast does not require any model assumption and is implemented in several popular phylogenetic programs e g macclade more sophisticated model based maximum_likelihood ml and bayesian_methods were developed for reconstructing ancestral characters e g simmap these methods are generally_accepted to be more accurate than parsimony and account for various sources of uncertainty however they are time consuming with large_data and require a realistic evolutionary model to be available for the trait being considered this is not an easy step even with standard traits such as geographic_location or morphological_characters despite the number of methods available for the inference of ancestral traits there is little development for the interpretation of trait annotated phylogenies most of the programs display the reconstructed ancestral states but do not allow for tests on ancestry and taxon clustering for example macclade reconstructs ancestral characters and maps them in the phylogeny but the resulting annotated tree needs to be interpreted visually other ml and bayesian programs such as beast simultaneously reconstruct ancestral states and the phylogeny and allow for testing however because of this simultaneous reconstruction they need to be re launched entirely when new traits are analyzed which combined with their computational heaviness renders it difficult in the exploratory stages to select relevant traits for the data at hand moreover model based programs are mostly intended to specific trait types e g geographical_location lemey et_al or molecular characters with simmap finally most if not all of ml and bayesian programs are not able to deal with the huge amount of virus sequences available today with data_sets commonly comprising several thousand strains there is a need for a fast easy to use exploratory tool that can use phylogenies constructed with any of the most popular_methods while providing fast inference of ancestral traits and enabling hypothesis_testing and visual data interpretation of evolutionary_scenarios in this article we use and formally define the concept of viral phylotype commonly a phylotype is a biological type that classifies an organism by its phylogenetic to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work relationship to other organisms the term phylotype is taxon neutral thus one can choose the phylogenetic level at which the phylotype is described depending on the question being examined the term is commonly used in microbiology and several tools have been developed to infer bacteria phylotypes e g rami or to study them from an ecological perspective e g picante for analyzing the phylogenetic and trait diversity of ecological_communities here we adopt a more specific virus view combining ancestral traits with combinatorial and numerical criteria measuring tree shape characteristics and the diversity and separation of the phylotypes traits of extant and ancestral nodes are used to assess the relevance of phylotypes for the question being addressed numerical criteria are analogous to those used to define and study bacteria phylotypes this method is implemented in phylotype a_user that uses parsimony to reconstruct ancestral traits and a number of criteria to select phylotypes a shuffling procedure is used to assess the significance of this selection process the method is fast allowing for the analysis of phylogenies comprising several thousands of taxa strains in the following we describe the method and the web_interface then show its application on two data_sets dealing with the epidemiological history of hiv subtype a hiv a in albania and the global epidemic of hiv subtype c hiv c using a large data_set comprising strains collected worldwide
