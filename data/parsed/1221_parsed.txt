customizable views on semantically integrated networks for systems_biology motivation the rise of high_throughput in the post genomic era has led to the production of large_amounts of biological data many of these datasets are freely_available on the internet making optimal use of these data is a significant challenge for bioinformaticians various strategies for integrating data have been proposed to address this challenge one of the most promising approaches is the development of semantically rich integrated datasets although well suited to computational manipulation such integrated datasets are typically too large and complex for easy visualization and interactive_exploration results we have created an integrated dataset for saccharomyces_cerevisiae using the semantic data_integration tool ondex and have developed a view based visualization technique that allows for concise graphical_representations of the integrated data the technique was implemented in a plug in for cytoscape called ondexview we used ondexview to investigate telomere_maintenance in s cerevisiae availability the ondex yeast dataset and the ondexview plug in for cytoscape are accessible at http bsu ncl ac uk ondexview
