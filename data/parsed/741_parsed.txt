genome_analysis biocircos js an interactive circos javascript_library for biological data visualization on web_applications we here present biocircos js an interactive and lightweight javascript_library especially for biological data interactive_visualization biocircos js facilitates the development of web_based applications for circular visualization of various biological data such as genomic_features genetic_variations gene_expression and biomolecular_interactions availability_and biocircos js and its manual are freely_available online at http bio info ibp ac cn biocircos multi_faceted and complex biological data increasingly require visualization and sophisticated analyses however suitable visualization_tools are not always available to come readily at hand furthermore many biological visualization_tools are desktop applications that may be difficult to install and configure circos is a powerful perl based tool for illustrating genomic_features and is widely used in biological_research however the graphical files it outputs are not interactive and users can thus not obtained further details by moving a mouse pointer over the data_points alternatives to circos such as circoletto circus and rcircos are also not interactive whereas j circos though interactive is a desktop software web visualization applications have the advantage of generating interactive images in which all elements are interactive with mouse over explanations and clickable buttons and are thus far more userfriendly and provide more easily_accessible information as circos and its alternatives do not function well on web_applications an interactive circos like tool for web_applications would greatly_facilitate visualization of biological data based on the powerful d data_driven documents and the jquery javascript_library we have developed biocircos js an interactive and lightweight javascript_library especially adapted for interactive_visualization of biological data on web_applications biocircos js thus facilitates the development of web_applications for visualization of biological data in a circular format similar to that of circos the main differences between biocircos js and circos are threefold i biocircos js provides a convenient way to construct web_based applications for interactive_visualization of biological data in a circular format additionally biocircos js can generate high_quality svg vector_graphics ii biocircos js is written in web client side javascript and can thus take advantages of many web features to achieve useful interactive_effects such as binding mouse events to data_points animation effects etc which are not available to the perl based circos we consider this is the most important advantage of biocircos js iii biocircos js can be used by conjunction with standard browsers thereby circumventing a number of problems such as fixing dependencies or upgrading perl modules which is often necessary to perform when installing circos on a local computer to demonstrate the utility of biocircos js in generating circular images of biological data we attempted to reproduce published circos plots using biocircos js a study published in reported a comprehensive catalogue of somatic_mutations from a human cancer genome we obtained all necessary data from the supplementary_materials including insertions deletions substitutions copy_number loss_of loh and rearrangements and used biocircos js to reproduce the plot containing all mutations for example we reproduced substitutions using scatter modules and rearrangements using the link modules a detailed_description of data tracks can be found in shows the ability to visualize multi_faceted biological data shows how biocircos js can be used to visualize other types of biological data in this case the amino_acid of the egfr the protein_domains and snps in cds are displayed using the arc and scatter modules so that the further away an snp is located from the center the higher its mutational frequency in population drug targeted mutations and indels are also displayed in the plot all drug targeted mutations being located in the kinase_domain the mutation l r target of afatinib iressa and tarceva has a higher frequency in population andclearly demonstrates the significance of l r in drug_design to further illustrate the utility of biocircos js we have provided three additional examples in the supplementary drug targeted mutations l r and t m and mutations data from the intogen database in the cds respectively
