a co module approach for elucidating drug disease associations and revealing their molecular basis motivation understanding how drugs and diseases are associated in the molecular level is of critical importance to unveil disease mechanisms and treatments until recently few studies attempt end to discover important gene_modules shared by both drugs and diseases results here we propose a novel presentation of druggene disease relationship a co module which is characterized by closely_related drugs diseases and genes we first define a network based gene closeness profile to relate drug to disease then we develop a bayesian partition method to identify druggene disease co modules underlying the gene closeness data genes share similar notable patterns with respect not only to the drugs but also the diseases within a co module simulations show that our method comcipher achieves a better performance compared with a popular co module detection method ppa we apply comcipher to a set consisting of drugs diseases and genes and demonstrate that our co module approach is able to identify new drugdisease associations and highlight their molecular basis disease co morbidity emerges as well three co modules are further illustrated in which new drug applications including the anti cancer_metastasis activity of an anti asthma drug pranlukast and a cardiovascular stress_testing agent arbutamine for obesity as well as potential side_effects e g hypotension for triamterene are computationally identified availability the compiled version of comcipher can be found atdrugs achieve their therapeutic functions by targeting gene_products relevant to an abnormal state on the one hand drugs do not always follow a one gene one drug one disease paradigm such promiscuities result in unanticipated actions some of which may lead to serious side_effects others may induce drug new applications and therefore guide drug to whom correspondence should be addressed repositioning on the other hand complex human_diseases are often multi factor driven involving dysfunctions of dozens of genes identifying such disease_relevant gene_modules helps us decipher how an abnormal phenotype is induced and therefore in turn offers opportunities for the development of new therapies with this understanding it is of great_importance to investigate how drugs exert their activities directly_or via those gene_modules how pathophenotypes are influenced by the abnormality of gene_modules and most notably how drugs and disease_phenotypes are associated on the basis of gene_modules however few analyses address these questions together in a systematic view initiatively characterized different tumor_types by predefined gene_modules using gene_expression data however their method is largely dependent on the prior_knowledge of gene_modules and does not involve drugs connected gene_modules with human_cancers by defining a module map which was shown to guide new disease therapies demonstrated that common functional gene_modules underlie similar diseases and highlighted the therapeutic importance of those modules proposed a network based_approach to discover new drug indications by connecting disease pairs sharing therapies novel drug uses were predicted recently developed a computational_method predict to identify drug disease associations and predict new drug indications a area under the curve auc demonstrates the power of their method nevertheless few existing_studies attempt to identify gene_modules important both in drugs and diseases in current study we aim to investigate drugdisease associations and their shared gene_modules on a network basis it has been widely shown that the modularity of genes can be characterized by a tightly interconnected subnetwork of their products in the proteinprotein_interaction or the interactome network in our previous_studies we proposed a measurement termed gene closeness to describe such interconnectedness and then used it to predict drug_targets and disease genes the gene closeness is calculated according to known drugtarget diseasegene relations as well as the shortest distance in the interactome network a gene whose products is more highly interconnected in interactome network with drug_targets disease gene_products receives a higher closeness score with respect to that drug disease section here we use such a closeness index to define a gene closeness profile to relate drugs to diseases and then identify important gene_modules that both tightly interconnect with drug_targets and disease genes from this profile we selected fda_approved promiscuous drugs with multiple_targets and diseases with multiple susceptibility_genes in current study for co module analysis as we were also interested in human_cancers antineoplastic_drugs and cancers were included finally drugs and diseases from the drugbank and online_mendelian omim databases respectively were selected as our candidate set the interactome network data was an integration of five protein interaction_databases section we mapped drug_targets and disease genes onto the integrated interactome network generating drugtarget and diseasegene relations in this study we propose a novel interpretation of drugdisease relationships and seek to decipher their molecular basis by proposing the druggenedisease co module using computational means to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to present and investigate druggene disease relationships using functionally_related co modules then we develop a bayesian partition method to identify druggenedisease co modules from gene closeness data the simulation_study demonstrates the superior_performance of comcipher in co module detection as discussed modular presentation of biological data has several advantages first it can discover subtle associations between biological elements that are too weak to detect by considering all of their features as a whole which also was noted in microarray_data analysis second the complex interconnections between elements suggest that modular measurements are more robust than treating each element individually the approach used in the current study possesses several merits first we find that drugs and diseases in the co modules tend to share targets or disease genes and may therefore serve as another way to identify new drug_targets and disease genes moreover disease co_morbidities also tend to enrich in co modules suggesting the potential application of co modules in disease diagnosis and prognosis second compared with ppa method the indicator variables used in comcipher provide a relatively clear structure of co modules which facilitates the interpretation of results moreover simulations show that as long as m is sufficiently_large comcipher can identify not only the real co modules but also pure drug and disease modules which could be missed by ppa these single dimensional modules serve to find common molecular interconnections between different drugs or diseases and thus are also of value third those unselected co modules in which no significant drugdisease associations are found are still useful on the one hand the incompleteness in current knowledge might suggest unknown associations existing in those co modules on the other hand even though prior_knowledge indicates no association in a co module understanding why those network related drug disease relations do not tend to yield associations may provide new insights into the mechanistic_understanding of drugdisease relations and generate new hypotheses some aspects of the implementation of comcipher are worth mentioning although the mcmc method theoretically guarantees that the markov_chain will converge to the target distribution because the number of iterations is always finite it is possible that the chain will be trapped in a local mode we handled this problem by adopting parallel tempering with multiple chains under different temperatures and with different initial points still the chain must be monitored carefully to determine its burn in state and convergence moreover when the dimension becomes very large the chain will move very slowly therefore we only focused on a small subset of genes in this study though this may make us lose some useful information in addition if we choose m larger comcipher tends to break data
