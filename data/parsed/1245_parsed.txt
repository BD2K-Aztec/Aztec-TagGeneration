dactal divide_and trees almost without alignments motivation while phylogenetic_analyses of datasets containing sequences are challenging for existing_methods the estimation of substantially larger phylogenies poses a problem of much greater complexity and scale methods we present dactal a method for phylogeny estimation that produces trees from unaligned sequence_datasets without ever needing to estimate an alignment on the entire dataset dactal combines iteration with a novel divide_and approach so that each iteration begins with a tree produced in the prior iteration decomposes the taxon set into overlapping subsets estimates trees on each subset and then combines the smaller trees into a tree on the full taxon set using a new supertree method we prove that dactal is guaranteed to produce the true tree under certain conditions we compare dactal to sat and maximum_likelihood trees on estimated alignments using simulated_and with taxa results our studies show that on average dactal yields more accurate trees than the two phase methods we studied on very large_datasets that are difficult to align and has approximately the same accuracy on the easier datasets the comparison to sat shows that both have the same accuracy but that dactal achieves this accuracy in a fraction of the time furthermore dactal can analyze larger datasets than sat including a dataset with almost sequences availability dactal source_code and results of dataset analyses are available atphylogeny estimation methods are used to estimate the true tree from sequences that have evolved down the tree this estimation is typically performed using two phases first a multiple_sequence msa is estimated and then a statistical estimation method such as maximum_likelihood ml is applied to the alignment such two phase approaches produce highly_accurate trees when the datasets are small enough under a few hundred sequences and have evolved without too many insertions_and called indels several methods for coestimation of trees and alignments based on statistical_models of evolution that include indels as well as substitutions have been developed including of these methods bali phy is the only one to whom correspondence should be addressed that to our knowledge has been able to analyze datasets with sequences but even these analyses can take a week or more sat is a new coestimation method but unlike the methods discussed earlier estimates these alignments and trees without reference to a parametric model that includes indels as well as substitutions simulations show that sat produces more accurate trees than twophase methods on large hard to align datasets and does so fairly quickly because sat uses raxml a popular ml heuristic to produce phylogenies it is computationally_intensive for large_datasets furthermore sats realignment technique can have very large memory_requirements on some datasets with sequences thus none of the current methods is able to produce highly_accurate phylogenetic estimation on very large sequence_datasets when they are difficult to align as large phylogenetic_studies are increasingly common and more will likely arise as a result of next_generation this represents a substantial limitation an alternative approach to two phase methods are alignmentfree methods that estimate trees without performing any msa at all although some of the promising methods have not yet been implemented e g the best of the currently available alignment_free while exhibiting surprising and desirable properties such as improved accuracy in the presence of among site rate variation do not yet produce trees of the same accuracy as two phase methods that first align and then estimate the tree here we present dactal divide_and trees almost without alignments a method that is designed to estimate trees but not a msa on large_datasets dactal combines iteration with a divide_and dataset decomposition approach to produce a tree without ever needing to estimate an alignment on the full dataset the dataset decomposition technique used in dactal is inspired by theoretical results related to supertree estimation methods and observations from extensive experience with phylogenetic_analyses of large_datasets the iterative technique however is purely empirically motivated our study compares dactal to several existing_methods including several leading two phase methods and sat on simulated and biological_datasets with to almost sequences we show that bullet dactal was able to analyze larger datasets than sat can including one dataset with rrna sequences for which sats re alignment technique had excessive memory_requirements
