systems_biology hybrid regulatory models a statistically tractable approach to model regulatory network_dynamics motivation computational modelling of the dynamics of gene_regulatory is a central task of systems_biology for networks of small medium scale the dominant paradigm is represented by systems of coupled non linear ordinary_differential odes odes afford great mechanistic detail and flexibility but calibrating these models to data is often an extremely_difficult statistical problem results here we develop a general statistical_inference framework for stochastic transcriptiontranslation networks we use a coarse_grained approach which represents the system as a network of sto chastic binary promoter and continuous protein variables we derive an exact inference algorithm and an efficient variational approximation that allows scalable inference and learning of the model_parameters we demonstrate the power of the approach on two biological case studies showing that the method allows a high degree of flexibility and is capable of testable novel biological predictions availability_and http homepages inf ed ac uk gsanguin software html understanding the dynamics of gene_regulatory grns is a fundamental area of research in systems_biology in silico predictions of the networks response to altered conditions can often give deep insights in the functionality of the biological system under consideration as well as being crucial in biomedical and biotechnological_applications bioinformatics data analysis methods are invaluable in extracting information in large_datasets and can be useful to predict the main changes in regulatory behaviours however detailed predictions of the dynamics of small medium scale complex_regulatory cannot avoid dealing with the non linear and continuous time nature of such systems calling for more sophisticated mathematical_modelling techniques by some distance the dominant paradigm to model grns dynamics is given by systems of coupled non linear ordinary_differential odes odes provide an ideal framework for the detailed modelling of mechanistic systems and of course can rely on refined analysis tools developed over hundreds of years of mathematical research nevertheless mechanistic detail often comes at the cost of including many unknown_parameters as well as novel variables that are not observed e g post_translational of proteins although there are many parameter_estimation tools available parameter_estimation in systems of non linear odes is often an intrinsically difficult statistical problem owing to the severe multimodality of the likelihood landscape this is further compounded by the limited amount of data usually available in most biological scenarios here we propose a novel statistical modelling framework to model regulatory_interactions in grns which maintains some key features of non linear ode_models while being amenable to a principled statistical treatment statistical modelling has become increasingly central in systems_biology many different statistical_models have been proposed in the context of mechanistic systems_biology models ranging from odes with uncertain parameters to fully stochastic models naturally the key_question is to select a representation that is complex enough to capture the behaviour of the system but simple enough to allow tractable inference here we build on recently_proposed statistical_models for transcriptional_regulation and represent grns using a hybrid continuous discrete stochastic_process consisting of binary promoter states occupied vacant that drive a stochastic differential_equation describing protein dynamics in this way we bypass much of the statistical difficulties introduced by detailed modelling of transcription translation and subsequent posttranslational_modifications on the other hand the introduction of a latent stochastic promoter state can capture much of this complexity giving a flexible framework our key advance is the introduction of a model of how promoters can depend on upstream protein states and of a modular approach to approximate inference in this model class that scales linearly with the number of genes in the network in this way we can handle medium_sized networks of arbitrary topology we complement our theoretical_analysis with an empirical analysis of our method on simulated_data as well as on two real biological_systems the to whom correspondence should be addressed benchmark yeast synthetic network irma and the circadian_clock of the picoalga ostreococcus tauri we compare with existing ode_models and show that our approach achieves excellent fits and robust predictions by comparing predictions on different data types our model also provides a new testable hypothesis about the structure of the o tauri clock network mathematical_modelling of grns is fundamental to our attempts to understand the structure and dynamics of gene_networks non linear ode_models provide an excellent framework to elucidate and predict complex regulatory_mechanisms in small to medium scale grns however they can be vulnerable to incomplete knowledge of the system and calibrating complex models to limited data may pose an unsurmountable statistical challenge here we have presented a statistical_approach to modelling transcriptiontranslation networks which aims at retaining the flexibility allowed by non linear ode_models while making possible a statistical exploration of the models parameterization the approach relies on a stochastic hybrid representation of the system where the transcriptiontranslation mechanism is modelled using only two variables promoter latent states and protein states by replacing complex non linearities and additional unknown_parameters of ode_models with latent_variables the model becomes simpler more robust and more identifiable our empirical study demonstrates the identifiability of our approach and shows how on two real biological_problems it can yield comparable or better predictions than competing_methods as well as leading to novel testable biological_hypotheses our prediction that a repressilator structure underpins the o tauri clock is in line with recent_discoveries on the structure inferred promoter states for cca left and toc right obtained with the nfl model using translational solid lines and transcriptional dashed lines reporters of the a thaliana clock and indeed with the structure of known animal circadian clocks ukai if validated this finding would suggest that the repressilator structure is an evolutionarily_conserved feature of eukaryotic circadian clocks furthermore our model_predicts that toc acts as a repressor while remaining an indirect activator of cca through a double repression again the repressor role of toc was recently demonstrated in a thaliana leading further weight to our hypotheses although the repressilator model substantially ameliorates the model misfit of the nfl model there remains some residual unexplained discrepancy between inferences from transcriptional and translational reporters although this may be due to noise in the data it cannot be excluded that the complexity of the o tauri oscillator may be even greater as is the case of other plant oscillators we believe that these results show the promise of this approach as an effective tool in addressing systems_biology problems nevertheless this work opens further avenues for development from the biological point_of validation of the novel structure of the o tauri clock would be an important step which is likely to require substantial bioinformatics_research however perhaps even more interesting would be to computationally explore the links between the transcriptiontranslation oscillator we study and the recently described non transcriptional oscillator of o tauri o from the computational point_of this study does not address the important problem of de_novo reconstruction of the structure of the regulatory_network but relies on pre_existing network_structures a systematic method to combine structure_learning with dynamical modelling remains a desirable goal we hope that this work will represent an advance in that promising direction
