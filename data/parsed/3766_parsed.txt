prototypes of elementary functional loops unravel evolutionary connections between protein functions motivation earlier_studies of protein_structure revealed closed loops with a characteristic size residues and ring like shape as a basic universal structural_element of globular_proteins elementary functional loops efls have specific signatures and provide functional_residues important for binding activation and principal chemical transformation steps of the enzymatic_reaction the goal of this work is to show how these functional loops evolved from pre domain peptides and to find a set of prototypes from which the efls of contemporary proteins originated results this article_describes a computational_method for deriving prototypes of efls based on the sequences of complete_genomes the procedure comprises the iterative derivation of sequence_profiles followed by their hierarchical_clustering the scoring_function takes_into information content on profile positions thus preserving the signature the statistical_significance of scores is evaluated from the empirical distribution of scores of the background model a set of prototypes of efls from archaeal proteomes is derived this set delineates evolutionary connections between major functions and illuminates how folds and functions emerged in pre domain evolution as a combination of prototypes enzymes are involved in all processes in living_organisms well before the first protein_sequence and structure were determined the function of enzymes became one of the central questions in biochemical studies despite the wealth of experimental_data available nowadays the functions of the majority of proteins are still uncharacterized since the presence of certain biochemical activities is typically sought for while all other possible activities e g promiscuous functions are ignored experimental determination of enzymatic_function is in most cases confirmative besides biochemical assays are expensive are subject to in vitro experimental_conditions and they can not be run on a genomic_scale all the above makes prediction of enzymatic_function with computational_methods an important alternative approach there are several general assumptions on which such methods are based i homologous_proteins have similar functions ii most of the functional_variants emerged as a result of divergence from a common_ancestor iii structural homologs so_called fold superfamilies persist down to of sequence_identity iv divergence below of sequence_identity leads to the emergence of families with different organism substrate and or tissue specificities though enzymatic to whom correspondence should be addressed function can be inferred by sequence and structure similarity the relations between sequence structure and function are far from being completely_understood many folds display vast functional_diversity for example structurally_similar barrels provide scaffolds to a number of biochemical_functions while particular biochemical_functions can be performed by different protein_folds e g hydrolase the contemporary evolution of protein_structure and function takes_place through mutations recombination and domain swapping and or interactions however it is rather obvious that this process was preceded by the emergence of a first set of protein domain structures folds with a limited repertoire of biochemical_functions these structures emerged from peptides with rudimentary non specific catalytic_activities in the pre domain stage of evolution understanding of this process is important for characterizing the most ancient functions and their connections to the modern proteins the difficulties in understanding and more importantly in predicting protein_function are well reflected in the diversity of their descriptions enzymatic_reactions are classified in enzyme nomenclature ec by the biochemical transformation and the substrate according to macie database there could be different mechanisms employed for the same transformation different biochemical_reactions can have the same core mechanism as it is exemplified by mechanistically diverse superfamilies in order to reconcile different approaches and to develop a generic description of enzymatic functions one has to start from considering their elementary units which provide binding activation and principal chemical transformation steps of the whole reaction then it should be found out how combinations of these units result in a variety of enzymatic_reactions and how protein_folds restrict the possibility of performing a particular biochemical transformation or binding a certain substrate the first question that arises in this context is what elements of protein_folds serve as elementary units of function what were the structures of these units in pre domain evolution and how did they affect the structures of modern proteins earlier_studies have shown that soluble_proteins contain a basic universal element stemming from the polymer nature of polypeptide_chains namely closed loops or returns of the polypeptide_chain backbone with a typical size of amino_acid any protein fold can be decomposed into sets of consecutively connected closed loops indicating their independence in the evolutionary past can we reconstruct the pre biotic peptides that gave rise to the elementary functional_units of modern proteins our hypothesis is that a functional signature revealing the type ofpage i i i
