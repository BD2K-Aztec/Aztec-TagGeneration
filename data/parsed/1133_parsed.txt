data_and condensing biomedical journal texts through paragraph ranking motivation the growing availability of full text scientific_articles raises the important issue of how to most efficiently digest full text content although article titles_and provide accurate and concise information on an articles contents their brevity inevitably entails the loss of detail full_text provide those details but require more time to read the primary goal of this study is to combine the advantages of concise abstracts and detail rich full texts to ease the burden of reading results we retrieved abstract related paragraphs from full_text through shared keywords between the abstract and paragraphs from the main text significant paragraphs were then recommended by applying a proposed paragraph ranking approach finally the user was provided with a condensed text consisting of these significant paragraphs allowing the user to save time from perusing the whole article we compared the performance of the proposed approach with a keyword counting approach and a pagerank like approach evaluation was conducted in two aspects the importance of each retrieved paragraph and the information coverage of a set of retrieved paragraphs in both evaluations the proposed approach outperformed the other approaches contact in recent_years the development of bioinformatics and information_technology has coincided with the rapid_growth of biomedical_literature databases and the rate at which more full text scientific_literature becomes available on the web is accelerating the u s national_center ncbi under the u s national_library has collected more than million biomedical study abstracts in its free access literature_database pubmed which acts as a portal site for various biomedical journals and provides a literature_search service for browsing and retrieving abstracts the service helps researchers keep up to date on biomedical progress and discoveries and also reduces the risk of redundant experiments this overwhelming volume of information obviously defies manually exploration and given time limitations the ability of individuals and organizations to digest this flood of data is an issue of growing concern investigations into the automatic extraction of important information begun decades_ago recently many text_mining applications have been developed to raise to whom correspondence should be addressed efficiency and save time in literature_reviews goetz and von der gopubmed categorized pubmed_search results into various topics to assist users in looking for articles relevant to their specific interests litlnspector enhanced search results by highlighting keywords with various colors according to predefined keyword categories genelibrarian extracted specific information from pubmed_abstracts to facilitate awareness of critical relationships between genes of interest all of these applications use various methods to compile abstracts and present concise information in the past obtaining full_text could be very inconvenient however these days more and more full text literature is available online via digital literature databases pubmed central pmc and pubmed both established by the ncbi differ mainly in that pmc is dedicated to collecting full_text in the life_science while pubmed collects abstracts only both services offer free access to their collections and the pmc database currently consists of nearly life_science journals following the increased availability of free full_text text_mining applications have allowed readers to peer into the main texts providing full article searches which extract more complete and detailed information than would otherwise be available in the abstracts however directly applying tools designed for searching abstracts on a full text corpus entails unacceptably_high computation and performance costs in recent_years new research has been proposed on full text utilities lin compared search_engine performance at various levels abstract whole article and sections of an article studied keyword distribution and difference cross_sections investigated the performance of semi_automatic indexing on abstracts and full_text all of these studies make clear that the development of tools for full text use is a matter of great urgency the advantage of applications which search full_text is that the main text is where the details of the research are addressed however this data inevitably is accompanied by redundant or trivial description material from the perspective of text miming the variety of elements e g text equations figures tables etc is a significant challenge for full text information_extraction and information noise from redundant and trivial description may impair system performance abstracts contain much less information than the full_text and they are wellstructured and helpful for readers to quickly ascertain a papers purpose an abstract briefly_describes the research_focus methods findings and main conclusion in a brief text in this study we propose an approach to assist readers in digesting full text more effectively and efficiently effective andefficient reading requires a mid sized text containing essential and detailed information to generate this condensed text we combine the respective advantages of an abstract and full text article using text_mining and summarization techniques and propose a ranking framework to recommend important and relevant paragraphs these paragraphs should be related to topics mentioned in the abstract and contain complementary and detailed information we then collect these paragraphs into a condensed text to assist readers in section we describe the proposed ranking framework and a metric named paragraph relevanceinverse sentence relevance prisr which is used to evaluate the importance of paragraphs section_describes the materials and experimental_settings used in performance evaluation section_presents the results of two perspective evaluations and conclusions are drawn in section
