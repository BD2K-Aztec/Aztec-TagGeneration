efficient network guided multi_locus association_mapping with graph cuts motivation as an increasing number of genome_wide reveal the limitations of the attempt to explain phenotypic heritability by single genetic_loci there is a recent focus on associating complex phenotypes with sets of genetic_loci although several methods for multi_locus mapping have been proposed it is often unclear how to relate the detected loci to the growing_knowledge about gene pathways and networks the few methods that take biological_pathways or networks into account are either restricted to investigating a limited number of predetermined sets of loci or do not scale to genome_wide settings results we present scones a new efficient method to discover sets of genetic_loci that are maximally associated with a phenotype while being connected in an underlying_network our approach is based on a minimum cut reformulation of the problem of selecting features under sparsity and connectivity constraints which can be solved exactly and rapidly scones outperforms state of the art competitors in terms of runtime scales to hundreds of thousands of genetic_loci and exhibits higher power in detecting causal_snps in simulation_studies than other methods on flowering time phenotypes and genotypes from arabidopsis_thaliana scones detects loci that enable accurate phenotype prediction and that are supported by the literature availability code is available attwin and family pedigree studies make it possible to estimate the heritability of observed traits that is to say the amount of their variability that can be attributed to genetic_differences in the past_few genome_wide gwas in which several hundreds of thousands to millions of single_nucleotide snps are assayed in up to thousands of individuals have made it possible to identify hundreds of genetic_variants associated with complex phenotypes unfortunately although studies associating single snps with phenotypic outcomes have become standard they often fail to explain much of the heritability of complex_traits investigating the joint effects of multiple_loci by mapping sets of genetic_variants to the phenotype has the potential to help explain part of this missing_heritability although efficient multiple_linear approaches make the detection of such multivariate associations possible they often remain_limited in power and hard to interpret incorporating biological_knowledge into these approaches could help boosting their power and interpretability however current methods are limited to predefining a reasonable number of candidate sets to investigate for instance by relying on gene pathways they consequently run the risk of missing biologically_relevant loci that have not been included in the candidate sets this risk is made even likelier by the incomplete state of our current biological_knowledge for this reason our goal here is to use prior_knowledge in a more flexible way we propose to use a biological_network defined between snps to guide a multi_locus mapping_approach that is both efficient to compute and biologically_meaningful we aim to find a set of snps that i are maximally associated with a given phenotype and ii tend to be connected in a given biological_network in addition this set must be computed efficiently on genome_wide data in this article we assume an additive_model to characterize multi_locus association the network constraint stems from the assumption that snps influencing the same phenotype are biologically linked however the diversity of the type of relationships that this can encompass together with the current incompleteness of biological_knowledge makes providing a network in which all the relevant connections are present unlikely for this reason although we want to encourage the snps to form a subnetwork of the network we also do not want to enforce that they must form a single connected component finally we stress that the method must scale to networks of hundreds of thousands or millions of nodes approaches byor li and developed to analyze gene_networks containing hundreds of nodes do therefore not apply although our method can be applied to any network between genetic_markers we explore three special types of networks gs network snps adjacent on the genomic_sequence gs are linked together in this setting we aim at recovering subsequences of the genomic_sequence that correlate with the phenotype to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the

permissions_oup com gm gene membership network snps are connected as in the sequence network described earlier in the text in addition snps near the same gene are linked together as well usually a snp is considered to belong to a gene if it is either located inside said gene or within a predefined distance of this gene in this setting we aim more particularly at recovering genes that correlate with the phenotype gi gene interaction_network snps are connected as in the gm network described earlier in the text in addition supposing we have a genegene interaction_network derived for example from proteinprotein_interaction data or gene_expression correlations snps belonging to two genes connected in the gene network are linked together in this setting we aim at recovering potential pathways that explain the phenotype our task is a feature_selection problem in a graph structured feature_space where the features are the snps and the selection criterion should be related to their association with the phenotype considered our problem is different from subgraph selection problems such as those encountered in chemoinformatics where each object is a graph and each feature is a subgraph of its own several approaches have already been developed for selecting graph structured features a number of them le only use the graph over the features to build the learners evaluating their relevance but do not enforce that the selected_features should follow this underlying_structure indeed they can be applied to settings where the features connectivity varies across examples whereas here all individuals share the same network the overlapping group_lasso is a sparse linear_model designed to select features that belong to the union of a small number of predefined groups if a graph over the features is given defining those groups as all pairs of features connected by an edge or as all linear subgraphs of a given size yields the so_called graph lasso a similar approach is taken by their structured sparsity penalty encourages selecting a small number of base blocks where blocks are sets of features defined so as to match the structure of the problem in the case of a graph induced structure blocks are defined as small connected components of that graph as shown in the overlapping group_lasso aforementioned is a relaxation of this binary problem as the number of linear subgraphs or connected components of a given size grows exponentially with the number of nodes of the graph which can reach millions in the case of whole_genome snp data only the edge based version of the graph lasso can be applied to our problem it is however unclear whether it is sufficient to capture long_range connections between graph nodes li and li propose a network constrained version of the lasso that imposes the type of graph connectivity we deem desirable however their approach has been developed with networks of genes rather than of snps in mind and does not scale easily to the datasets we envision indeed the implementation they propose relies on a singular_value of the laplacian of the network which is intensive to compute and cannot be stored in memory also searched subnetworks of protein_protein that are maximally associated with a phenotype however their greedy approach_requires fixing beforehand a necessarily small upper_limit on the size of the subnetworks considered in the case of directed_acyclic mairal and yu propose a minimum flow formulation that makes it possible to use for groups or blocks the set of all paths of the network unfortunately the generalization to undirected graphs with cycles such as the snp networks we consider requires randomly assigning directions to edges and pruning those in cycles without any biological justification although this can work reasonably well in practice this is akin to artificially removing more than half of the network connections without any biological justification in what follows we formulate the network guided snp selection problem as a minimum cut problem on a graph derived from the snp network in section and evaluate the performance of our solution both in simulations and on actual arabidopsis_thaliana data in section we evaluate the ability of scones to detect networks of traitassociated snps on simulated_datasets and on datasets from an association_mapping study in a thaliana
