fast randomization of large genomic_datasets while preserving alteration counts motivation studying combinatorial patterns in cancer genomic data_sets has recently_emerged as a tool for identifying novel cancer driver networks approaches have been devised to quantify for example the tendency of a set of genes to be mutated in a mutually_exclusive manner the significance of the proposed metrics is usually evaluated by computing p values under appropriate null_models to this end a monte_carlo method the switching algorithm is used to sample simulated_datasets under a null_model that preserves patient and gene wise mutation_rates in this method a genomic dataset is represented as a bipartite network to which markov_chain updates switching steps are applied these steps modify the network_topology and a minimal number of them must be executed to draw simulated_datasets independently under the null_model this number has previously been deducted empirically to be a linear function of the total number of variants making this process computationally_expensive results we present a novel approximate lower_bound for the number of switching steps derived analytically additionally we have developed the r package birewire including new efficient implementations of the switching algorithm we illustrate the performances of birewire by applying it to large real cancer_genomics datasets we report vast reductions in time requirement with respect to existing implementations bounds and equivalent p value computations thus we propose birewire to study statistical_properties in genomic data_sets and other data that can be modeled as bipartite networks availability_and birewire is available on bioconductor atin the past_few next_generation ngs_technologies have progressed swiftly and currently hundreds of genomes can be simultaneously sequenced in a matter of weeks at more affordable costs this opens a wide_range of new avenues in biological and biomedical_research in particular because of the established impact of the genomic background on disease_progression and response to drug treatment cancer research has significantly benefited from these advances comprehensive catalogues of mutations in multiple_cancer have been assembled and fruitfully used to identify new diagnostic prognostic and therapeutic_targets existing large_scale projects such as the cancer_genome tcga the international cancer genome consortium data portal and recently the genomics of drug_sensitivity in cancer and the cancer_cell provide invaluable opportunities to explore molecular_alterations that could potentially play_a in a plethora of different cancer_types and their response to therapy a key task in these projects is to distinguish between driver_mutations i e those conferring selective clonal growth_advantage and functionally neutral passenger_mutations which do not contribute to tumour_development once key driver mutated genes are identified a fruitful analysis is to consider them in the context of the pathways where they operate this allows the identification of cancer driver biological_networks whose altered functionality results in the acquisition of a cancer hallmark one of the ideas exploited to identify these networks is based on the assumption that sets of mutations exhibiting statistically_significant levels of mutual_exclusivity me are likely to alter genes involved in a common biological_process that drives cancer development it has been noted that driver_mutations in cancer occur in a limited number of pathways and driver lesions in the same pathway do not tend to occur in the same patient a possible biological explanation is that if a crucial node is altered in an oncogenic pathway a secondary mutation on the same pathway is unlikely to provide further selective_advantage to the cancer cell thus it does not tend to be selected during somatic evolution hence sets of mutations exhibiting statistically_significant levels of me are likely to alter genes involved in a common biological_process that drives cancer development on the other hand mutations of genes participating in different biological_pathways may exert a synergistic_effect in conferring growth advantages to tumour_cells therefore investigations have been devoted to searching for groups of genes that are simultaneously mutated more often than expected by random chance to whom correspondence should be addressed
