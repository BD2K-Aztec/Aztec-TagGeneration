iongap integrative bacterial genome_analysis for ion_torrent sequence_data we introduce iongap a publicly_available web platform designed for the analysis of whole bacterial_genomes using ion_torrent sequence_data besides assembly it integrates a variety of comparative_genomics annotation and bacterial classification routines based on the widely used fastq bam and sra file_formats benchmarking with different datasets evidenced that iongap is a fast powerful and simple to use bioinformatics tool by releasing this platform we aim to translate low_cost bacterial genome_analysis for microbiological prevention and control in healthcare agroalimentary and pharmaceutical_industry applications availability_and iongap is hosted by the iters teide hpc supercomputer and is freely_available on the web for non commercial use at http iongap the application of next_generation ngs to bacterial genomic studies has a great impact in clinical microbiology diagnosis and epidemiology as well as in the management of infectious_disease given the abundance of information produced by the ngs_platforms affordable and fast access to whole genome_sequence by means of intuitive bioinformatics_tools demanding minimal_training is mandatory to translate this technology into the clinical_settings routine ion_torrent semiconductor sequencing_technology thermo fisher scientific inc benefits from high sequencing speed at low_cost constituting one of the preferred choices in settings demanding fast turnaround ngs routine analysis nevertheless a comprehensive bacterial genomic_data analysis demands a number of software_packages which often have cumbersome installation and use and lack a graphical_interface existing web platforms such as orione aim to solve this issue albeit the user still must configure many genome_assembly and analysis options alternatives for local execution of analyses often requiring expert installation are also available for genome_assembly annotation or variant_calling however they were designed for illumina and roche sequencing_data therefore there is no specific package providing an integrated collection of microbial genomic applications speciallyconfigured for rapid handling of data generated by ion_torrent sequencing for this reason we have developed iongap a webbased genome_analysis platform to straightforwardly perform both the assembly process and subsequent comparative_analysis variant_calling functional_annotation and bacterial typing routines in a seamless user_friendly way therefore iongap offers a first line solution making data analysis accessible to non specialists but compatible with downstream advanced applications
