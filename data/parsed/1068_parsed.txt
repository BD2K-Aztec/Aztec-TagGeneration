data_and comparing bioassay response and similarity ensemble approaches to probing protein pharmacology motivation networks to predict protein pharmacology can be created using ligand similarity or using known bioassay response profiles of ligands recent_publications indicate that similarity methods can be highly_accurate but it has been unclear how similarity methods compare to methods that use bioassay response data directly results we created protein networks based on ligand similarity similarity ensemble approach or sea and ligand bioassay response data bard using pfizer internal bioprint assays both sea and bard successfully cluster together proteins with known relationships and predict some non obvious relationships although the approaches assess target relations from different perspectives their networks overlap considerably overlap of the top of correlated edges they can thus be considered as comparable methods with a distinct advantage of the similarity methods that they only require simple computations similarity of compound as opposed to extensive experimental_data the study of the impact of drugs and chemical_compounds across multiple protein targets polypharmacology is of increasing importance for many reasons including finding new therapeutic_indications for known drugs understanding the causes of drug side_effects profiling off target interactions and understanding the role of proteins and their associated genes using chemical_compounds as probes this latter application is of particular interest as protein targets can share the same natural ligand but be classified completely differently from a protein_function perspective for example the targets of opioid methadone are opioid_receptor and n_methyl nmda_receptor which belong to two different types of target class gpcr and ion_channel detection of this relationship between protein targets is extremely_difficult with knowledge of the targets alone in general protein_sequence is not well correlated with the chemical similarity of to whom correspondence should be addressed known ligand sets relating proteins using ligand similarity can thus be a complementary tool to study biological_function and can be incorporated into wider network pharmacology systems ligand based similarity of two protein targets can be calculated either by comparing the activity profiles of sets of ligands against a reference_set of ligands for both two targets activity similarity or by comparing the chemical_structure similarities of the two sets of ligands chemical similarity presented the first dendrogram of kinases based entirely on small_molecule selectivity data and proposed a similarity measure sarsim using the difference of log ic_values built target target similarity networks using the polypharmacology interaction_strength the fraction of compounds_tested against two proteins that have comparable binding_affinity a similar approach was applied in pubchem bioassay networks linking two assays if they share at least one active compound metz andreviewed a number of recent activity similarity methods and their use at abbott laboratories used chemical similarity between ligand sets similarity ensemble approach or sea to study the pharmacological relations and found many unexpected relationships some of which were later proved experimentally benders group used substructure mining to determine the similarity between groups of ligands to classify gpcrs van_der the studies based on the activity similarity approach are limited by the lack of large_scale sar data for many compounds against many targets and thus have only focused on particular classes of targets such as kinases and are also limited in that they do not in any way take into account chemical similarity between the ligands conversely the similarity based_approaches such as sea do not take account of the degrees of chemical protein interaction the sea method has been subject to limited experimental_validation which showed_positive but has not been evaluated against a wide_range of targets in this article we carried_out an evaluation using a large experimental set at pfizer called bioassay response data or bard that is extracted from pfizer bioprint collections bard contains biological_assays with at least active_compounds and unique compounds along with their binding_affinities using a variety of similarity and statistical_association methods we created bard networks from this data to project the known target relationships and then compared this with the network derived from sea bard and sea assess target relations using ligand data but from two perspectives bard measures relationship between two proteins based on correlations of the proteins profiles of compounds that are known to be active against them sea assumes if the active_compounds between two proteins have certain structural_similarity the two proteins would share similar pharmacology these approaches are clearly different but the approaches share a distinct correlation of their results the network from bard spearman has overall nearly overlap with that from sea clearly though each method highlights relationships not found by the other so they can be
