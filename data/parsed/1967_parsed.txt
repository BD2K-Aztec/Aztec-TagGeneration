genemania cytoscape_plugin fast gene function predictions on the desktop the genemania cytoscape_plugin brings fast gene_function capabilities to the desktop genemania identifies the most related genes to a query gene_set using a guilt by association approach the plugin uses over networks from six organisms and each related gene is traceable to the source network used to make the prediction users may add their own interaction networks and expression_profile data to complement or override the default data the genemania cytoscape_plugin is a standalone tool for making fast and efficient gene function predictions the plugin implements the genemania algorithm which uses a guilt by association approach to derive predictions from a combination of potentially heterogeneous_data genemania has been shown to be as good or better in speed and accuracy compared with other gene_function algorithms in a competition based on mouse functional association_network data the plugin extends the cytoscape network_visualization and analysis platform and the functionality of the genemania gene_function website to enable computational_biologists and biologists to conduct queries using any number of genes and networks as long as their machine has enough memory the resulting predicted network of functional_relationships among query and predicted genes is then available as an annotated cytoscape network for further analysis the plugin uses a large dataset of functional association networks which includes over networks for six organisms arabidopsis_thaliana caenorhabditis_elegans drosophila_melanogaster mus_musculus homo_sapiens and saccharomyces_cerevisiae the networks are grouped into six categories co expression colocalization genetic_interaction physical_interaction predicted and to whom correspondence should be addressed shared protein domain the data come from a wide_range of sources including individual studies and large_databases such as biogrid geo i d and pathway_commons http www pathwaycommons org networks are updated regularly the plugin automatically checks for these updates and prompts the user to download and install new networks and organisms as they become available the genemania cytoscape_plugin is freely_available www genemania org plugin and via the cytoscape_plugin manager it also includes command_line for running multiple predictions in an automated fashion to facilitate performance evaluation of different algorithm parameters via cross_validation for example users can determine the contribution of their own networks to the performance of the algorithm using all publicly_available data
