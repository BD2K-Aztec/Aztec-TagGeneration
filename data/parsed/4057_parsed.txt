robust data_driven incorporation of prior_knowledge into the inference of dynamic regulatory_networks motivation inferring global regulatory_networks grns from genome_wide data is a computational challenge central to the field of systems_biology although the primary data currently used to infer grns consist of gene_expression and proteomics measurements there is a growing abundance of alternate data types that can reveal regulatory_interactions e g chip_chip literature derived interactions proteinprotein_interactions grn_inference requires the development of integrative methods capable of using these alternate data as priors on the grn structure each source of structure priors has its unique biases and inherent potential_errors thus grn methods using these data must be robust to noisy inputs results we developed two methods for incorporating structure priors into grn_inference both methods modified elastic_net men and bayesian best subset regression bbsr extend the previously described inferelator framework enabling the use of prior information we test our methods on one synthetic and two bacterial datasets and show that both men and bbsr infer accurate grns even when the structure prior used has significant amounts of error erroneous interactions we find that bbsr outperforms men at inferring grns from expression data and noisy structure priors availability_and code datasets and networks presented in this article are available at http bonneaulab bio nyu edu software html understanding how global regulatory_networks grns coordinate systems level response of a cell or organism to a new environmental state or perturbation is a key problem in systems_biology with applications spanning biofuels novel therapeutic_targets and the discovery of novel pathways involved in cellular_differentiation the cellular response is governed by multiple regulatory_mechanisms that can be encapsulated by large network models recent_advances in the quality and availability of high_throughput enable measurement of different components of the grn including mrna transcript_levels protein levels post_translational as well as dna characteristics such as transcription_factor binding regions and open chromatin locations encode_project these multi level and multi_scale datasets have made the inference of integrative grns possible as high_throughput data capturing the abundance of mrna_transcripts are the most mature and readily available many methods focus only on this single level of regulation learning transcriptional_regulatory in transcriptional grns the regulators are transcription_factors tfs either previously known or predicted and the targets are genes time series data capturing the temporal changes in transcript_abundance allow for the inference of the strength and direction of regulatory_interactions which can be used to predict how the system will behave under previously unmeasured conditions here we are primarily interested in methods for learning regulatory_networks from compendia of expression data and combining this data with complementary data_sources that provide priors on network_structure importantly the priors we use in this work provide information about connectivity but do not provide any information about the relative_strength importance or dynamic_properties of each known regulatory edge these we atempt to learn from the data learning networks from single data types has severe_limitations as grns operate on multiple levels in addition to the transcriptome thus alternate data types are needed to form a complete picture of cellular circuits even if one is interested in learning the purely transcriptional layer of a cells regulatory_network many tfs are post_transcriptionally modified in ways that confound single data type network_inference the transcript_abundance of a tf is not necessarily correlated with its protein_abundance nor activity and some regulatory sub circuits produce transcriptional output that is consistent with multiple models one way to mitigate these pitfalls is to use publicly_available sources of complementary data with bearing on regulation we term any data that contains direct tf target information either predicted or experimentally_validated as structure priors one source of such prior information is an ever growing collection of experimentally_validated and manually_curated databases of regulatory_interactions these databases are especially rich for to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work model_organisms and the sets of known regulatory_interactions are considered to be accurate and precise though not complete additionally the encode_project consortium a high profile effort to build an encyclopedia of coding_dna elements has generated a wealth of dna_binding information that can be used to generate priors on mammalian regulatory network_structure these are only a few examples of an ever growing number of sources of grn structure priors and it can be seen that they differ substantially from organism to organism each source of prior information on grn structure is an incomplete recapitulation of the underlying_network and may contain many incorrect or irrelevant interactions thus incorporating structure priors into expression based grn_inference poses several interesting algorithmic challenges successful methods for integrative grn_inference must possess the following key_properties i the method must only include the part of the prior with support from the data this is important as the prior information typically is a collection of possible regulatory_interactions of which only a subset might be relevant in a given dataset also this implies robustness to erroneous interactions in the prior which can have various sources such as non functional tf_binding reported by chip_seq ii using a structure prior must not limit the ability to learn the part of the network for which no prior information exists iii the user must be able to control the weight given to the prior this feature allows the user to tune the method based on the believed completeness and accuracy of the prior while respecting the first two properties over a wide_range of parameters in this work we introduce two methods for incorporating structure priors that possess all three criteria we have conducted systematic thorough testing of the ability of both men and bbsr to accurately_reconstruct grns using prior information in biologically_relevant settings we tested both methods with respect to the number and accuracy of prior known interactions pkis and the effect of the weight of the pkis performance is validated against the set of gold_standard interactions gsis we developed two methods for incorporating prior_knowledge into grn_inference both methods use the same underlying ode model of regulation see section but use different model_selection approaches men uses an adaptive weight on the penalty function to incorporate_prior bbsr uses the bayesian formulation of linear_regression together with zellners g prior to incorporate prior information and best subset regression with the bic for sparse model_selection a key difference between men and bbsr is how the choice of weight how much influence to give to the prior effects performance results presented inshow that for bbsr higher values of g result in overall higher confidence in pkis and reduced confidence in all unknown interactions as such g can be interpreted as a confidence measure in the accuracy and completeness of pkis and be chosen accordingly it is also possible to introduce multiple sources of prior information each with a different weight value of g for men performance change on the leave out set pkis were sampled randomly from and of the gsis in five repetitions we define the leave out set as the set of gsis that are not pkis here we compare the aupr of the leave out set when using pkis y axis to the aupr when not using pkis x axis points above the line indicate a performance increase when pkis are used the prior weight parameter exhibits a less predictable behaviour lower values of generally lead to higher confidence in pkis however for all datasets we observed a performance peak around this non linear property could be the result of cross_validation model_selection procedure we tested the performance of both methods on different subsets of the gsis we see that increasing the number of pkis increases performance in a linear manner for all datasets and both methods supplementary this is in concordance with the results on the leave out set the set of gsis that are not pkis where both methods showed only minor performance change in the presence of pkis regardless of dataset or number of pkis used finally and most importantly for application to biological_systems where only incomplete and noisy sets of pkis are available we assessed the robustness of both methods to fpis both methods are robust to fpis and outperform the naive ranking scheme which assigns high_confidence to all pkis more specifically for both large real_datasets e coli and b subtilis both methods perform better than various baselines no pkis with up to fpis for each true prior interaction this means that both methods given sufficient genomic_data are able to act as filters to distinguish between true and false prior interactions however bbsr is slightly more robust to the presence of fpis a key consideration for any practical_application of network_inference with prior information is the trade_off between recapitulating the prior and discovering novel biology intuitively as the degree of belief in the prior is increased by increasing the weight of the prior information more of the interactions in the prior will be ranked highly by the inference_method thus high weights can lead to the incorporation of false interactions in the case of inaccurate pkis men more prone than bbsr and impair performance on the leave out set as seen in bbsr we suggest to the reader to set the weight parameter for incorporating prior_knowledge based on the expected completeness and accuracy of the pkis and when in doubt to choose a low weight
