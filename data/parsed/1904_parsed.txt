systems_biology functional_integration of a metabolic_network model and expression data without arbitrary thresholding motivation flux_balance fba has been used extensively to analyze genome_scale constraint_based of metabolism in a variety of organisms the predictive_accuracy of such models has recently been improved through the integration of high_throughput expression_profiles of metabolic genes and proteins however extensions of fba often require that such data be discretized a priori into sets of genes or proteins that are either on or off this procedure requires selecting relatively subjective expression thresholds often requiring several iterations and refinements to capture the expression dynamics and retain model functionality results we present a method for mapping expression data from a set of environmental genetic or temporal conditions onto a metabolic_network model without the need for arbitrary expression thresholds metabolic adjustment by differential_expression made uses the statistical_significance of changes in gene or protein expression to create a functional metabolic model that most accurately recapitulates the expression dynamics made was used to generate a series of models that reflect the metabolic adjustments seen in the transition from fermentative to glycerol based respiration in saccharomyces_cerevisiae the calculated gene states match of possible changes in expression and the resulting models capture functional characteristics of the metabolic shift availability made is implemented in matlab and requires a mixed integer_linear solver source_code is freely_available atthe availability of sequenced_genomes has enabled the assembly of high_quality genome_scale reconstructions various constraint based techniques such as flux_balance fba have been developed to predict the steadystate flux distribution through a metabolic_network after various environmental and genetic_perturbations this method assumes that an organisms metabolic objective or objective_function is to maximize the flux through a subset of pathways often corresponding to the production of biomass in unicellular organisms as an approximation of growth and formulates to whom correspondence should be addressed a linear_programming problem describing the stoichiometry of the metabolic_network with constraint based techniques such as fba in silico reconstructions have successfully predicted relationships between the presence_or of a gene and the metabolic_capabilities of a microorganism including gene essentially adaptive_evolution and strain design for optimal production of a metabolic byproduct these predictions assume that the reactions in a reconstruction are either on or off as determined by a set of boolean rules connecting reactions to the binary expression states of associated genes this simplification attempts to overcome the paucity of kinetic details for metabolic gene reaction associations and allows genes to be mapped to the hundreds_or of reactions in a genome_scale model genome_wide transcriptional_regulatory trns can be used to predict the likely on or off state of metabolic genes as a function of environmental_factors unfortunately complete trns are only available for a limited number of organisms including escherichia_coli and saccharomyces_cerevisiae other reconstructions must instead rely on experimental_measurements typically from gene_expression to determine the appropriate gene states but this approach suffers from two complications first classifying reactions as on or off requires setting a threshold in the continuous expression levels of the associated genes such thresholds cannot be accurately_determined from measured mrna_levels alone recent evidence indicates that such a correlation between transcript_levels and metabolic reaction activity does exist however determining a specific threshold above which microarray measurements imply physiologically appreciable activity in the corresponding metabolic reaction is an unresolved problem second these thresholds are not independent since functioning metabolic reconstructions require a minimum set of reactions to be active in each condition regardless of any apparent change in the underlying gene_expression data especially when considering decreases in expression levels the choice to fit these data by inactivating the corresponding reaction must be balanced with the functional effects of removing a reaction from the metabolic_network an early attempt at reconciling gene_expression data with an fba model was the gimme algorithm using a set of user supplied thresholds for the transition of each gene from on to off gimme iteratively reactivated off reactions by turning on genes below their threshold until a functioning model was obtained while gimme did produce functioning fba models the method required the a priori determination of expression thresholds page our made algorithm integrates gene or protein expression data and a metabolic model without a priori determination of activity thresholds made can be applied to any set of two or more page normalized expression levels were averaged across all genes associated with the subsystem for comparison the same approach was applied to the binary expression states calculated by made the range of flux variability is the difference between the maximum and minimum allowable fluxes through a reaction while preserving an optimal objective value these ranges were averaged for reactions in a subsystem and normalized indicates the largest average range for reactions in the subsystem is the smallest range the models only fva results use the indicated media and no constraints on gene_expression the models with expression data show the changes to flux variability at each time point after the expression data were integrated with the model by made genetic environmental or temporal conditions the method attempts to match most closely the genes that exhibit the most statistically_significant changes in expression levels the resulting gene states always produce functioning models and match the direction of differential_expression with high_accuracy results from the glucose glycerol shift in s cerevisiase indicate that made derived models also recapitulate the overall behavior of the actual biological system
