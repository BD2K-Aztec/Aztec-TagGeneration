systems_biology eresponsenet a package prioritizing candidate_disease through cellular_pathways motivation although genome_wide gwas have found many common_genetic associated with human_diseases it remains a challenge to elucidate the functional links between associated variants and complex_traits results we developed a package called eresponsenet by implementing and extending the existing responsenet algorithm for prioritizing candidate_disease through cellular_pathways using type_ii t d as a study case we demonstrate that eresponsenet outperforms currently available approaches in prioritizing candidate_disease more importantly the package is instrumental in revealing cellular_pathways underlying_disease associated genetic_variations availability the eresponsenet package is freely downloadable atgenome wide association studies gwas have uncovered hundreds of common_genetic contributing to human_diseases various methods have been developed to translate statistical associations into biological_functions such as identification of expression_quantitative eqtl using expression_profiles or prediction of disease causative_genes linked with single_nucleotide snps using biological_networks however it is still an enormous gap to understand the biological_mechanisms by which each dna variation affects disease risk here to address this gap we developed a computational package by implementing and extending the responsenet algorithm we showed that the extended package eresponsenet can effectively prioritize candidate_disease linked to disease associated snps and uncover cellular_pathways underlying_disease associated human genetic_variations to whom correspondence should be addressed in this article we present eresponsenet a package demonstrated effective for prioritizing candidate_disease and identifying their underlying molecular_pathways to human disease this method apparently can be generalized to analyzing any complex disease and can be used to link any two layers of omics_data including not only the snps to gene_expression as described here but also epigenomic or microrna data to gene_expression gene_expression to proteomic or metabolic data and so on the eresponsenet output_files can be directly visualized in cytoscape supplementary_material funding china natural national_science grant and chinese ministry of science and technology grant cb chinese academy of sciences grant kscx ew r and kscx ew j and stem_cell leading project xda to j d j h conflict of interest none declared
