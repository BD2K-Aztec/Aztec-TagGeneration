data_and a novel specific edge effect correction_method for rna_interference screenings motivation high_throughput hts is an important method in drug_discovery in which the activities of a large number of candidate chemicals or genetic materials are rapidly evaluated data are usually obtained by measurements on samples in microwell plates and are often subjected to artefacts that can bias the result selection we report here a novel edge effect correction algorithm suitable for rna_interference rnai screening because its normalization does not rely on the entire dataset and takes_into the specificities of such a screening process the proposed method is able to estimate the edge_effects for each assay plate individually using the data from a single control column based on diffusion model and thus targeting a specific but recurrent well known hts artefact this method was first developed and validated using control plates and was then applied to the correction of experimental_data generated during a genome_wide sirna screen aimed at studying hivhost interactions the proposed algorithm was able to correct the edge effect biasing the control data and thus improve assay quality and consequently the hit selection_step in high_throughput hts campaign although most repetitive errors can be controlled some biases such as edge_effects also called border effects which appear after a long incubation_period cannot easily be corrected due to well to well discrepancies inherent in the spatial_structure of each plate in these cases a number of post screening correction methods have been developed to normalize the data and are currently applied to small_molecule based screens recently the emergence of genome_wide rna_interference rnai hts has raised experimental complications such as the requirement for more incubation time than compoundbased screens however because of the specificity of the small_interfering sirna library format and the diversity of phenotypes induced after sirna treatment the classical_methods developed for post_processing in compound screens cannot be efficiently implemented in rnai screens within this framework the relevance of the positive results or hits is highly linked to the consistency of each test within the complete screening campaign thus every experimental parameter is a potential source of variation and can lower the accuracy of the entire screen consequently the entire_process must be designed to maximize the similarity between each individual experiment in such a context each spatial or time dependent dissimilarity can also be considered to be a possible source of response variability the most widely used platform for biological_experiments in hts is the microtitre_plate hereinafter referred to simply as plate it is basically a rectangular rigid support containing an array of wells each containing a single experiment this type of support displays intrinsic heterogeneity in its spatial design each well has a unique physical location making it different from the others in terms of its immediate neighbours thus the surrounding properties of a given well can have consequences for its response usually a cellular_phenotype in the biological experiment this is especially true for wells that are located at the border of the plate therefore this locational variability can cause a differential in response across the plate in practice locationdependent variations in observed phenotypes can be due to many physical causes such as temperature and evaporation differences inhomogeneous cell or agent dispensing cross_contamination or plate_reader edge_effects in many applications these factors are either neglected or prevented by the use of specific countermeasures nevertheless because of the expense and technology involved in a screening campaign such preventive_measures are not always feasible or applicable in these cases post correction of the data is mandatory in compound based screening methods for correcting spatial_patterns of variation in plate responses have been widely_studied and described in the literature these methodologies relypage
