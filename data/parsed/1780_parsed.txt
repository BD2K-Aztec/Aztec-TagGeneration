fast overlapping of protein contact_maps by alignment of eigenvectors motivation searching for structural_similarity is a key issue of protein functional_annotation the maximum contact_map overlap cmo is one of the possible measures of protein_structure similarity exact and approximate_methods known to optimize the cmo are computationally_expensive and this hampers their applicability to large_scale comparison of protein_structures results in this article we describe a heuristic_algorithm al eigen for finding a solution to the cmo problem our approach relies on the approximation of contact_maps by eigendecomposition we obtain good overlaps of two contact_maps by computing the optimal global_alignment of few principal eigenvectors our algorithm is simple fast and its running time is independent of the amount of contacts in the map experimental_testing indicates that the algorithm is comparable to exact cmo methods in terms of the overlap quality to structural alignment_methods in terms of structure similarity detection and it is fast enough to be suited for large_scale comparison of protein_structures furthermore our preliminary tests indicates that it is quite robust to noise which makes it suitable for structural_similarity detection also for noisy and incomplete contact_maps measuring the similarity of protein_structures is a necessary step in several problems of bioinformatics including the determination of structure conservation through evolution across species and or the relation among structure and function several similarity_measures of protein_structures are available albeit no general agreement on the best one has been achieved routinely each similarity measure relies on the choice of a scoring_function and on the assumption that its optimum corresponds to the best possible match between two protein_structures the most widely_adopted scoring measures are based on the root_mean rmsd distance map similarity contact_map overlap cmo to whom correspondence should be addressed and recently universal similarity_metric ums the maximum cmo measure quantifies the level of similarity between two protein_structures by measuring the maximum overlap of their contact_maps and it is obtained by computing the sequence_alignment that maximizes the number of corresponding contacts between pairs of aligned residues the maximum cmo is one of the few measures for which exact algorithms are known on the other hand the maximum cmo problem is known to be np_hard although not explicitly stated in previous papers dealing with cmo algorithms the goal of the these tools is to address the problem of protein_structure in practice given a set of predicted contacts the basic idea is to look for the best possible physical contact_map among the available ones by means of a cmo program methods for contact_prediction are presently not accurate enough to allow protein_structure reconstruction the main contribution of cmo algorithms is therefore to provide tools for template recognition when the native protein_structure is unknown and not to substitute structural alignment_methods i e methods based on rmsd and distance map similarity_measures which perform quite well the first exact algorithm for the maximum cmo problem based on integer_programming ip was developed inand improved in later several other methods based on the same approach were proposed the ip approach consists in formulating the cmo as the maximization of some integer linear function and solving it with lagrangian relaxation lr and or branch and bound reduction techniques the disadvantage of ip based_methods is that due to the intractability of the problem they are exponential in the worst_case for a practical usage the running time of these algorithms is bounded and the best solution within the time limit is returned the counter part is that the ip based_methods provide upper and lower bounds to the optimal_solution and this makes it possible to evaluate the quality of the partial solution from the distance between the upper and lower_bound the best possible overlap is found when the upper and lower bounds coincide recently two polynomial time approximation schemes for the protein_structure problem in particular contact_map alignment have been developed the approximation algorithm described inis polynomial in the protein length but it is exponential with respect to some constant parameters and its running time increases with decrease of an approximation factor the method developed
