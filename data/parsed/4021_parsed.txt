rknots topological_analysis of knotted biopolymers with r motivation rknots is a flexible r package providing tools for the detection and characterization of topological knots in biological polymers the package is well documented and provides a simple syntax for data import and preprocessing structure reduction topological analyses and d and d visualization remarkably rknots is not limited to protein knots and allows researchers from interdisciplinary fields to analyze different topological structures and to develop simple yet fully custom pipelines availability rknots is distributed under the gpl license and is available from the cran the comprehensive_r at http cran r project org_web rknotsthe topological study of knotted biological polymers is an active interdisciplinary field of research in polymers knots influence both material_properties and polymer_chain dynamics informally knots are closed curves in d and links are collections of non intersecting knots hence knot theory deals with closed structures see_supplementary for an informal introduction to the subject however the vast_majority of biological or synthetic_polymers are open chains in this context the definition of knot is relaxed and transferred to open curves a chain is knotted if it does not disentangle after being pulled from both ends nature tends to avoid knots knotted protein backbones are rare and the physical mechanisms_governing their formation is largely_unknown intriguing experimental_results unraveling protein knots properties have recently been reported and in certain viral capsids there are evidences of mechanisms preventing knotted dna formation in order to understand structural_properties of knotted polymers rigorous yet simply to use generalized computational_methods are required web_servers for protein knots analysis nicely accomplished this for proteins however the to whom correspondence should be addressed underlying framework cannot be generalized to cope with more complex structures and it cannot be customized in this note we present rknots an r package combining a generalized framework for the topological_analysis of knotted biopolymers with the benefits of r programming different structures can be analyzed with a simple syntax and methods have been implemented accounting for modularity rknots requires a standard r installation and depends on bio d and rsympyrsympy r interface to sympy computer algebra system r package version in the following we will provide an overview of the available methods a case study on a knotted protein will be used as an example additional examples can be found in the package manual and vignette at http cran r project org_web rknotsthe following example illustrates a typical rknots session for the analysis of a protein of interest a monomeric left_handed trefoil knotted protein pdb id k a has been selected for this case study first the protein is imported with the function loadprotein gaps finding is performed with default parameter cutoff library rknots pdb loadprotein pdbid k a cutoff second a knot object is created simply by providing the protein coordinates of the single polypeptide_chain to newknot chain newknot pdb a third the open chain is closed and projected using the closeandproject function the knot diagram can then be visualized with plot chain closeandproject chain plot chain lwd then the knot type is determined by computing a polynomial invariant with the computeinvariant function by setting invariant homfly the homfly polynomial is returned computeinvariant chain invariant homfly finally further information on the knot type can be obtained with the function getknottype see the package vignette for details rknots is the first package providing generalized tools for the study of knotted biopolymers the modularity of the package allows integration in custom pipelines we encourage contributions from other members of the research_community
