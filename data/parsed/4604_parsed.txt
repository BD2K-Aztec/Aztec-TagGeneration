gene_expression the hematopoietic expression viewer expanding mobile_apps as a scientific tool many important data in current biological science comprise hundreds thousands or more individual results these massive data require computational_tools to navigate results and effectively interact with the content mobile_device apps are an increasingly important tool in the everyday_lives of scientists and non scientists alike these software present individuals with compact and efficient tools to interact with complex data at meetings or other locations remote from their main computing environment we believe that apps will be important tools for biologists geneticists and physicians to review content while participating in biomedical_research or practicing medicine we have developed a prototype app for displaying gene_expression data using the ios platform to present the software engineering requirements we review the model view controller schema for apples ios we apply this schema to a simple app for querying locally developed microarray_gene the challenge of this application is to balance between storing content locally within the app versus obtaining it dynamically via a network connection availability the hematopoietic expression viewer is available at http www shawlab org he viewer the source_code for this project and any future information on how to obtain the app can be accessed at http www shawlab org he viewer
