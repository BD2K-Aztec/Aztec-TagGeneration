databases_and dbsno a database of cysteine s nitrosylation s nitrosylation sno a selective and reversible protein post_translational that involves the covalent_attachment of nitric_oxide no to the sulfur_atom of cysteine critically regulates protein activity localization and stability due to its importance in regulating protein functions and cell_signaling a mass_spectrometry method rapidly evolved to increase the dataset of experimentally_determined sno sites however there is currently no database dedicated to the integration of all experimentally_verified s nitrosylation sites with their structural or functional information thus the dbsno database is created to integrate all available data_sets and to provide their structural analysis up to april the dbsno has manually accumulated experimentally_verified s nitrosylated peptides from research_articles using a text_mining approach to solve the heterogeneity among the data collected from different sources the sequence_identity of these reported s nitrosylated peptides are mapped to the uniprotkb protein entries to delineate the structural correlation and consensus motif of these sno sites the dbsno database also provides structural and functional_analyses including the motifs of substrate sites solvent_accessibility protein secondary_and protein_domains and gene_ontology availability the dbsno is now freely_accessible via http dbsno mbc nctu edu tw the database content is regularly updated upon collecting new data obtained from continuously surveying research_articles contacts of the various post_translational ptms s nitrosylation sno is reversible and involves the covalent_attachment of nitric_oxide no to the thiol group of cysteine_residues an increasing number of studies suggest that protein s nitrosylation plays an important role in the no related redox pathway especially in immune cardiovascular neuronal and plant systems the various targets of s nitrosylation and differential_expression of those targets modulate the activity localization and stability of proteins and further regulate patho physiological_events such as neurodegenerative_diseases and cancers due to the importance of s nitrosylation in biological_processes numerous efforts have been directed toward mass_spectrometry based s nitrosyl proteomic_studies using various biological_systems to increase significantly the number of known s nitrosylated peptides among these studies the biotin switch method is the most commonly adapted method for the site_specific identification of protein s nitrosylation as the number of experimentally_identified s nitrosylated peptides grows a structured database of protein s nitrosylation is desirable for the further investigation of the biological_functions of s nitrosylated proteins and the substrate_specificities of sno sites although a number of databases have been developed for post_translational such as dbptm phospho elm phosphosite o glycbase ubiprot dbogap and pupdb there is no database dedicated to s nitrosylated proteins and their corresponding substrate sites thus a new database dbsno containing the experimentally_verified s nitrosylated peptides from research_articles is proposed to facilitate with the functional analysis of s nitrosylated proteins and assist with the structural investigation of s nitrosylation sites the dbsno database is the first public resource to allow efficient access to curated sno sites functional_annotations structural_characteristics and substrate motifs for s nitrosylated proteins with regard to the computational_prediction of sno sites dbsno could provide the benchmark_dataset for the development and comparison of prediction_tools
