systems_biology exact likelihood computation in boolean_networks with probabilistic time delays and its application in signal network_reconstruction motivation for biological_pathways it is common to measure a gene_expression time series after various knockdowns of genes that are putatively involved in the process of interest these interventional time resolved data are most suitable for the elucidation of dynamic causal_relationships in signaling_networks even with this kind of data it is still a major and largely unsolved challenge to infer the topology and interaction logic of the underlying regulatory_network results in this work we present a novel model based_approach involving boolean_networks to reconstruct small_to regulatory_networks in particular we solve the problem of exact likelihood computation in boolean_networks with probabilistic exponential time delays simulations_demonstrate the high_accuracy of our approach we apply our method to data of ivanova et_al where rna_interference knockdown experiments were used to build a network of the key regulatory_genes governing mouse stem_cell and differentiation in contrast to previous_analyses of that data_set our method can identify feedback_loops and provides new insights into the interplay of some master_regulators in embryonic_stem development the inference of signaling_networks from biological data is of fundamental_importance for a systemic understanding of regulatory_processes the statistical_methods that have been developed for that purpose can be grouped according to the type of data that they expect as input many approaches use gene_expression data some methods are based solely on static observations of the unperturbed system they exploit the fact that fluctuations of interacting components are dependent the use of perturbation data greatly_improves network_reconstruction to resolve the order of events in a signaling_cascade time resolved measurements after perturbation yield further improvements boolean_networks are an appropriate tool for dealing with this type of data the most difficult problem lies in accounting for the mostly unknown time delays with which the signal is propagated through the network in this work we propose boolean_networks with probabilistic time delays as a novel statistical network inference_method there have been attempts to calculate the likelihood of a boolean_network in special cases by using markov_chain mcmc sampling and for dynamic nested effects models exact results were so_far obtained only under strong restrictions on the logic functions involved as in the context of conjunctive bayesian_networks by analytically marginalizing over the unknown delay times we derive our main_result an exact and efficient recursive likelihood formula for a broad class of boolean_networks with exponentially_distributed time delays that may include feedback_loops we evaluate our method in various simulation scenarios for its ability to recover the unknown topology the method is then applied to a murine stem_cell knockdown data_set by which consists of a set of whole_genome gene_expression time series after the knockout of six genes essrb sox nanog tcl oct and tbx that are considered key_regulators in the maintenance and differentiation of mouse_embryonic our analysis reveals more feedback_loops than previously detected in this work we developed an algorithm that permits us to analyze gene_knockdown time series experiments which have high_dimensional readouts such as gene_expression to elucidate the interplay of the major regulators all of them need to be perturbed and measured individually on the side of methods development we have solved the problem of calculating the likelihood_function for data generated from a boolean_network with probabilistic exponentially_distributed time delays algorithm the likelihood_function can be used for network_reconstruction as has been demonstrated in our simulation_studies having a closed form solution for the likelihood has several further applications that we did not mention so_far it is possible to sample the joint_distribution pbj f rather efficiently because many observations b can be excluded a priori knowing and f this allows for accounting for some hidden_variables b k among the observed b by integrating them out furthermore it is possible to calculate the expectation of a certain b j to be on or off in a given time interval as an application we have devised a method to apply it to data in which the values of the boolean_network can only be observed indirectly algorithm we analyzed murine stem_cell data offor the purpose of signaling network_reconstruction comparison with a previous reconstruction attempt inrevealed a much richer feedback structure than expected our method suggests regulatory feedback_loops that lead to a better understanding of the dynamic interplay of some master_regulators in murine embryonic_stem development we expect our method to find numerous applications as protein_abundance data become increasingly available
