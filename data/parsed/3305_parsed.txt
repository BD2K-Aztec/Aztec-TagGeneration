nucleusj an imagej plugin for quantifying d images of interphase_nuclei nucleusj is a simple and user_friendly imagej plugin dedicated to the characterization of nuclear_morphology and chromatin_organization in d starting from image_stacks the nuclear boundary is delimited by combining the otsu segmentation_method with optimization of nuclear sphericity chromatin domains are segmented by partitioning the nucleus using a d watershed algorithm and by thresholding a contrast measure over the resulting regions as output nucleusj quantifies parameters including shape and size of nuclei as well as intra nuclear objects and their position within the nucleus a step_by documentation is available for self training together with data_sets of nuclei with different nuclear organization availability_and dataset of nuclei is available at https www gred clermont fr media workdirectory zip nucleusj is available at http imagejdocu tudor lu the nucleus is a compartmentalized organelle containing distinct chromosomal domains and a variety of nuclear bodies organization and positioning of chromatin domains within the nuclear space such as clusters of heterochromatin termed chromocentres impact gene_expression to link nuclear_structure and function imaging_tools that quantify nuclear_morphology positioning and organization of chromatin domains in three dimensions d are needed although proprietary softwares or open_source programs such as nemo and tango are available they either require financial investment or minimal knowledge of image_processing our nucleusj plugin assembles a complete set of methods in a coherent strategy quantifies different nuclear and chromatin parameters and does not require expertise in image_analysis following segmentation a morphometric_analysis is applied to measure nuclear_volume and d shape descriptors flatness elongation and sphericity nucleusj also computes chromatin_organization parameters such as number total volume and intensity of chromocentres relative to the entire nucleus as well as individual chromocentre parameters including volume and distance to the nuclear_periphery overall the nucleus is characterized by quantitative_parameters and supplementary which are automatically saved as output_files for further statistical_analysis nucleusj was validated using an arabidopsis mutant_line lacking crowded nuclei crwn proteins which are putative components of the plant nucleoskeleton analysis of a small set of wild_type and crwn crwn mutant nuclei revealed reduced nuclear_volume increased sphericity and fewer chromocentres of increased size in the mutant compared with wt in perfect agreement with the analysis of the nuclei took about h the time limiting step is the manual thresholding of contrast_images for chromocentre segmentation since it involves visual crosschecking with raw images the statistical_analysis of the data validates our method and opens avenues to phenotype nuclei in other arabidopsis mutants as well as in different cell_types of other organisms computational image_analysis provides precise objective and reproducible quantitative data from images our plugin generates within a few steps d quantitative_measurements from single images or large_data without requiring expertise in image_analysis nuclear domains visible with dna dyes such as chromocentres are not specific to plants nucleusj will therefore be useful for a large community of users interested in quantifying size_and of nuclei nuclear objects or chromatin domains as well as positioning of the latter in nuclear space in the future we expect to improve our segmentation_methods to extend nucleusj to quantify fluorescent_in fish and immunochemistry signals and to define a new method to automatically segment chromocentres
