netrave constructing dependency networks using sparse linear_regression netrave is a small suite of r functions for generating dependency networks using sparse regression_methods such networks provide an alternative to interpreting top n lists of genes arising out of an analysis of microarray_data and they provide a means of organizing and visualizing the resulting information in a manner that may suggest relationships between genes the advent of microarray_technology has spawned a plethora of statistical and machine_learning to analyze the resulting expression data their ultimate aim is to guide the researcher to some understanding of how the observed patterns of gene_expression are related to the phenotype being studied and to suggest hypotheses that merit further exploration in this note we outline netrave a two step approach to analyzing microarray_data that combines a fast sparse variable_selection method known as generave with dependency networks an alternative to bayesian_networks developed by netrave is a descriptive tool whose use is facilitated by a small suite of r r development core_functions that interface with the existing libraries to visualize the resulting networks its output is a local dependency network that encapsulates the results of the data analysis in a form that is easy to visualize and provides users with additional information about local relationships between gene_transcripts these local relationships can then be used to generate hypotheses that can lead to further experimentation there are a few options for generating and visualizing dependency networks that are discussed in the documentation accompanying netrave and in the supplementary_material in our experience in analyzing this and other datasets we have found many of the genes in a local network are also found in top n lists of differentially_expressed obtained by for example modified t tests here of the genes inappear in the top list of for example they found that aldh a depth and cyp b depth were highly up regulated in smokers however the network imposes an additional structure on those lists that provides the researcher with a means of organizing and visualizing that information the dependency network inshows other genes that were not comparatively highly up or down_regulated yet that are related to the effects of cigarette_smoking for example akr b is a potential diagnostic_marker of non_small and together with other aldoketo reductase genes akr c akr c and akr c participates in the metabolism of xenobiotics the up regulation of pir which appears at depth represents one mechanism by which cigarette_smoke induces_apoptosis in the airway_epithelium and many other such examples in molecular toxicology research it is well documented that the transcription_factor aryl_hydrocarbon ahr also called the dioxin receptor enhances gene_transcription upon activation by polycyclic hydrocarbons such as those found in cigarette_smoke reviewed in it is tempting to speculate that some gene linkages within the network inare due to coordinated gene_expression in response to activation of ahr by cigarette_smoke toxins but the truth is inevitably more complex consider the effect of smoking on epithelial inflamation linkages between some genes such as
