data_and web_based gene pathogenicity analysis wgpa a web platform to interpret gene pathogenicity from personal genome data as the volume of patient specific genome_sequences increases the focus of biomedical_research is switching from the detection of disease mutations to their interpretation to this end a number of techniques have been developed that use mutation data collected within a population to predict whether individual genes are likely to be disease_causing or not as both sequence_data and associated analysis tools proliferate it becomes increasingly difficult for the community to make sense of these data and their implications moreover no single analysis tool is likely to capture all relevant genomic_features that contribute to the genes pathogenicity here we introduce web_based gene pathogenicity analysis wgpa a web_based to analyze genes impacted by mutations and rank them through the integration of existing prioritization_tools which assess different aspects of gene pathogenicity using population level sequence_data additionally to explore the polygenic contribution of mutations to disease wgpa implements gene_set to prioritize disease_causing and gene_interaction therefore providing a comprehensive annotation of personal genomes data in disease with the growing volume of patient specific sequences that is being generated there is an increasing need to annotate these data and distinguish possible disease_causing from benign mutations to this end a number of approaches have been developed to prioritize genes based on their predicted pathogenicity using wholeexome and whole_genome data a recently_introduced class of approaches use the pattern of functional sequence_variation i e rare and common mutations observed in the human population the likelihood of observed mutations according to evolution or statistical modelling of genes under selective constraint to prioritize rank diseasecausing genes from sets of genes impacted by mutations differently from sequence variant level analysis e g polyphen these methods specifically allow a gene level analysis of pathogenicity providing elegant yet distinct schemes to evaluate the significance for individual genes in disease here we provide an easy to use web_based webbased gene pathogenicity analysis or wgpa that integrates these methods for gene level pathogenicity analysis as well as any future scoring system therefore facilitating the assessment of the evidence
