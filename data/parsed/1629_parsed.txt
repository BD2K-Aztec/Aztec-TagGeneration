estimating ibd_tracts from low coverage ngs_data motivation the amount of ibd in an individual depends on the relatedness of the individuals parents however it can also provide information regarding mating system past history and effective size of the population from which the individual has been sampled results here we present a new method for estimating inbreeding ibd_tracts from low coverage ngs_data contrary to other methods that use genotype data the one presented here uses genotype likelihoods to take the uncertainty of the data into account we benchmark it under a wide_range of biologically_relevant conditions and show that the new method provides a marked_increase in accuracy even at low coverage availability_and the methods presented in this work were implemented in c c and are freely_available use from https github com fgvieira ngsf hmm the inference of inbreeding levels is of central importance in many studies of ecology evolution and conservation biology inbred individuals often have lower fitness than offspring of unrelated parents and a cumulative_effect can reduce the population growth_rate and probability of persistence o furthermore the study of inbreeding levels on natural_populations can shed light into the species mating system and past history and is important for understanding the distribution of genetic_variation within and among populations and consequently the effect of natural_selection in addition to the genome_wide inbreeding_coefficient of an individual further information can be gained by examining the distribution of inbred or identity by descent ibd regions throughout the genome these regions are usually organized into tracts of homozygous genotypes that recombination breaks down over time their number and lengths are tightly_coupled to population_genetics processes from fine_scale population_structure effective_population selfing and recombination_rate to age and type of inbreeding and even relatedness of the parents briefly short tracts reflect old inbreeding in the population possibly due to large effective_population while long tracts may reflect recent inbreeding either due to small effective_population or familial matings under certain conditions and carefully_designed experiments the identification of ibd_tracts can even be used for other types of analyses like mapping of recombination breakpoints from back crossed individuals as common descent is always guaranteed for any pair of homologous loci ibd is often defined relative to an expectation under a certain model an example is ibd due to recent familial relationships relative to the expectation of genetic identity for two individuals sampled at random from the population a common operational definition of inbreeding is the excess of homozygosity compared to the hardyweinberg equilibrium expectation this corresponds to classical population_genetic definitions dating back toand is in effect the definition used here and in many previous papers based on individual genotype data current next_generation ngs_technologies can sometimes produce data with high_error due to random_sampling of homologous base_pairs sequencing or alignment errors furthermore due to budget constraints many ngs studies rely on low or medium depth of coverage sequence_data per individual causing genotype_calling to be made with a considerable amount of uncertainty the uncertainty especially from low depth data can greatly bias inferences of ibd_tracts as sites with sequencing_errors can be mistaken for heterozygote sites thereby breaking up the tracts into smaller segments many recent methods rely on probabilistic frameworks to account for these errors and accurately call snps and genotypes even at low coverage these methods integrate the base quality_score together with other error sources e g mapping or sequencing_errors to calculate an overall genotype likelihood b these likelihoods can be used directly or combined with priors to take into account the uncertainty associated with the data for reviews see there are several methods available to infer inbreeding_coefficients but only ngsf is suitable for low coverage ngs_data however this program only estimates genome_wide inbreeding levels and is thus incapable of inferring ibd_tracts in this paper we present a new method to estimate ibd_tracts from lowcoverage ngs_data we evaluate its accuracy using extensive biologically_relevant simulations and apply it to two real_datasets one consisting of populations from the hapmap and genomes projects and another consisting of varieties of wild and domesticated rice when comparing against genotype based_methods the method presented here performs considerably better when estimating ibd_tracts and per individual inbreeding_coefficients for coverages the levels of inbreeding in an individual is an important parameter in population genomic studies since it can reflect mating system selfing rates population_size and past population history theoretically the best way to infer it is through the pedigree but pedigrees are not available in much studies however even in these cases inferences based on pedigrees can be biased due to incomplete knowledge of the pedigree in addition pedigrees provide expected levels of inbreeding but these may differ from true genetic levels of inbreeding due to the stochasticity of allelic segregation and recombination this has been demonstrated by recent analyses identifying higher than expected roh prevalence in unrelated_individuals from outbred populations supporting a recent claim that estimates based on markers are more accurate than expected_values inferred from pedigrees here we have developed a method that can reliably estimate individual identical by descent ibd_tracts and inbreeding_coefficient directly from genomic_data without requiring any knowledge of the underlying genealogy other methods exist for this but all were developed for snp chip data which has much lower error_rates than low coverage ngs_data ngs_technologies have revolutionized genetics by providing fast cheap and reliable large_scale dna sequencing_data however the per base_pair error_rate in ngs_data is still considerably_higher than in sanger_sequencing or chip based genotyping technologies as a consequence researchers usually sequence at high sequencing_depths but this comes at an increased financial computational and storage cost furthermore due to the ever growing demand for larger_sample many ngs studies rely on low coverage ngs sequence_data as such the availability of methods that can properly handle this data will help researchers make more cost_effective choices in the trade_off between sample_size and sequencing_depth the method presented here facilitates the estimation of ibd_tracts from low coverage ngs_data we evaluate its performance through both simulated_and analyses when compared to genotype_calling based_methods the improvement in accuracy when estimating ibd_tracts and individual inbreeding_coefficients is considerable for sequencing_depths apart from the previously mentioned use of this methods in population genomic studies we note that there is another possible application of the method mapping of recombination breakpoints in backcrosses between inbred_lines in backcross data each individual in the backcross generation effectively has an inbreeding_coefficient of f the method presented here allows the estimation of recombination_rates for such data by estimation of the parameter a more importantly the posterior decoding algorithm provides estimates of the genomic location of recombination breakpoints this provides in combination with low coverage ngs sequencing of a backcross generation an efficient design for mapping recombination breakpoints from model species such as yeast
