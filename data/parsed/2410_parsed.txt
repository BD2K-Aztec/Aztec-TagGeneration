imseq a fast and error aware approach to immunogenetic sequence_analysis motivation recombined t and b cell receptor repertoires are increasingly being studied using next_generation ngs in order to interrogate the repertoire composition as well as changes in the distribution of receptor clones under different physiological and disease_states this type of analysis requires efficient and unambiguous clonotype assignment to a large number of ngs read sequences including the identification of the incorporated v and j gene_segments and the cdr sequence current_tools have deficits with respect to performance accuracy and documentation of their underlying algorithms and usage results we present imseq a method to derive clonotype repertoires from ngs_data with sophisticated routines for handling errors stemming from pcr and sequencing artefacts the application can handle different kinds of input_data originating from single or paired_end in different configurations and is generic regarding the species and gene of interest we have carefully evaluated our method with simulated and real_world data and show that imseq is superior to other tools with respect to its clonotyping as well as standalone error_correction and runtime performance availability_and imseq was implemented in c using the seqan library for efficient sequence_analysis it is freely_available under the gplv open_source and can be downloaded at www imtools org t and b cells are lymphocytes that form part of the adaptive or acquired immune system in vertebrates these cells express an antigen_receptor on their surface the t cell receptor tcr or b cell receptor immunoglobulin ig which is responsible for the recognition of antigens due to the enormous_number of potential antigens a large diversity among these receptors is required the key behind that diversity is that in the germline genome there is no functional tcr or ig gene instead it is generated by recombination of germline encoded gene_segments as well as random base additions and deletions upon differentiation of t and b cell precursors in the thymus and bone_marrow this somatic recombination_process is referred to as v d j recombination and explained in more detail in the following section the cells transmit their recombined receptor gene to daughter_cells upon proliferation allowing for a targeted immune_response against antigens recently methods have been developed to enrich these recombined genes in order to capture the repertoires of unique gene sequences using next_generation ngs the derived data i e populations of such unique gene sequences referred to as clonotypes can be used to better understand how the adaptive_immune works the underlying samples for this analysis can be full t or b cell_populations from blood urine biopsies or other sources or antigen specific_subpopulations that have been exposed to antigen in vitro and subsequently selected for activation markers using methods such as flow_cytometry also specialized cells e g regulatory memory or effector t cells can be sorted with immunophenotyping protocols ngs based t and b cell clonotype analysis thus opens up new possibilities of qualitative_and repertoire assessment recently such methods were applied for tcr and ig repertoire analysis in healthy and diseased conditions a number of data characteristics can be measured and are medically relevant including repertoire size and diversity under different conditions or for different subpopulations as well as shared clonotypes across different individuals and the tracking of particular clonotype subgroups applications in medical and clinical research include the identification and tracking of clonotypes with known antigen specificities in vaccination studies differential_diagnosis in transplant patients or the usage of clonotypes as biomarkers in patients with lymphoid_malignancies here we present imseq a method to derive clonotypes from ngs sequence_data it can recognize and correct likely sequencingor pcr errors can quickly process large_datasets and was extensively tested on simulated and experimental_data we also show that it outperforms currently available software_tools imseq is open_source and available online http www imtools org we have presented imseq a fast and flexible tool for tcr ig repertoire analysis from ngs_data our method is capable of handling se as well as overlapping and spe data apart from per read clonotyping it also features error_correction methods to resolve false clonotype calls originating from pcr and sequencing_errors as well as a method to correct for ambiguously assigned gene_segments the results produced by imseq were thoroughly validated using simulated_data the tools performance was compared with that of other state of the art standalone tcr ig clonotypers available namely decombinator tcrklass mitcr and migeccdrblast our evaluations show that the clonotyping capabilities of imseq are superior to those of decombinator and mitcr while being comparable to those of migec cdrblast and tcrklass however imseq substantially outperformed the latter tools with respect to runtime when it comes to the error_correction performance imseq could only be compared with mitcr and showed superior_performance especially with regards to the precision of clonotype detection migeccdrblast has additional requirements for the experimental_setup namely the incorporation of umis to be able to perform any kind of error_correction decombinator does not support error_correction at all and was also excluded from the evaluation due to its poor clonotyping performance the tcrklass error_correction does not seem to include the cdr region and therefore does not effectively reduce the number of false clonotype calls due to errors the evaluation of the impact of spe sequencing showed a great_improvement in v segment accuracy when compared with se sequencing with the same overall read_length to conclude imseq is a rapid well tested flexible and erroraware clonotyping and repertoire generation tool that was shown to be superior to available tools with regard to clonotyping and standalone error_correction capabilities
