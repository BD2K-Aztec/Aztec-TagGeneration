subject section kscons a bayesian_approach for protein residue_contact using the knob_socket model of protein tertiary_structure motivation by simplifying the many bodied complexity of residue packing into patterns of simple pairwise secondary_structure interactions between a single knob residue with a three residue socket the knob_socket construct allows a more direct incorporation of structural_information into the prediction of residue_contacts by modeling the preferences between the amino_acid of a socket and knob we undertake an investigation of the knob_socket constructs ability to improve the prediction of residue_contacts the statistical_model considers three priors and two posterior estimations to better understand how the input_data affects predictions this produces six implementations of kscons that are tested on three sets psicov casp and casp we compare against the current leading contact prediction_methods results the results demonstrate the usefulness as well as the limits of knob_socket based structural_modeling of protein contacts the construct is able to extract good predictions from known structural homologs while its performance degrades when no homologs exist among our six implementations kscons_mst which uses the multiple structure alignment prior and marginal posterior incorporating structural homolog information performs the best in all three prediction sets an analysis of recall and precision finds that kscons_mst improves accuracy not only by improving identification of true_positives but also by decreasing the number_of over the casp and casp sets kscons_mst performs better than the leading methods using only evolutionary coupling data but not quite as well as the supervised_learning methods of metapsicov and coindca nn that incorporate a large set of structural_features contact due to the resource_intensive nature of experimental protein structure_determination the amount of information about protein_structure lags far behind the amount of known protein sequence_data yet a protein_structure yields a deeper_understanding of how a protein functions as well as how it is controlled in a biological system since anfinesens insightful experiments on protein_folding it is generally_accepted that all the information on a proteins structure is coded in its amino_acid therefore automatic_methods that predict protein_structure from its sequence are a particular focus of computational biochemistry as a step towards developing a protein_structure method this work describes the statistical_model for the prediction of protein residue_contacts using the novel knob_socket model of protein residue packing structure there are four distinct levels of protein_structure the sequential chemical bonded nature of a polypeptide_chain of amino_acids allows the structure of protein g pgb is shown with the backbone in ribbon and residues as ball and stick for clarity the sheet is shown in blue the helix in orange because of the many bodied contacts between residue the bullet interactions are difficult to identify even when isolated in the circles in contrast the knob_socket representation of bullet packing provides a clear decomposition of the packing surfaces between the helix and sheet such that the interpretation of packing are simple pairings of knobs packing into sockets to be consistent with the color theme the knob_socket packing surface topology map shows knobs from sheets in blue helix in orange and coil in green as examples the interactions in the circles reference the sheet knob f packing into a helix socket made up of residues a e f and also the helix knob y packing into the sheet socket made up of residues l l t where the sockets are given in the standard notation therefore instead of pairwise residue_contacts the bullet residue packing contacts are classified as knob_socket interactions which allow a direct mapping of structure to sequence_patterns the primary bullet structure of a protein to be simply represented as the linear sequence of the amino_acids at the secondary bullet level of protein_structure the patterns of chemical interactions called hydrogen_bonds determine the state assigned at that position in the sequence the set of interactions that bring these bullet structure elements together within a polypeptide_chain is called the tertiary bullet level of protein_structure the last quaternary bullet level of protein_structure occurs between two separate polypeptide_chains in prediction of protein_structure the goal is to predict a proteins bullet structure from the amino_acid bullet sequence an important part of predicting protein bullet structure is to correctly identify the residues close in three dimensional_space that define the topology of the folded backbone as a result residue_contact has become its own category in computational_structural as discussed in the most recent critical assessment of structure_prediction casp review of contact prediction_methods accurate_predictions of residue_contacts have been successfully used to model soluble as well as transmembrane protein_structures recently it has been estimated that long_range contact is needed per every residues for an accurate prediction of protein bullet structure a thorough review comparison of the major contact prediction_methods has been performed and serves as a good benchmark generally these approaches to contact_prediction are based on the concept of evolutionary coupling ec where residues packing near in space will most likely mutate with each other this approach is most successful when there are many sequence homologs to provide a deep enough multiple_sequence to identify covariation between positions to address cases with low sequence_information characteristics from protein_structure usually on the order of hundreds have been added to ec to properly integrate these large number of multiple inputs machine_learning like support_vector or neural nets have been used at the most recent th casp meeting the consip server of the metapsicov method demonstrated quantifiable progress even on targets with little to no sequence homologs by implementing a supervised machine_learning approach that combined several ec protocols with over protein features to address the lack of sequence_information by identifying exact residue_contacts from bullet structure packing the knob_socket model provides a simpler and more direct approach to incorporate structural data that is complementary to the aforementioned methods for predicting protein contacts in a series of papers a novel description of protein bullet packing has been developed that uses a new construct to predict protein contacts the knob_socket model represents a paradigm_shift in the characterization of protein_structure by directly relating protein_sequence and the arrangement of residues in bullet structure as shown in the model decomposes the complexity of the multibody residue interactions into discrete patterns of a four residue packing unit called the knob_socket essentially the entire bullet structure simply maps into residue sockets which include irregular coil structure that exist in either a filled or free_state to define bullet structure a filled socket packs with a knob residue to form bullet structure and reduces the manybodied residue packing interactions into a simple two body mapping of knob_socket patterns a free socket indicates those regions of the structure that are not involved in bullet structure it has been shown that the types of amino_acids that make up the socket determine_whether a socket is filled or free as a result filled sockets provide a scoped definition for predicting residue_contacts in bullet in other words protein contacts can be modeled based on the propensity of the filled knob_socket interactions in this work we investigate the usefulness of a knob_socket based_approach to protein contact_prediction one challenge in identifying the residue_contacts is projecting the bullet and bullet one dimensional structures into a three_dimensional arrangements of amino_acids the characterization of packing as a knob residue contacting three residues in a socket allows the direct mapping of three_dimensional residue arrangements to one dimensional contact pairs unlike the supervised_learning approaches that use hundreds of inputs to include structural_information our approach uses only the knob_socket construct we incorporate this protein structural_information defined by the knob_socket construct into a principled statistical_approach the bullet packing information provided by the knobsocket model is captured by our likelihood and the evolutionary data from structural homologs provides prior information in our bayesian_approach we name our proposed residue_contact program kscons to properly assess predictions kscons is run against structure sets the first is the set of structural families used to comprehensively compare a number of current contact_prediction routines that was originally used to characterize psicov the last are the more challenging sets of structures from casp and casp from the standard scores used in these comparisons kscons produces an improvement in the prediction of protein contacts and therefore demonstrates the usefulness of a structure based modeling of protein contacts in prediction we first trained the kscons sampling model i e equation with the aln data_set the training_set does not contain any target from any test_sets and so is properly jack knifed with respect to the test data_sets the statistics of these four data_sets are summarized in the supplement then we evaluated the performance of our method with different prior distributions and posterior estimates against the targets in the psicov test_set the targets in the casp test_set and the available targets in the casp test_set using common accuracy metrics kscons pairwise contact_prediction was compared consistently based on test_set with leading methods of coindca and psicov including the new implementations metapsicov and consip for kscons with an independent bernoulli prior we set the hyperparameter when using the mst or msq priors we set the hyperparameters which leads to a non informative hyperprior comparisons of different variants and estimation methods are summarized in tables and with complete tables in the supplement the prediction_accuracy is defined as the percentage of native contacts among the top predicted l l and l predicted contacts where l is the sequence_length contacts are short medium and long_range when the sequence distance between the two residues in a contact falls into three intervals and l respectively in only the performance of all different combinations of the prior distributions and posterior estimates on the psicov test_set is compared to identify the best implementation of kscons because the bernoulli prior was limited to only modeling sockets no information about long_range knob residue_contacts are modeled as a result this prior performed the poorest at predicting contacts for long_range but also was not much more accurate for medium and short range contacts the multiple structure sequence_alignment mst msq priors that incorporate evolutionary_information improved the prediction_accuracy however these priors need to be paired with an appropriate posterior estimate to take advantage of the evolutionary_relationships and produce significantly_improved accuracy of the posterior estimates the maximum a posteriori method map estimates did the worst with both priors this approach favored the socket triplets and knob_socket quartets with the highest probabilities in the aln data_set at the cost of identifying the unique and correct contacts for each protein in contrast using the marginal probability mp that selected pairs based on homology over a threshold included more correct contacts of the priors the bernoulli exhibited the worst improvement with the mp posterior estimate between the msq and mst priors the mst using a structural_alignment prior performed just about better than the msq using sequence alone this similarity in the performance of alignment priors is expected as both are one dimensional decompositions of the three_dimensional structure overall the best results for kscons were obtained using the mst structural evolutionary prior with the mp posterior estimate although the msq mp prior performs reasonably well compared to the ec methods of psicov and coindca kscons_mst exhibits marked improvement on this data_set in each of the categories from the psicov test_set the kscons_mst predictions improve prediction_accuracy by or over ec methods like psicov and coindca that leverage significantly more sequence_data than kscons generally the performance trends shown inwere consistent across each test_set see supplement for these reasons further comparisons to the casp and casp test_sets in tables and respectively are from the mst mp kscons models although complete tables are shown in the supplement regarding contact predictions in the more challenging casp set kscons_mst is again comparable to the best ec approaches of psicov and coindca kscons performs markedly better than psicov in this instance however kscons_mst contact predictions are just on average better than coindca which is within the equivalence of the standard_deviation the supervised_learning methods of metapsicov and coindca nn are both about better than the kscons_mst for the most recent casp kscons_mst contact prediction_accuracies are lower by but show similar improvement over the strictly ec methods of psicov and coindca again the supervised_learning metapsicov and coindca nn programs are about better the consip server using metapsicov had the strongest showing in casp for contact_prediction consip is an implementation of metapsicov a supervised machine_learning approach combining a number of ec methods only the l and l values were reported so our discussion is limited to these prediction_accuracies also kscons was tested on all structures while the consip server results are only for kscons_mst generally did not perform as well as the consip server results especially for short and medium range contacts additionally the casp set contained many targets that did not have many homologs the present implementation of kscons_mst needs homologs to make accurate_predictions in general current supervised_learning methods are more accurate than our implementation of the knob_socket approach due to this requirement for structural homologs even so results from all data_sets are impressive considering that the kscons approach is based primarily on modeling structural data using the simple knob_socket construct the supervised_learning methods are more complex in there using hundreds of inputs and furthermore do not provide insight on their successes or failures on the other hand the knob_socket construct allows us to investigate the performance of this approach to better understand the current strengths and limitations of the knobsocket implementation in kscons the classification precision and recall for were calculated complete tables for all variations are given in the supplement whileshows the values over the tests sets for the mst map and mst mp implementations of kscons precision is defined as the percentage of actual sockets that are correctly estimated over all predicted sockets consistent with previous methods the precision results showed that many false_positives are predicted which has been a recognized problem in contact_prediction the improvement of the mp over the map was clear in the precision and can be seen especially for the casp set where the mp identified more true contacts than the map recall is defined as the percentage of sockets that are correctly estimated over all actual sockets in comparison the msq and mst priors improved the recall of true contacts but more false_positives were found comparing the posterior estimates in the map predicted fewer true contacts and more contacts that were false than the mp these results indicate the need for homologs for accurate_predictions in this implementation of kscons because the map predicts contacts only using the isolated preference of knobs with sockets without context the predictions produce many false_positives and fewer true_negatives therefore certain knob_socket combinations that have high_frequency in the aln library of structures will always be predicted the mp uses the homolog and structural topology to provide context and attenuate the highly preferred knob sockets of the map to make more correct predictions more specifically an analysis of contact prediction_accuracy based on a state description of secondary_structure between casp and casp shows the accuracy of prediction using a state description of secondary_structure the improved_performance of kscons_mst in the casp data_set over the casp data_set involves not just identifying fewer correct contacts but also more false_positives for kscons_mst the strength is that the knob sockets are able to pull significant information from the packing of the structural homologs for both data_sets the trend is that helices are the most accurately_predicted contacts above with a drop to about for true_positives a significant fall off is seen in accuracy of predicting sheets coil is just a little worse with just over true_positives the lack of homologs in casp compared to casp shows that helical predictions suffer from more false_positives while the sheets and coil have more false_negatives helices are well represented in the training aln set with a local socket and non local knob_socket for helices the decrease in accuracy between casp and casp is mainly due to a increase in the false_positives a closer look at the more complete analysis in the supplement shows the helical contact predictions in the casp data_set make many more false_positives therefore kscons difficulty with helical contact_prediction is inclusion of more incorrect long_range without homologs or poor knob_socket predictions sheet sockets and knob sockets are both non local and problematic for the knob_socket construct for sheets the decrease in accuracy is due to a increase in false_negatives looking at the more detailed breakdown this increase is primarily due to more false_negatives from long_range in the casp data_set the coil contacts are local but random sockets while knob sockets are long_range like sheet predictions the coil contacts are difficult to model with very low accuracies the increase in false_positives seen in coil predictions also mirrors the difficulties with long_range percent socket prediction_accuracies for casp and casp target data_sets for helix sheet and coil secondary_structures ss the true_positives tp columns give the percents of sockets predicted correctly as free or filled false_positives fp columns are percents of filled sockets predicted as free or free sockets predicted as filled and false_negatives fn columns are percents of sockets not predicted as a complement to current ec and supervised_learning approaches to residue_contact the knob_socket construct allows the direct statistical_modeling of structure into sequence_space therefore the purpose of this work has been to develop a bayesian statistical_model using knob_socket information that maximizes contact prediction_accuracy from a combination of priors and posteriors the resulting program was then compared over different and difficult test_sets to gauge the overall performance on contact predictions against current leading methods this article is a natural extension of our preliminary work where we proposed a bayesian_model to predict bullet structure from bullet structure based on the knob_socket model of protein packing in bullet structure the combinations and comparisons revealed that a simple implementation of the knob_socket preferences requires known homologs to guide correct predictions testing priors and posterior estimates revealed that the multiple structure alignment prior and a marginal probability posterior mst mp combination maximized kscons prediction_accuracy without the mp the knob_socket preferences from the aln training_set are too dominant and lead to decreased contact prediction_accuracy because of the inclusion of more false_positives in other words kscons_mst improved the prediction true_positives and also true_negatives while kscons mstmp demonstrated greater contact prediction_accuracy in comparison to ec methods over the psicov dataset the more challenging casp and casp revealed that kscons_mst performs better than ec methods without the need for deep sequence_alignments but also has the same need for homologs for proteins with no homologs the supervised_learning methods are the most accurate even so this initial_implementation of the knob_socket model performs well in extracting correct contact predictions using a simple and intuitive construct as opposed to the complicated amalgamation of hundreds of inputs needed in the supervised_learning approaches because the knob_socket construct maps a direct correspondence between sequence and structure space the strengths_and of the current_implementation in contact_prediction can be identified this analysis provides a clear path to method improvement further work will be to understand how to improve the map that uses only the preferences from a protein_structure training_set in particular the goal is to identify how
