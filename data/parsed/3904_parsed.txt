rcp a novel probe design bias correction_method for illumina methylation beadchip motivation the illumina humanmethylation beadchip has been extensively utilized in epigenome_wide this array and its successor the methylationepic array use two types of probesinfinium i type i and infinium ii type_ii in order to increase genome_coverage but differences in probe chemistries result in different type i and ii distributions of methylation_values ignoring the difference in distributions between the two probe types may bias downstream_analysis results here we developed a novel method called regression on correlated probes rcp which uses the existing correlation between pairs of nearby type i and ii probes to adjust the beta values of all type_ii probes we evaluate the effect of this adjustment on reducing probe design type bias reducing technical variation in duplicate samples improving accuracy of measurements against known standards and retention of biological signal we find that rcp is statistically_significantly better than unadjusted data or adjustment with alternative_methods including swan and bmiq availability we incorporated the method into the r package enmix which is freely_available from the bioconductor website the advance of dna_methylation arrays in recent_years has enabled large_scale epigenome wide studies at single cpg_site resolution the illumina_infinium is currently the most commonly utilized array it provides measurement of methylation_level at about half a million individual cpg_sites its successor the infinium methylationepic beadchip provides measurement of methylation_level at more than sites to increase cpg coverage across the human_genome both arrays utilize probes of two different chemistries infinium i type i and infinium ii type_ii however methylation measurements beta values derived from the two types of probes exhibit different distributions in particular beta values derived from type_ii probes have a smaller dynamic range and are not as reproducible as the beta values derived from type i probes several methods have been proposed to normalize the beta values derived from the two types of probes these include adjusting the beta values from both types of probes so that they are more comparable e g swan implemented in the minfi package or adjusting beta values from type_ii probes using beta values from type i probes as referents e g the peak based correction pbc and beta mixture quantile dilation bmiq here we proposed a novel method of adjusting type_ii probe beta values based on the correlation between a subset of closely_spaced pairs of type i and ii probes this method regression on correlated probes rcp is simple accurate and efficient we tested rcp on multiple datasets and found that rcp outperformed bmiq and other methods rcp has been implemented in bioconductor_package enmix is freely_available for use and can be combined with other pre_processing methods
