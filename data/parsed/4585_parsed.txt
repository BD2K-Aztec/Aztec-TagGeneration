structural_bioinformatics the cleversuite approach for protein characterization predictions of structural_properties solubility chaperone requirements and rna binding_abilities motivation the recent shift towards high_throughput is posing new challenges for the interpretation of experimental_results here we propose the cleversuite approach for large_scale characterization of protein groups description the central part of the cleversuite is the clevermachine cm an algorithm that performs statistics on protein_sequences by comparing their physico_chemical propensities the second element is called cleverclassifier and builds on top of the models generated by the cm to allow classification of new datasets results we applied the cleversuite to predict secondary_structure properties solubility chaperone requirements and rna binding_abilities using cross_validation and independent datasets the cleversuite reproduces experimental_findings with great accuracy and provides models that can be used for future_investigations availability the intuitive_interface for dataset exploration analysis and prediction is available at http s tartaglialab com clever suite due to the latest_advances in technology a large number of sequences have been deposited into databases and computational_methods are being developed for their analysis and interpretation some algorithms require per case configuration or lack intuitive_interface which prohibits diffusion among non computational scientists experimental scales encoding physico_chemical are useful to retrieve basic information on protein_sequences and to predict features associated with protein_folding aggregation and molecular_interactions for instance the zyggregator method predicts aggregation propensity using a combination of physicochemical_properties including secondary_structure solvent_accessibility hydrophobicity and polarity similarly the svmprot algorithm exploits amino_acid to predict protein_families annotated in pfam indeed experimental scales can be employed to investigate large_scale properties of proteomes and identify common features but no systematic approach has been attempted so_far to provide a general_purpose algorithm we aim to provide researchers with an intuitive and statistically_robust method to characterize protein groups exploiting the information contained in primary structure our premise is that the user should be able to make multiple_hypotheses on the training_sets and build models that others can test as a general_purpose universal optimization is theoretically impossible our strategy is to build a class of predictors that are specific for the individual problems we pay particular attention to derive unbiased models because over fitting of internal parameters can undermine the general applicability of algorithms our approach the cleversuite provides a series of easy to use configuration free tools with interactive graphical_interface the central part of the suite is the clevermachine cm an algorithm to characterize protein datasets cm does not require external fitting parameters and returns multiple physico_chemical ranked by their significance relevant properties are merged together to provide coherent and consistent classification allowing complex feature analysis the second element of our suite is the cleverclassifier cc that builds on top of results generated by the cm to allow classification of protein datasets using state of the art machine_learning cm and cc algorithms are freely_available s tartaglia lab com page clever suite we illustrate the powerfulness of our approach by making predictions of several protein features including structural_disorder solubility chaperone interactions and rna binding_abilities cm and cc models that are available for consultation at http s tartaglialab com clever community to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup coma sketch describing cm and cc workflow is presented in the goal of the cm algorithm is to discriminate between two protein_sets a number of properties including hydrophobicity alpha_helical beta_sheet disorder burial aggregation membrane and nucleic_acid binding propensities are employed to build physicochemical profiles the physico_chemical are combined together to identify similarities and differences between the two sets once the discriminating properties are characterized cm generates a model which is employed by cc to classify new datasets as shown in the examples below we tested cm and cc performances on protein features such as secondary_structure structural_disorder solubility chaperone requirements and rna_binding ability supplementary unless otherwise stated we always remove overlap between training and test_sets using cd_hit with default cut_off set for sequence_similarity
