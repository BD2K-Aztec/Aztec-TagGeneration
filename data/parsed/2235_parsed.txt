htsanalyzer an r bioconductor_package for integrated network_analysis of high_throughput motivation high_throughput hts by rnai or small_molecules are among the most promising tools in functional_genomics they enable researchers to observe detailed reactions to experimental perturbations on a genome_wide scale while there is a core_set of computational_approaches used in many publications to analyze these data a specialized software combining them and making them easily_accessible has so_far been missing results here we describe htsanalyzer a flexible software to build integrated analysis_pipelines for hts_data that contains over representation analysis gene_set comparative gene_set and rich sub network identification htsanalyzer interfaces with commonly used pre_processing packages for hts_data and presents its results as html pages and network plots availability our software is written in the r language and freely_available via the bioconductor_project at http www bioconductor org contact in recent_years several technological_advances have pushed gene perturbation screens to the forefront of functional_genomics combining high_throughput hts techniques with rich phenotypes enables researchers to observe detailed reactions to experimental perturbations on a genome_wide scale this makes hts one of the most promising tools in functional_genomics although the phenotypes in hts_data mostly correspond to single genes it becomes more and more important to analyze them in the context of cellular_pathways and networks to understand how genes work together network_analysis of hts_data depends on the dimensionality of the phenotypic readout while specialized analysis approaches exist for high_dimensional phenotyping e g analysis approaches for low_dimensional screens have so_far been spread out over diverse softwares and online tools like david or gene_set gsea to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as here we provide a software to build integrated analysis_pipelines for hts_data that contain gene_set and network_analysis approaches commonly used in many papers as reviewed by htsanalyzer is implemented by s classes in r r development core and freely_available via the bioconductor_project the example pipeline provided by htsanalyzer interfaces directly with existing hts pre_processing packages like cellhts or rnaither additionally our software will be fully integrated in a web_interface for the analysis of hts_data and thus be easily_accessible to non programmers
