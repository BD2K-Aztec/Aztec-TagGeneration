structural_bioinformatics ccharppi web_server computational characterization of protein_protein from structure the atomic_structures of proteinprotein_interactions are central to understanding their role in biological_systems and a wide_variety of biophysical functions and potentials have been developed for their characterization and the construction of predictive_models these tools are scattered across a multitude of stand alone programs and are often available only as model_parameters requiring reimple mentation this acts as a significant barrier to their widespread_adoption ccharppi integrates many of these tools into a single web_server it calculates up to parameters including models of electrostatics desolvation and hydrogen_bonding as well as interface packing and complementarity scores empirical potentials at various resolutions docking potentials and composite scoring_functions availability_and the server does not require registration by the user and is freely_available academic use atproteinprotein interactions are involved in most cell processes and their structural and functional_annotation is essential to understand biological and pathological phenomena and to develop new therapeutic_approaches the increasing volume of experimental_data on proteinprotein_interactions at the molecular level offers many opportunities for functional characterization and the construction of predictive_models based on properties arising from structure such as interface geometry hydrogen_bonding electrostatics and desolvation energy which act as an intermediate layer between structure and function indeed the selection and combination of structure based potentials within a learning framework have been used for many tasks often beyond their original development purpose such as the prediction of binding_affinity kinetics mutational_effects interface design proteinprotein_docking and the detection of hotspots with many further possibilities remaining to be explored although many tools have been developed to calculate structural_properties some of which are available online their availability and ease of use are an impediment often requiring the installation of stand alone programs with different library dependencies reimplementation of models for which only parameters are given and reformatting of pdb files thus there is a need to consolidate these methods into a single implementation here we present ccharppi a web_server which gathers together a large number of these functions including those on which many of our previous_models were based into a single easy to use interface
