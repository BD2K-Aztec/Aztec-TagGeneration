sequence_analysis peakdeck a kernel density estimator based peak_calling program for dnasei seq data hypersensitivity to dnasei digestion is a hallmark of open chromatin and dnasei seq allows the genome_wide identification of regions of open chromatin interpreting these data is challenging largely because of inherent variation in signal_to between datasets we have developed peakdeck a peak_calling program that distinguishes signal from noise by randomly sampling read densities and using kernel_density to generate a dataset specific probability_distribution of random background signal peakdeck uses this probability_distribution to select an appropriate read density threshold for peak_calling in each dataset we benchmark peakdeck using published encode dnasei seq data and other peak_calling programs and demonstrate superior_performance in low_signal datasets availability_and peakdeck is written in standard perl and runs on any platform with perl installed peakdeck is also available as a standalone application written in perl tk which does not require perl to be installed files including a user guide can be down loaded at www ccmp ox ac uk dnasei hypersensitivity analysis can be used to map sites of open chromatin in genomic_dna hypersensitivity of dna to digestion by dnasei arises when nucleosomal histone_proteins are displaced from chromatin leaving a region of naked nucleosome free dna that is accessible to the dnasei enzyme owen histone displacement and consequent dnasei hypersensitivity characteristically occur at promoter and enhancer sites allowing the sequence specific binding of proteins such as transcription_factors to the dna recently advances in high_throughput methods have been applied to dnasei hypersensitivity testing dnasei seq supplementary_information section s with dnasei seq regulatory dna_fragments at accessible open chromatin sites are released by two hit digestion these fragments are sequenced using high_throughput technology and mapped back to the reference_genome the comparison of dnasei hypersensitivity patterns in different datasets can play_an in the study of gene_regulation for example in response to a physiological stimulus however a major_challenge in analyzing these data is the variation in signal_to snr between datasets supplementary while many potential sources of noise exist a key variable affecting the snr is the enzymatic_activity of dnasei which is difficult to control between experiments variation in the level of dnasei activity leads to different amounts of digestion supplementary altering the composition of the population of short dna_fragments that are sequenced there is no universal surrogate measurement of digestion that can be used to accurately quantify digestion at the library_preparation stage and no ideal control sample discussed in supplementary_information section s for these reasons distinguishing signal from noise in a manner that allows comparison between datasets is more challenging with dnasei seq than with other high_throughput sequencing_approaches such as chip_seq several peak_calling programs have been developed for use with high_throughput sequencing_data most focus on chipseq where a clear input control is available but some have also been used for dnasei seq data including f seq macs and homer while analyzing our own dnasei seq data we found variable performance between peak callers particularly at low snrs and the identification of a suitable peak threshold was challenging this confounded the comparison between datasets with different snrs see supplementary_information section s for snr estimation we have developed a peak_calling algorithm peakdeck that limits the effect of snr on threshold setting which is of particular value in datasets with lower snrs we have used hotspotidentified dnasei seq sites from cell_types published by encode to compare the quality of peak_calling by peakdeck with that by other peak_calling programs peakdeck also includes additional tools for dnasei seq data analysis see supplementary_information section s for description of additional tools this is an open_access the terms of the

sites are discarded supplementary next the signal_strength is measured at the non overlapping sites using sampling bins and supplementary this is achieved by measuring the background read density in a large bin surrounding the site background read density default bp and then measuring the read density in a smaller focused bin at the same site central read density default bp the corrected read density is calculated by subtracting the expected read density given the background read density from the central read density once this calculation has been repeated for all the randomly selected_sites in the dataset a probability_distribution is generated to describe the distribution of these corrected read density scores supplementary because the distribution of these scores is typically non gaussian peakdeck uses kernel_density supplementary_information section s to calculate a probability_distribution for the randomly_selected corrected read density scores where n is the number of sites sampled h is the bandwidth h x i is the value of x for the ith site and k u is a gaussian_kernel
