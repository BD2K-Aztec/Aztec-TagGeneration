the sufficient minimal set of mirna_seed types motivation pairing between the target_sequence and the nt_long seed_sequence of the mirna presents the most important feature for mirna_target novel high_throughput such as argonaute hits_clip afford meanwhile a detailed study of mirna mrna duplices these interaction maps enable a first discrimination between functional and non functional target_sites in a bulky fashion prediction_algorithms apply different seed paradigms to identify mirna_target therefore a quantitative assessment of mirna_target is of major interest results we identified a set of canonical seed types based on a transcriptome_wide analysis of experimentally_verified functional target_sites we confirmed the specificity of long seeds but we found that the majority of functional target_sites are formed by less specific seeds of only nt indicating a crucial_role of this type a substantial fraction of genuine target_sites are non conserved moreover the majority of functional sites remain uncovered by common prediction_methods the relation between mirnas and their targets in higher_eukaryotes is part of the highly complex gene regulation_network to unravel the functional specific interactions the available information on the interaction of the short rnas as presented by the risc complex and their mrna counterparts is insufficient to reliably_predict all functional pairs modulating translation and mrna_decay the basic prerequisite for mirna targeting in metazoans is a short perfect match complemented by imperfect matches in close_vicinity this region is called the seed_sequence and is considered to be a nt_long substring within the first nt at the end of the mirna it is regarded to be the most important feature for target_recognition by mirnas in mammalians to whom correspondence should be addressed naturally merely seeking for short sequence matches yields a plethora of putative target_sites with a large fraction of false_positives to dodge a priori the majority of false_positives in silico mirna target_site prediction_approaches concentrate on the subset of target_sites equipped with long perfect seed matches in addition several mirna targeting determinants beyond the seed have been proposed to extract authentic target_sites from the set of seed matches a common strategy to increase specificity is to require conservation of the seed match but there is evidence that non conserved mirna targeting is even more widespread to date the effect of different types of seed matches has been assessed by means of signal_to degree of mrna or protein repression based on that a set of canonical seed types that differ in abundance and intensity of the regulatory effect has been defined recent experimental_approaches allow for the identification of argonaute ago mirna mrna ternary_complexes using an in vivo cross_linking protocol and subsequent high_throughput analyzed mirna mrna interactions in mus_musculus neocortex tissue_samples and published an interaction map containing a set of verified target_sites in the transcriptome of the murine_brain complementing previous_studies we determined seed types using functional target_sites of the interaction map we identified a minimal and sufficient set of six seed types the precise mapping of ago footprints allowed us to distinguish between mirna target and higher resolved mirna target_site interaction we quantified the impact of individual seed types on recall and specificity additional target_site conservation analyses revealed short seeds to be less conserved than long seeds provided a mirna mrna interaction map that contains the absolute chromosomal positions of sites full complementary to mirna seeds murine genome_assembly of these sites are located almost at the center of an average ago mrna footprint this is a defined region of mrna complexed with ago determined by ago mrna clusters where ago bound within nt of cluster peaks of the time for each chromosomal coordinate we determined the longest protein_coding mature mrna_transcript and its corresponding relative_position by means of the ncbi reference_sequence database sites that were located within an intron or upstream of the utr werepage in this study we present an analysis of the most important feature for mirna target_recognition the so_called mirna_seed using a large_scale dataset of functional target_sites based on the ago hitsclip and par_clip mirna mrna interaction maps we analyzed seeds properties and their influences on mirna target_site prediction_methods due to the definite specification of ago binding_sites we were able to classify mirna recognition elements contained in the mrna utr as either functional or non functional we defined a minimal set of seed types that is sufficient for accurate mirna target_site predictions the final data pool allows for enhanced analysis of mirna_target prediction_algorithms compared to earlier_studies that were restricted by experimental constraints we found that most conserved mirnas interact predominantly with target_sites endowed with short seed matches of functional sites are based on mer seeds in contrast common prediction_algorithms focus mainly on seeds of length seven or eight at present prediction_algorithms have to accept severe deficiencies of recall to ensure high_specificity that is naturally considered to be more important moreover the preferential search for long seeds lifts the proportion of conserved sites but we found that a substantial fraction of all functional target_sites is not conserved target_sites including mer seeds are enriched among these concluding the problem of recall can be easily translated to the problem of precision however this strongly intensifies the need for features beyond seed pairing that realistically describe mirna targeting in particular non conserved target_sites it may also raise the basic question for the potential of seed based_approaches in discriminating between functional and non functional sites
