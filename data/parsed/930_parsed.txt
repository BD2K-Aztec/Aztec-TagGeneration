characterization of clinical_signs in the human interactome motivation many diseases are related by shared associated molecules and pathways exhibiting comorbidities and common phenotypes an indication of the continuous nature of the human pathological landscape although it is continuous this landscape is always partitioned into discrete diseases when studied at the molecular level clinical_signs are also important phenotypic descrip tors that can reveal the molecular_mechanisms pathological states but have seldom been the subject of systemic research here we quantify the modular nature of the clinical_signs associated with genetic_diseases in the human interactome results we found that clinical_signs are reflected as modules at the molecular_network level to at least to the same extent as diseases they can thus serve as a valid complementary partition of the human pathological landscape with implications for etiology research diagnosis and treatment disease associated phenotypes also known as clinical_signs are commonly used in clinical practice to describe pathological manifestations these signs help in the differential_diagnosis and treatment of a patient enabling identification of a particular disease diseases can thus be regarded as a special and important type of pathological phenotype most work on the molecular basis of pathologies has focused on diseases or syndromes instead of clinical_signs this is the case e g in the determination of the genetic_variations associated with a given disease some exceptions include the analysis of quantitative_traits such as height body_mass erythrocyte count or certain common clinical_manifestations alopecia hearing_loss cardiac_arrhythmias diseases are the basic pathological units in the systemic approaches to human_pathologies from a network perspective nevertheless clinical_signs can also be valid useful descriptors of the human pathological landscape currently neglected by its traditional partitioning into distinct diseases if that is the case partitioning the human pathological landscape into clinical_signs should result in a clear link between the molecular and physiological levels clinical_signs are thought to be reflected at the molecular_network level possibly to an even greater extent than diseases there are numerous examples of diseases or groups of diseases with similar_phenotypes caused by functionally_related previous_studies observed a correlation between disease similarity as measured by common phenotypes clinical_signs and their similarity due to common molecular_mechanisms such as shared genes protein interactions etc in a recent study provided evidence for the disease module hypothesis demonstrating that genes associated with different diseases appear as distinct modules in the still incomplete human interactome while most of the diseases studied appeared as separate modules some overlap here we quantify the extent to which clinical_signs not diseases are reflected in the human interactome due to the lack of data on the genetic_basis of most clinical_signs we built a dataset of geneclinical sign relationships through the genetic_diseases they are linked to as most genetic_diseases are monogenic it is reasonable toassume that these genes are pleiotropic and make an important contribution to the clinical_sign observed we found that clinical_signs are modular this dataset also allowed us to establish relationships between distinct clinical_signs and to compare these relationships with those obtained from shared genes we find significant_overlap in neighborhoods between clinical_signs and between signs and complex_diseases here we analyzed the organization of clinical_signs associated with genetic_diseases in the human interactome and found that the clinical_manifestations of these diseases form modules in the interactome the size si and compactness di of the modules differ due to the current coverage of the known interactome and to the nature of the clinical_signs but in most cases si and di deviate from random expectation with the most stringent_criteria we applied the same mathematical formalism developed to estimate the modular nature of a set of complex_diseases and groups of diseases in their study menche et_al analyzed diseases and their relationships and showed that diseases that overlap in the interactome have more similar clinical_signs that those that do not we found that some clinical_sign modules overlap with disease modules and that some of these overlaps are statistically_significant our results show that not only genes associated with complex_diseases are modular in the interactome as demonstrated previously but also genes associated with clinical_signs this offers new alternatives to the study of pathological states of common diseases and their association to genetic_determinants especially for the development of personalized_medicine as it will allow better understanding of a given disease_manifestation in a given patient with a specific set of signs and symptoms and its relationship with the genetic_variations found as the human pathological landscape is partitioned into distinct clinical_signs as well as into diseases both can serve as targets for the study of pathological states using molecular_network concepts for diseases with no existing or immediately foreseeable treatments one could devise ways of targeting some clinical_signs by looking at their associated genes and network modules as the human pathological landscape is a continuum it can and should be explored beyond traditional disease definitions and classifications in conclusion our results show that clinical_signs associated with genetic_diseases appear as modules in the interactome and some show significant_overlap as such they can be used to identify molecular_mechanisms that could explain the manifestations of more complex_diseases to quote oti et_al we have traditionally split the human phenome into discrete entities called diseases instead of searching for common pathogenetic_mechanisms that link diseases togetherhowever there is more to the human phenome than a list of diseases partitioning the human pathological landscape into other molecularly supported entities could help to approach diagnosis and treatment of disease_states from a new perspective
