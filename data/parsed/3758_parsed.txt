databases_and proteinworlddb querying radical pairwise_alignments among protein_sets from complete_genomes motivation many analyses in modern biological_research are based on comparisons between biological_sequences resulting in functional evolutionary and structural inferences when large_numbers of sequences are compared heuristics are often used resulting in a certain lack of accuracy in order to improve and validate results of such comparisons we have performed radical all against all comparisons of million protein_sequences belonging to the refseq database using an implementation of the smithwaterman_algorithm this extremely intensive computational_approach was made possible with the help of world community grid through the genome comparison project the resulting database proteinworlddb which contains coordinates of pairwise protein_alignments and their respective scores is now made available users can download compare and analyze the results filtered by genomes protein functions or clusters proteinworlddb is integrated with annotations derived from swiss_prot pfam kegg ncbi taxonomy database and gene_ontology the database is a unique and valuable asset representing a major effort to create a reliable and consistent dataset of cross comparisons of the whole protein_content encoded in hundreds of completely_sequenced using a rigorous dynamic_programming availability the database can be accessed throughthe assignment of biological_function predictions and structural_features to raw_sequence is typically accomplished by comparing them either to predicted protein_sequences or to the corresponding genes this information is stored in several primary public_databases such as genbank http www ncbi nlm nih gov genbank or embl bank http www ebi ac uk embl however annotations are often incomplete based on non standardized to whom correspondence should be addressed nomenclature or might have no value when inferred from previous incorrectly annotated sequences hence secondary databases such as swiss_prot http www expasy ch sprot pfam http pfam sanger ac uk or kegg http www genome ad jp kegg to mention only a few have been implemented to analyze specific functional_aspects and to improve the annotation procedures and results dynamic_programming or a fast approximation have been successfully_applied to biological sequence comparison for decades and this class of algorithms comprises the heart of many well known sequence_alignment programs however because of their quadratic time complexity rigorous dynamic_programming are usually not suitable for the comparison of a large set of sequences against a database as they demand exceptionally huge computational power and are very time consuming for this reason sequence_comparisons are generally performed by heuristics like blast and fasta which have proved to be quite effective and significantly_faster than the dynamic_programming however in many instances these comparisons might lack accuracy as these heuristics do not guarantee to find a mathematically optimal alignment therefore affecting all subsequent analytical steps the genome comparison project gcp http www dbbm fiocruz br genomecomparison aims to compare protein information on a genomic_scale to improve the quality and interpretation of biological data and our understanding of biological_systems and their interactions stringent comparisons were obtained after the application of the smithwaterman sw algorithm in a pairwise manner to all predicted proteins encoded in both completely_sequenced and unfinished genomes available in the public database refseq version the project represents a joint effort involving fiocruz puc rio and ibm and was executed through world community grid wcg a computational grid on a global scale we present here the outcome of this joint effort the proteinworlddb which represents a major effort to create a reliable and consistent dataset of cross comparisons of the whole protein_content encoded in hundreds of completely_sequenced using a rigorous dynamic_programming
