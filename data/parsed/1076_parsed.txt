bioinformatics_discovery systems_biology comparison of the mammalian insulin signalling_pathway to invertebrates in the context of foxo mediated ageing motivation a large number of experimental_studies on ageing focus on the effects of genetic_perturbations of the insulin insulin_like signalling_pathway iis on lifespan short_lived invertebrate laboratory model_organisms are extensively used to quickly identify ageing related genes and pathways it is important to extrapolate this knowledge to longer lived mammalian organisms such as mouse and eventually human where such analyses are difficult or impossible to perform computational_tools are needed to integrate and manipulate pathway_knowledge in different species results we performed a literature_review and curation of the iis and target of rapamycin signalling_pathways in mus_musculus we compare this pathway model to the equivalent models in drosophila mel anogaster and caenorhabtitis elegans although generally well conserved they exhibit important differences in general the worm and mouse pathways include a larger number of feedback_loops and interactions than the fly we identify functional orthologues that share similar molecular_interactions but have moderate sequence_similarity finally we incorporate the mouse_model into the web_service neteffects and perform in silico gene perturbations of iis components and analyses of experimental_results we identify sub paths that given a mutation in an iis component could potentially antagonize the primary effects on ageing via foxo in mouse and via skn in worm finally we explore the effects of foxo knockouts in three different mouse_tissues availability_and http www ebi ac uk thornton srv software neteffectsthe insulin insulin_like signalling_pathway iis and the target of rapamycin tor signalling_pathway have been shown to be important regulators of ageing across species via the transcription_factor foxo the mechanisms by which foxo increased activity leads to lifespan_extension are still unclear however it is thought that lifespan_extension is achieved through cell_cycle by foxo in the absence of insulin_signalling van_der in addition identification of foxo transcriptional_targets has revealed a second tier of transcription factors_regulating a variety of downstream responses ageing via the iis pathway has been intensively_studied at the level of invertebrate model laboratory organisms with their short lifespans well described genomes and a variety of mutants already available drosophila_melanogaster and caenorhabtitis elegans provide_excellent frameworks for fast identification of genetic_determinants of ageing relating results from fly and worm to a longer lived mammalian model such as mus_musculus is critical for the understanding of the ageing processes in human but it is often difficult owing to the large evolutionary distance between invertebrates and mammals the general flow of the pathway is as follows the insulin and insulin growth_factor can be activated by two different insulin molecules or two insulin_like molecules on activation the two receptors can activate the insulin_receptor substrates irs by tyrosine_phosphorylation the role of irs especially has been well examined and found to propagate the signal further downstream via the pi k complex the phospholipid products of pi k phosphatidylinositol triphosphate pip once produced can activate phosphoinositide_dependent pdk that leads to the activation of akt_protein like proteins akt with akt being well studied and serum_and kinases sgk akt and the sgk kinases inhibit the activity of the forkhead_transcription foxo by retaining them in the cytoplasm the iis pathway is generally well conserved with the main building_blocks insr pi k pdk akt foxo present in both mammals and invertebrates the tor pathway is also well conserved with its main building_blocks present tor complexes and rheb s kinase important differences also exist there are seven known insulin molecules in the fly as opposed to in the worm in the mouse there are two insulin and two insulin_like flies and worms possess a single insulin_receptor each whereas mice possess two insulin_like receptors in addition to the insulin_receptor in mice we to whom correspondence should be addressed the molecular basis of nutrient signalling is largely comparable across a large evolutionary space despite striking_differences in the presence or number of copies of certain components between species the pathways in all organisms except worm focus only on foxo mediated lifespan thereby ignoring any effects through different transcription_factors however using the mouse pathway we can identify neighbouring signalling_pathways with the potential to influence the signal_transduction of the iis through the identified cross_talk points comparison of the pathways in a systematic and qualitative way has the potential to explain differences in effects on lifespan across species and help design experiments that will evaluate the pathway flux the richness and detail of the mammalian model can inform the interpretation of results in invertebrates where molecular_interactions have not been so extensively_studied being able to compare the pathways side_by we recorded all differences and identified functional orthologues by use of neteffects we were able to suggest possible paths affecting foxo mediated shortest_paths to foxo mediated longevity derived from neteffects where daf is the foxo orthologue in c elegans lifespan given a single mutation and how these differ across species thus generating hypotheses for further investigation
