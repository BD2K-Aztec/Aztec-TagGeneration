offtargetfinder a web_tool for species specific rnai design motivation rna_interference rnai technology is being developed as a weapon for pest insect control to maximize the specificity that such an approach affords we have developed a bioinfor matic web_tool that searches the ever growing arthropod transcriptome databases so that pest specific rnai sequences can be identified this will help technology developers finesse the design of rnai sequences and suggests which non target species should be assessed in the risk_assessment availability_and http rnai specifly org rna_interference rnai is a powerful reverse_genetics tool routinely used to reduce or eliminate gene activity within an organism rnai is most commonly_applied in functional_genomics screens of laboratory model_organisms and cell_lines rnai technology is also being developed for so_called environmental rnai where it can be applied to free living_organisms such as pest insects the key attribute of rnai for all these applications is its specificity which is determined by sequence_identity between the rnai molecule and the target_gene however the nature of specificity requirements differs between applications in reverse genetic_screens of model_organisms a premium is placed on targeting the specified target_gene and no other offtarget genes there are many web_based tools to help with the design of such rnai molecules http www flyrnai org snap dragon however for environmental_applications species specificity is just as important as gene specificity the application of rnai to pest_control is an attractive alternative to traditional control chemicals because it has the potential to only target pest species among the pests for which this technology is being developed are beetles moths locusts and various phloem feeders including aphids a challenge of such an approach is in the delivery of rnai inducing molecules to pest organisms this might be achieved by expressing dsrna in transgenic crop_plants that are hosts for the pests being targeted or by using sprays containing either naked dsrna molecules or dsrna molecules packaged within microorganisms the former approach has been taken by monsanto which has developed transgenic crop_plants that produce dsrna against the western_corn diabrotica_virgifera showed that ingestion of a nucleotide rnai sequence directed to the rootworm snf gene is lethal experiments surveying ten insect families found that only closely_related beetles those sharing at least three mers with the dsrna sequence were affected by consuming the snf dsrna molecule this not only demonstrates the potential specificity of the technology but also illustrates the fact that only a small number of mers sirnas may elicit a response given the likelihood that rnai based_technologies may be entering our agricultural landscapes in the near future it is critically_important to establish the species specificity of such rnai inducing molecules we have developed a bioinformatic tool that searches transcriptomic databases that will i assist rnai technology developers in maximizing the pest specificity of rnai molecules and ii provide information for regulatory_authorities and the public on the relative environmental risks that these molecules have on non target organisms this web_based is called offtargetfinder and the various outputs it provides enables users to refine the regions within gene of interest so as to eliminate potential off target effects in other arthropod species it can also be used to identify which species should be tested_experimentally in the ecological risk_assessment
