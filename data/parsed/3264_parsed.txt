nlr parser rapid annotation of plant nlr complements motivation the repetitive nature of plant_disease genes_encoding for nucleotide_binding leucine_rich nlr proteins hampers their prediction with standard gene_annotation software motif alignment and search tool mast has previously been reported as a tool to support annotation of nlr encoding_genes however the decision if a motif combination represents an nlr protein was entirely manual results the nlr parser pipeline is designed to use the mast output from six frame translated amino_acid and filters for predefined biologically curated motif compositions input reads can be derived from for example raw long_read sequencing_data or contigs and scaffolds coming from plant genome_projects the output is a tab separated file with information on start and frame of the first nlr specific motif whether the identified sequence is a tnl or cnl potentially full or fragmented in addition the output of the nb arc domain sequence can directly be used for phylogenetic_analyses in comparison to other prediction software the highly complex nb arc domain is described in detail using several individual motifs availability_and the nlr parser tool can be downloaded from git hubplants have evolved a multi_layered innate_immune system to protect themselves against pests and pathogens breeding efforts towards disease_resistance in crops rely on the introgression of quantitative_trait or major dominant disease_resistance r genes from wild relatives reviewed in the largest class of r genes encodes nucleotide_binding leucine_rich proteins nlrs or nb lrrs these are key receptors that recognize secreted pathogen effector_molecules or their effect in the plant on recognition these proteins commonly lead to a hypersensitive_response in the form of local cell_death to prevent further spread of pathogens relying on living tissue in dicotyledonous plants nlr proteins come in two flavours that are determined by an n_terminal extension and internal amino_acid composition cnl proteins possess in most cases a coiled_coil followed by the highly_conserved p loop and rnbs a motif tnl proteins possess a toll interleukin_receptor like tir domain followed by the p loop but lack the rnbs a motif the tnl class is absent from monocotyledonous plants like wheat and barley a set of nlr descriptive motifs have previously been identified using meme and were used indue to the biological_importance and relevance for breeding the identification and annotation of nlr type disease_resistance genes has high_priority in all plant_genome sequencing_projects these annotations however rely heavily on gene prediction software in the past we were able to show that up to of the total nlr complement was either wrongly predicted or completely missing our mast parser tool provides high_precision identification of nlr gene sequences from every input format that is available from genome_sequencing including contigs scaffolds pseudomolecules or chromosomes in two experiments with the model plants a thaliana and b distachyon we were able to show the functionality of the well characterized meme motifs in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants the output of this tool is directly usable for downstream applications including phylogenetic_analyses or visualization on the corresponding reference_sequence the tab_delimited output format is publishable as a supplementary table the mast parser pipeline that we present here will streamline nlr identification efforts within genome_sequencing in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants
