genetics_and multi objective tag_snps selection using evolutionary algorithms motivation integrated analysis of single_nucleotide snps and structure variations showed that the extent of linkage_disequilibrium is common across different types of genetic_variants a subset of snps called tag_snps is sufficient for capturing alleles of bi_allelic and even multi allelic_variants however accuracy and power of tag_snps are affected by several factors including genotyping failure errors and tagging bias of certain alleles in addition different sets of tag_snps should be selected for fulfilling requirements of various genotyping_platforms and projects results this study formulates the problem of selecting tag_snps into a four objective optimization_problem that minimizes the total amount of tag_snps maximizes tolerance for missing_data enlarges and balances detection_power of each allele class to resolve this problem we propose evolutionary algorithms incorporated with greedy initialization to find non dominated solutions considering all objectives simultaneously this method provides users with great flexibility to extract different sets of tag_snps for different platforms and scenarios e g up to tags and missing rate compared to conventional methods our method explores larger search_space and requires shorter convergence time experimental_results revealed strong and weak conflicts among these objectives in particular a small number of additional tag_snps can provide sufficient tolerance and balanced power given the low missing and error_rates of todays genotyping_platforms availability the software is freely_available at bioinformatics online andgenetic differences between two individuals range from single_nucleotide snps to large structure variations e g deletions and duplications based on analysis of linkage_disequilibrium ld among snps the entire_human is shown to be composed of high_ld blocks interspersed by recombination_hotspots a small subset of snps termed tag_snps is capable of capturing haplotype_information in a high_ld block recently large structure variations have been discovered by array_comparative acgh to whom correspondence should be addressed or massively_parallel sequencing_platforms integrated analysis of snps and structure variations showed that the extent of ld is not limited to snps for example a number of copy_number cnvs are found to exhibit high_ld with flanking snps implying the copy_number of each individual is now inferable by tag_snps in an analysis of an inversion polymorphism at p the orientation of each haplotype can be predicted by tag_snps these results suggest that a single snp_genotyping platform and well chosen tag_snps are sufficient for capturing alleles of structure variations owing to the limited capacity of a genotyping platform the number of tag_snps is often minimized to increase genome_wide coverage which is ordinarily done by capturing extent of ld e g r and d or haplotype diversity however alleles of tag_snps may be missed or miscalled due to defective quality of signals during genotyping these missing_data and genotyping_errors greatly reduce the accuracy of tag_snps because alleles of tagged variations may be wrongly inferred recently variants of these methods have also been developed for tagging multi allelic variations e g cnv nevertheless the power of tag_snps is further affected by tagging bias toward certain alleles some alleles may be well distinguished by many tag_snps whereas others are distinguished by only a few tags thus subsequent association studies using the tag_snps will fail to provide unbiased detection_power for each allele these issues can be formulated into different objectives in tag_snps selection a small number of tag_snps on the one hand is always desired given the limited capacity of a genotyping platform on the other hand the number of tag_snps has to be increased in order to tolerate the influence of missing_data and genotyping_errors additionally the distance and diversity among haplotype backgrounds of different allele classes should be considered for providing sufficient and unbiased power in distinguishing each allele however some of these objectives are intrinsically conflict e g genotyping cost and tolerance existing_methods for tag_snps selection fail to take multiple objectives into account moreover different sets of tag_snps are required to accommodate various platforms and scenarios e g maximum tags and tolerance for missing_data thus a method that can simultaneously address_these and generate multiple non dominated solutions satisfying distinct constraints of each objective is highly demanded this study formulates the tag snp selection problem into a fourobjective optimization_problem that minimizes the total amount of tag_snps maximizes tolerance for missing snps enlarges
