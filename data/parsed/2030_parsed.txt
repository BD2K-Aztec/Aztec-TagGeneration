sequence_analysis genome_wide quantitative analysis of dna_methylation from bisulfite sequencing_data here we present the open_source r bioconductor software_package beat bs_seq epimutation analysis toolkit it implements all bioinformatics steps_required for the quantitative high_resolution analysis of dna_methylation from bisulfite sequencing_data including the detection of regional epimutation events i e loss or gain of dna_methylation at cg positions relative to a reference using a binomial mixture_model the beat package aggregates methylation counts per genomic_position thereby compensating for low coverage incomplete conversion and sequencing_errors availability_and beat is freely_available as part ofbisulfite sequencing bs_seq is a sequence_based method to accurately detect dna_methylation at specific_loci which involves treating dna with sodium_bisulfite the method is based on bisulfite_conversion of unmethylated_cytosines into uracil and has become a standard in dna_methylation its advantage is accuracy as the degree of methylation at each cytosine can be quantified with great precision more recently bisulfite_sequencing has been applied in a genome_wide which requires advanced computational_analysis for determining dna_methylation and changes therein thus far such analysis has been limited to the comparison of individual cpg_sites between samples however because of the bisulfite_conversion of cytosines into uracils and eventually thymines sequence complexity is much reduced with no account for incomplete conversion and or sequencing_errors bisulfite_sequencing also often suffers from low coverage here we present bs_seq epimutation analysis toolkit beat a novel tool for analyzing bisulfite_converted sequences to overcome the aforementioned limitations in the estimation of methylation rates beat aggregates data from consecutive cytosines into regions by using a bayesian binomialbeta mixture_model the model is derived described in detail and evaluated in our supplementary_material for each region it calculates a posterior methylation probability_distribution that can be used for the comparison of dna_methylation between samples anticipating technological_progress in the dna_methylation field beat includes an error_model adapted to single_cell bs_seq data the beat package delivers methods for the estimation of methylation_levels methylation status and for calling epimutation events in a two sample comparison to our knowledge it is the first tool providing a rigid statistical_model for handling bsseq samples it has an in built correction for conversion errors and is therefore tailored to the analysis of bs_seq samples with possibly different bs conversion_rates funding nih grants ag ag ag and sens foundation to j v and s g jeff schell professorship for computational_biology grant sfb from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft to a t bmbf e bio grant to k a conflict of interest none declared b a methylation estimates and epimutation calls on a dna_segment for all regions with sufficient read_coverage the black curves show the methylation estimates for a single_cell sample top a reference_sample bottom and their difference middle regions with methylating epimutations are marked in red while regions with demethylating epimutations are marked in blue samples used for our analysis in this article were obtained from neuronal_cells of young_mice data unpublished b scatterplot of methylation estimates of a multi cell reference_sample x axis versus those of a sample y axis for all common regions with sufficient coverage each dot represents a single region that is covered by both samples red dots indicate methylating epimutations in the sample while blue dots indicate demethylating epimutations in the sample four dots representing exemplary regions with epimutations at the corresponding boundary value ranges for demethylating and methylating epimutations have been annotated with their values of methylated k and total n counts note that there exists no boundary line separating the red and the blue region because our bayesian_model assigns different methylation estimates to tuples k n k n with equal empirical methylation_level k n k n
