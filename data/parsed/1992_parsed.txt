genome_analysis genetalk an expert exchange platform for assessing rare sequence_variants in personal genomes next_generation has become a powerful_tool in personalized_medicine exomes or even whole genomes of patients suffering from rare_diseases are screened for sequence_variants after filtering out common_polymorphisms the assessment and interpretation of detected personal variants in the clinical context is an often time consuming effort we have developed genetalk a web_based that serves as an expert exchange network for the assessment of personal and potentially disease_relevant sequence_variants genetalk assists a clinical geneticist who is searching for information about specific sequence_variants and connects this user to other users with expertise for the same sequence variant availability genetalk is available at www gene talk de users can login without registering in a demo account exome_sequencing has become an invaluably powerful_tool in the identification of disease_causing and the first patients are now already treated based on sequence variant information of their exomes to date the primary bottleneck in such clinical personal genome cases is not anymore data generation but data analysis clinical geneticists therefore require efficient tools for filtering and interpreting the clinically_meaningful sequence_variants currently the most potent filters for reducing the set of novel and potentially causal_mutations in rare_diseases are based on variation data from population scale sequencing_efforts such as the genomes_project www genomes org only very few variants will be medically relevant perhapsin case of a monogenic disorderjust one bioinformatics_tools such as annovar and mutationtaster may then be used for comprehensive annotations and predictions about the expected pathogenicity of a variant however such classifiers have high false positive_and error_rates they may therefore serve only for prioritization but cannot replace the assessment of human_experts genetalk is an exchange platform that allows users to look for variant specific information and makes human expertise searchable any sequence variant with respect to the human_reference based on the grch assembly is annotatable the user decides to whom an annotation is visible one user may link to scientific_articles that are relevant in context with a certain variant or that even provide evidence that a mutation is disease_causing a second user might comment on this annotation to express her concern because she views the detected variant as an technical artefact a third user might state that she has seen patients with this genotype and is not sure about the statistical_significance of the association with the phenotype all annotations and comments of genetalk users about a certain genomic_position can be read like a locus specific conversation thread the trustworthiness of annotations can be rated by users as well as the likelihood of a mutation to be disease_causing if there is consensus in the genetalk community that to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work a certain mutation is pathogenic and its annotation is trustworthy this mutation is added to the annotation track pathogenic this annotation track is thus curated in a collaborative_effort of all genetalk users genetalk also assists users in filtering genetic_variants from ngs projects a user that has a patients informed_consent to analyze the clinical data may upload sequence_variants to genetalk in variant_call vcf version and above in order to reduce the initial vcf to a set of potentially disease_relevant mutations the user can apply certain filter settings first the list of variants could be restricted to e g only nonsynonymous homozygous variants with the functional and inheritance filter common_variants can be filtered out by a genotype_frequency filter that is based on high_quality ngs data_sets from hapmap the genomes_project and the exomes project if a linkage_analysis has been performed a genomic interval may be set to limit the search_space or gene panels may be applied as in silico filters to restrict the analysis to certain molecular_pathways in a rare recessive monogenic disease the mode of inheritance and the genotype_frequency filter that is set to usually reduce the number of candidate_mutations down to a few hundreds in a patients exome these variants may then be further analyzed for disease_causing annotations if the pathogenic mutation of this case has not yet been described in the literature and no pathogenic annotation exists the user can look for annotations that discuss patients with similar_phenotypes or basic research_scientists that talk about unpublished experimental_data for this gene such an annotation can serve as a conversation starter and the users can simply contact the author by clicking on the envelope symbol currently the annotation database contains over clinically_relevant entries from dbsnp a video tutorial on www genetalk de illustrates how an exome dataset may be analyzed in genetalk in a few easy steps the variant data of a simulated patient with hyperphosphatasia with mental_retardation syndrome are filtered down to the disease_causing
