joint detection of copy_number in parent_offspring trios motivation whole_genome wgs of parent_offspring trios is a powerful approach for identifying disease associated genes via detecting copy_number cnvs existing_approaches which detect_cnvs for each individual in a trio independently usually yield low detection_accuracy joint modeling_approaches leveraging mendelian transmission within the parent_offspring trio can be an efficient strategy to improve cnv detection_accuracy results in this study we developed triocnv a novel approach for jointly detecting cnvs in parent_offspring trios from wgs_data using negative_binomial we modeled the read_depth signal while considering both gc_content bias and mappability bias moreover we incorporated the family relationship and used a hidden_markov to jointly infer cnvs for three samples of a parent_offspring trio through application to both simulated_data and a trio from genomes_project we showed that triocnv achieved superior_performance than existing_approaches availability_and the software triocnv implemented using a combination of java and r is freely_available from the website at https github com yongzhuang triocnv copy_number cnvs are defined as changes in the copy_number gain or loss of large genomic_segments which can be transmitted from parents or arise de_novo cnvs have been shown to play_an in human morbidities including neuropsychiatric_disorders and cancers cnvs have been traditionally detected using fluorescent_in array_comparative and snp microarray recently next_generation ngs especially whole_genome wgs has become extremely powerful in detecting cnvs comprehensively being able to identify cnvs that are often missed by array based assays on the other hand ngs based_approaches present substantial challenges for cnv_calling they usually work by mapping sequencing_reads to the reference_genome and subsequently identifying discordant mapping signatures putatively caused by cnvs as summarized in there have beenand iv a combination of the above in addition cnvs can be detected by using the de_novo approach which first reconstructs contigs from short_sequencing and then compares the assembled_contigs with the reference genome_sequence to identify the regions with discordant copy_numbers most existing cnv_detection approaches focus on one single sample individually or multiple samples without considering the intersample relatedness naturally when genetic_relatedness is known for multiple_individuals effective utilization of this information could potentially improve cnv detection_accuracy a common relevant study_design with known inter individual relationships is sequencing parent_offspring trios indeed the parent_offspring trio design has been shown to be powerful in identifying disease associated genetic_variants for both common and rare_diseases for trio based ngs_data a joint modeling_approach leveraging the parent_offspring relationship can potentially improve detection_accuracy for cnvs as the same principle has been successfully_applied to improve detection_accuracy for inherited and de_novo single_nucleotide and indels from ngs_data as well as that for cnvs from snp_array importantly the joint modeling_approach allows for an explicit identification of de_novo mutations that have been increasingly_recognized to play_critical many human_diseases to our knowledge there have been no approaches for calling cnvs from trio wgs_data in a trio aware manner due to the popularity of trio sequencing in both research and clinical_settings such a tool is urgently_needed in this study we presented triocnv to fulfill this purpose first we modeled read_depth signal with negative_binomial to accommodate over dispersion and considered gc_content and mappability bias second we leveraged parent_offspring relationship to apply mendelian_inheritance constraint while allowing for the rare incidence of de_novo events third we used a hidden_markov hmm by combining the two aforementioned models to jointly perform cnv segmentation for the trio we applied triocnv to a simulated trio and a wgs trio from genomes_project gp to demonstrate its performance and strength over existing_approaches in summary we introduced triocnv a novel approach to jointly detecting cnvs from wgs_data in parent_offspring trios first we modeled read_depth by the negative_binomial to accommodate over dispersion and account for gc_content bias and mappability bias second we incorporated parent_offspring relation ship into our model to leverage mendelian_inheritance constraint while allowing the rare incidence of de_novo mutations third we used an hmm to jointly make cnv segmentation of the parent_offspring trio to our knowledge this is the first cnv_detection method developed specifically to handle trio sequencing_data to evaluate the performance of triocnv and compare it with existing_approaches we applied triocnv to a simulated trio and a sequenced trio from gp our results illustrate that triocnv achieves a better performance compared with existing_approaches in the trio setting our approach may be further enhanced in several ways for example we only modeled the rd signal for emission probability while not all cnvs are assessable by rd therefore other types of mapping signals such as read_pairs and split_reads can be incorporated to detect_cnvs that are not easily assessable by rd similar to other rd based cnv_detection methods triocnv reports lower i e window based breakpoint resolution than sr pem and de_novo based_methods and these three kinds of signals can help refine breakpoints in addition our approach is now limited to wgs_data but it can be potentially adapted to support whole exome_sequencing
