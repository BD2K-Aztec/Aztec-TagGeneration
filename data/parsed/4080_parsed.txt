rseqc quality_control of rna_seq experiments motivation rna_seq has been extensively used for transcriptome study quality_control qc is critical to ensure that rna_seq are of high_quality and suitable for subsequent analyses however qc is a time consuming and complex task due to the massive size and versatile nature of rna_seq therefore a convenient and comprehensive qc tool to assess rna_seq quality is sorely needed results we developed the rseqc package to comprehensively evaluate different aspects of rna_seq experiments such as sequence quality gc bias polymerase_chain bias nucleotide_composition bias sequencing_depth strand specificity coverage uniformity and read_distribution over the genome_structure rseqc takes both sam and bam_files as input which can be produced by most rna_seq mapping tools as well as bed files which are widely used for gene models most modules in rseqc take advantage of r scripts for visualization and they are notably efficient in dealing with large bam sam_files containing hundreds of millions of alignments availability_and rseqc is written in python and c source_code and a comprehensive users manual are freely_available atdeep transcriptome_sequencing rna_seq provides massive and valuable information concerning all transcribed elements in the genome using rna_seq researchers are able to for instance profile gene_expression interrogate alternative_splicing identify novel transcripts and detect aberrant transcripts and coding variants rna_seq experiments should ideally be able to directly identify and quantify all rna species regardless of their size or frequency however current rna_seq protocols still possess several intrinsic biases and limitations such as nucleotide_composition bias gc bias and pcr bias these biases directly affect the accuracy of many rna_seq applications and can be directly checked from raw sequences using tools like fastqc however these raw sequence_based metrics are not sufficient to ensure the usability of rna_seq other rna_seq specific quality_control qc metrics such
