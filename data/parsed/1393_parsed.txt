genome_analysis dinup a systematic approach to identify regions of differential nucleosome_positioning motivation with the rapid development_of the genome_wide of nucleosome_positioning has become increasingly affordable many future_studies will investigate the dynamic behaviour of nucleosome_positioning in cells that have different states or that are exposed to different conditions however a robust method to effectively_identify the regions of differential nucleosome_positioning rdnps has not been previously available results we describe a novel computational_approach dinup that compares nucleosome profiles generated by high_throughput under various conditions dinup provides a statistical p value for each identified rdnp based on the difference of read distributions dinup also empirically estimates the false_discovery as a cutoff when two samples have different sequencing_depths and differentiate reliable rdnps from the background_noise evaluation of dinup showed it to be both sensitive and specific for the detection of changes in nucleosome location occupancy and fuzziness rdnps that were identified using publicly_available datasets revealed that nucleosome_positioning dynamics are closely_related to the epigenetic_regulation of transcription as a basic_unit of the eukaryotic_genome the nucleosome is formed by an octamer of histones and the surrounding bp of dna nucleosomes play_an in the epigenetic_regulation of diverse_cellular through covalent_modifications of histone_tails and positioning of nucleosomes although previous_studies have focused primarily on the former mechanism the relative location of the dna and the histone_octamer or the nucleosome_positioning is also a determining mechanism to whom correspondence should be addressed for epigenetic_regulation through controlling the accessibility of transcription_factor in addition in the process of gene_transcription the frequency of nucleosome unwrapping and formation can reflect the rate of pol_ii elongation as a result if genome_wide nucleosome profiles for cells exposed to different conditions are known then researchers can better understand the dynamic behaviours of the transcriptional_machinery with the rapid development_of genome_wide nucleosome profiles have been generated for several organisms at a single_nucleotide which provides an opportunity to study nucleosome_positioning dynamics in cells that are in different states or that are exposed to different conditions to identify regions of differential nucleosome_positioning rdnps introduced the concept of a nucleosome score to indicate the stability of the nucleosome position and then compared scores for yeast samples before and after heat_shock in addition a fold_change calculation can be an intuitive method for identifying regions with sequencing read number changes however those approaches have several limitations first to the best of our knowledge none of the previous_studies provided a statistical measurement e g a p value to evaluate the significance of the difference in the nucleosome_positioning changes second both the fold_change calculation and the nucleosome score comparison are sequencing_depth independent which would affect the robustness of the results especially when the sequencing_depth is low to address these limitations we present a novel method called differential nucleosome_positioning dinup in this article dinup takes_advantage of the single_nucleotide of nucleosome profiles and it directly compares the distributions of sequenced nucleosome dna centres along the genome between different samples to detect genomic_regions with differential nucleosome_positioning without introducing any intermediate concepts such as the nucleosome score or the positioned nucleosome dinup also calculates p values and empirically estimates the false_discovery fdr to evaluate the statistical_significance of the identified difference moreover dinup provides various parameters with which to characterize the physical_properties of those identified regions when applied to publicly_available nucleosome profiles for yeast dinup reliably detected differences in nucleosome_positioning in a sequencing_depth dependent_manner when comparing the nucleosome profiles of different samples it is important to first make the samples comparable to each other dinup uses the ks test to calculate statistical p values between sliding_windows and estimates the fdr from the background p value for use as the cutoff to achieve_this after reducing the number of potential artifacts genomic_regions with p values consecutively lower than the cutoff were then identified as rdnps it is worth noting that when using different fdrs or minimum_length cutoffs the number of identified rdnps can differ greatly therefore the cutoff chosen depends on the features of the identified regions that are preferred by the user because dinup is designed to capture the most significant read_distribution changes it should strike a balance between the detection of different types of nucleosome_positioning changes at a certain fdr cutoff in the identification of short range nucleosome_occupancy change although regions with different occupancy levels may have similar read distributions the ks test can identify the differences in both boundaries around the occupancy change region after combining the differential signals on the boundary of sharp nucleosome_occupancy changes regions with differential occupancy levels can be identified however in terms of long_range nucleosome_occupancy change as the differential signals on the boundaries can be too far away from each other to be combined as an rdnp our method will have limitations in the accurate identification of regions with long_range occupancy changes as a result we implemented the fold_change method into the software_package of dinup and provided an option to users who are especially interested in detecting occupancy changes nevertheless dinup is in general an effective and robust method for identifying rdnps another important factor that influences the detection of differential nucleosome_positioning is sequencing_depth to evaluate this effect we sampled datasets with different levels of genomic coverage and used dinup to detect rdnps assuming that the results obtained from the datasets with the deepest sequencing_depth were the most reliable results we used these rdnps as a standard to determine the level of consistency between the regions identified using datasets with lower sequencing_depths and those identified using the standard dataset supplementary with an fdr cutoff of the consistency percentage dropped to with a genomic coverage of indicating that the sequencing_depth indeed affects the detection of rdnp to a large extent from this perspective we argue that a minimum sequencing_depth i e a genomic coverage of or is required for the accurate identification of differential nucleosome_positioning otherwise genomic_regions that are identified as different may not be truly different but instead may appear different as a result of random discrepancies or background_noise
