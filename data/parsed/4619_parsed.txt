bioinformatics_discovery the naked_mole genome resource facilitating analyses of cancer and longevity related adaptations motivation the naked_mole heterocephalus glaber is an exceptionally long_lived and cancer resistant rodent native to east_africa although its genome was previously_sequenced here we report a new assembly sequenced by us with substantially_higher n values for scaffolds and contigs results we analyzed the annotation of this new improved assembly and identified candidate genomic adaptations which may have contributed to the evolution of the naked mole rats extraordinary traits including in regions of p and the hyaluronan receptors cd and hmmr rhamm furthermore we developed a freely_available web_portal the naked_mole genome resource http www naked_mole org featuring the data and results of our analysis to assist researchers interested in the genome and genes of the naked_mole and also to facilitate further studies on this fascinating species availability_and the naked_mole genome resource is freely_available online at http www naked_mole org this resource is open_source and the source_code is available at https github com maglab naked_mole portal the naked_mole nmr heterocephalus glaber is a long_lived subterranean rodent native to the horn of africa it can not only live to years making it the longest lived rodent but is also extremely resistant to neoplasia and as a result is an ideal model for research on longevity cancer and disease_resistance the nmr genome was sequenced at the bgi in to fold coverage with a contig n of kb and scaffold n of mb here we describe a higher quality assembly hetgla female which has subsequently been sequenced by us at the broad institute its analysis and availability on a purpose built portal the naked_mole genome resource http www naked_mole org hetgla female has substantially_higher n for contigs kb and scaffolds mb when compared with the kim et_al assembly ng values based on a c value of pg source http www genomesize com result species php id are also considerably_higher for hetgla female kb for contigs versus kb for the kim et_al assembly and mb for scaffolds versus mb to assist researchers in studying the genome and genes of the nmr to improve understanding of its extraordinary traits and also to foster further studies_employing this fascinating species we developed a freely_available web_portal the naked_mole genome resource http www naked_mole org our portal features an annotation of the hetgla female assembly generated by the ncbi using the ncbi eukaryotic_genome annotation_pipeline http www ncbi nlm nih gov books nbk to assess the accuracy of this annotation proteins were identified which exhibit at least length conservation between human mouse rat_and orthologs of these exceed the same length threshold using to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as the annotation of the hetgla female assembly compared with using the annotation of kim et_al all annotated nmr sequences derived from the ncbi annotation of hetgla female are available on our portal coding_sequences non coding_sequences and proteins the best match nmr transcripts were identified based on coding sequence_length similarity with the guinea_pig ortholog for which protein_alignments and ka_ks ratios calculated with the codeml program of the paml package v using default_parameters and guinea_pig mouse rat and human orthologs are also included on the portal genes that have been associated with longevity are cross_linked with the genage database http www naked_mole org annotations results genage a blast interface is also provided to allow users to quickly and easily search for sequences of interest including coding and non coding_sequences proteins and scaffolds we have previously also sequenced the nmr transcriptome which allowed us to compare liver gene_expression between nmrs and wildderived mice the data and results of this work can also be downloaded http www naked_mole org static downloads rna_seq supplements zip moreover an additional fold coverage assembly of the nmr genome generated by the genome_analysis centre tgac based on two illumina paired_end runs is available for download http www naked_mole org static downloads naked_mole contigs zip guinea_pig genes were used to analyse nmr orthologs of potential significance because it is the most closely_related with a high coverage genome functionally enriched david v clusters using human mouse orthologs and a background of the best match transcripts otherwise default_parameters were used with an enrichment score corresponding to p for the top of nmr genes by ka_ks included cytokine activity signal_peptide and defense_response given the higher quality of this more recent genome_annotation we assessed whether we could identify novel candidate_genes in the nmr that were not detected by kim et_al in particular because p substitutions identical to those found in human_tumours have been identified in the related blind mole rat spalax ehrenbergi it is relevant to assess whether there is any evidence of adaptive_evolution in nmr p while the nmr p coding_sequence is not surprisingly subject to purifying_selection ka_ks a window from codons was observed encompassing transactivation_domain tadii and most of the proline_rich prd which had a signature of positive_selection ka_ks the prd is found between residues and of the human and mouse proteins respectively the human prd contains numerous prolines including five pxxp p proline x any amino_acid compared with only two in mouse and one in rat interestingly the nmr prd substitutions include four proline_residues resulting in an additional four pxxp motifs relative to the guinea_pig domain this raises the possibility of convergent_evolution of additional prolines and pxxp motifs in the p prds of humans and nmrs two species which evolved an extended lifespan and consequent requirement for an enhanced dna_damage in addition there are two nmr substitutions in the aatadii which has been reported to mediate apoptosis by activating targets including mdm and bax numerous proteins have been shown to interact with p including brca via a region from residues there is a strong_signal of selection within this region of nmr brca particularly from codons ka_ks which may influence the interaction with p early contact_inhibition eci has been identified as a novel anti cancer mechanism in the nmr with high_molecular hyaluronan as the extracellular signal which is partly transmitted via the cd receptor interestingly a signal of selection ka_ks was observed not only in cd from guinea_pig codons and but also in another hyaluronan receptor hmmr rhamm from codons and suggesting that it may also contribute to transmission of the eci signal kim et_al reported that relative to mice two early stop_codons in the nmr p ink a transcript were predicted to produce a truncated protein there are no cdkn a transcripts in the ncbi annotation however a predicted transcript was generated based on alignments of the mouse and guinea_pig exons with the assembly and transcriptome although there are no significant differences with the transcript predicted by kim et_al it is important to note that the guinea_pig protein is also of similar length and shorter than in mice indicating that this is not an nmr specific adaptation in conclusion we have developed a nmr portal using a genome_assembly of superior quality for the research_community to benefit from this data our portal is designed so it can be easily updated if the nmr genome_annotation is updated in
