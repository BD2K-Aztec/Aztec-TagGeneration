gene_expression genomic data_integration using guided clustering motivation in biomedical_research transcriptomic proteomic or metabolomic_profiles of patient samples are often combined with genomic_profiles from experiments in cell_lines or animal_models integrating experimental_data with patient data is still a challenging_task due to the lack of tailored statistical_tools results here we introduce guided clustering a new data_integration strategy that combines experimental and clinical high_throughput data guided clustering identifies sets of genes that stand out in experimental_data while at the same time display coherent expression in clinical data we report on two potential applications the integration of clinical microarray_data with i genome_wide chromatin_immunoprecipitation and ii with cell perturbation assays unlike other analysis strategies guided clustering does not analyze the two datasets sequentially but instead in a single_joint analysis in a simulation_study and in several biological_applications guided clustering performs favorably when compared with sequential_analysis approaches availability guided clustering is available as a r package fromtoday molecular_profiling technologies allow the characterization of clinical biopsies which capture complementary cellular properties including genotype methylation_state transcriptome proteome and metabolome snapshots moreover the same technologies are used in experiments with cell_lines or primary_cell where they are complemented by chromatin_immunoprecipitation like chip_seq proteinprotein_interaction screens or protein_localization assays each profiling technology sheds different and partly complementary light on the functioning and malfunctioning of cells however their joint full potential can only be realized when the two information_sources are combined thus integrating data from different sources is an important part of modern biomedical_research an important aspect of data_integration is the development to whom correspondence should be addressed of tailored statistical_methods that are able to leverage knowledge contained within a diverse range of data_sources and at the same time being able to provide evidence to answer the types of question being posed by the research_community as a whole while the concept of statistical data_integration is self evident its realization in genomics is challenging obstacles include the heterogeneity of experimental_setups study_designs profiling platforms sample handling and data management furthermore missing metadata and insufficient documentation of heuristic and complex multistep analysis procedures complicate the endeavor heterogeneities can in part be overcome by data_integration on the level of gene_lists all datasets are analyzed individually and gene_sets or ranked_list of genes are produced in a subsequent meta_analysis step the studies are integrated by detecting significant overlaps of gene_sets enrichment of genes sets in ranked lists or similarities of multiple ranked lists this strategy avoids the need for joint quantitative data models that describe the dependencies between individual quantitative profiles a quantitative approach is the concatenation of feature_vectors from different platforms in the context of classification_problems if several types of high_dimensional readouts are available for the same group of samples predictive signatures can be constructed by combining selected_features across all data types thus exploring potential complementary information somewhat surprisingly several authors observed only marginal improvements in classification_accuracy resulting from data_integration in complementary work data_integration has been used to aggregate information across clinical and experimental sample populations rather than platforms combined data generated experimentally by overexpression of active oncogenes in non malignant breast_epithelial with tumor_samples of various carcinomas signatures of pathway activation were learnt on the primary cell_culture data and applied to tumor profiles for predicting pathway activation_status outcome and treatment efficiency of the cancer samples the exact opposite sequential_analysis strategy is described by the authors start their analysis on the clinical data by identifying clusters of strongly coexpressed genes which they subsequently test for joint differential_expression between experimental_conditions here the experimental_data cannot influence the formation but the selection of gene_clusters the first analysis approach to combine both data_sets from the outset is described in applying a class_discovery method by vonin a semisupervised setting the authors find classifications of patientpage we introduce guided clustering a new method for the combined analysis of clinical microarray_gene and experimental_data our method is controlled by two parameters and while is selected automatically has to be specified by the user with the help of these parameters guided clustering circumvents the need for crisp cutoffs of gene_lists and clusters used by most competing_methods even though both parameters are chosen based on the training data they are not tuned to enhance any fit their purpose is to balance the influence of both datasets in fact we did not observe any overfitting phenomenon in simulations with separate test and training data data not shown guided clustering is flexible and can be adapted to various data_integration challenges here we applied it in the context of a study on dlbcl that was guided to focus on aspects of bcl and tolllike receptor_signaling we could establish a novel prognostic_index in dlbcl which holds more prognostic_information than existing predictors of survival the composition of the genes underlying this index point to a link between bcl activity and toll_like signaling we experimentally strengthened this link by an lps stimulation experiment combined with a second guided clustering analysis we observed that targets of lps mediated tolllike receptor_signaling and bcl targets are coherently expressed in a large collection of dlbcl suggesting that bcl in fact influences the transcriptional program by toll_like signaling in dlbcl
