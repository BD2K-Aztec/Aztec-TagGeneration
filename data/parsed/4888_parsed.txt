waltz db a benchmark database of amyloidogenic hexapeptides accurate prediction of amyloid forming amino_acid remains an important challenge we here present an online database that provides open_access to the largest set of experimentally_characterized amyloid forming hexapeptides to this end we expanded our previous set of hexapeptides used to develop the waltz algorithm with peptides from literature_review and by systematic experimental characterisation of the aggregation of hexapeptides by transmission_electron dye binding and fourier_transform this brings the total number of experimentally_characterized hexapeptides in the waltz db database to of which are annotated as positive for amyloid_formation availability_and the waltz db database is freely_available without any registration requirement at http waltzdb amyloid_formation by proteins is widely_recognized as a pathogenic mechanism in diverse_diseases such as alzheimer_disease and type_ii but also as a functional mechanism of biological nanostructure formation such as the chorion protein that stabilizes insect eggshell it has been generally established that the formation of amyloid_fibrils by proteins is nucleated by short aggregation_prone segments apr of the polypeptide_chain which are a necessary and sufficient requirement to allow amyloid conversion of a folded protein in amyloid these short stretches form an intermolecular beta_sheet that runs parallel to the fiber axis indicated as the cross beta structure the sequence that constitute aprs are usually characterized by a high beta_sheet propensity and hydrophobicity and a low net_charge computational_tools have been developed to predict amylogenic or aggregation propensities of proteins by detecting aprs in polypeptide sequences reviewed elsewhere we earlier developed the waltz amyloid prediction algorithm maurer which is a data based statistical_method that uses a position_specific for its data representation as the quality of statistical_methods depends critically on the quantity number and sequence_diversity of known positive_and examples and quality confidence of the amyloid status of the available data we decided to increase the available high_confidence learning data by an order of magnitude this was achieved by expanding the set of hexapeptides of known amyloid forming proteins with an additional experimentally_verified hexapeptides derived from different proteins combined with an additional peptides derived from literature_review bringing the total number of hexapeptides to v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com
