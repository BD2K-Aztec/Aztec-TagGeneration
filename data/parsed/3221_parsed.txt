genome_analysis netcomm a network_analysis tool based on communicability motivation set based network similarity_metrics are increasingly used to productively analyze genome_wide data conventional approaches such as mean shortest_path and clique based metrics have been useful but are not well suited to all applications computational scientists in other disciplines have developed commu nicability as a complementary metric network communicability considers all paths of all lengths between two network_members given the success of previous network_analyses of proteinprotein_interactions we applied the concepts of network communicability to this problem here we show that our communicability implementation has advantages over traditional approaches overall analyses suggest network communicability has considerable utility in analysis of large_scale biological_networks availability_and we provide our method as an r package for use in both human proteinprotein_interaction network_analyses and analyses of arbitrary networks along with a tutorial atmany types of biological data for example proteinprotein_interactions coexpression data and biomedical_research literature naturally lend themselves to formation of interconnected networks while finding meaningful connections between network_members i e nodes proteins or genes can be challenging networks provide an opportunity to contextualize results at the system level standard analyses rely on relationships between individual pairs of nodes and can be vulnerable to stochasticity and technical errors identifying sets of relationships between individual nodes and groups of others is one strategy for a more robust metric of connectedness the challenge_remains to retain topological information while simplifying network interactions into univariate representations for statistical_analysis and comparison with other data types a number of metrics have been successfully_applied to the analysis of biological_networks previously shortest_path analysis assesses the fewest connections i e edges required to connect a query node to one or more targets however nodes which themselves have many connections i e high degree are on average closer to all nodes therefore identifying meaningful relationships by shortest_path often requires some form of degree correction another weakness of shortest_path analysis is that two or more paths of the same length are equivalent to a single path of that length thus information regarding connectedness is lost jaccard similarity between two nodes is the quotient of the intersection and the union of their kth degree interactors this metric is useful for testing connections to near by nodes but performs poorly for nodes that are far apart the method of random_walk mean first passage assesses how soon a random_walk leaving a node takes to reach a given target this metric may also require degree correction researchers in physics have proposed communicability as a metric of connectedness we previously used communicability to identify proteins connected in the human ppi_network to a set of epilepsy proteins to aid identification of novel epilepsy genes communicability considers paths of all lengths between two nodes scaled by the factorial of path_length retaining more information about connectedness compared with shortest_path metrics it remains useful across greater path lengths compared with jaccard similarity and avoids algorithmic stochasticity communicability is still influenced by degree and is challenged by large_networks such as the human proteinprotein_interaction here we propose a degree normalized network connectedness metric inspired by network communicability and suitable for analysis of large complex_networks we provide an implementation for the human ppi_network as well as tools for arbitrary networks we assessed connectedness of proteins causative of mendelian_diseases that have been previously classified to phenotypic classes we used the inweb network to calculate mean communicabilities of proteins causing neurological and cardiovascular_disease to those of other classes our metric identified increased connectedness among proteins within classes than between classes and outperformed shortest_path supplementary our method similarly identified interactions among gene_products associated with type_diabetes
