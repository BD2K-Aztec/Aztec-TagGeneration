sequence_analysis a gradient_boosting approach for filtering de_novo mutations in parent_offspring trios motivation whole_genome and exome_sequencing on parentoff spring trios is a powerful approach to identifying disease associated genes by detecting de_novo mutations in patients accurate detection of de_novo mutations from sequencing_data is a critical step in trio based genetic_studies existing bioinformatic approaches usually yield high_error due to sequencing artifacts and alignment issues which may either miss true de_novo mutations or call too many false ones making downstream validation and analysis difficult in particular current approaches have much worse specificity than sensitivity and developing_effective filters to discriminate genuine from spurious de_novo mutations remains an unsolved challenge results in this article we curated sequence_features in whole_genome and exome alignment context which are considered to be relevant to discriminating true de_novo mutations from artifacts and then employed a machine_learning approach to classify candidates as true or false de_novo mutations specifically we built a classifier named de_novo mutation filter dnmfilter using gradient_boosting as the classification algorithm we built the training_set using experimentally_validated true and false de_novo mutations as well as collected false de_novo mutations from an in house large_scale exome_sequencing project we evaluated dnmfilters theoretical performance and investigated relative importance of different sequence_features on the classification_accuracy finally we applied dnmfilter on our in house whole exome trios and one ceu trio from the genomes_project and found that dnmfilter could be coupled with commonly used de_novo mutation detection approaches as an effective filtering_approach to significantly reduce false_discovery without sacrificing sensitivity availability the software dnmfilter implemented using a combination of java and r is freely_available from the website atde novo mutations dnms represent the most extreme form of rare_variants and play_an in human_diseases with rapid development of high_throughput large_scale wholegenome or exome_sequencing of parentoffspring trios or multiplex_families is becoming a powerful approach to investigating dnms associated with human disease recent sequencing studies have revealed that dnms can affect genes with diverse biological_consequences in several neuropsychiatric_diseases such as autism_spectrum intellectual_disability schizophrenia and epileptic encephalopathies here we focus on a critical step in such studies the detection of dnms from whole_genome exome_sequencing in parent_offspring trios the standard approach used by most studies is to call variants in each sample of a trio independently and then identify putative dnms by comparing offspring against parental genotypes with mendelian inconsistency therefore a false_positive variant call in offspring or a false_negative variant call in either parent will result in a false_positive dnm call conversely a false_negative variant call in offspring or a false_positive variant call in either parent will result in a false_negative dnm call although there have been great improvements in development of single and multiple sample variant_calling approaches a variety of factors including sequencing artifacts and alignment issues lead to high rates of both false_positive variant_calls although allele_frequency and linkage_disequilibrium ld have been successfully leveraged to improve variant_calling accuracy it cannot apply to dnm calling because no such information is available for new mutations distinct from standard_approaches methods that jointly_model parentoffspring relationships within a trio have been developed specifically for dnm calling by utilizing mendelian_inheritance information within a trio for example denovogear calculates a posterior_probability of being a true dnm call for every candidate variant site by taking_into all three samples genotype likelihoods under a prior based on genome_wide dnm rate polymutt calculates maximum likelihoods of genotype configurations without and with mendelian constraint respectively and then takes the ratio of the two resulting likelihoods as the cutoff the larger the ratio the more confident the dnm call is due to the use of extra_information in the model joint modeling_approaches achieve much improved accuracy compared to standard_approaches both standard and joint modeling_approaches can achieve high_sensitivity however in terms of specificity despite the better performance of joint modeling over standard_approaches both approaches rely on information of single sites assuming all reads having been correctly mapped so they cannot eliminate false_positive dnm calls originating from alignment mistakes heuristic filtering strategies and visual alignment inspection via genome_browsers are usually used to filter out such false_positive dnm calls however it is inherently difficult to select appropriate filtering parameter combinations to accommodate sensitivity_and simultaneously it is also impractical to manually inspect a large number of candidates these challenges necessitate the development of effective and automated dnm filtering algorithms machine_learning is a powerful approach to modeling complex multidimensional data and has been successfully_applied to nextgeneration_sequencing ngs_data to identify genetic_variants for example variant quality_score recalibration in genome_analysis gatk uses a semi_supervised machine_learning algorithm gaussian_mixture to estimate the probability that each variant is a true polymorphism rather than a sequencer alignment or data_processing artifact by evaluating sequence_features extracted from true variants typically hapmap sites and polymorphic_sites on the omni m snp chip array supervised machine_learning which usually train a model with known true and false_positive variants are also widely used to classify candidates as real variants versus artifacts for example snpsvm o utilizes support_vector svm to detect single_nucleotide snvs the atlas suite builds a logistic regression_model to call snvs insertions_and indels forestsv and svm employs random_forest rf and svm to detect large structural_variants svs in addition mutationseq makes use of four algorithms including rf svm bayesian additive regression tree and logistic_regression to identify somatic_mutations from tumornormal paired sequencing_data because these machine_learning can incorporate multidimensional sequence_features into a model they usually yield better results than approaches that are based on single or very few sequence_features since dnms are extremely_rare oftentimes real mutations are buried in a mass of false calls in this article we develop a supervised machine_learning based_approach namely dnmfilter to effectively sift out false dnm calls from a large number of putative candidates we choose gradient_boosting as the classification algorithm for dnmfilter based on recent_reports showing that it can achieve better performance than other supervised machine_learning in many conditions and our own preliminary comparative_analysis data not shown dnmfilter is designed to train a model based on experimentally_validated and collected dnms and then classify each novel candidate as a true or false dnm probabilistically in the following sections we describe dnmfilter a gradient_boosting approach for classifying and filtering dnm candidates identified from any computational or manual approaches we investigate multidimensional sequence_features in whole_genome and exome alignment context that have been shown to be relevant to dnm calls then we illustrate how to employ gradient_boosting to design dnmfilter based on these features we evaluate dnmfilters theoretical performance and evaluate the contribution of different sequence_features finally we apply dnmfilter on in house whole exome trios and one wholegenome ceu trio from the genomes_project gp to investigate its general performance in practice given a training_set of x y x y x n y n boosting aims to find n approximation fx to a function f x that minimizes the expected value of some specified loss function l y f x as followsboosting iteratively fits an additive expansion of the formwhere m is the expansion coefficient hx m is the base classifier parameterized by m gradient_boosting is one kind of boosting algorithms that applies steepest descent to minimize the loss function on the training data at iteration step m the gradient is calculated by fx n g t is updated as followswhere m is the step_length which is calculated bygradient boosting machine makes use of decision_trees as the base classifiers and implements the above generic gradientboosting algorithm in addition stochastic gradient_boosting incorporates the idea of bagging to gradient_boosting machine which can improve the performance by fitting every base classifier with bootstrapped samples of the whole dataset at each iteration step in this article we use gradient_boosting machine as well as stochastic gradient_boosting implemented in the r gbm package http cran r project org_web gbm index html as to the parameter_settings bernoulli distribution is chosen as the loss function shrinkage is set to tree construction depth is set to and bag fraction is set to moreover fold_cross is used for tuning the number of iterations the remaining parameters are all with gbm packages default_settings in addition a score between and will be produced for each prediction representing the probability of the classification as the true dnm we build the training_set using the approach described in section and evaluate the models theoretical classification_performance in addition we evaluate different sequence_features contribution to the models performance furthermore we combine dnmfilter with commonly used dnm detection approaches and apply them on in house whole exome trios and one gp ceu trio to look into its performance in the general_case in summary we developed dnmfilter a novel gradient_boosting based_approach for filtering dnms identified in parentoffspring trios we curated sequence_features in wholegenome and exome alignment context and employed gradient_boosting as the classification algorithm we built the training_set with confirmed true and false_positive dnms as well as collectedfalse positive dnms the evaluation of theoretical performance demonstrates that dnmfilter works confidently for its designed purpose according to feature relative importance measure we showed that alignment error is a significant cause of false dnm calls we also applied dnmfilter on in house whole exome trios and one gp ceu trio and found that dnmfilter could maintain the high_sensitivity and significantly reduce false_positive dnms when coupled with commonly used dnm detection approaches all results indicate that dnmfilter is a valuable complement for existing dnm detection approaches by combining dnmfilter with any dnm detection approach es into a pipeline users can first relax the confidence of detection step to ensure sensitivity and then dnmfilter can be employed to filter out false_positive dnm calls which eventually leads to a reasonable size of highly confident dnm call set for experimental_validation and further analysis in particular dnmfilter is expected to work best when it is applied to samples from the same sequencing and alignment pipeline as the ones used in the training_set in future we will consider extending dnmfilter to other kinds of dnms such as indels and svs currently dnmfilters power is largely limited by the small number of known dnms especially for potential de_novo indel and sv filtering as more parentoffspring trios are sequenced in future more dnms within a more complete variant spectrum will be validated and incorporated into the training_set we plan to actively update dnmfilter with new whole exome and genome data to make it more effective and robust we also consider incorporating additional relevant sequence_features to capture a more comprehensive pattern discriminating true and false dnm calls that might not be represented by existing sequence_features we hope that dnmfilter is useful to the community as either a stand alone tool for detecting dnms or a filtering strategy combined with other dnm detection_tools to boost both sensitivity_and
