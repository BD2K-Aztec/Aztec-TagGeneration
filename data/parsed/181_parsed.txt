structural_bioinformatics a highly_accurate statistical_approach for the prediction of transmembrane barrels motivation transmembrane barrels tmbbs belong to a special structural_class of proteins predominately found in the outer_membranes of gram_negative mitochondria and chloroplasts tmbbs are surface exposed proteins that perform a variety of functions ranging from nutrient_acquisition to osmotic regulation these properties suggest that tmbbs have great_potential for use in vaccine or drug_therapy development however membrane_proteins such as tmbbs are notoriously_difficult to identify and characterize using traditional experimental_approaches and current prediction_methods are still unreliable results a prediction method based on the physicochemical_properties of experimentally_characterized tmbb structures was developed to predict tmbb encoding_genes from genomic_databases the freemanwimley prediction algorithm developed in this study has an accuracy of and mcc of when using the most efficient prediction criteria which is better than any previously_published algorithm availability the ms windows compatible application is available for download atthe transmembrane barrel tmbb is one of two major structural_classes of membrane_spanning proteins tm helical bundles are the other tmbbs are found in the outer_membranes of gramnegative bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts while tm helical bundles are found in the cytoplasmic membranes of all living_organisms although genes that encode tmbbs are estimated to represent at least of all protein_coding in gram_negative tmbbs represent only of the solved_protein from gram_negative as a rapidly_expanding number of genomic_sequences become available using in silico methods to identify previously_unknown tmbbs is an appealing alternative to more difficult and time consuming experimental methods such as crystallography computational tmbb prediction_methods can identify candidate_genes in order to perform experimental_validation or structural proteomics on a more focused population to whom correspondence should be addressed these methods also provide the opportunity to identify and characterize tmbbs that may not be expressed under standard culturing conditions and thus would go unobserved using traditional screening methods such as proteomic_analysis computational_prediction have been used to predict tm helices with an accuracy of for nearly a decade tm helices are simple stretches of hydrophobic_residues which can be predicted with near perfect accuracy using experimentally_determined hydrophobicity scales an example of such a program is mpex however the prediction of tmbbs presents a more difficult challenge due to the cryptic nature of the tmbb structure the tmbb structure is a series of anti_parallel strands that are arranged in a cylindrical geometry forming a structure that resembles a barrel the tm strands of tmbbs consist of amino_acids arranged in an alternating dyad repeat pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues where the hydrophobic side_chains face the lipid_environment and the hydrophilic sidechains face the interior of the barrel the hairpin which is the major structural_unit of the tmbb is a pair of anti_parallel tm strands connected by a short loop of residues i e hairpin turn the hairpins are connected to each other by loops of varying length the complexities and irregularities in the structure including the variations in loop length and composition deviations from the pattern of hydrophobicity in some strands and the low information content e g only five hydrophobic_residues in a tm strand make the identification of tmbbs especially problematic there are a wide_variety of tmbb prediction_algorithms that utilize machine_learning ranging from bayesian_networks to k nearest_neighbor methods machine_learning are designed to identify the common features of the tmbbs in a training_dataset as well as features that distinguish tmbbs from other types of proteins the distinguishing variables as interpreted by the algorithm are used as rules to classify a test sequence although these methods can yield reasonable tmbb prediction_accuracies their predictions are still less reliable than those made for tm helical bundles besides achieving less than ideal prediction_accuracy a major disadvantage of using a machine_learning is that it cannot be used for hypothesis_testing because the variables used to make the predictions are either hidden or arbitrary thus there is no discernable link between the variables and the physicochemical_properties of the experimentally solved tmbb structures a tmbb prediction algorithm based on the physicochemical_properties of tmbbs was developed in this lab this algorithm is based on an analysis of the structure and compositionpage
