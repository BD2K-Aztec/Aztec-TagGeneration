data_and pcircrna finder a software for circrna prediction in plants motivation recent_studies reveal an important role of non coding circular rna circrna in the control of cellular_processes because of differences in the organization of plant and mammal gen omes the sensitivity and accuracy of circrna prediction programs using algorithms developed for animals and humans perform poorly for plants results a circrna prediction software for plants termed pcircrna finder was developed that is more sensitive in detecting circrnas than other frequently used programs such as find circ and circexplorer based on analysis of simulated and real rrna rnaase r rna_seq from arabidopsis_thaliana and rice pcircrna finder provides a more comprehensive sensitive precise prediction method for plants circrnas availability and implementationnon coding circular rna circrna is a covalently continuous closed_loop that usually originates from exonic_regions named exonic circrna but can also arise from intronic and intergenic_regions circrnas can function as a mirna sponge and have the potential to enhance transcription of their host_genes the emergence of rrna depleted high_throughput rna_seq technology provides a revolutionary approach for the systematic discovery of circrnas in various species including human mouse arabidopsis and rice a robust method for circrna identification is an important tool for investigating the role of these molecules the available circrna prediction_methods e g find circ and circexplorer were primarily developed for use with human or animal datasets there are large differences between mammal and plant_genomes and therefore the prediction_accuracy and sensitivity of detecting circrnas in plants using the currently available methods are relatively low in this study we developed a software termed pcircrna finder that shows a more comprehensive ability and greater sensitivity and precision in predicting circrnas in plants false predictions dues to the high_copy of genes in plants supplementary data ii annotator that can be used to annotate the candidate exonic backsplice sites based on available gene_annotation recent_studies that circrnas backsplicing site is flexible and alternative_splicing of circrnas is prevalent much of the alternative_splicing of circrnas occurred near by canonical splicing sites and therefore bp flanking the two canonical backsplice sites acceptor and donor were allowed for our candidate backsplice sites and iii filter which is a quality_control module for the above candidate circrnas it creates a pseudoref file with the flanking_sequences of chiastic backsplice sites and then maps raw_reads to it and confirms the backsplice sites it also requires that the candidate circrnas contain at least one of two kinds of splicing signals either a u based spliceosome usually with a consensus_sequence of gt ag and gc ag and a u based minor spliceosome usually with a consensus_sequence of at ac
