sequence_analysis basic cseq an r bioconductor_package for analyzing c seq data basic cseq is an r bioconductor_package for basic filtering analysis and subsequent near cis visualization of c seq data the package processes aligned c seq raw_data stored in binary alignment map bam format and maps the short_reads to a corresponding virtual fragment library functions are included to create virtual fragment_libraries providing chromosome position and further information on c seq fragments length and uniqueness of the fragment ends and blindness of a fragment for any bsgenome package an optional filter is included for bam_files to remove invalid c seq reads and further filter functions are offered for c seq fragments additionally basic quality_controls based on the read_distribution are included fragment data in the vicinity of the experiments viewpoint are visualized as coverage plot based on a running median approach and a multi_scale contact profile wig files or csv files of the fragment data can be exported for further analyses and visualizations of interactions with other programs availability_and basic cseq is implemented in r and available at http www bioconductor org a vignette with detailed_descriptions of the functions is included in the package contact carolin walter uni muenster decircular chromosome_conformation combined with high_throughput c seq is a method that allows the identification of chromosomal interactions between one potential interaction partner called viewpoint and virtually any other part of the genome two rounds of digestion and ligation with two distinct restriction_enzymes are performed to create a c seq library unlike regular next_generation data valid c seq reads can only originate from precisely_defined points in the genome any c seq read will map to the end of a so_called c seq fragment i e a genomic_region flanked by two primary restriction_sites when a secondary restriction_site is not present a fragment is called blind a fragment end is defined as the region between a primary restriction_site and the nearest secondary restriction_site van_de blind fragments are expected to yield less reads than non blind fragments the length of a fragment end in general can cause variations in the read_count any repetitive fragment end is to be interpreted with caution van_de consequently these properties have to be considered during the analysis of c seq data to prevent biases or misinterpretation van_de werken et_al s cseqpipe is a pipeline to analyze c seq data which respects these issues van_de however it is not embedded into the r bioconductor environment has little transparency regarding internal data_structures limited output options and less flexibility for smaller interactions with a length of up to kb the package r cseq works on regular binary alignment map bam_files and can detect and visualize interactions but does not differentiate between fragment types which is a source of bias the recently_published foursig method includes fragment filtering options and detects different types of interactions but does not provide more complex visualization routines for the data profile in the viewpoint region in contrast basic cseq offers routines for the analysis of c seq fragment data that are easy to customize provided functionality includes fragment filtering quality_control explorative near cis visualization and data export import functions
