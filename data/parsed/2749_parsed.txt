lola enrichment_analysis for genomic_region sets and regulatory_elements in r and bioconductor genomic_datasets are often interpreted in the context of large_scale reference_databases one approach is to identify significantly overlapping gene_sets which works well for gene centric data however many types of high_throughput data are based on genomic_regions locus overlap analysis lola provides easy and automatable enrichment_analysis for genomic_region sets thus facilitating the interpretation of functional_genomics and epigenomics data availability_and r package available in bioconductor and on the following website http
