almostsignificant simplifying quality_control of high_throughput the current_generation of dna_sequencing produce a large amount of data quickly all of these data need to pass some form of quality_control qc processing and checking before they can be used for any analysis the large number of samples that are run through illumina sequencing_machines makes the process of qc an onerous and time consuming task that requires multiple pieces of information from several sources results almostsignificant is an open_source platform for aggregating multiple sources of quality_metrics as well as run and sample meta_data associated with dna_sequencing runs from illumina sequencing_machines almostsignificant is a graphical platform to streamline the qc of dna se quencing data to store these data for future reference together with extra meta_data associated with the sequencing runs not typically retained this simplifies the challenge of monitoring the volume of data produced by illumina sequencers almostsignificant has been used to track the quality of over sequencing runs covering over samples produced over the last three years availability the code and documentation for almostsignificant is freely_available at https github com bartongroup almostsignificant contactthe current_generation of high_throughput short_read dna_sequencing quickly generate large_datasets but all sequencing_technologies produce errors whether systematic technical or simple human mistakes tracking the quality of the sequence_data is critical to a successful experiment but can become time consuming for all but the smallest projects monitoring the success of a sequencing run requires dedicated software located on the sequencing machine or standalone software provided by its manufacturer these are often used in conjunction with tools such as fastqc www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc for assessing the quality of the output fastq_files and fastqscreen www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastq screen to check for contaminating dna although these tools are simple to use and interpret for a handful of samples or a single project this is difficult for sequencing facilities that handle many sequencing runs simultaneously almostsignificant is open_source software_designed to simplify the aggregation of quality statistics for sequencing runs from illumina_miseq nextseq and hiseq machines the single consistent interface for viewing these data helps to quickly and efficiently identify potential issues with sequencing runs lanes within the run or with the original samples aggregating information into a single system has the added bonus of allowing extraneous meta_data to be gathered automatically and the overall quality trends in sequencing runs to be viewed thus the data production and run protocol for each machine can be tracked over time and so guide lab side decision_making and problem_solving in contrast to services such as illuminas basespace almostsignificant uses local_resources is open_source and all data remains local while there are tools with some similarity to almostsignificant e g statsdb there are distinguishing differ
