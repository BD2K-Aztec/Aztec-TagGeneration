cyclefreeflux efficient removal of thermodynamically infeasible loops from flux_distributions motivation constraint based metabolic modeling_methods such as flux_balance fba are routinely used to predict metabolic phenotypes e g growth_rates atp yield or the fitness of gene_knockouts one frequent difficulty of constraint based_solutions is the inclusion of thermo dynamically infeasible loops or internal cycles which add nonbiological fluxes to the predictions results we propose a simple postprocessing of constraint based_solutions which removes internal cycles from any given flux distribution v without disturbing other fluxes not involved in the loops this new algorithm termed cyclefreeflux works by minimizing the sum of absolute fluxes jjvjj while i conserving the exchange fluxes and ii using the fluxes of the original solution to bound the new flux distribution this strategy reduces internal fluxes until at least one reaction of every possible internal cycle is inactive a necessary and sufficient condition for the thermo dynamic feasibility of a flux distribution if alternative representations of the input flux distribution in terms of elementary_flux exist that differ in their inclusion of internal cycles then cyclefreeflux is biased towards solutions that maintain the direction given by v and towards solutions with lower total flux jjvjj our method requires only one additional linear optimization making it computationally very efficient compared to alternative_strategies availability_and we provide freely_available r implementations for the enumer ation of thermodynamically infeasible cycles as well as for cycle free fba solutions flux variability calculations and random_sampling of solution spaces constraint based_methods for the functional analysis of metabolic_networks cbm or cobra methods rely on stoichiometric equations and do not require kinetic_information for individual reactions they are thus applicable to genome_scale systems flux_balance fba which involves the maximization of a fitness related objective_function in steady_state conditions has been successfully_applied to predict phenotypes such as growth_rates atp yield and the effects of gene_knockouts recent_publications have applied fba to predict drug_targets while others have used fba to study the evolution of metabolic systems fba predicts the maximal value of the objective functionoften the yield of biomass_production in the metabolic system a flux distribution one of the difficulties of fba predictions is that they frequently include thermodynamically infeasible internal cycles i e sets of reactions that together carry a flux that has no influence on the exchange reactions of the model these are metabolic perpetual motion machines and do not occur in biological reality such internal cycles thus distort predicted flux_distributions and should be removed from the predictions thermodynamically infeasible cycles affect not only the predictions of fba but also those of many other constraint based analysis methods in particular thermodynamically infeasible cycles distort the output of sampling algorithms that aim to characterize the steady_state solution_space and lead to the assignment of unrealistically high values to the flux ranges that can be carried by individual reactions in flux variability analysis fva at least for fba there exists a strategy that ensures the thermodynamic feasibility of the flux distribution the minimization of the sum of absolute fluxes under the additional constraint of an optimal value for the original objective_function minimization of total flux mtf this method aims to approximate a flux distribution that minimizes cellular investment into enzymes and is hence sometimes called parsimonious fba as a side effect of its parsimonious strategy mtf also removes any internal cycles mtf solutions do not represent the full thermodynamically_feasible solution_space of the original fba problem hence they cannot be used to characterize this full space which is the purpose of random_sampling algorithms and fva calculations several approaches for the identification and or exclusion of thermodynamically infeasible cycles have been proposed de the most widely used method ll cobra is based on the integration of thermodynamic_constraints with fba into a mixed integer linear problem milp however this approach is computationally_expensive resulting in runtimes that severely limit its applicability to large_scale studies here we propose a new algorithm termed cyclefreeflux which removes all thermodynamically infeasible cycles from any given flux distribution with a single linear optimization step this makes it orders_of than previous_approaches when applied to sampling or flux variability analyses of genome_scale
