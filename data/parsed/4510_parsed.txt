systems_biology systematic analysis of gene properties influencing organ system phenotypes in mammalian perturbations motivation diseases and adverse_drug are frequently caused by disruptions in gene functionality gaining insight into the global system properties governing the relationships between genotype and phenotype is thus crucial to understand and interfere with perturbations in complex organisms such as diseases states results we present a systematic analysis of phenotypic_information of perturbations of single genes in mice human_diseases and drugs that examines the relationships between different gene properties and the phenotypic impact at the organ system level in mammalian organisms we observe that while single gene perturbations and alterations of nonessential tissue_specific genes or those with low betweenness_centrality in proteinprotein_interaction often show organ specific effects multiple gene_alterations resulting e g from complex_disorders and drug_treatments have a more widespread impact interestingly certain cellular localizations are distinctly associated to systemic effects in monogenic disease genes and mouse gene perturbations such as the lumen of intracel lular organelles and transcription_factor complexes respectively in summary we show that the broadness of the phenotypic effect is clearly related to certain gene properties and is an indicator of the severity of perturbations this work contributes to the understanding of gene properties influencing the systemic effects of diseases andphenotypic traits are observable characteristic_features of organisms reflecting the architecture of their biological_systems deciphering genetic_factors as well as system properties associated to phenotypic_traits is still a central problem in biology and enormous efforts have been devoted to solve it this knowledge is fundamental for the understanding and interference with a disturbed biological system state such as a disease the recent explosion of omics_data has accelerated the discovery of novel relationships between genotypes and complex phenotypes such as multifactorial disorders and drug_induced perturbations where multiple and often unknown genes and environmental_factors are involved for example genome_wide in human populations are expanding the repertoire of genes linked to diseases and the systematic_analyses of adverse_effects of drugs and their molecular_targets are elucidating novel mechanisms of drug_action systematic single gene perturbation screenings in bacteria yeast and mice have illustrated that the phenotypic_responses occurring after single gene perturbations are greatly variable while perturbations of essential genes cause lethal_effects other gene_alterations show undetectable subtle or environment dependent phenotypes despite this observed phenotypic diversity the majority of system level analyses of perturbations has centered on gene properties linked to lethal phenotypes for example several topological_properties of genes in proteinprotein_interaction such as betweenness_centrality hereafter named betweenness have been associated with lethality moreover tissue gene_expression and cellular_localization of genes have also been related to lethality of perturbations in multicellular_organisms in particular genes expressed in multiple tissues tend to be essential both in human and mouse in contrast gene_products localized in vacuoles have been found enriched among human essential genes whose orthologous_genes are not essential in mouse although the knowledge about the association of gene properties with lethality is relevant to understand severe perturbations such as lethal monogenic_disorders novel conceptual approaches are needed to analyze system properties of non lethal perturbations frequently observed in humans such as complex_disorders or drug treatment in this regard the number of side_effects of a drug has been used as a measurement of the severity of drug response and has been studied in relation to the number of protein targets and to the essentiality and centrality of drug_targets in human proteinprotein_interaction however this measurement does not take into account the diversity of impaired organ_systems for example a drug exhibiting many side_effects related to the same organ system would be considered as being as severe as a drug affecting to whom correspondence should be addressed
