genetics_and gowinda unbiased analysis of gene_set for genome_wide an analysis of gene_set e g gene_ontology go enrichment assumes that all genes are sampled independently from each other with the same probability these assumptions are violated in genome_wide association gwa studies since i longer genes typically have more single_nucleotide resulting in a higher probability of being sampled and ii overlapping genes are sampled in clusters herein we introduce gowinda a software specifically_designed to test for enrichment of gene_sets in gwa studies we show that go tests on gwa data could result in a substantial number of false_positive go terms permutation_tests implemented in gowinda eliminate these biases but maintain sufficient power to detect enrichment of go terms since sufficient resolution for large_datasets requires millions of permutations we use multi threading to keep computation times reasonable availability_and gowinda is implemented_in v and freely_available onthe advent_of analysis such as single_nucleotide snp_arrays and next_generation enabled large_scale genome_wide association gwa studies or gwa like studies such as selective genotyping and experimental_evolution for almost any phenotype of interest these studies typically yield hundreds of candidate snps associated with the studied trait a wide_spread approach to shed light on the biological_implications of these snps is a test for gene_set e g gene_ontology go such an analysis of gene_set is based on the assumptions that all genes are sampled independently from each other with the same probability these assumptions are violated with data from gwa studies as i longer genes usually have more snps resulting in a higher probability of being sampled and ii overlapping genes are sampled in clusters
