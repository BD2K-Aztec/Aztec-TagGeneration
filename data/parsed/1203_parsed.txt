crnreals a toolbox for distinguishability and identifiability analysis of biochemical_reaction chemical_reaction network_theory is widely used in modeling and analyzing complex biochemical_systems such as metabolic_networks and cell signalling_pathways being able to produce all the biologically and chemically important qualitative dynamical features chemical reaction_networks crns have attracted_significant in the systems_biology community it is well known that the reliable inference of crn models generally requires thorough identifiability and distinguishability analysis together with carefully_selected prior modeling assumptions here we present a software toolbox crnreals that supports the distinguishability and identifiability analysis of crn models using recently_published optimization based procedures availability_and the crnreals toolbox and the associated documentation are available at http www iim csic es gingproc crnreals the toolbox runs under the popular matlab computational environment and supports several free and commercial linear_programming and mixed_integer solvers contact the key importance of dynamics in the explanation of complex phenomena occurring in living_systems is now a commonly_accepted view that underscores the importance of mathematical model_building and model parameter_estimation an important family of non negative non linear dynamical_systems is the class of deterministic chemical reaction_network crn models obeying the mass action law such networks can be used to describe pure chemical_reactions but they are also widely used to model the dynamics of intracellular_processes metabolic or cell signalling_pathways chemical_reaction network_theory crnt is originated in the s by the pioneering works of horn jackson and feinberg since then crnt has gained an increasing attention and many strong results have been published in the field on the relation between network_structure and qualitative dynamical_properties to whom correspondence should be addressed it is known from the early literature that different crns can produce exactly the same kinetic differential_equations this phenomenon is called macro equivalence or dynamical equivalence however effective optimization based procedures for the analysis and synthesis of dynamically equivalent crns have been developed only recently using the possibility of transforming propositional logic statements encoding structural_properties into mixed_integer milp problems the primary purpose of our toolbox is to make these numerical_methods accessible in an easily usable way as a related software_tool first we have to mention the chemical reaction_network toolbox that can produce detailed reports about the basic network_properties multiple and degenerate steady_states injectivity and strong concordance additionally the open_source ernest toolbox performs a detailed model analysis of the input crn by determining the basic system features and by using the deficiency zero or deficiency one theorems the toolbox is also capable of running the deficiency one algorithm where applicable however both of the above_mentioned toolboxes assume that the structure of the analyzed network is a priori known therefore they have no functionality for examining dynamical equivalence a software toolbox called crnreals was presented in this note for the analysis and synthesis of dynamically equivalent crns the tools provided by our software aid modeling and dynamical analysis in the following areas i they support the distinguishability and identifiability analysis of crn models by deciding whether a given crn has a unique_structure or not ii they clearly extend the application scope of crnt results by searching for dynamically equivalent network_structures with preferred properties such as density sparsity weak reversibility detailed complex balance etc and iii they allow the crnt based analysis of non negative polynomial models possibly coming from application areas other than bio chemistry further work in future versions will be focused on making the applied numerical_methods more effective and on including the recently_developed algorithms related to linear conjugacy thus extending the notion of dynamical equivalence
