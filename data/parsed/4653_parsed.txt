gene_expression the use of semiparametric mixed models to analyze pamchip peptide array data an application to an oncology experiment motivation phosphorylation by protein_kinases is a central theme in biological_systems aberrant protein kinase_activity has been implicated in a variety of human_diseases e g cancer therefore modulation of kinase_activity represents an attractive therapeutic_approach for the treatment of human illnesses thus identification of signature peptides is crucial for protein_kinase targeting and can be achieved by using pamchip microarray_technology we propose a flexible semiparametric mixed model for analyzing pamchip data this approach_enables the estimation of the phosphorylation rate velocity as a function of time together with pointwise confidence_intervals results using a publicly_available dataset we show that our model is capable of adequately fitting the kinase_activity profiles and provides velocity estimates over time moreover it allows to test for differences in the velocity of kinase inhibition between responding and non responding cell_lines this can be done at individual time point as well as for the entire velocity profile scientific advances in biotechnology bring us in a new era of targeted_therapies and personalized_medicine biomarkers are essential for selecting patients that benefit from certain treatments and biomarker_discovery is nowadays driven by novel platforms that measure more biological_properties more precisely evidently these technological_advances often require the development of optimal analysis approaches for its generated data in order to increase its detection_power here we propose a statistical_model to efficiently analyze output from pamchip microarrays these high content peptide arrays are capable of measuring phosphorylation changes over time for more than hundred peptides simultaneously to whom correspondence should be addressed compared to conventional microarrays pamchips have two main advantages first proteins are closer to phenotypic_expression than dna or mrna profiles second pamchips are not measuring concentrations but biological_activity i e phosphorylation over time an important application area of pamchip microarrays is the study of protein kinase_activity protein_kinase can specifically block key_signaling in cancer making kinases very popular targets in anticancer targeted_therapy discovery programs pamchip microarrays have a very distinct technical design see section of the supplementary_material for more details and the data properties of the pamchip read out are atypical compared with more traditional microarrays hence specific data analysis_pipeline has to be developed for pamchip microarrays in this article we demonstrate the statistical methodology to model the kinase_activity profiles and thereby estimate the phosphorylation rate referred to as velocity with the proposed approach phosphorylation rates can be investigated and tested for each peptide the article is organized as follows section_describes a real_life pamchip microarray experiment that is used to demonstrate our method in section we describe existing_methods for analyzing pamchip array data and motivate our approach in section we give a brief review of penalized smoothing splines formulated as mixed models specify the proposed model specifically adapt it to the pamchip array data at hand and focus on the inference problem of this study the results are given in section the discussion and conclusions are presented in sections and respectively signal_intensity profiles are the outcomes of the peptide microarray experiment and correspond to the degree of phosphorylation for assessing the impact of the kinase_inhibitor compound however the phosphorylation rate is required modeled peptide array data with an exponential model y ij y o y max where the y ij values stand for the signal_intensity of subject i at j th time point y o is the signal_intensities at the beginning of the experiment and y max is the maximum observed intensity is the reaction rate_constant and t j is the time point when the image was recorded only the initial_velocity of the peptide phosphorylation was used for subsequent data analysis preprocessed each pamchip profile separately using curvefitht software for deriving the initial_velocity at the first kinetic time point read they only used the first min of the assay and based all subsequent data analysis on the estimated initial velocities in particular the estimated initial velocities were log_transformed and are used for comparing responsive and non responsive cell_lines with a mixed model bothuse a two stage approach where i exponential models are used in the first stage to summarize the individual time series into a single value i e initial velocities and ii these estimated initial velocities are assessed in the downstream_analysis without accounting for their associated uncertainty hence they ignore the within replicate variability and only capture the technical variation between the replicates this can have a severe effect on the outcome of the second stage analysis if the within variability of the replicates is large as compared to the between variability and in case that the uncertainty of the initial_velocity estimates differs among replicates cell_lines or treatments hence the hilhorst method and the versele method might suffer from a loss in power efficiency and an incorrect control of the type_i we propose a semiparametric mixed_effects that combines both the estimation and modeling stage into a single analysis moreover the link between mixed models and smoothing provides a very flexible framework for estimating the kinase_activity profiles in a data_driven way within the mixed model framework it is very natural to account for the dependence_structure of the intensity signals within and across activity profiles by modeling all data for a given peptide simultaneously the proposed semiparametric mixed model allows for testing whether the change in phosphorylation rate velocity induced by the treatment compound effect differs between responsive and non responsive cell_lines the tests can be performed at any time point as well as for the entire profile simultaneously further velocity profiles can be derived as a function of time along with pointwise confidence bands we apply the proposed method to a publicly_available dataset from which we described in section similar to microarray_technology pamchip data are also subject to noise and we use background corrected intensity_measurements for the data analysis prior to fitting the model we examine the data for unusual observations and extreme profiles outlier removal has been done in three steps first we notice that some of the observations are negative for a given kinase_activity profile the pamchip software reports background corrected intensities hence negative observations might occur when the measured intensity for a particular peptide in a certain well does not exceed the background signal negative intensity_measurements are replaced by half of the positive minimum intensity measurement of that profile second we compute the area under the curve auc for each profile of a given cell_line analysis_of has been carried_out based on those auc values while taking the treatment as covariate with two levels extreme profiles whose residuals are beyond the square_root of the mean squared error are removed third we look at the observations within a profile and remove the extreme observations if they differ more than standard_deviations of the profile specific mean in this step we are able to remove extremely_high intensity_measurements spikes all these steps are repeated for each peptide and each cell_line supplementary figures s and s illustrate these preprocessing_steps for peptide ampe y and cell_line n the filtered data are then log_transformed to stabilize the variability over time protein_kinases are key_regulators of important_cellular including growth stress_response differentiation and apoptosis for drug_development signal_transduction research and clinical research in depth insight in the effects of stimuli on multiple protein_kinases is often required in order_to the effects of kinase_inhibitors the novel pamchip technology enables us to monitor kinase_activity in a highly multiplex setting with wide_range of peptides we have proposed a semiparametric mixed model to analyze pamchip array data our aim was to model the kinase_activity profiles and estimate the rate of phosphorylation velocity over time the proposed approach is capable of modeling these page
