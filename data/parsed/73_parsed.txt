a coalescent_based method for population_tree with haplotypes motivation population trees represent past population divergence histories the inference of population trees can be useful for the study of population evolution with the size of data increases in large_scale population_genetic projects such as the genomes_project there are new computational challenges for ancestral population inference including population_tree existing_methods for population_tree are mainly designed for unlinked genetic_variants e g single_nucleotide or snps there is a potential loss of information by not considering the haplotypes results in this article we propose a new population_tree method called stells h based on coalescent likelihood the likelihood is for haplotypes over multiple_snps within a non recom bining region not unlinked variants unlike many existing ancestral inference methods stells h does not use monte_carlo approaches when computing the likelihood for efficient computation the likelihood model is approximated but still retains much information about population divergence history stells h can find the maximum_likelihood population tree based on the approximate likelihood we show through simulation_data and the genomes_project data that stells h gives reasonably accurate inference results stells h is reasonably efficient for data of current interest and can scale to handle whole_genome data availability_and the population_tree method stells h has been implemented as part of the stells programthe inference of population demographic histories from population_genetic data has recently become an active research subject there are many aspects of demographic_history in this article we focus on the inference of the population divergence history including the order of divergence and the divergence time of multiple_populations the population divergence history can be modeled by a tree called the population tree the leaves of a population tree represent extant populations while internal nodes represent ancestral_populations accurate inference of population trees can greatly_facilitate the study of population demographic histories to see this we consider for example the program ima which performs inference under the isolation with migration model if a user wants to use ima to study multiple_populations then a population tree needs to be provided before the demographic histories of multiple_populations can be studied however there are no hints being offered by ima on how the population tree should be inferred another example is the treemix program developed in pickrell and pritchard treemix aims to infer population split and admixture history the first step of treemix is inferring the population tree which provides the foundation for the admixture inference in the following steps on a high_level population_tree is related to species tree_inference which has been studied extensively in phylogenetics however there are significant differences between these two inference problems first the time scale of a population tree is muchshorter than that of a species_tree in most cases second the sequence mutation models used in population_tree can be different from those used in species tree_inference for example the infinite sites model of mutations is often used in population_genetics but rarely in phylogenetics moreover population studies usually involve more individuals than what are typically found in phylogenetics studies so methods that infer species_trees from sequences e g may not be directly applicable to population_tree in this article we develop a maximum_likelihood population_tree approach_called stells h stells h works with haplotypes from multiple unlinked loci from multiple_populations the main_feature of stells h is its use of haplotypes rather than individual genetic_variations as used in existing population_tree methods e g and pickrell and pritchard the central computational_problem is computing the likelihood of population haplotypes under certain models such as coalescent models a major_challenge is that coalescent likelihood functions are often complicated and exact computation on these models is usually difficult at present monte_carlo methods such as markov_chain and importance sampling are often used for coalescent likelihood computation while these methods are certainly very useful in practice many existing monte_carlo methods suffer from long computational time for large_datasets conversely many existing_methods for analyzing_large genetic data often do not fully use the information contained in the data for example many approaches do not use haplotypes e g there is a potential loss of information by not considering the haplotypes in this article we take a different approach by approximating the coalescent likelihood of haplotypes to allow faster computation while still maintaining the appeal of coalescent models a limitation of stells h is that its likelihood computation is still computationally more demanding than methods e g treemix that do not use haplotypes therefore the data size that can be handled by stells h is smaller than methods such as treemix we will show that even with less data stells h still performs well when compared with existing_methods using larger amount of data in population_tree the following lists the features and assumptions of stells h the input of stells h is a set of haplotypes at each of k unlinked loci at a single locus haplotypes from each population cover multiple strongly linked single_nucleotide snp sites haplotypes at two different loci are assumed to be independent stells h finds the maximum_likelihood estimate of the population tree we will focus on inferring the topology of the population tree although stells h also infers the branch_lengths in coalescent units i e scaled by n generations where n is the diploid effective_population the computed likelihood is based on coalescent_theory and is computed in a deterministic way that is this is not a monte_carlo method the likelihood_function is approximated to allow faster computation we assume the infinite sites model of mutations we assume that intra locus recombination within the haplotypes can be ignored note that sometimes this assumption may not hold in practice in this case we adopt a simple preprocessing approach to allow stells h to work for data with some low_level of intra locus recombination similar to we do not explicitly address the effect of migration on population_tree in this article we also do not consider other demographic events such as population_size changes instead of including these processes e g migration in our model we will show that stells h is reasonably robust even for data that deviates from these ideal_conditions
