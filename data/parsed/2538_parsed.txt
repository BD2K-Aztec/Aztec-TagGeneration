interactiverosetta a graphical_user for the pyrosetta protein modeling suite modern biotechnical research is becoming increasingly reliant on computational structural_modeling programs to develop novel solutions to scientific questions rosetta is one such protein modeling suite that has already demonstrated wide applicability to a number of diverse research_projects unfortunately rosetta is largely a command_line driven software_package which restricts its use among non computational researchers some graphical interfaces for rosetta exist but typically are not as sophisticated as commercial software here we present interactiverosetta a graphical_interface for the pyrosetta framework that presents easy to use controls for several of the most widely used rosetta protocols alongside a sophisticated selection system utilizing pymol as a visualizer interactiverosetta is also capable of interacting with remote rosetta servers facilitating sophisticated protocols that are not accessible in pyrosetta or which require greater computational_resources availability_and interactiverosetta is freely_available at https github com schenc interactiverosetta releases and relies upon a separate download of pyrosetta which is available at http www pyrosetta org after obtaining a license free for academic use computational molecular_modeling has exhibited significant advances over the past several years leading to its more widespread use in academic and commercial research for novel structural engineering applications one significant software_package is the rosetta protein modeling suite which provides access to a wide_array of structural_modeling tools which have been successfully used for protein_engineering including protein design structure_prediction loop modeling and protein_docking among other tools unfortunately the main rosetta software_package has a command_line intended for use on unix operating_systems which limits its usability mainly to researchers with extensive c and unix operating system experience one significant_improvement in rosetta accessibility was the development of the pyrosetta package which provides python bindings to several of the main rosetta protocols and permits the user to design their own customized protocols using these bindings in python scripts later visualization capabilities were added to pyrosetta by synchronizing rosetta pose structures with the pymol molecular_visualization system www pymol org via the so_called pymol movers however a central graphical_interface that provides access to pyrosetta for researchers who are uncomfortable with python scripting is still a major_concern two notable graphical interfaces exist for pyrosetta foldit and the pyrosetta toolkit foldit provides an easy to use visualization and selection system but there only exist a couple of basic rosetta protocols such as minimization and basic protein design the pyrosetta toolkit provides a graphical_interface designed with pythons standard tkinter gui library adolf but a sophisticated visualization system is still missing recently rosettadiagrams www rosettadiagrams org provides a userfriendly interface for rosettascripts rosie rosetta online server that includes everyone provides access to computational_resources for big rosetta jobs we have developed a novel rosetta gui called interactiverosetta interactiverosetta provides several userfriendly controls for interacting with many of the common pyrosetta protocols including superimposition energy_minimization fixed backbone protein design kinematic closure kic loop modeling proteinprotein_docking point_mutations and parameterization tools for unrecognized pdb types interactiverosetta does not require a familiarity with the structure and organization of rosetta and provides easy access to its structural_modeling applications
