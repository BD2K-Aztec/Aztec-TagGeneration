structural_bioinformatics domire a web_server for identifying structural_domains and their neighbors in proteins the domire web_server implements a novel automatic protein structural_domain assignment procedure based on d substructures of the query_protein which are also found within structures of a non redundant protein database these common d substructures are transformed into a co occurrence matrix that offers a global view of the protein domain_organization three different algorithms are employed to define structural_domain boundaries from this co occurrence matrix for each query a list of structural neighbors and their alignments are provided domire by displaying the protein structural domain_organization can be a useful tool for defining protein common cores and for unravelling the evolutionary_relationship between different proteins availability http the modular nature of proteins is well established first described at the level of their structure based on their compactness character and folding properties their evolutionary role has been substantiated by comparing amino_acid following the pioneering works of doolittle databases such as prodom http prodom prabi fr prodom current html home php or pfam http pfam sanger ac uk provide domain definitions at the level of amino_acid databases such as cath http www cathdb info and scop http scop mrclmb cam ac uk scop index html define domain at the level of the d structures domains are exchangeable segments of amino_acids that retain their d structure and molecular_function domain identification is thus an important tool for a number of studies about protein d structures or evolution recently we applied the protein_structure comparison program vast and we found that the recurrence of small common d substructures typically four secondary_structures between the query_protein and proteins of a non redundant dataset were sufficient to define the boundaries of the domains the methodology described in the latter to whom correspondence should be addressed paper is now available as an online server named domire for domain identification from recurrence the server also provides for each query a list of structural neighbors with their alignments with a benchmark of chains using scop or and cath classifications as gold_standards smf and svd algorithms provided results similar to those of the puu server but less close to those of domain parser or pdp pcm performs better than smf and svd for chains having three or more domains for that reason we provide the results of the three algorithms on the web_site with their possibly different boundaries the criterion for selecting the structural neighbors of or more aligned residues is based on the fact that vast alignments involve essentially the secondary_structures and that on average secondarystructures amount to of the residues of a protein the criterion of at least of the target aligned with the query tends to select regions of the query that can be aligned with whole structures in the pdb some of them are homologues of the query or of its domains to be published in addition to offering an automatic partitioning of protein_structures into domains with performances comparable with the best existing programs domire provides the identification and alignments of structural neighbors this can be useful for identifying remote homologues it provides a tool to analyze the common d substructures in polypeptide_chains shedding light on their evolution
