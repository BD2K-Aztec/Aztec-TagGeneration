sequence_analysis self interaction of transmembrane_helices representing pre clusters from the human single span membrane_proteins motivation most integral_membrane form dimeric or oligo meric complexes oligomerization is frequently supported by the non covalent interaction of transmembrane_helices it is currently not clear how many high_affinity transmembrane_domains tmd exist in a proteome and how specific their interactions are with respect to preferred contacting faces and their underlying residue motifs results we first identify a threshold of sequence_similarity which demarcates the border between meaningful alignments of tmds and chance alignments clustering the human single span membrane proteome using this threshold groups of the tmds the homotypic interaction of the tmds representing the largest clusters was systematically investigated under standardized conditions the results reveal a broad distribution of relative affinities high relative_affinity frequently coincides with i the existence of a preferred helixhelix interface and ii sequence_specificity as indicated by reduced affinity after mutating conserved_residues most integral_membrane assemble to non covalent functional oligomers this oligomerization is frequently supported by interactions of their helical transmembrane_domains tmds on the one hand their association is favored by the constraints of the lipid_bilayer which concentrates and pre orients the proteins on the other hand tmdtmd interactions frequently depend on recurrent interfacial amino_acid for example the tmd helixhelix interface of glycophorin a gpa contains a critical gxxxg motif which also promotes close association of many other helices in some cases variations of gxxxg the g a sxxxg a s motifs are crucial as in erbb_receptors and integrins these motifs can cooperate with polar or aromatic_amino within the same tmd which makes them dependent on sequence_context self interaction of other tmds is driven by s t qxxw motifs aromatic_residues or by residues with carboxamide side_chains tmdtmd interactions have been studied most intensely with single span membrane_proteins that account for a substantial fraction of membrane_proteins that increases from in bacteria to in humans to date dozens of single span proteins are known to interact via their tmds and about one dozen of high_resolution structures have been published that reveal distinct helixhelix interfaces in structural detail reviewed in it is currently unclear which fraction of the predicted single span membrane_proteins self assemble via tmdtmd interactions further it is not known whether strongly interacting tmds generally exhibit distinct interfaces it is likely that some interacting helices exhibit multiple interfaces depending on the functional state of the protein alternative interfaces may interchange by rotation or by interaction of n_terminal versus c terminal parts in addition many tm helices exhibit unilateral residue conservation to which extent these interactions are based on conserved amino_acid such as g a sxxxg a s has also been debated here we approached these issues in a systematic way by identifying tmds that represent clusters of homologous_sequences and by experimentally characterizing their self interaction to this end we clustered the human single span membrane proteome based on pairwise_alignments of tmds using a meaningful sequence_similarity threshold derived in this study analyzing the self interaction of the tmds representing each major cluster revealed a broad distribution of relative affinities in a number of high_affinity tmds mutational_analyses confirmed the sequence_specificity of the self interaction although the majority of to whom correspondence should be addressed in the initial part of this study our goal was to identify paradigmatic tmds that would represent clusters of homologs and thus cover a significant part of the single span membrane proteome these representative tmds were subsequently investigated for self interaction the objective of this study was to identify tmds representing a significant fraction of the human single span membrane proteome and to systematically characterize their homotypic interactions our results have several implications first our comparative_analysis of homotypic affinity which was done at the same lipid_composition and protein density of the host membrane shows that the representative tmds of top clusters exhibit a broad range of relative affinities the interaction of most high_affinity tmds depends on preferential helixhelix interfaces and on conserved_residues in general therefore high relative_affinity existence of a preferred interface and mutation sensitivity characterize efficient and specific interaction on the other hand there are exceptions to this rule two high_affinity tmds c and c may have multiple yet sequence specific interfaces we cannot exclude however that terminal regions of these tmds unwind to allow re orientation of toxr domains into an orientation where they can activate_transcription in c c c c and c mutating various g a sxxxg a s motifs or other conserved_residues strongly_reduced affinity whereas no significant effect was seen in other cases c and c thus some tmdtmd interfaces appear to be rather robust which may be a property that has been optimized through evolution the mere presence of gxxxg or related motifs does not predict self interaction although homotypic tmdtmd interactions have been demonstrated previously for members of some high_affinity clusters e g for protocadherins c and integrin chains c and c a second outcome of this study is that it uncovers novel self interacting the relationship of relative_affinity orientation dependence maximal impact of point_mutations presence of conserved gxxxg motifs and functional homogeneity of the respective top clusters among most representative tmds strong self interaction az reference tmd is often accompanied by orientation dependence and mutation sensitivity functionally heterogeneous clusters are enriched in conserved gxxxg motifs not all representative tmds have been investigated to mutational_analysis tmds these include tmds of sialic_acid binding ig c armadillo repeat containing proteins c hla_class chains c and others supplementary the affinity of tmds is close to that of the structurally well characterized highaffinity gpa dimer these tmds represent a total of tmds homologous to them which equals of sequence_space as they are likely to represent a similar percentage of structure space they may be regarded as paradigmatic targets for future structure analysis in some cases self interaction may parallel functionally_relevant heterotypic interaction for example hla_class c and b c chains are known for heterotypic interaction via extramembraneous domains which could be supported by the tmds the tmds of integrin c and c and b c chains also support heterodimerization whereas the functional_relevance of their homotypic interactions is unclear the homotypic interactions of several tested tmds are rather inefficient although some of them may be functionally_important as in cadherins c integrin b chains c syntaxin c and synaptobrevins c it should be borne in mind that low_affinity detected under our standardized conditions does not exclude efficient tmd based self interaction of proteins that are present at high concentration in addition the lipid_composition of the relevant host membrane may affect affinity third pairwise tmd alignments within the top clusters suggest relationships between tmds that belong to proteins being apparently unrelated in function part of these alignments might result from random homology in other cases tmd based clustering of functionally unrelated proteins could reflect convergent_evolution of their tmds despite dissimilar soluble domains interestingly these tmds are enriched in gxxxg axxxg and sxxxg motifs relative to the tmds of functionally homogeneous clusters further gxxxg motifs are conserved in tmds of functionally heterogeneous clusters but only in the tmds of functionally homogeneous clusters this might indicate that tmds of functionally unrelated proteins tend to converge toward g a sxxxg a s based interaction_motifs the evolution of such short interaction_motifs requires fewer mutations than that of more complex helixhelix interfaces and they could therefore develop rather rapidly by convergent_evolution in addition to homotypic tmdtmd interaction the conservation of tmd sequences within the functionally heterogeneous clusters could reflect conserved heterotypic interaction interaction with lipids and or binding of co factors finally the homology threshold of may be useful when aligning membrane_proteins for homology_based structure modeling especially for proteins that mainly consist of tmds it must be borne in mind however that the threshold may be different for multi span proteins
