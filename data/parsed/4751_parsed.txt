trstalker an efficient heuristic for finding fuzzy tandem_repeats motivation genomes in higher eukaryotic_organisms contain a substantial amount of repeated_sequences tandem_repeats trs constitute a large class of repetitive_sequences that are originated via phenomena such as replication slippage and are characterized by close spatial contiguity they play_an in several molecular regulatory_mechanisms and also in several diseases e g in the group of trinucleotide_repeat disorders while for trs with a low or medium level of divergence the current methods are rather effective the problem of detecting trs with higher divergence fuzzy trs is still open the detection of fuzzy trs is propaedeutic to enriching our view of their role in regulatory_mechanisms and diseases fuzzy trs are also important as tools to shed light on the evolutionary_history of the genome where higher divergence correlates with more remote duplication_events results we have developed an algorithm christened trstalker with the aim of detecting efficiently trs that are hard to detect because of their inherent fuzziness due to high levels of base_substitutions insertions_and to attain this goal we developed heuristics to solve a steiner version of the problem for which the fuzziness is measured with respect to a motif string not necessarily present in the input string this problem is akin to the generalized median string that is known to be an np_hard experiments with both synthetic and biological_sequences demonstrate that our method performs better than current state of the art for fuzzy trs and that the fuzzy trs of the type we detect are indeed present in important biological_sequences availability trstalker will be integrated in the web_based trs discovery service treads atrepeats trs are multiple two or more duplications of substrings in the dna that occur contiguously and may involve some base mutations such as substitutions insertions_and trs of several forms satellites microsatellites minisatellites and others have been studied extensively because of their role in several biological_processes in fact trs are privileged targets in activities such as fingerprinting or tracing the evolution of populations several diseases disorders and addictive_behaviors are linked to specific tr loci the role of trs has been studied also within coding_regions o and in relation to gene_functions large_scale comparative_studies on trs of the human_genome are described inand data bases of repetitive_elements to whom correspondence should be addressed such as repbase and tandem_repeats database trdb are now available and the detection of repetitive_elements via library based similarity matching for example by using the tool repeatmasker is a popular practice however tools for ab_initio detection of repetitive_elements that are not based on prior_knowledge accumulated in data bases are still important in order to extend our comprehension of the role of trs in biological_mechanisms existing ab_initio tools are successful when the tr exhibits a moderate amount of divergence and when the tr is easily validated however there is an emerging need for new tools that are able to cope with higher levels of sequence_divergence and or tr computationally more difficult to validate for example study so_called fuzzy trs and their role in gene_expression the technique inworks well for the hamming metric only substitutions and no insertions_deletions allowed and for short repeat_units from to bp that are common in micro and mini satellite families some of the most successful ab_initio tools such as trf and atrhunter are based on a multistage filtering_approach see also in the first stage the input_sequence is analyzed to detect via statistical criteria likely position and length of candidate subsequences the final_stage is the validation one in which a more expensive test is applied to candidate substrings passing the first stages so to determine an output that matches the implicit definition of tr and the user_defined filtering parameters we have performed comparative experiments both with synthetic and with biological_sequences here we describe the experimentalpage i i i set up how the synthetic sequences are generated and the outcome of the comparison for biological data we briefly indicate the reason why that sequence has been selected and the new trs found by the application of trstalker trstalker is a novel efficient heuristic_algorithm for finding fuzzy trs in biological_sequences trstalker aims at improving the capability of tr detection for a class of fuzzy trs for which existing_methods do not perform well initial_testing on biological data show that fuzzy trs not previously_reported are present in biologically_relevant sequences in the case of the frataxin sequence the fuzzy tr reported is associated with the known variable copy_number breakpoint of frederichs ataxia future work will involve testing trstalker on relevant families of repetitive_elements such as centromeric satellites an extension of trstalker to handle amino_acid is under development
