metdraw automated visualization of genome_scale reconstructions and high_throughput data motivation metabolic reaction maps allow visualization of genome_scale models and high_throughput data in a format familiar to many biologists however creating a map of a large metabolic model is a difficult and time consuming process metdraw fully automates the map drawing process for metabolic_models containing hundreds to thousands of reactions metdraw can also overlay high_throughput omics_data directly on the generated maps availability_and web_interface and source_code are freely_available atthe number of genome_scale has increased_greatly in recent_years an accompanying expansion in available algorithms for analyzing these models in the context of high_throughput data has created the need for tools to visualize large models and datasets cytoscape and similar graph drawing software can visualize arbitrary biological_networks however the resulting node and edge graphs are visually distinct from the more familiar metabolic map layout where lines show the flow of reactants coming together before branching into products only a few genome_scale reconstructions include a manually_curated visualization however producing these maps is difficult and time consuming and the maps are rarely updated as the model is revised the kyoto_encyclopedia kegg and other metabolic pathway_databases provide visualizations of indexed reactions but these maps exclude reactions not in the database such as transport or speciesspecific reactions metabolic modeling software_packages such as the cobra toolbox and cellnetanalyzer can overlay flux and gene_expression data on reaction maps although both packages allow users to modify existing maps no software_package is capable of assembling a complete genome_scale map de_novo from a set of reactions
