computational_prediction of eukaryotic phosphorylation_sites motivation kinase mediated_phosphorylation is the central mechanism of post_translational to regulate cellular_responses and phenotypes signaling defects associated with protein_phosphorylation are linked to many diseases particularly cancer characterizing protein_kinases and their substrates enhances our ability to understand and treat such diseases and broadens our knowledge of signaling_networks in general while most or all protein_kinases have been identified in well studied eukaryotes the sites that they phosphorylate have been only partially elucidated experimental methods for identifying phosphorylation_sites are resource_intensive so the ability to computationally predict potential sites has considerable value results many computational_techniques for phosphorylation_site have been proposed most of which are available on the web these techniques differ in several ways including the machine_learning used the amount of sequence_information used whether or not structural_information is used in addition to sequence_information whether predictions are made for specific kinases or for kinases in general and sources of training and testing data this review summarizes categorizes and compares the available methods for phosphorylation_site and provides an overview of the challenges that are faced when designing predictors and how they have been addressed it should therefore be useful both for those wishing to choose a phosphorylation_site predictor for their particular biological application and for those attempting to improve upon established techniques in the future contact phosphorylation is the most widespread post_translational in eukaryotes and plays_a in the regulation of virtually every cellular_behavior including dna_repair environmental stress_response regulation of transcription apoptosis cellular motility immune_response metabolism and cellular_differentiation historically novel phosphorylation_sites have been discovered primarily through the use of low_throughput biological techniques with the advent of site_directed for instance many labs started using this technique to characterize specific phosphorylation to whom correspondence should be addressed events e g unfortunately such techniques are time consuming tedious and expensive to perform more recently a high_throughput techniquemass spectrometry has greatly accelerated the identification of novel sites for example used mass_spectrometry to map the phosphoproteome of nine different mouse_tissues identifying nearly distinct phosphorylation_sites while useful this technique has important_limitations it cannot identify the protein_kinase s responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation of a given site many phosphorylation_sites are modified at substoichiometric levels with the unphosphorylated form sometimes preventing detection of the phosphorylated form many interesting proteins are present at very low levels making them difficult to detect through mass_spectrometry breaking open cells can place kinases together with substrates they would not normally encounter potentially resulting in the detection of phosphorylation_events that would not occur in vivo technical_challenges exist that sometimes make pinpointing exact phosphorylation_sites difficult and perhaps most importantly mass_spectrometry requires very expensive instruments and specialized expertise that are not available in typical laboratories given the limitations associated with both low_throughput and high_throughput biological techniques for identifying novel phosphorylation_sites computational_approaches have become increasingly popular such techniques require a protein_sequence as input and produce some numerical measure of the likelihood that each serine threonine or tyrosine s t y residue in that sequence is a phosphorylation_site for example found that the mutation r p in the protein encoded by the ikbkap gene causes familial dysautonomia with the hypothesized mechanism being disruption of the phosphorylation of t a site predicted to be phosphorylated by netphos the first phosphorylation_site prediction_tool prediction programs are often used to narrow down the list of possible phosphorylation_sites in a protein of interest with the predictions subsequently verified using biological_experiments for instance used a combination of several predictors to identify seven putative sites phosphorylated by protein_kinase in the transient_receptor trpv ion_channel when three of these sites were separately mutated to alanine the resultant proteins exhibited markedly_reduced activation in response to protein_kinase compared with wild_type trpv to the authors knowledge four review_articles have previously been published that included significant discussion of computational phosphorylation_site provided a brief review of this field along with a detailed discussion of the structural bases of protein_kinase specificity hjerrild andreviewed both computational and biological aspects of phosphoproteomics while miller and blom briefly_summarized some of the literature on phosphorylation_site and provided a protocol for the use of their netphos family of tools most recently reviewed phosphorylation_site databases prediction_tools and miscellaneous software associated with phosphorylation_sites and also compared the performance of a subset of available predictors compared with the above reviews here we concentrate more specifically on the methodologies employed by the various prediction_tools taking a comparative_approach to examining the issues and challenges associated with computational phosphorylation_site section of this review provides a brief overview of the available methods while section compares and discusses the tools with respect to different aspects of their methodologies section comments on some of the challenges that remain in the field and section gives some concluding_remarks there has already been a great_deal of success in applying different methodologies to the problem of phosphorylation_site addressing the challenges outlined above as well as those described by will require much coordination and effort but would constitute significant steps forward for the field
