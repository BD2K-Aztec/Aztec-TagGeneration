bioimage_informatics cellmissy a tool for management storage and analysis of cell_migration data produced in wound_healing like assays automated image_processing has allowed cell_migration research to evolve to a high_throughput research field as a consequence there is now an unmet need for data management in this domain the absence of a generic management system for the quantitative data generated in cell_migration assays results in each dataset being treated in isolation making data comparison across experiments difficult moreover by integrating quality_control and analysis capabilities into such a data management system the common practice of having to manually transfer data across different downstream_analysis tools will be markedly sped up and made more robust in addition access to a data management solution creates gateways for data standardization meta_analysis and structured public data dissemination we here present cellmissy a cross_platform data management system for cell_migration data with a focus on wound_healing data cellmissy simplifies and automates data management storage and analysis from the initial experimental_setup to data exploration availability_and cellmissy is a cross_platform open_source developed in java source_code and cross_platform binaries are freely_available under the apache open_source atdynamic cell_motility processes are essential for morphogenesis immune_responses wound_healing and cancer_metastasis investigation of the mechanisms and modes of cell_migration is therefore important for fundamental scientific insight and for translational_research as molecules involved in deregulated cell_migration are attractive targets_for as a result the field has developed methods for the systematic high_throughput analysis of cell_migration with wound_healing like assays currently most amenable to multiple condition comparison or high_throughput in these assays a cell_layer is allowed to move into a cell_free region and the decrease in time of this area reflects cell_migration velocity the cell_free zone can be created by scratching a confluent cell_layer typical wound_healing assay or by using non damaging barriers during cell_seeding cell exclusion zone assay advanced microscopes then allow automatic acquisition of images of the migrating cells and specialized image processing_tools are used to quantify cell_migration features from these images specific solutions for tackling the problems in large_scale image management and storage have additionally been reported however a major current challenge in the cell_migration field lies in the development of suitable software for the annotation management and sharing of the quantification data obtained from such imaging based experiments although software_tools are available to help with several of the steps in this workflow several key functions currently remain unmet see we here present cellmissy a cross_platform system for the annotation storage analysis and dissemination of quantitative cell_migration data it aids the user with experimental set up and annotation generic data import export downstream from image_processing and subsequent data storage inspection and analysis it thus provides support for the entire experimental workflow when coupled to an image_analysis algorithm of choice cellmissy is intended to facilitate local storage and analysis of acquired data but it also provides the basic infrastructure for improved annotation standardization and dissemination in the migration field ultimately enabling re analyses and meta_analyses to take place the benefit of the latter has already been proven in other fields where data management and dissemination infrastructure are more mature the development of useroriented freely_available data storage and analysis systems for cell_migration data thus provides an important and timely next step for the field
