gene_expression rip_chip enrichment_analysis motivation rip_chip is a high_throughput method to identify mrnas that are targeted by rna_binding the protein of interest is immunoprecipitated and the identity and relative amount of mrna associated with it is measured on microarrays even if a variety of methods is available to analyse microarray_data e g to detect differentially_regulated the additional experimental steps in rip_chip require specialized methods here we focus on two aspects of rip_chip data first the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation step performed in the rip_chip protocol varies in between different experiments introducing bias not existing in standard microarray_experiments this requires an additional normalization step to compare different samples and even technical_replicates second in contrast to standard differential_gene experiments the distribution of measurements is not normal we exploit this fact to define a set of biologically relevant_genes in a statistically meaningful way results here we propose two methods to analyse rip_chip data we model the measurement distribution as a gaussian mixture distribution which allows us to compute false_discovery fdrs for any cutoff thus cutoffs can be chosen for any desired fdr furthermore we use principal_component to determine the normalization factors necessary to remove immunoprecipitation bias both methods are evaluated on a large rip_chip dataset measuring targets of ago the major component of the microrna guided rna_induced risc using published hits_clip experiments performed with the same cell_line as used for rip_chip we show that the mixture modelling approach is a necessary step to remove background which computed fdrs are valid and that the additional normalization is a necessary step to make experiments comparable gene_expression is a highly complex process that is controlled on multiple levels by various proteins and rnas various experimental_protocols have been established to measure expression levels of mrnas or proteins targets of transcription_factors or post transcriptional_regulators and many other parameters of gene_expression in a genome_wide each step of such a high_throughput experiment may introduce systematic errors bias or random variation noise into the generated data and specialized methods are necessary to deal with particular kind of bias and noise and to answer specific_questions using highthroughput data the most widely used high_throughput experiments are based on microarrays or next_generation ngs and are designed to measure the amount of all mrnas in one or multiple conditions based on the raw intensities from a microarray experiment or the sequencing_reads from an ngs experiment several analytical steps are taken including normalization summarization and statistical_evaluation there is a vast amount of literature describing various methods fulfilling these steps to identify differentially_regulated chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by microarray_analysis or ngs chip_chip chip_seq can determine the targets of dna_binding and has successfully been applied to a wide_range of transcription_factors and cell_types in addition to the above_mentioned analysis methods necessary for microarray and ngs_data it has been recognized that additional methods are necessary to successfully determine target_sites on the genome and thus a variety of methods is described in the literature in recent_years it has become apparent that transcriptional_regulation is only one part of the machinery carrying out gene_regulation rna_binding rbps and rna_binding ribonucleoproteins rnps play_important and are responsible for splicing rna_editing regulation of translation and rna degradation these processes are highly_regulated by sequencespecific binding of rbps or rnps to the mrna micrornas are small nt_long rna_molecules which have emerged in recent_years as important post transcriptional_regulators involved in all known multicellular_organisms they play_important in development tumorigenesis and viral_infection they act by guiding the rna_induced risc to mrnas by binding to their untranslated_region utr in a sequence specific_manner which leads to inhibition of translation or rna degradation a powerful experimental high_throughput technique to detect targets of rbps or ribonucleoproteins such as risc is based on immunoprecipitation ip of the rbp or rnp with associated to whom correspondence should be addressed mrnas followed by microarray or ngs measurement rip_chip rip_seq targets of the rbp rnp are enriched in the rip experiment in comparison with a control measurement using an unspecific antibody or total_rna novel techniques including hits_clip iclip and par_clip also include cross_linking of the protein to the mrna followed by digestion of the unprotected mrna to determine the precise location of the target_site the main question in a rip_chip experiment is to determine the set of target_genes of the immunoprecipitated protein a basic answer is a sorted list of enrichment values that can be computed for each gene by dividing the intensity value in the ip fraction microarray by the intensity in the control microarray this is very similar to standard differential_gene de experiments here differentially_regulated can be determined by a sorted list of fold changes computed for each gene by dividing the intensity in condition a by the intensity in condition b consequently rip_chip data are often analysed using standard methods borrowed from the de setup such as fold changes t statistics or moderated t statistics however as indicated above additional experimental steps may introduce additional bias in contrast to log_fold distributions of de experiments log enrichment distributions of rip_chip experiments are not normal but typically have heavier right tails see also this is an indication that rip_chip is able to separate true targets from the background very efficiently here we exploit these skewed distributions to estimate the biological_significance of genes this is different from the statistical_significance usually computed for de experiments where p values are related to the reproducibility of the measurements and not to biological_relevance the above_mentioned question about the set of target_genes in a rip_chip experiment only considers a single condition in contrast to a de experiment however especially for risc ip experiments an additional question is to determine differential microrna targets between two or several conditions for instance if these conditions are control and transfected microrna differential targets would be targets of the transfected microrna and if there are uninfected and virusinfected cells differential targets would include targets of viral micrornas the answer to this question can be given by genes that are more enriched in condition a than in condition b either by choosing two cut_offs on the corresponding enrichment values i e at least x fold enriched in a and at most y fold enriched in b by computing differential enrichment values as the ratio of the two enrichment values or by a mixture of both approaches all answers to this question necessarily have to compare enrichment values i e ratios of intensities of the conditions however ip efficiencies may vary between independent experiments and it is important to account for this bias when comparing enrichment values obviously the same problem exists for the summarization of replicate measurements see figs and here we develop a suite of methods to properly analyse rip_chip datasets which take care of the unique properties of such data introduced by the ip first we use a gaussian_mixture approach to find statistically meaningful cut_offs for enrichment values we show that this approach can be used to filter unexpressed genes that it allows to compute false_discovery fdrs for sets of biological significant genes and that it is in fact a necessary step to make experiments comparable with each other we also address the problem of differing ip efficiencies by introducing a principal_component pca based method to normalize enrichment distributions in a data dependent_manner we use publicly_available hits_clip data measured for the same cell_lines as standard of truth for evaluation and show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements for the analysis of rip_chip data a similar approach to our gaussian mixture modelling gmm has already been used in however gmm was applied to summarized enrichment values and log odds_ratios lod_scores were computed as the ratio of the two scaled mixture components lod_scores were then used in two different ways first they were directly subjected to gene_set where they have no advantage over directly using enrichment values as the weighted kolmogorovsmirnov statistic used for gene_set is non parametric and only sensitive to the ranking of the genes second the authors used a cut_off of lod to define a set of targets however choosing a cut_off based on the lod is still arbitrary and not statistically meaningful in contrast to our fdrs if we used the lod to define a cut_off we would get fdrs ranging from to in our experimental dataset we could show that our refined mixture modelling approach has several advantages first it allows us to filter unexpressed genes when comparing two conditions e g virus_infected expressing viral micrornas versus non infected_cells expression of a gene targeted by cellular micrornas below the detection_limit of the microarray in one but not the other cell_line would result in the misinterpretation of this to be a target of the viral micrornas second for experiments with poor ip efficiency we observed extremely poor distance and asymmetry scores over the whole intensity range and could remove these bad replicates from further analyses third it helps to compare experiments with each other see and finally we can compute valid fdrs furthermore the comparison of the rip_chip fdrs to hits_clip data revealed important properties of both the rip_chip and hits_clip techniques both are designed to identify microrna targets and naturally they agree significantly p kolmogorovsmirnov test a fact that is also reflected in the negative slope of the linear fit to the fdr against sites per gene plot however the agreement is not perfect and we estimate an average number of hits_clip target_sites per rip_chip target_gene and of per rip_chip non target_gene even if hits_clip target_sites may be erroneous and the clip techniques may implicate additional bias we expect that not all of the sites per background gene are true errors such inconsistencies may be due to differing experimental steps e g different antibodies used for ip or due to differences the jijoye cell_cultures have accumulated in the two laboratories since the cell_line has been established also as hits_clip does not control for target mrna_abundance it may find several weak sites on highly_expressed that are biologically irrelevant i e not contributing significantly to regulation of its expression such a gene should not be enriched in a rip_chip experiment and could explain many cases of hits_clip sites on background genes thus even if clip techniques have several advantages e g they are able to identify target_sites instead of target_genes rip_chip is still a useful complementary method the second novel method introduced in this article is to use principal_components to normalize for different ip efficiencies evaluation using hits_clip data or the differential_expression of target_genes shows that the normalization improves results significantly the normalization proposed can only account for linear bias between experiments this very lenient normalization appears to be sufficient as affine offsets are already removed by the mixture_model approach and non linear effects are not recognizable in a visual_inspection our proposed methods do not include a way to compute statistical_significance e g like a t test for standard de experiment however this can be accomplished in a straight_forward way as all available tests could directly be used after our linear normalization has been applied to a dataset differing ip efficiencies require normalization before computing differential targets the second principal component in a is able to discover the experimental structure its loadings can be used as weights to compute a differential enrichment value that is normalized for different ip efficiencies in contrast to the standard way of subtracting the mean log enrichment in dg egfp from the mean log enrichment in jijoye corresponding to weights indicated in red the difference distribution of the normalized differential enrichment values and the un normalized ones is shown in b differential targets are expected to be downregulated and indeed the difference is significantly_greater than background for downregulated genes as illustrated in c this effect is more pronounced the higher the downregulation is f erhard et_al in this article we presented methods we developed to analyse rip_chip data in comparison with standard de experiments the additional ip step introduces special requirements for the data analyis first we use gmm to determine biologically_significant target_genes second we use a linear normalization technique based on pca to remove bias introduced by the ip the evaluation of both methods using independent data showed a significant_improvement in comparison with standard_approaches the background of not enriched genes can be removed valid fdrs can be calculated and the comparability of both replicates and differential experiments is improved
