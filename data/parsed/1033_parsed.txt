cod inferring immune_cell quantities related to disease_states motivation the immune system comprises a complex network of genes cells and tissues coordinated through signaling_pathways and cellcell communications however the orchestrated role of the multiple immunological components in disease is still poorly_understood classifications based on gene_expression data have revealed immune_related signaling_pathways in various diseases but how such pathways describe the immune cellular_physiology remains_largely results we identify alterations in cell quantities discriminating between disease_states using cell_type of disease cod a classification based_approach that relies on computational immune_cell decomposition in gene_expression cod attains significantly_higher accuracy than alternative state of the art methods our approach is shown to recapitulate and extend previous knowledge_acquired with experimental cell quantification technologies conclusions the results suggest that cod can reveal disease_relevant cell_types in an unbiased manner potentially heralding improved diagnostics and treatment immune_cell heterogeneity is central to systems level functions in health and disease it has therefore been the focus of a substantial research_effort to identify immune_cell that are relevant to a disease of interest the main approach has been to quantify each individual immune cell_type using cell measurement tools such as immunohistochemical_staining or facs_analysis and then utilize the resulting measurements to identify particular cell_types that are relevant to patient prognosis e g however as hundreds of immune_cell work in coordination manual measurement of relatively small numbers of subsets poses_significant obstacles to successful identification of disease_relevant immune_cells one such impediment attributable to the strict requirement for the use of antibodies of high_quality is the strong bias toward immune_cell that are well studied another major_hurdle has been the large_amounts of material required for quantification as well as the high_costs and time consuming nature of the process as a result most studies have been focused on preselected subpopulations of cells and have rarely_investigated a broad range of immune_cell one possible solution to these obstacles would be to combine disease classification based on transcription profiles with predefined groups of gene markers that relate to specific immune_cell inferring the activity of relevant gene groups as a clue to disease classification is already an area of active research but it has not to our knowledge been applied in the case of immune_cell typically these methods take as their starting_point a list of signaling_pathway related gene groups from for example the molecular_signatures the first phase is to v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com determine the activity of each gene group in the transcription profiles of the various samples and the second phase is to classify the samples based on the inferred activity levels of the pathways a key_question however is whether these group activity based_methods can be used to automatically infer the quantities of specific immunecell subpopulations that are relevant to a disease_state to understand the challenges involved in this task it is first necessary to realize that most genes are assigned a quantitative level in every cell_type this is fundamentally unlike the case of molecular_pathways in which the genes either participate in the pathway or do not several computational_approaches have been developed for identifying quantitative changes in particular immune_cell within a complex tissue under study e g these methods integrate transcriptional_profiling of a given complex tissue with prior genomic knowledge about immune_cells into a mathematical framework enabling a robust decomposition of tissues into immune_cell quantities for example the dcq algorithm has been shown to identify over immune cell_subpopulations simultaneously opening the way to a global view of immune physiology through computational_modeling therefore computational immune_cell decomposition methods can be used to aid identification of immunecell types related to specific diseases here we developed cell_type of disease cod a methodology for identifying all disease_relevant immune_cell cod was designed to reveal the entire set of relevant cell_types including redundant cell_types that are completely obscured by other cell_types thus providing a comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms to that end cod utilizes computational immune_cell decomposition on gene_expression data to predict cell_type quantities and then exploits the cell quantities as features in a random_forest classification_scheme finally permutation_tests are utilized to select the entire set of relevant_features rather than a minimal optimal set of non redundant features our synthetic data analysis showed that cod achieves better accuracy in predicting immune_cell of relevance for disease classification than existing feature_selection and activity based classification methods we tested our approach by applying it in the case of whole_body ionizing_radiation as well as in both the primary_tumor and distal organs in mouse_models of breast_cancer the results indicated the ability of cod to successfully recapitulate many of the known immune_cell changes in these systems and showed that the predictions can provide novel leads even when the immune_cell composition has already been measured_experimentally in this article we present cod a novel framework for the identification of immune_cell whose quantities discriminate between different types of disease based on a computation decomposition algorithm cod generates cell_type based features and exploits the random_forest classification_method to extract the cell_types that discriminate between disease_states a key_advantage of cod is its ability unlike existing group activity based_approaches to integrate prior quantitative information about each of the relevant immune_cell in simulations cod shows high_accuracy outperforming existing state of the art group activity based classification methods and b as well as all relevant feature_selection predicting disease_relevant cell_subsets more accurately this relatively high_accuracy can be improved even further by focusing only on those cases in which the generalization error is low and supplementary thus although all classification methods ours as well as others are under constrained and prone to overfitting cell_types and individuals in each sample class the cod algorithm seems more accurate in the tumor_bearing dataset for example although our analysis was restricted to individuals a large number of candidates were identified as relevant cell_types given larger datasets the cod algorithm can potentially capture additional relevant cell_types our results in mice point to the utility of the cod pipeline for real_data analysis first whereas standard gene level analyses cannot attain interpretable immunophysiological results cod successfully identifies many of the previously_reported alterations in cell_types albeit with a higher generalization error supplementaryand supplementary second the identification of all relevant_features including redundant features cod stage is crucial for identifying the entire set of disease related cell_types in agreement many of the identified cell_types are tightly correlated with each other while others may be quite distinct supplementary this study presents two alternative all relevant methods cod stageplots y axis log scaled of known factors typically secreted from a pre metastatic niche in both human and mouse x axis for all samples isolated from tumor_bearing gray and healthy control white_mice observed significant alterations in
