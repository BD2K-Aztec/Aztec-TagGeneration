genome_analysis use of autocorrelation scanning in dna_copy analysis motivation data_quality is a critical issue in the analyses of dna_copy obtained from microarrays it is commonly assumed that copy_number data can be modeled as piece wise constant and the measurement errors of different probes are independent however these assumptions do not always hold in practice in some published datasets we find that measurement errors are highly_correlated between probes that interrogate nearby genomic_loci and the piecewise_constant model does not fit the data well the correlated errors cause problems in downstream_analysis leading to a large number of dna_segments falsely identified as having copy_number gains_and method we developed a simple tool called autocorrelation scanning profile to assess the dependence of measurement_error between neighboring probes results autocorrelation scanning profile can be used to check data_quality and refine the analysis of dna_copy data which we demonstrate in some typical datasets dna copy_number cna is one of the hallmarks of cancer and has been linked to various complex genetic_diseases technological_advances in microarrays and next_generation have made it possible to generate large_amounts of cna data various methods developed for cna data analysis have been compared in published reviews these methods differ in their focus including preprocessing and normalization segmentation joint analysis of multiple samples copy_number based on mapped sequence_reads integrated analysis with genotyping allelespecific copy_number and others however there are still some challenging issues regarding quality_assessment and biological_interpretation of cna data a common step of cna analysis is segmentation which transforms noisy measurements into genomic_segments of equal copy_number this step aims to reduce noise and data dimension significant_gains losses of the segments can be subsequently recognized the ends of the segments may correspond to dna_breakage points the underlying assumptions in segmentation are i the data can be modeled as piecewise_constant and ii the measurement errors of different probes are independent although in most cases methods such as circular_binary cbs yield reasonable_results we find that occasionally the piecewise_constant model appears to fit the data poorly and the independence_assumption is grossly violated the independence_assumption is critical because it forms the basis for separating true signals from noise correlated errors are expected to lead to incorrect identification of aberrant segments to address the issue we have developed a method called the autocorrelation scanning profile asp autocorrelation is the cross_correlation of a signal with itself which is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns in time series data if the time series data can be modeled as piecewise_constant and the noises in the data are independent at different time points asp has the following appealing properties i the autocorrelation within each segment of a constant mean is expected to be ii at the junction of an abrupt change_point however the autocorrelation rises significantly above we observe different patterns when the asp method is applied to published datasets our results show that asp can be used to check for cna data_quality and refine the analysis to evaluate the use of the asp method we compute the asps using previously_published dna_copy data shows the typical_patterns we observe the most common pattern is shown in after denoising the cnp the green curve has the shape of step functions with well defined abrupt change_points the asp profile bottom peaks around the abrupt change_points of cnp but mostly fluctuates near in other loci and rarely exceeds the significance line the horizontal black line it appears that the piecewise_constant model fits the cnp data well and there is little correlation between the measurements of different probes i e the probes can be regarded as independent in this case however the pattern shown inis not universal as other patterns have also been observed for example in the asp appears to be much higher exceeding the significance line the horizontal black line around throughout the genome we also find samples lacking clearly defined change_points the cnp appears to have gradual changes in some areas such as in chromosome top another distinct_pattern is shown in in which the asp reaches high levels in a localized region in the genome chromosome the cnp also fluctuates a lot in the same region we suspect the pattern seen inmay indicate a quality problem with the dna_sample we obtained supporting evidence of this view from comparing formalin_fixed paraffinembedded ffpe_samples with fresh_frozen samples obtained from the same type of cancer and using the same microarray_platform formalin fixation is known to cause damages in dna and extraction of dna from ffpe_samples is more prone to biases as expected we find that the ffpe_samples appear to have elevated asps more often than the fresh_frozen samples the average of the median asp of each ffpe sample is whereas the median asp of the fresh_frozen samples is only the difference between the two groups of samples is statistically_significant p e student_t to better understand the consequences of elevated asps we performed computer simulations to create artificial cnps with different levels of autocorrelation we first generated cnps following a standard normal distribution which corresponds to a sample with no copy_number change and asp approximately_equal to we then introduced correlation between neighboring probes by coupling the signals between neighboring probes with a tunable parameter see details in methods shows how the cbs segmentation_results depend on median asps that are computed from the simulated cnps the results show that when the median asp is the number of segments remains at and the fp rate is close to the number of segments and the fp rate rise rapidly when the median asp is this result suggests that there is a clear association between the elevated asp and the number of segments a similar relationship has been found in real_data shows correlation between the median asp and number of segments in a dataset of breast_cancer samples spearmans rank correlation_coefficient besides correlated measurement errors between adjacent probes segmental copy_number changes can affect asp to assess the effects of the former factor alone we used a dataset of samples from a population without cancer and with few copy_number changes we used that dataset as a standard reference_set for calibrating the data on the platform to further reduce the effects of the copy_number changes we removed the segments that had significant gains_and because the nominal copy_number is nearly throughout the genome the correlations observed between neighboring probes thus should measure the extent to which the probes depend on each other we calculated the copy_number correlation between neighboring probes shows the distribution of the correlations red line the distribution is centered mean but the range is much wider than that expected from randomly permuted data the sd of the red line is whereas the sd of the black line this means that we cannot assume that the probes are independent from each other even though the correlation between neighboring probes is near on average in this study we have demonstrated the use of asp in dna_copy analysis the issue of interdependence of probes has been largely ignored in the existing_methods we argue this is an important issue and show that there are elevated asps that can be frequently observed in published datasets elevated asps mean that one cannot assume that the microarray probes measure the copy_number data independently the elevated asps inflate the fps in the identification of aberrant segments because they increase the probability of multiple probes having common biases from the results of our computer simulations we found that fps in segmentation rise rapidly when the median case b from sample gsm in gse case c from sample gsm geo accession_number is gse and case d is from gsm geo accession_number is gse reported a dramatic_increase in the absolute number of genetic_alterations in all ffpe tissues relative to their matched fresh_frozen counterparts suggesting that ffpe_samples are more prone to produce spurious_results of copy_number changes these results are similar to our current study which showed that ffpe_samples tend to have higher median asps than fresh_frozen samples our asp method provides a much needed tool for quality_control existing_tools such as the nanodrop spectrophotometer aim to ensure that dna samples to be hybridized onto the arrays are in sufficient quantity and have the appropriate length there are also metrics commonly used to assess data_quality such as the derivative log_ratio spread dlrs and genotyping call rate on snp_arrays the dlrs estimates the log_ratio noise by calculating the spread of log_ratio differences between consecutive probes along all chromosomes the genotyping call rate of a sample is the fraction of probes that have passed the detection filter the dlrs and genotype call rate are correlated both reflecting measurement noises on individual probes asp is conceptually different as it measures the correlation of noises between neighboring probes hence we recommend the use of asp in addition to existing quality_measures it is interesting to note that the asps show several distinct patterns when only a localized region has a high asp the phenomenon is similar to that reported as chromothripsis or firestorm the cnp pattern seen incontains gradual changes which poorly fit the piecewise_constant model the piecewise_constant model is expected to hold under the condition that there is only one tumor clone in the tissue and the number of aberrant segments is less than the number of probe sites the latter condition usually holds except in the case of chromothripsis when there is only one tumor clone the denoised copy_number should take integer values after adjusting the scale the gradual changes that fall between the level of single_copy gain or loss such as in cannot result from a single tumor clone andtherefore must come from the contribution of multiple_clones tumor_tissues containing multiple_clones are commonly observed which is recognized as another hallmark of cancer taken together our results show that asp provides a useful tool in dna_copy analysis
