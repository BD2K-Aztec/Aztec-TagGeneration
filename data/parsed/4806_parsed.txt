uproc tools for ultra_fast protein domain classification motivation with rapidly increasing volumes of biological sequence_data the functional analysis of new sequences in terms of similarities to known protein_families challenges classical bioinformatics results the ultrafast protein classification uproc toolbox implements a novel algorithm mosaic matching for large_scale sequence_analysis uproc is by three orders_of than profile based_methods and in a metagenome simulation_study achieved up to higher sensitivity on unassembled bp reads availability_and uproc is available as an open_source at https github com gobics uproc precompiled databases pfam are linked on the uproc homepage http uproc gobics de next_generation ngs has stimulated the development of many new sequence_analysis methods in particular metagenomic_studies of microbial and viral assemblages require innovative algorithms to analyse the vast amount of anonymous and fragmented sequence_data that is obtained from environmental or clinical samples in a typical bioinformatics pipeline the assignment of genomic or metagenomic_sequences to known protein_families is an essential step towards a characterization of the functional repertoire of a particular organism or community the pfam_database of protein_families in combination with the hmmer profile_hidden is widely used for functional_annotation of genomic and metagenomic_sequences before the advent of hmmer protein domain detection on large sequence collections had been computationally_expensive and several prefiltering methods were suggested to speed up the analysis although such a prefilter approach has been included in hmmer the processing of large metagenomic_sequence files generated by ngs_technologies can still be demanding in metagenomics and other ngs applications not only the amount of sequence but also the limited length of sequencing_reads can be challenging for a functional analysis now that illumina sequencing_platforms are increasingly used in metagenomics we are facing huge collections of short_reads often not longer than bp here the question arises what quality of the functional assignments can be expected for sequences that merely cover of a typical microbial gene in a recent study on transcriptomic_data showed that profile_hidden substantially lose sensitivity on short_reads we have developed a toolbox for ultrafast protein classification uproc that is available in terms of an open_source although uproc can in principle be applied to any protein_sequence classification_problem the toolbox is predestined for functional analysis of metagenomes first of all the classification speed allows researchers to analyse large metagenomic_datasets on a desktop computer without the requirement of large computer clusters or special purpose hardware in addition it also provides the necessary functionality to select open_reading orfs from dna_sequences besides the computational speed our results on simulated v c the author published_by to evaluate the classification_performance of uproc we implemented a simulation of metagenomic short_read following the approach ofwho sampled short fragments from longer_sequences to study the read_length dependency of similarity based protein_family assignments we utilized two different types of sequences from which we extracted the simulated short_reads in close correspondence to the approach of we also used longer metagenomic sanger reads which were subject to gene prediction and pfam analysis to obtain a valid labelling of the subsequently extracted fragments in addition we also utilized a collection of microbial_genomes where we used the available gene_annotation to obtain the labelling this gives rise to two kinds of test datasets with different characteristics the test data from metagenomic_reads contains sequencing_errors and the detection of coding_regions has to cope with incomplete genes this provides a realistic read simulation but some errors in the labelling are highly probable on the other hand the test data from microbial_genomes can be expected to be almost free of sequencing_errors and the full_length gene_annotation should provide a more reliable labelling however the microbial_genomes can also be expected totools for ultra_fast protein domain classificationbe closer to the known sequences that have been used to create the pfam_database for that reason we used an older version of the pfam_database to slightly increase the sequence novelty for the pfam analysis on the test data nevertheless the genome based test data in principle provides an easier trial while the metagenomebased data is more challenging the results on simulated short_reads encourage the use of uproc for large_scale metagenome analysis for bp reads the usual speedaccuracy trade_off seems to be obsolete since uproc is both faster and more sensitive the computationally more expensive profile methods that provide state of the art classification_performance on full_length protein_sequences might not be optimal for this kind of short_read this finding agrees well with a recent study on transcriptomic_data where hmmer and other profile based_methods showed inherent difficulties in classifying protein_domains on short_reads from weakly conserved_regions in our case this is even more remarkable because the hmmer program was also used for preparing all test examples on the basis of its predictions on full_length sequences the sensitivity rates clearly show that on bp short_reads hmmer does not recognize a considerable fraction of the protein_domains that have been predicted in longer_sequences before for increasingly longer_reads hmmer successively outperforms uproc in terms of sensitivity while in terms of speed it remains times slower it is important to note that uproc requires a large protein database that well represents the sequence_variation within different families in particular smaller databases that are based on full_length protein_sequences might require a homology extension before being used with uproc this shows an important advantage of profile based_methods that can even be used to represent tiny families with just a few sequences furthermore it can also be expected that profile methods can better cope with the increasing overlap between families in full_length databases in turn uproc is not restricted to protein_families that are well representable by sensitivity tpr of protein domain detection on simulated short_reads with best value in bold face multiple_alignments at the uproc homepage we offer a precompiled database for a recent version of the kegg orthologs which are widely used for metabolic_profiling in metagenomics and metatranscriptomics beyond functional analysis uproc can also be used for fast taxonomic_profiling of metagenomes forwarding the protein domain hit counts to the taxy pro mixture_model toolbox
