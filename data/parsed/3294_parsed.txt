gene_expression novel statistical_framework to_identify allowing transcriptomic background differences motivation tests of differentially_expressed degs from microarray_experiments are based on the null_hypothesis that genes that are irrelevant to the phenotype stimulus are expressed equally in the target and control samples however this strict hypothesis is not always true as there can be several transcriptomic background differences between target and control samples including different cell tissue_types different cell_cycle and different biological donors these differences lead to increased false_positives which have little biological medical significance result in this article we propose a statistical_framework to identify degs between target and control samples from expression microarray_data allowing transcriptomic background differences between these samples by introducing a modified null_hypothesis that the gene_expression background difference is normally distributed we use an iterative procedure to perform robust estimation of the null_hypothesis and identify degs as outliers we evaluated our method using our own triplicate microarray experiment followed by validations with reverse_transcription rtpcr and on the microarray quality_control dataset the evaluations suggest that our technique i results in less false_positive as measured by the degree of agreement with rtpcr of the same samples ii can be applied to different microarray_platforms and results in better reproducibility as measured by the degree of deg identification concordance both intra_and platforms and iii can be applied efficiently with only a few microarray replicates based on these evaluations we propose that this method not only identifies more reliable and biologically medically significant deg but also reduces the power cost tradeoff problem in the microarray field availability source_code freely_available for download atmicroarray technology is widely used for gene_expression analysis of biological_samples that undergo different treatments or represent different phenotypic groups the treated sample or the group of interest is called the target and the other sample group is called the control one of the most important usages of such an experimental_design is to identify genes that are differentially_expressed between target and control this is usually achieved by statistical_tests using biological_replicates replicates using different biological cases and technical_replicates replicates of a single case on multiple arrays usually t test or analysis_of on the equality of mean microarray_gene measurement between the target group and the control_group are employed to identify differentially_expressed gene deg fold_change fc method is also used as a simple and empirical alternative more sophisticated tests such as shrinkage methods are available and possess greater_power all of these methods are based on the null_hypothesis that genes that are irrelevant to the phenotype stimulus are expressed equally in the target and control samples however this strict hypothesis is not always true as there can be several transcriptomic background differences between target and control including different cell tissue_types different cell_cycle and different biological donors these differences lead to increased false_positives which have no biological medical significance when traditional statistical_tests are employed for example when the sample_size is large the testing of gene_expression differences between brain tissue_samples and blood_samples will identify most genes as deg following the traditional framework investigators will also exhaust their financial_resources to maximize the sample_size in order to gain greater_power for the identification of smaller gene_expression differences however the small differences they seek may be simply explained by the aforementioned transcriptomic background differences which are irrelevant to the phenotype or stimulus of interest to overcome the problems that can be encountered when using the traditional statistical_testing framework we propose a new approach to identify deg in the presence of different transcriptomic backgrounds we extend and broaden the traditional null_hypothesis of no difference to normal distributed differences and identifypage in this article we present a statistical_framework to identify degs from microarray_experiments in the presence of transcriptomic background differences between target and control samples we evaluate its performance by our own triplicate microarray experiment followed by rtpcr validation and a comparison with the maqc dataset on multiple microarray_platforms our method can reduce both false_positive in biological medical sense results and can be applied effectively with fewer replicates compared with other methods the technique is also portable across different microarray_platforms its reproducibility is not only higher than the traditional t test but is also robust since it is not greatly affected by the significance cutoff threshold this method brings new insight to the significance of degs and may provide_supporting for those degs that would be accepted by more biomedical investigators the definition of statistical_significance depends on how the null_hypothesis is defined currently most methods define the null_hypotheses as d g and develop a corresponding testing framework this null_hypothesis however is too idealistic and sensitive if its biological meaning is seriously considered in reality cells or biological_tissues can never be exactly the same especially after undergoing different treatments i suppose we have highly matched cells lines and the cell expression network changed as a whole after the treatment we can image that expression_level goes up and down across different genes but only those leading genes indicated by obvious response to the treatment is of our interest while the rest result from background expression differences ii many experimental_designs are not so perfect that they compare different cells at different time points different tissues and different status e g cancer and nearby tissue another example is the benchmark_datasets created by maqc consortium compares human universal rna against human_brain rna slight variations in d g around zero should be allowed otherwise the null_hypothesis will be always rejected when the sample_size is large enough which would result in many meaningless positive findings therefore in this article the null_hypothesis was loosened to become more realistic and robust as indicated by d g n the marginal distribution of the sample averaged target control difference was still normally distributed even with the addition of the unknown variance given that the number of genes in microarray experiment is usually large the overall variance can be estimated using the transcriptome wide_distribution of d g the robust estimators mad or qn were selected to estimate in the presence of deg pollution although mad is easy and quick to calculate it has a low gaussian efficiency on the other hand the qn calculation is computationally slow but has a high gaussian efficiency both mad and qn have the maximum breakdown point at which their maximum robustness is indicated our method assumes that the mean target control difference of the g th gene is distributed as d g n d g in order to ensure that this assumption can be approximately held the signal should be properly normalized and transformed in this article quantile normalization and the box cox power transformation were selected extensive comparison between these two methods and other methods was not performed since they work well enough on our dataset the rtpcr significance cutoff was set to a fold_change which is consistent with that used by the fold_change methods this cutoff is arbitrary but generally acceptable by biomedical investigators the high degree of concordance of our results with those obtained in the rtpcr analyses suggests that the degs identified by highthroughput microarray_experiments using our method can be trusted and applied to other situations with little risk our findings demonstrate that the reproducibility portability of our method is higher than that of t test this is because t test requires estimation of individual gene variance which is inaccurate and unstable in small_sample thus its reproducibility is limited on the contrary our method estimates one common variance contributed by both background variance and measuring variance across thousands of genes and thus is more stable and reproducible
