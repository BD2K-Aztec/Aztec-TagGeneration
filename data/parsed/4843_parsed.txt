genetics_and varld a program for quantifying variation in linkage_disequilibrium patterns between populations motivation linkage_disequilibrium ld differences between populations can potentially result in failure to replicate primary signals of trait association in independent genome_wide gwas however such inter population ld differences can be leveraged to narrow the search for common causal_variants responsible for the association_signals observed the ability to assess and quantify ld variations among populations is thus expected to contribute to both replication and fine_mapping stages of gwas availability the program varld is available for download fromthe aim of genome_wide gwas of common diseases and complex_traits is to find statistically_significant markers usually single_nucleotide snps which are associated with the phenotype of interest these snps are seldom the genetic_variants responsible for the phenotype but are markers in linkage_disequilibrium ld with the underlying causal_variants thus the findings from gwas serve as indicators for genomic_regions that are likely to possess the genetic_variants directly responsible for the functional changes and differences in phenotypic_expression to reduce statistical noise it is necessary to validate the initial findings in replication studies performed in independent cohorts which are often from different populations increasingly metaanalysis of multiple gwas_studies of the same trait involving tens_of of individuals are currently being performed in addition to confirming the initial gwas findings larger effective sample_sizes from these meta_analyses also increase_statistical for identifying novel associations with smaller genetic effects the large number of individuals in these studies meant it is highly unlikely they will come from the same population but rather from multiple_populations potentially possessing diverse genetic architectures the portability of association_signals in these trans population studies is thus highly dependent on the to whom correspondence should be addressed similarity of ld patterns between the associated markers and the underlying causal_variants in the different populations interpopulation heterogeneity in ld patterns can confound replication leading to false_negatives in some populations the ability to quantify the extent of inter population ld variation is thus the first step towards understanding whether a failure to reproduce an association_signal in another population may be a result of differential ld architecture with the causal_variant the presence of ld among snp markers has allowed commercial genotyping_platforms with incomplete snp coverage to successfully detect genotypephenotype associations however this becomes a liability in fine_mapping studies that aim to identify the actual causal_variants since it becomes difficult to distinguish between the causal_variant and the neighbouring markers in high or perfect ld with the causal_variant assuming there exists a common causal_variant among different populations diverse patterns of ld surrounding the snps that emerge from different gwas_studies can be used to refine the boundaries where the causal_variant may be found narrowing the search_space and reducing the cost of genotyping and sequencing during fine_mapping studies here we introduce a java program varld that quantifies the extent of ld variation between the two populations the program allows genome_wide assessment of ld variation as well as targeted analysis of a specific genomic_region the outcome from these analyses can be used to identify regions that display evidence of the inter population ld variation as these regions are likely to possess diverse haplotypic patterns across the populations association_signals emerging from gwas that fall within these regions will benefit from leveraging this genomic_diversity in trans population fine_mapping studies
