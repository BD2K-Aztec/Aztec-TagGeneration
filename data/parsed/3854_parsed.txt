structural_bioinformatics r d align global pairwise_alignment of rna d structures using local superpositions motivation comparing d structures of homologous rna_molecules yields information about sequence and structural_variability to compare large rna d structures accurate automatic comparison tools are needed in this article we introduce a new algorithm and web_server to align large homologous rna_structures nucleotide by nucleotide using local superpositions that accommodate the flexibility of rna_molecules local_alignments are merged to form a global_alignment by employing a maximum clique algorithm on a specially defined graph that we call the local_alignment graph results the algorithm is implemented in a program suite and web_server called r d align the r d align alignment of homologous d structures of s s and s rrna was compared to a high_quality hand alignment a full comparison of the s alignment with the other state of the art methods is also provided the r d align program suite includes new diagnostic_tools for the structural evaluation of rna alignments the r d align alignments were compared to those produced by other programs and were found to be the most accurate in comparison with a high_quality hand crafted alignment and in conjunction with a series of other diagnostics presented the number of aligned base_pairs as well as measures of geometric similarity are used to evaluate the accuracy of the alignments availability r d align is freely_available through a web_server http rna bgsu edu r dalign the matlab_source of the program suite is also freely_available for download at that location alignments of homologous rna_sequences can provide great insight into the structures functions and evolutionary_histories of rna_molecules as is the case for proteins alignment procedures based solely on sequence_similarity will also correctly align secondary_structure features of rna when sequence_similarity is high but such methods are inadequate for rna homologs that have diverged significantly in sequence and alignment_methods that take into to whom correspondence should be addressed account watsoncrick base_pair co variation are needed to obtain accurate alignments that reflect the conserved secondary_structure homologous rna_molecules share a core conserved secondary_structure and d structure as more d structures of rna homologs appear robust_methods for simultaneous alignment at multiple structural levels sequence secondary_structure and d structure are needed that can reveal the common structural_features this knowledge extracted from the extant d database can in turn guide efforts aimed at efficiently aligning the exponentially_growing number of homologs known only from sequence for example although only a handful of atomic_resolution d structures of ribosomal_rnas are known hundreds of thousands of homologs have been sequenced we have d structures of three bacterial and one archaeal s rrnas the bacteria thermus_thermophilus t th escherichia_coli e coli and deinococcus_radiodurans d r and the archaeon h m in previous work we produced hand crafted alignments of these structures a non trivial task for which no software existed at the time because producing a hand crafted alignment is a labor_intensive and time consuming process and in light of the rapid increase in d rna_structures in the pdb ndb we were motivated to develop automated tools to align rna d structures in a robust manner this article reports a successful effort to do so for the purposes of this article an alignment of two rna_structures is a list of correspondences between individual nucleotides from the two rnas in every alignment we require that the correspondences be well ordered if nucleotides i and j are aligned with nucleotides i and j respectively then i j if and only if i j and uniquely assigned no nucleotide should be aligned to more than one nucleotide from the other rna a number of research groups have developed programs for aligning rna d structures and we briefly_review previous work in this section dial aligns rna d structures using a quadratic time dynamic_programming that includes terms for similarity in nucleotide_sequence base_pairing and nine torsional angles used to describe the rna backbone the nine torsional angles include six dihedral_angles used to define rna backbone_conformations and the dihedral_angle that describes rotation about the glycosidic_bond it also uses two additional virtual angles and introduced in and reintroduced in sara performs pairwise rna d to d alignment by implementing a unit vectorpage we tested r d align by aligning the d structures of s s s rrnas of e coli e coli and thermus_thermophilus t th we also aligned the d structures of s and s rrnas of e coli and haloarcula marismortui h m pdb files aw j and s were used for e coli t th and h m respectively we chose these test cases because high_quality hand crafted alignments are available to effectively assess the accuracy of the alignments also these structures provide appropriate test cases because they are large and highly_structured with many non watsoncrick base_pairs and long_range moreover e coli t th and h m are phylogenetically distant so there are significant differences in sequence and structure we also tested r d align on other rnas including rnasep and trna see section in this section we focus on the alignment of the s rrna molecules of e coli and t th pdb files avy and j e respectively because the dial and sara web_servers are incapable of producing alignments of structures this large we asked the authors of the respective programs to provide alignments from local installations of these programs the r d align web_server is capable of aligning s and even s rrna molecules evaluations of the s and s alignments can be found in supplementary_materials s and s to align the molecules we used the iterative_approach discussed in the previous section which took min to run we benchmarked using a local installation of r d align on a compaq presario cq notebook with one intel pentium t processor running at ghz and with gb of ram matlab version r b was used for this benchmark one application of an accurate d to d alignment_method such as r d align is to create a consensus interaction list one application of an accurate d to d alignment_method such as r d align is to create a consensus interaction list for a variety of reasons two crystal_structures of the same molecule whether from the same organism or different organisms will show small_variations in the local structure of the rna when one structure shows a base_pair but the other shows the corresponding two bases falling just outside the classification limits it is reasonable to infer the presence of the base_pair in the second structure a r d align alignment can be used to locate near base_pairs in one structure that are aligned with true base_pairs in another the near base_pairs can then be inferred to be true base_pairs this could be used in conjunction with annotation program like fr d and the results would be useful for page we have introduced a new method for aligning two rna d structures and provided an implementation of this method in the r d align program suite and web_server in contrast to the existing_methods which either rely on a reduced linear representation of the d structure or on single global rigid superpositions we focus on superpositions of local neighborhoods which take into account interactions of all types while maintaining independence from discrete classifications of pairwise nucleotide interactions we have shown that r d align can be used to accurately align large rna_structures the s rrna alignment produced by r d align was compared with alignments produced by other methods it was shown to be the most accurate and to closely approximate a hand crafted alignment we have also introduced new display methods and diagnostics to compare and evaluate alignments among the new tools introduced is a spreadsheet which displays all of the alignment information in addition to all base_pairs detected in the structure this spreadsheet format is also useful for comparing different alignments side_by new bar diagrams were introduced which concisely display the alignment and the structural_similarity of the local neighborhoods of each aligned nucleotide
