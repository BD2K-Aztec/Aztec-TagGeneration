sequence_analysis racer rapid and accurate correction of errors in reads motivation high_throughput next_generation enable increasingly fast and affordable sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes with a broad range of applications the quality of the sequencing_data is crucial for all applications a significant portion of the data produced contains errors and ever more efficient error_correction programs are needed results we propose racer rapid and accurate correction of errors in reads a new software_program for correcting errors in sequencing_data racer has better error_correcting performance than existing programs is faster and requires less memory to support our claims we performed extensive comparison with the existing leading programs on a variety of real_datasets availability racer is freely_available use atthe automated sanger_sequencing method has revolutionized biological_research by unveiling the sequence of the dna_molecule most prominently that of the human_genome limitations of the method created the need for improved sequencing_technologies great demand caused the discovery of several so_called next_generation ngs_technologies such as illumina solexa roche life apgs solid helicos biosciences heliscope pacific_biosciences and lifes ion_torrent the survey of metzker gives detailed_descriptions these high_throughput produce huge_amounts of data at decreasing costs thus enabling an ever increasing number of applications including de_novo genome resequencing cancer mutation discovery metagenomics dnaprotein interaction discovery and so forth the way has been opened for ambitious projects such as the genomes_project the first project to sequence the genomes of a large number of people to provide a comprehensive resource on human genetic_variation and the genome k project aiming at discovering the genomes of vertebrate_species a large number of bioinformatics programs are essential in analyzing the ngs_data although their variety is impressive they all need high_quality data nearly half of the reads produced by illumina the currently dominant technology contain errors among other problems they make genome_assembly much more difficult and genome_assemblers such as euler sr allpaths abyss soapdenovo or sga include their own correcting mechanisms the importance of the problem led to the design of many stand alone error_correcting programs such as euler shrec schroder reptile quake cuda hshrec soap hitec coral salmela and schroderschroder hammer echo psaec and myhybrid see also the survey of the errors present in sequencing_data consist of substitutions where the correct base has been replaced by an erroneous one and indels where new bases have been inserted or existing ones deleted however due to the domination of the illumina technology which produces mostly substitution_errors the majority of the existing programs focus on correcting this type of errors for the same reason the current version of our new program focuses as well on substitution_errors the main idea of all correcting programs is essentially the same high_throughput compensate for short read_length by high coverage which implies that each position in the genome is sequenced multiple times many of which are correct therefore the correct way will prevail in a careful analysis and the errors can be corrected it is the way in which such an analysis is done that makes the difference between various programs some programs count the number of k_mers and those with counts above a given threshold are deemed correct whereas the remaining ones undergo correction these include shrec hitec hshrec and psaec others consider all k_mers occurring in each read the k spectrum and try to correct the entire read with minimum edit_distance such that all k_mers have counts above a threshold cuda quake reptile and hammer are included here finally coral echo and myhybrid are based on multiple_sequence the reader is referred to the survey offor details we propose a new program racer rapid and accurate correction of errors in reads that belongs to the first category although shrec and hshrec use suffix_trees and hitec uses the more efficient suffix_arrays racer uses completely different more efficient data_structures this way whereas both shrec and to a lesser extent hitec have high space to whom correspondence should be addressed consumption racer is space efficient it is also faster and more effective at correcting errors than the existing programs we have performed extensive comparison with the leading programs on a variety of real_datasets racer is freely_available use at www csd uwo ca ilie racer extensive testing shows that racer is superior to the existing programs in all aspects error_correcting performance time and space it corrects about three quarters of the errors in min for a bacterial dataset and min for a larger organism such as a worm or fly racer does not require any additional software to run we have presented a new tool racer for correcting errors in ngs_data the current version of racer targets illumina data thus correcting substitution error future versions will be able to handle indel_errors to enable correction of data from other sequencing_platforms as well as mixed data
