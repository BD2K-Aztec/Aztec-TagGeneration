correcting systematic_bias and instrument measurement drift with mzrefinery motivation systematic_bias in mass measurement adversely_affects data_quality and negates the advantages of high_precision instruments results we introduce the mzrefinery tool for calibration of mass_spectrometry data_files using confident peptide_spectrum three different calibration_methods are explored and the optimal transform function is chosen after calibration systematic_bias is removed and the mass measurement errors are centered at ppm because it is part of the proteowizard package mzrefinery can read and write a wide_variety of file_formats availability_and the mzrefinery tool is part of msconvert available with the proteowizard open_source package at http proteowizard sourceforge net for data analysis algorithms to take advantage of the higher accuracy of newer mass_spectrometers it is essential to remove systematic_bias in mass measurement mass measurement_error may originate from a variety of sources e g power_supply voltage temperature drift space charge effects temperature humidity variation in the laboratory vacuum system stability etc real_time calibration adjusts the mass measurement during data_acquisition typically using a known species as an internal reference lock mass methods may also be used to calibrate after the run has completed a separate method for calibration utilizes spectrum identifications to estimate measurement_error and guide mass correction we present a new calibration tool mzrefinery written directly into the proteowizard package like existing_tools mzrefinery models mass measurement_error based on peptide_identifications and finds the optimal calibration function in addition to simply adjusting the precursor ion mzrefinery corrects the m z of every ion in any high_resolution spectrum with the increasingly common use of high_resolution tandem_mass in prm and dia experiments more data are being created with highresolution fragments given the inherent complexity of such multiplexed fragmentation protocols calibrating the mass accuracy will be a great benefit for these experiments
