an automatic tool to analyze and cluster macromolecular conformations based on self_organizing motivation sampling the conformational_space of biological_macromolecules generates large sets of data with considerable complexity data_mining such as clustering can extract meaningful_information among them the self_organizing soms algorithm has_shown in particular since its computation time rises only linearly with the size of the data_set whereas soms are generally used with few neurons we investigate here their behavior with large_numbers of neurons results we present here a python_library implementing the full som analysis workflow large soms can readily be applied on heavy data_sets coupled with visualization_tools they have very interesting_properties descriptors for each conformation of a trajectory are calculated and mapped onto a d landscape the u matrix reporting the distance between neighboring neurons to delin eate clusters we developed the flooding algorithm which hierarchically identifies local basins of the u matrix from the global minimum to the maximum availability_and the python implementation of the som library is freely_available on github https github com clustering is an ideal way to reduce huge high_dimensional data_sets generated by conformational_sampling facilitating their analysis and visualization in general clustering requires prior_knowledge such as the relevant number of clusters furthermore the encoding of the structures in d cartesian atomic_coordinates depends strongly on alignment a problem when studying large conformational_transitions such as folding_unfolding our novel algorithm to analyze conformational_sampling addresses these points i to abolish the dependence on structural_alignment we use the matrix of squared euclidean_distances as conformational descriptor ii we exploit the property of large self_organizing soms to spontaneously and clearly cluster similar conformations in basins and to separate dissimilar ones by barriers by projecting the highdimensional exploration onto d landscape maps the som algorithm was applied to the analysis of ms molecular_dynamics at k of a simplified sequence of a residue a b subdomain of the protein g this frame trajectory presents multiple folding and unfolding events the map organizes the large diversity of explored conformations from extended forms to the native_state the u matrix depicts the covered conformational_space and its topology the minimum_spanning between local_minima reveals possible transition paths between conformational basins we found conformational basins and corresponding minima the transition i j probability flux for each pair of basins i j can be computed as explained in this markov_model provides the distribution of the first passage times in the folded basin the distribution we obtain is similar to the one found byand can be fitted by a single_exponential in a similar way with a mean folding time of ns compared with ns seein supplementary_materials the package presented here exploits the ability of soms to spontaneously cluster macromolecular conformations it provides a powerful_tool for the analysis and visualization of the sampled conformational_space even when they cover extremely different areas it can also delineate more subtle conformational changes such as catalytic_mechanisms of an enzyme furthermore the method can be applied to sparser sampling as inwith only conformations the som algorithm is a non linear dimensionality_reduction technique in contrast to linear approaches such as principal_component this is of major importance for the study of highly non linear processes such as folding_unfolding the som computation effort scales linearly with data size and this enables us to cluster even massive numbers of conformations this is very important given the ever increasing length of simulations it is largely automatic and has only very few parameters which we have optimized for this type of application the good agreement with the previous study byon the same trajectory is highly satisfying in particular considering the fact that our method requires no interventions the som library is very flexible and the conformational descriptors can be tailored to different cases of conformational clustering and analysis
