structural_bioinformatics shape directed rna_folding chemical mapping experiments allow for nucleotide_resolution assessment of rna_structure we demonstrate that different strategies of integrating probing_data with thermo dynamics based rna_secondary prediction_algorithms can be implemented by means of soft constraints this amounts to incorporating suitable pseudo energies into the standard energy_model for rna_secondary as a showcase application for this new feature of the viennarna package we compare three distinct previously_published strategies to utilize shape reactivities for structure_prediction the new tool is benchmarked on a set of rnas with known reference structure availability_and the capability for shape directed rna_folding is part of the upcoming release of the viennarna package for which a preliminary release is already freely_available www tbi beyond its role as information carrier from genome to proteome rna is a key_player in genome regulation and contributes to a wide_variety of cellular tasks the spatial_structure of rna plays an important role in this context because it critically influences the interaction of rnas with proteins and with nucleic_acids knowledge of rna_structure is therefore crucial for understanding various biological_processes chemical and enzymatic probing methods provide information concerning the flexibility and accessibility at nucleotide_resolution they are based on the observation that rna can be selectively modified by small_organic metal_ions or rnase enzymes resulting in formation of an adduct between the rna and the small compound or rna cleavage subsequent primer_extension mediated by rt enzymes typically terminates at the modified sites the resulting cdna_fragments thus inform directly on the rna_structure by identifying depending on the particular reagent paired or unpaired sequence_positions for a recent overview of such highthroughput probing methods we refer to as chemical probing is becoming a frequently used technology to determining rna_structure experimentally there is increasing demand for efficient and accurate computational_methods to incorporate probing_data into secondary_structure prediction_tools efficient dynamic_programming as implemented in the viennarna package typically yield excellent prediction results for short_sequences but accuracy decreases to between and for long rna_sequences this discrepancy is mainly caused by imperfect thermodynamic_parameters and the inherent_limitations of the secondary_structure model such as tertiary_interactions pseudoknots ligand_binding or kinetics traps to alleviate the gap in available computational_tools we have extended the viennarna package by a flexible framework to incorporate all those soft constraints that are compatible with the rna_folding grammar here we use this to handle position wise data as they arise from chemical probing experiments
