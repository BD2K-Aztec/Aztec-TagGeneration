sequence_analysis abmapper a suffix_array based tool for multi location searching and splice_junction mapping sequencing_reads generated by rna_sequencing rna_seq must first be mapped back to the genome through alignment before they can be further analyzed current fast and memory saving short read_mappers could give us a quick view of the transcriptome however they are neither designed for reads that span across splice_junctions nor for repetitive reads which can be mapped to multiple_locations in the genome multi reads here we describe a new software_package abmapper which is specifically_designed for exploring all putative locations of reads that are mapped to splice_junctions or repetitive in nature availability_and the software is freely_available at http abmapper sourceforge net the software is written in c and perl it runs on all major platforms and operating_systems including windows mac os x and linux the advent of rna_seq technology has dramatically transformed transcriptomics within just a few years the next_generation platform can generate far more data per experiment than traditional sequencing_technology millions of short sometimes paired_end have brought about new challenges to map them back onto the genome for determining gene expression_level and for detecting splicing_events two groups li et_al and langmead et_al have developed shortread alignment tools based on the burrowwheeler transformation algorithm which runs fast and with low memory requirement a major_drawback of these fast aligners is that they require reads to map to contiguous genomic_sequence and thus are not appropriate for reads spanning splice_junctions splitseek tophat and splicemap are three widely known software_packages written to make up for the lack of ability of these short_read for splice_site identification however these tools have to rely on output from existing aligners tophat requires bowtie splicemap requires eland or bowtie and splitseek depends on the solid whole transcriptome analysis_pipeline and is therefore restricted only to solid dataset in this work we present abmapper which has been developed as a stand alone tool for ab_initio mapping of sequencing_reads that span across splicing junctions or reads that have multiple putative locations within the genome it adopts a fast suffix_array algorithm and a dual seed strategy to find all putative locations of reads we chose reads each with the size of bp that cover all human known junction sites and the same number of reads from the exons of human_genome to compare the results of abmapper version seed length maximum output m and output format t with splicemap version and tophat version performance of the three software_packages are summarized in additional performance data of abmapper as well as resource usage of the three programs can be found in the supplementary_material
