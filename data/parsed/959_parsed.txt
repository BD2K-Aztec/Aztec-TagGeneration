sequence_analysis chimera a bioconductor_package for secondary analysis of fusion products chimera is a bioconductor_package that organizes annotates analyses and validates fusions reported by different fusion detection_tools current_implementation can deal with output from bellerophontes chimerascan defuse fusioncatcher fusionfinder fusionhunter fusionmap mapsplice rsubread tophat fusion and star the core of chimera is a fusion data_structure that can store fusion_events detected with any of the aforementioned tools fusions are then easily manipulated with standard r functions or through the set of functionalities specifically developed in chimera with the aim of supporting the user in managing fusions and discriminating false_positive availability_and chimera is implemented as a bioconductor_package in r the package and the vignette can befusion genes also known as chimeras have become crucial in the areas of biomarkers and therapeutic_targets investigation the emergence of deep_sequencing of the transcriptome has opened many opportunities for the identification of this class of genomic_alterations leading to the discovery of novel chimeric_transcripts in cancers a significant number of bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to detect fusion_genes recently we have shown that the performances of such tools can be quite variegated and that their false_positive detection rate can be a critical issue most tools detect fusion_events in two steps i alignment to a reference_genome to detect discordant alignments and ii refinements of fusion candidates with removal of false_positive the second step is particularly critical as each tool implements a different set of filters and users have limited control on them as each fusion_detection tool has a specific combination of alignment and filtering approaches results produced by each tool are only partially comparable with the others thus although the combination of the results derived from different tools can increase the number of true fusions detected it also significantly increases the number of falsepositive results see_supplementary the bioconductor_package chimera reported in this note provides a common framework to manipulate analyze and filter fusion_events detected by a variety of fusion detection_tools chimera is based on typical r data_structures which allows its users to take advantage also of the full set of r functionalities to the best of our knowledge chimera is the only available software able to integrate and compare the data produced by different fusion detection_tools thus it represents an answer to the lack of standard data_structure for fusion data representation furthermore as the combination of results from more than one fusion_detection tool enhances the probability to identify fusion_events see_supplementary chimera provides a common framework to manipulate filter and prioritize fusion_events moreover chimera offers a validation procedure based on de_novo thanks to the gapfiller tool and enhances fusions annotation through the exploitation of the oncofuse results
