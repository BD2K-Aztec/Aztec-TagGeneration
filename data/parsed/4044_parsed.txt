gene_expression rnaseqviewer visualization_tool for rna_seq with the advances of rna sequencing_technologies scientists need new tools to analyze transcriptome_data we introduce rnaseqviewer a new visualization_tool dedicated to rna_seq the program offers innovative_ways to represent transcriptome_data for single or multiple samples it is a handy tool for scientists who use rna_seq to compare multiple transcriptomes for example to compare gene_expression and alternative_splicing of cancer samples or of different development stages the development of next_generation allows largescale transcriptome_studies using massively_parallel of complementary_dna reverse_transcribed from rna rnaseq technologies scientists now face the challenge of analyzing the unprecedented amount of available sequencing_data in addition to the use of automated tools such analysis needs human review and interpretation of the data to gain insight into them verify consistency of programs results understand intricate cases and structures and reveal underlying patterns as data_files generated by automated tools for rna_seq analysis are formatted for computational treatments and can exceed gigabytes they are improper for easy direct human reading this calls for effective visualization_tools capable of displaying big datasets in intuitive ways genomic visualization software can be divided_into two categories web_based genome_browsers like those from ucsc and ensembl and standalone software including the integrative_genomics and savant only the latter category is adapted to the visualization of the large locally stored datasets usually manipulated in rna_seq analysis as web upload is prohibitive however existing solutions are limited to a few tracks visualized simultaneously and it is not possible to compare the multiple samples of medium or large rna_seq experiments here we introduce rnaseqviewer a desktop program to visualize the data from the rna_seq analyzing process for single or multiple samples by focusing on expression of genes and transcript_isoforms the program offers innovative_ways to present the transcriptome_data in a quantitative and interactive manner
