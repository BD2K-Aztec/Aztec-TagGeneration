improving evolutionary_models of protein_interaction motivation theoretical_models of biological_networks are valuable tools in evolutionary inference theoretical_models based on gene_duplication and divergence provide biologically_plausible evolutionary mechanics similarities found between empirical networks and their theoretically generated counterpart are considered evidence of the role modeled mechanics play in biological evolution however the method by which these models are parameterized can lead to questions about the validity of the inferences selecting parameter_values in order to produce a particular topological value obfuscates the possibility that the model may produce a similar topology for a large range of parameter_values alternately a model may produce a large range of topologies allowing incorrect parameter_values to produce a valid topology from an otherwise flawed model in order to lend biological credence to the modeled evolutionary mechanics parameter_values should be derived from the empirical data furthermore recent work indicates that the timing and fate of gene_duplications are critical to proper derivation of these parameters results we present a methodology for deriving evolutionary_rates from empirical data that is used to parameterize duplication and divergence models of protein_interaction evolution our method avoids shortcomings of previous methods which failed to consider the effect of subsequent duplications from our parameter_values we find that concurrent and existing existing duplication and divergence models are insufficient for modeling protein_interaction evolution we introduce a model enhancement based on heritable interaction sites on the surface of a protein and find that it more closely reflects the high clustering found in the empirical network the study of biological_networks is a promising_area for arriving at evolutionary inference gene_duplication is regarded as the primary evolutionary phenomenon driving protein network growth in theoretical_models gene_duplication is represented through the random copying of one of the proteins nodes in the network each duplication is accompanied by link dynamics the gain and loss of interactions in the network based on theories of gene duplicate to whom correspondence should be addressed fates model_parameters control the probability at which interactions are gained and lost with each duplication two models in particular are exemplars of this type of theoretical_model the strategy used to affirm the evolutionary mechanics captured by these models is to compare the topology generated by these networks with empirical biological_networks the models are seen to be validated when the theoretical and empirical networks share similar topological characteristics it therefore follows that proper parameterization of the models is paramount to generating a network which is plausible given the model mechanics used the average number of empirical protein interactions from empirical data average degree as a constraint to tune model parameter_values which produced a similar theoretical network derived parameter_estimates directly from empirical measurements based on the fact that the model_parameters represent the gain and loss of interactions after gene_duplication their interaction gain and loss rate parameter_values were based on examination of interactions of known duplicates i e paralogs the average degree and mathematical constraints the mechanics featured in the vzquez and sol models are essential to this study gene_duplication loss of redundant interactions between duplicates the formation of new interactions and interactions which form between paralogs when a selfinteracting proteins gene is duplicated are all evolutionary phenomena which have direct analogs in the vzquez and sol models it is these evolutionarily plausible mechanics to which we give special_attention can these mechanics be enhanced to improve model performance while preserving the biological_plausibility of the enhancements aside from vzquez and sol there are numerous models that have furthered our understanding of protein_interaction evolution one notable example is who construct a stochastic_model based on empirical observations the model features protein interaction gain and loss but the interaction loss rate is predicated on preserving a constant network_connectivity rather than on a biologically identifiable phenomena in another example find that a geometric random graph has a good topological fit to empirical protein_interaction their geometric random graph is constructed by connecting nodes based on their proximity from each other when arranged randomly on a two_dimensional metric space the mechanics of the model are not evolutionarily plausible they do not help us elucidate the evolutionary_processes that have contributed to the formation of the network_topology a strength of the vzquez model over other models with biologically faithful mechanics is that it does not requirethe topological_properties of both the empirically_derived yeast network and other networks can be found in the top row of the table covers the empirical dataset additional datasets can be found in the supplementary_materials the bottom half of the table contains the topological_properties of various theoretical_models that are described later in the text the order and size columns refer to the number of proteins and interactions respectively triangles and connected triples refer to the components of the clustering_coefficient the clustering_coefficient is defined as c t where t is the number of triangles and is the number of connected triples a triangle is three fully connected nodes and a connected triple is a node connected to an unordered pair of other nodes i e a path of length the clustering_coefficient is the primary measure we use to scrutinize these models it is a uniquely appropriate measure because it is sensitive to the model mechanics we study the gain of interactions with each duplication the loss of interactions as interactions are subfunctionalized and the paralogous interactions formed between duplicates each have a measurable effect on the clustering_coefficient additional topological measures can be found in the supplementary_materials we have presented an alternative method of calculating model_parameters which take into consideration the effect concurrent and subsequent duplications have on the model calculation now we discuss the advantages of our parameter_estimation methodology over previous_approaches we also take a further look at the model improvements integrated into the isite model and how it compares to the empirical network we have developed an improved methodology for estimating link dynamics rates based on empirical network data estimating rates through simple examination of the empirical network fails to account for the entire evolutionary_history of interaction addition and loss which underlie the extant network our methodology attempts to peel back more recent duplication_events in order to more accurately assess link dynamics associated with older duplication_events using our empirically_derived rates the vzquez et_al model fails to achieve empirical clustering a modified model integrating heritable interaction sites generates networks with clustering more closely approximating the yeast network
