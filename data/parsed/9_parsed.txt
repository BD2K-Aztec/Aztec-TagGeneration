dgenome a comprehensive database of chromatin_interactions motivation the d structure of the genome plays_a in regulating gene_expression recent_progress in mapping technologies for chromatin_interactions has led to a rapid increase in this kind of interaction data this trend will continue as research in this burgeoning field intensifies results we describe the dgenome database that stores chromatin_interaction data compiled through comprehensive literature curation the database currently covers both low and high_throughput assays including c c seq c hi c chia_pet and capture c to complement the set of interactions detected by experimental assays we also include interactions predicted by a recently_developed computational_method with demonstrated high_accuracy the database currently contains million records covering cell tissue_types in five organisms records in the database are described using a standardized file_format facilitating data_exchange the vast major of the interactions were assigned a confidence_score using the web_interface users can query and download database records via a number of annotation dimensions query results can be visualized along with other genomics datasets via links to the ucsc_genome we anticipate that dgenome will be a valuable resource for investigating the spatial_structure and function relationship of genomes availability_and dgenome is freely_accessible at http dgenome int med uiowa edu the database and web_interface are implemented in mysql apache and javascript with all_major determining the d structure of the genome and its impact on gene_expression and other dna transactions has been a long_standing question in cell_biology the pioneering method of chromosome_conformation c determines the relative frequency of direct physical_contact between a pair of linearly separated chromatin segments by coupling c with short_read sequencing_technology chromosome_conformation on chip c seq and chromosome_conformation carbon copy c can detect genome_wide interactions involving a single anchor region and interactions involving multiple genomic_regions respectively the hi c protocol is a truly genome_wide technology that allows detection of all interactions in the genome the chia_pet protocol combines the principles of c and chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip to identify chromatin_interactions mediated by protein factors most recently the capture c method technology c and short_read and enables researchers to interrogate cis interactions at hundreds of selected loci at high_resolution in a single assay application of these genome_wide assays in recent_years has led to a dramatic_increase in chromatin_interaction data this rapid increase in data has spurred the development of specialized databases to document chromatin_interactions however existing databases only store interactions detected by either hi c or by c chia_pet and hi c as a result they miss a large number of interactions detected by other commonly used highthroughput methods such as c and capture c they also miss interactions detected by c which tend to have higher quality and thus is very useful as the gold_standard for a variety of purposes besides experimental assays computational_methods are being continuously improved to predict chromatin_interactions in particular the recently_developed method integrated method for predicting enhancer targets im pet has been demonstrated to have comparable accuracy as the c assay currently there is a lack of a comprehensive depository for chromatin_interactions identified by all major technologies this dispersion of information hinders standardization sharing and integration of the interaction data which are critical for gaining insights into genome structure_function towards this goal we have developed the dgenome database a general repository for chromatin_interactions records in dgenome are compiled through comprehensive literature curation of experimentally_derived interactions the database currently covers both low and high_throughput assays including c c seq c hi c chia_pet and capture c the database also includes computational predictions made by the im pet algorithm that integrates multiple types of genomic_features to predict interactions between enhancers and promoters the current release of dgenome contains experimentally_derived and computationally predicted interactions across cell tissue_types in five organisms and b show the percentages of interactions by organism and detection method respectively in terms of data resolution currently hi c data have the lowest resolution followed by c c seq chia_pet and capture c as sequencing becomes deeper we anticipate that resolutions of the interaction data will improve especially hi c data although their theoretical limits are determined by the choice of the restriction_enzyme used in the assays in terms of genomic_distance of interacting regions current c seq and c data tend to capture interactions separated by longer genomic_distance this likely reflects the choices of genomic_regions interrogated in the c and c seq studies instead of the inherent_properties of these assays additional summary_statistics regarding the database is presented in supplementary table s two alternative tools have been developed before however they either only curate a particular data type hi c or is specialized for visualizing interactions to the best of our knowledge dgenome is the first database that comprehensively document and curate chromatin_interactions generated by both experimental and computational_approaches another unique feature of dgenome is that it provides contact_frequency and confidence measure for each interaction whenever such a measure is possible as a result interactions can be prioritized in various analyses interactions documented in dgenome were detected using different experimental_technologies although these technologies rely on similar molecular_biology principle caveats need to be taken when comparing interactions involving the same loci but generated bydifferent technologies on the other hand if an interaction involving the same loci is detected by multiple technologies it increases our confidence in the interaction in the future integraing interactions detected by different technologies in a statistical sound way should be an important research area we anticipate that dgenome will be a valuable resource for investigating the spatial_structure and function relationship of genomes as research in this burgeoning area intensifies we envision that a wide_range of investigations will benefit from a carefully curated database such as dgenome a few examples_include standardization and benchmarking of interaction data qualities by different detection technologies relationship between genome d structure and epigenetic state dynamics of chromatin_interaction across cell tissue_types and organisms and genome d structure and pathogenic genetic_variations besides continued curation effort to add new interactions our future_research will focus on two areas in order to improve the quality and utility of database records first we plan to improve the integration of dgenome with other molecular interaction_databases such as biogrid and string second we plan to conduct systematic comparisons to identify and apply the most accurate means to assign confidence measures to interaction data generated by different technologies
