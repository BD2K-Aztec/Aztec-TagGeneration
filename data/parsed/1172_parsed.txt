cormut an r bioconductor_package for computing correlated_mutations based on selection_pressure correlated_mutations constitute a fundamental idea in evolutionary_biology and understanding correlated_mutations will in turn facilitate an understanding of the genetic mechanisms_governing evolution cormut is an r package designed to compute correlated_mutations in the unit of codon or amino_acid mutation three classical_methods were incorporated and the computation results can be represented as correlation mutation networks cormut also enables the comparison of correlated_mutations between two different evolutionary conditions availability_and cormut is released under the gnu_general within bioconductor_project and freely_available atin genetics the ka_ks ratio or dn_ds is the ratio of the number of non synonymous_substitutions per non synonymous site ka to the number of synonymous_substitutions per synonymous site ks which can be used as an indicator of selective_pressure acting on a protein_coding the selection_pressure may reflect a change in the function of a gene or a change in environmental_conditions that forces the organism to adapt for example the mutations to confer resistance of a highly_variable virus e g hiv or hcv to new antiviral_drugs may be expected to undergo positive_selection in a patient population treated with the drugs against the corresponding virus the concept of correlated_mutations is a fundamental idea in evolutionary_biology the amino_acid substitution_rates are expected to be limited by functional constraints given the functional constraints operating on genes a mutation in one position can be compensated by an additional mutation as a result mutation_patterns can be formed by correlated_mutations responsible for specific conditions here we developed an r bioconductor_package to detect the correlated_mutations among positive_selection sites by combining ka_ks ratio and correlated_mutations analysis cormut is suitable for computing the correlated_mutations of highly_variable genomes such as hiv and hcv random_variables making it possible to measure the correlated_mutations between two positions jaccard_index measures the similarity between two variables and it has been widely used to measure correlated_mutations the computation for correlated_mutations consists of two steps first the positive_selection sites are detected using the selection_pressure based method second the mutation correlations are computed among the positive_selection sites using the three methods described above it should however be noted that cormut can also be used to compute correlated_mutations without considering selection_pressure at all meanwhile cormut facilitates the comparison of the correlated_mutations between two conditions by means of a correlated mutation network the cormut package provides simple and flexible functionality to compute and display the correlated_mutations between codons or amino mutations the representation of correlation mutations as a network and the ability to compare correlated_mutations between two conditions make it possible to understand the genetic mechanisms_governing evolution
