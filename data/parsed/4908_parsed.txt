wellreader a matlab program for the analysis of fluorescence and luminescence reporter_gene data motivation fluorescent and luminescent reporter_gene systems in combination with automated microplate readers allow real_time monitoring of gene_expression on the population level at high_precision and sampling density this generates large_amounts of data for the analysis of which computer tools are missing to date results we have developed wellreader a matlab program for the analysis of fluorescent and luminescent reporter_gene data wellreader allows the user to load the output_files of microplate readers remove outliers correct for background effects and smooth and fit the data moreover it computes biologically_relevant quantities from the measured signals notably promoter_activities and protein concentrations and compares the resulting expression_profiles of different genes under different conditions availability wellreader is available under a lgpl licence at
