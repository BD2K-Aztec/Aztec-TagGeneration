scaffmatch scaffolding algorithm based on maximum_weight matching motivation next generation high_throughput has become a state of the art technique in genome_assembly scaffolding is one of the main_stages of the assembly pipeline during this stage contigs assembled from the paired_end are merged into bigger chains called scaffolds because of a high_level of statistical noise chimeric reads and genome repeats the problem of scaffolding is a challenging_task current scaffolding software_packages widely vary in their quality and are highly dependent on the read data_quality and genome complexity there are no clear winners and multiple opportunities for further improvements of the tools still exist results this article_presents an efficient scaffolding algorithm scaffmatch that is able to handle reads with both short bp and long bp insert_sizes producing high_quality scaffolds we evaluate our scaffolding tool with the f score and other metrics n corrected n on eight datasets comparing it with the most available packages our experiments show that scaffmatch is the tool of preference for the most datasets availability_and the source_code is available atnext generation sequencing ngs is a powerful technology as it can produce millions of short paired_end covering whole_genome the cost of producing reads keeps a trend of decreasing making it a very attractive tool for genome_sequencing and assembly genome_assembly from short ngs_reads is a challenging_problem assembled_genomes are frequently highly fragmented and consist of contigs of highly variable_length the connectivity_information coming from read_pairs mapped to contigs can be used to merge them into a scaffold which is a set of chains of oriented ordered contigs with estimated gaps between all pairs of adjacent elements a recent comprehensive evaluation of available software_tools shows that the scaffolding_problem still does not have an adequate solution because of misassemblies in contigs repeats and chimeric reads the information about relative ordering and orientation of two contigs connected with a set of read_pairs can be contradictory and not reliable thus choosing a wrong subset of read_pairs as an evidence of connection between two contigs can result in inferring a wrong relative ordering and or orientation as well as the gap estimation between them edges that comply with the true orientation of contigs and the distance between them are usually called concordant otherwise discordant edges the scaffolding_problem is usually formulated as an optimization_problem on a graph with the vertices corresponding to the contigs and the edges corresponding to the bunches of read_pairs connecting contigs in contrast the optimization objectives and the methods to find optimal scaffolding with respect to these objectives significantly vary from one tool to another for example opera maximizes the number of concordant edges using dynamic_programming scarpa minimizes the number of discordant edges using fixed parameter tractable and bounded algorithm and linear maximizes number of read_pairs agreeing with a chosen contig_orientation using nonserial dynamic_programming as all optimization scaffolding formulations are np_hard see e g many state of the art scaffolding tools use heuristic approaches exploiting specific properties of the underlying scaffolding graph scarpa and silp solve separately the orientation and the ordering problems mip and silp use decomposition of the scaffolding graph into biconnected components sspace uses a simple but powerful greedy heuristic and besst uses read_pair statistics to filter out spurious edges created by structural errors and starts scaffolding with larger contigs in this article we propose a novel optimization formulation representing scaffolding as a maximum_weight acyclic matching mwa m problem as the hamiltonian path problem can be reduced to this problem this formulation is also np complete the presented algorithm scaffmatch efficiently finds the maximumweight matching and iteratively destroys all cycles this approach works very well since usually number of cycles is very small our experimental study follows the evaluation of state of the art scaffolders inperformed on five scaffolding datasets including four from the gage project we have run the majority of up to date versions of stand alone scaffolders such as opera sopra sspace and mip as well the recently_published ones silp and besst we have also included the results for scaffolding modules of sga and soapdenovo run independently of de_novo following our matching based tool scaffmatch compares_favorably with the state of the art tools in terms of widely_accepted n metric the metrics introduced in as well as sensitivity ppv and f score in predicting contig junctions
