systems_biology inferring the soybean glycine_max microrna functional network based on target_gene network motivation the rapid accumulation of micrornas mirnas and experimental_evidence for mirna interactions has ushered in a new area of mirna research that focuses on network more than individual mirna interaction which provides a systematic view of the whole micrornome so it is a challenge to infer mirna functional interactions on a system wide level and further draw a mirna functional network mirfn a few studies have focused on the well studied human species however these methods can neither be extended to other non model_organisms nor take fully into account the information embedded in mirnatarget and targettarget interactions thus it is important to develop appropriate methods for inferring the mirna network of non model species such as soybean glycine_max without such extensive mirna phenotype associated data as mirna disease associations in human results here we propose a new method to measure the functional_similarity of mirnas considering both the site accessibility and the interactive context of target_genes in functional gene_networks we further construct the mirfns of soybean which is the first study on soybean mirnas on the network level and the core methods can be easily extended to other species we found that mirfns of soybean exhibit a scale_free small_world and modular_architecture with their degrees fit best to power_law and exponential distribution we also showed that mirna with high degree tends to interact with those of low degree which reveals the disassortativity and modularity of mirfns our efforts in this study will be useful to further reveal the soybean mirnamirna and mirnagene interactive mechanism on a systematic level

micrornas mirnas nt in length are endogenous small_non that repress gene_expression by binding untranslated_regions utrs of their target messengerrnas mrnas leading to direct destructive cleavage or translational_repression in plant mature_mirnas are generated from stem loop_regions of longer rna precursors mainly by an endoribonuclease iii like enzyme dicer like dcl the processed and methylated mirna mirna duplex is then exported to the cytosol mirnas that are incorporated into an argonaute protein containing rna_induced risc can affect the target gene_expression different from of animals most plant mirnas have highly complementary recognition_sites on their targets it is considered to be a prominent feature of cleavage guided repression mirnas one of the most important components of the cell play_critical many important biological_processes such as development nutrient homeostasis abiotic_stress and pathogen responses in plant so_far mirbase contains entries representing hairpin precursor mirnas expressing mature mirna products in species it is predicted that in eukaryotes mirna_genes accounted for of the total genes and their target_genes may reach the limited mirnas are claimed to be able to control the larger set of genes or processes through interaction in which multiple_mirnas work interactively to control individual genes to date several elegant experiments have been carried_out unraveling intriguing mirna interactions for example lin and let the first two experimentally_verified mirnas are cooperative in pointed_out that there are interactive relations between mirnas when they proposed the algorithm of pictar and further experimentally_validated that mir mir and let b coordinately regulate mtpn additionally numerous mirnas were identified to be involved in the aging signaling_pathway such as mir mir mir mir mir mir mir mir mir mir mir mir mir and mir reviewed by the same interactions also exist in plant for example mir and mir are involved in arabidopsis adventitious rooting program all these experimental_results bring to a new area of mirna research that focuses on network rather than individual mirna interaction with the availability of large data derived from fine_scale experiments and computer algorithms several results have been achieved first built an mirna network by analyzing the target_genes predicted by pictar and targetscan integrated analysis of mirna_expression data showed that the higher correlation_coefficient of mirna co expressions the higher intensity in to whom correspondence should be addressed their synergy mirnas with negative correlation between their expressions tend to avoid the synergies recently constructed a human mirnamirna functional synergistic network via co regulating functional_modules they found that contrasting to non disease mirnas disease mirnas have more synergism and are the global central cores of the network indicating their higher complexity of function the prerequisite of constructing an mirna functional network mirfn is to define the functions of the mirnas however the functions of the most recently identified mirnas are unknown due to the lack of experimental strategy for systematic identification of their regulating targets to better understand mirnas it is increasingly necessary to measure their functional_similarity fs and further construct a functional network thus in turn to infer novel potential functions for mirnas for the fs of protein_coding many successful methods have been proposed either based on sequence or expression similarities or based on gene_ontology go annotations nevertheless we cannot indiscriminately imitate these successful methods for inferring the fs of mirnas first all mirnas are short in length and mirnamrna duplex allows mismatch so mirnas with similar sequence and pre mirnas with similar structure may have distinctive functions second although expression similarity can interpret part of the fs of mirna like protein_coding the similar expression pattern does not always signify fs third it is impractical to measure mirnas fs directly based on their functions due to the absence of functional databases such as go annotations for coding_genes to annotate mirnas therefore new methods were developed to measure mirnas fs used human mirna disease association data to infer mirnas fs by measuring the similarity of their associated diseases structured as directed_acyclic which is similar to infer the similarity of protein_coding by measuring the semantic_similarity of their annotating go directed_acyclic however few species has datasets about the relationships between mirnas and specific phenotypes such as mirna diseases associations in human more generally and directly mirnas function as repressive regulator on their target_transcripts the final functionality of mirnas that is embedded in the mirnatarget interactions mainly depends on the functions of the downstream_target thus the target_genes should play the major roles in full elucidation of the biological meanings as well as the fss of the mirnas based on target_genes all existing_approaches for mirnas fs calculation can be summarized as shown in the simplest method reported bydefined the fs as the proportion of the common target_genes which is represented as a jaccard similarity between two target gene_sets regulated by two mirnas a presented a second method for systematic study of fss among human mirnas by using their target_genes fss presented as go semantic similarities b used the third method shown as in c for each pairwise mirnas they test the significance of their co regulated_genes sharing the same go category called as co regulating functional_modules using hypergeometric_test however all aforementioned methods ignored two critical aspects of information embedded in the mirna_target regulatory_process which would greatly improve their performances one is the site accessibility between mirna and its target_mrna the other is the interactive context between target_genes target accessibility first proposed by has been identified as one of important factors that are involved in target_recognition because the secondary_structure stem etc around target_site will prevent mirna and target_mrna from contacting as shown in the target accessibility is represented by g the energy computed as the free_energy gained by transitioning from the state in which mirna and its target are unbound left to the state in which the mirna binds its target right the less energy means the more possibility that mirna is able to contact and cleave target_mrna i e high accessibility from this point_of an mirna pair that has less g with their common target_mrnas should be more similar in functionality more detailed illustrations are provided in supplementary_materials s and supplementary thus we should take into account target accessibility when measuring the fs between mirnas to improve the sensitivity of functional comparison interactive contexts between mirnas target_genes have also attracted the attentions of several researchers suggested that a set of mirna_targets regulated by a single mirna generally constitute the biological_network of a three approaches for measuring fs of mirnas a fs was directly calculated as the proportion of the common target_genes between two mirnas which is represented as a jaccard similarity between two target gene_sets b fs was calculated by computing the semantic_similarity between their target gene_sets based on go c fs was represented as the significance of their co regulated_genes sharing the same go category which is identified by hypergeometric_test b illustration of accessibility represented as for mrnatarget interaction the left part shows the unbound risc and its partial paired target utr the right shows the risc target interactions g is computed as the free_energy gained by transitioning from the state in which mirna and target are unbound left to the state in which the mirna binds its target right the region of the target_site that needs to be unpaired for a mirna_target interaction includes the mirna bound region and likely additional flanks this figure was completely cited fromfunctionally associated molecules in human cells have performed topological_analysis to elucidate the global correlation between mirna regulation and protein_protein in humans they showed that target_genes of individual mirna tend to be hubs and bottlenecks in the network although proteins directly regulated by mirna might not form a network module themselves the mirna_targets and their interacting neighbors jointly showed significantly_higher modularity these studies indicate that target_genes constitute not just a simple gene_set but also a subnetwork of a larger scale functional gene network they involved in the interactive contexts in such target_gene network should also be used for inferring the fs of mirnas we propose a novel approach to measuring the fs of mirnas considering both their target_site accessibility and the topology of target functional gene_networks fgn and further construct four soybean glycine_max mirfns we by topology analysis indicated that mirfns of soybean exhibit a scale_free small_world and modular_architecture with their degrees fit best to power_law and exponential distribution degree correlation showed that mirnas of high degrees in mirfns tend to interact with mirnas of low degrees revealing the disassortativity and modularity of mirfns more researches on soybean genome and micrornome based on mirfns and fgns are underway in this study we first proposed a novel approach to measuring the fs of mirnas both considering their site accessibility and the topology of target_gene functional network based on pairwise fs we further constructed four soybean g max mirfns via a clusteringcoefficient based threshold selection our method in this article made up for the defects of existing_methods either that some of them failed to infer the mirna network of non model species without such extensive mirnaphenotype associated data as mirna disease association in human or that some of them did not consider the target_site accessibility and the interactive context between target_genes the successful application in soybean indicates that our methods can be easily extended to other species in next five subsections we will discuss the highlights of this article and the research prospects
