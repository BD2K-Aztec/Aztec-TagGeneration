inferring gene ontologies from pairwise similarity data motivation while the manually_curated gene_ontology go is widely used inferring a go directly from omics_data is a compelling new problem recognizing that ontologies are a directed_acyclic dag of terms and hierarchical relations algorithms are needed that analyze a full matrix of genegene pairwise similarities from omics_data infer true hierarchical_structure in these data rather than enforcing hierarchy as a computational artifact and respect biological pleiotropy by which a term in the hierarchy can relate to multiple higher_level terms methods addressing these requirements are just beginning to emergenone has been evaluated for go inference methods we consider two algorithms clique extracted ontology clixo localfitness that uniquely satisfy these requirements compared with methods including standard clustering clixo is a new approach that finds maximal cliques in a network induced by progressive thresholding of a similarity matrix we evaluate each methods ability to reconstruct the go biological_process ontology from a similarity matrix based on a semantic similarities for go itself or b three omics_datasets

other methods using two omics_datasets and achieves precision and recall using yeastnet v similar to an earlier approach network extracted ontology and better than localfitness or standard clustering precision recall conclusion this study provides algorithmic foundation for building gene ontologies by capturing hierarchical and pleiotropic structure embedded in biomolecular data ontologies have proven very useful for capturing and organizing knowledge as a hierarchical set of terms and their interrelationships in biology one of the most successful and widely used ontologies is from the gene_ontology go project a major effort to represent gene_functions in cellular_level processes across organisms go is the default source of functional_annotations for virtually every experimental system and the gold_standard for measuring the success of bioinformatic_methods it is extensively used by researchers in a wide_variety of situations such as understanding the function of genes discovered in a genome_wide or computationally predicting functions for uncharacterized genes an important feature of go is that the ontology structure is constructed by a diverse team of scientists according to their best abilities to curate the published scientific_literature as the amount of cell biological_literature increases however curating the ontology structure has become a painstaking effort that is proving difficult to scale up and systematize moreover human curation necessarily favors biological_entities that have been well studied and misses the large proportion of cell_biology that is not yet known or has not yet been curated for these reasons it is not possible to directly learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using go and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism let alone a specific cell_type or disease_state recently it has been shown by some of us that a go can be inferred directly from molecular data as a complement to further curation efforts www nexontology org for ontology curators this approach is extremely_valuable in three ways first it finds connections missed by curators second it will save huge_amounts of curation time by pointing curators to the data that matter third it provides a qualitycontrol check on the go that is unbiased by the vagaries of publication policies as it is based only on the data themselves furthermore the ability to rapidly generate ontologies from data opens up new possibilities for the use of ontologies in general for example data_driven ontologies generated from diseased and normal samples could be compared this would be a novel way to look at what goes awry in particular disease_states providing the context and perspective of complex interrelated biological_processes such an ontology model may also serve as the basis for an intelligent predictive agent as one of us has described elsewhere despite these possibilities inspired by an initial attempt it remains_an as to how best algorithmically to infer an ontology from molecular data to understand the challenges involved in inferring an ontology from data we first must recognize that ontologies contain both syntactic information terms and their structural relations as well as semantic_information relations between terms have defined meaningsin go these include is a part of and regulates relations both our previous work and this work will focus on inferring the syntactic informationthe ontology_terms their relations and the annotations of genes to terms this syntactic information is the most commonly used information by biologists using go as a gold_standard to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the

permissions_oup com go is structured as a rooted directed_acyclic dag where gene_annotations propagate up the hierarchy from child terms to parent terms through is a and part of relations for example in the biological_process bp branch m phase of mitotic_cell and interphase of mitotic_cell are child terms beneath mitotic_cell since go is a dag any term can have multiple parents and or multiple children allowing for multiple children per term is necessary to capture the biological truth that many molecular machines have more than two subunits or that a bp such as the interphase of cell_cycle can be split into more than two phases g s g multiple parents are necessary to capture the biological principle of pleiotropythe reuse of genes and or subunits or the classification of a bp into multiple higher categories of process e g sulfur amino_acid metabolic process is a child of both cellular amino_acid metabolic process and sulfur compound metabolic process in order to faithfully infer an ontology of genes like go we need an algorithm able to infer a dag in previous work we developed a multistep algorithm for constructing a network extracted ontology nexo which infers a dag structure from data summarized in the form of a molecular_interaction or gene similarity network this algorithm first infers a binary tree using the hac ml algorithm then splits without network support are collapsed creating nodes with more than children finally a post_processing step searches for additional parent_child between existing nodes allowing for a single_node to have multiple parents the nexo algorithm does not use quantitative information about gene interaction or similarity i e it assumes an input network for which the edges are unweighted however typical genome_scale such as gene_expression correlation populate a full matrix of similarity_scores between pairs of genes where all of the information is contained in the weights while thresholding these data is one way to interpret them as unweighted networks this results in information_loss not only below but also above the threshold as hierarchical_structure embedded in the weights is collapsed furthermore when combining multiple types of data as will be undoubtedly required for construction of a complete ontology of gene function it is useful to give greater weight to gene_pairs which have evidence of similarity in multiple datasets since the nexo algorithm is unable to use valuable information contained in the weights of edges in an input network it is instead forced to rely on setting a proper threshold below which all information is ignored and above which relative_weights are lost the essence of the dag inference problem is to detect communities of genes that span a wide_range of sizes scales and can nest hierarchically as well as share arbitrary subsets of members furthermore the algorithm should be able to construct a dag using the information contained in weighted networks and it should be capable of operating on a nearly complete weighted graph with a genome_scale number of nodes thousands and edges millions a number of existing clustering_algorithms address parts of this challenge for example there are many commonly used hierarchical clustering_algorithms which use similarity or distance scores as input and infer a nested hierarchy of clusters these methods however rely on iterative joining of pairs of terms resulting in forced construction of a binary tree clusters cannot overlap i e have multiple parents for a single_node or have children and the number of clusters inferred is fixed at n where n is the number of terminal nodes there have recently been a handful of algorithms which construct hierarchies with overlapping clusters by creating a first level of overlapping clusters with terminal nodes and then combining these base clusters into higher_level clusters these algorithms all present solutions that allow multiple parents and multiple children at the initial level of clusters and some operate on weighted networks however these methods restrict each higher_level cluster to having a single_parent this aspect inherently limits the types of relations that can be discovered by these methods another relevant method has been proposed that hierarchically clusters links in a graph rather than edges this method is quite flexible and allows for each node in the graph to appear in multiple clusters via participation in multiple edges such a method still restricts the types of clusters it creates however first an edge can only participate in a single cluster at each level of the hierarchy although a pair of nodes may incidentally participate in multiple clusters via other edges secondly the hierarchical_clustering of the edges allows only for binary joins between edges and therefore each lower level cluster will be joined with exactly one other cluster at each step this process creates e clusters where e is the number of edges in the input graph while the original paper proposes a method for determining a single optimal cut in the hierarchy for determining clusters how to determine all levels of the hierarchy that are meaningful and not an artifact of construction remains_an the localfitness algorithm which has recently been proposed in the physics community is to our knowledge the only previous approach that constructs a dag from an unweighted or weighted network and has a principled way of determining which clusters are robust this method constructs clusters at a given level in the hierarchy by optimizing a fitness_function for each of many potentially overlapping clusters built out from multiple seed nodes the fitness_function includes a parameter that is tuned to find clusters at multiple levels of the hierarchy graph partitionings that are stable across comparatively wide ranges of this parameter are used here we present a basic formulation of the ontology inference problem followed by a description of a new method called clique extracted ontology clixo for ontology inference based on progressive identification of maximal cliques we evaluate clixo in comparison with localfitness as well as several other methods such as the nexo algorithm and standard clustering methods are evaluated based on their ability to reconstruct the go from two starting datasets a pairwise semantic similarities which are derived directly from go itself and b three different omics_datasets genetic_interaction profile correlation gene_expression correlation and an integrated omics dataset for yeast here we have explored the requirements for inferring an ontology from a similarity matrix and available methods for doing so as well as proposed a new method clixo we found that clixo outperforms other methods when a reliable similarity matrix is available when using omics_data we found that clixo outperforms other methods on two of three datasets tested and ties the nexo algorithm on the third where both were able to successfully infer an ontology similar to go bp furthermore clixo proved significantly more stable than nexo to changes in parameters this study provides the algorithmic foundation for building gene ontologies by capturing hierarchical and pleiotropic structure embedded in biomolecular data
