mdcc tools characterizing multi_modal atomic motions in molecular_dynamics trajectories we previously_reported the multi_modal dynamic cross_correlation mdcc method for analyzing molecular_dynamics trajectories this method quantifies the correlation_coefficients of atomic motions with complex multi_modal behaviors by using a bayesian based pattern_recognition technique that can effectively capture transiently formed unstable interactions here we present an open_source toolkit for performing the mdcc analysis including pattern recognitions complex network_analyses and visualizations we include a tutorial document that thoroughly explains how to apply this toolkit for an analysis using the example trajectory of the ns simulation of an engineered endothelin peptide dimer availability_and the source_code is available for free atmolecular dynamics md_simulations are a promising method to investigate the dynamical behaviors of various molecular_systems with atomic details although recent_advances in the computer technologies have realized the long_term simulations of large systems the huge amount of trajectory data thus generated is not easily interpreted in order to tackle this problem analyses toolkits have been extensively developed such as mdanalysis wordom and vmd long_term trajectories reflect complex behaviors of the local and global conformational changes of molecules the distributions of atomic_coordinates may be unimodal i e adequately described by a cluster that is approximated by a single mean and standard_deviation or multi_modal with several spatially distinct clusters often slowly interchanging with relatively rapid fluctuations within each cluster for example a common multi_modal local_motion in proteins results from the rearrangements of hydrogen_bonds associated with transient flipping of side_chains the analysis of multi_modal motions which are not each describable by a single gaussian_distribution is not straightforward we previously_proposed a new analysis method named multimodal dynamic cross_correlation mdcc as a variant of the conventional dynamic cross_correlation dcc method because dcc calculates the correlations between atomic motions based on deviations from the averaged coordinate of each atom it does not make sense when atoms undergo multi_modal motions to characterize such multimodal motions the mdcc method takes_advantage of a bayesian statistics based pattern_recognition technique and classifies the distributions of atomic_coordinates into some clusters or modes we applied this method to analyze transcription factordna interactions and found that many transient multi_modal interactions are formed at interfaces between proteins and dna see supplementary_materials s and s for details of the method here we present an open_source easy to use toolkit for the mdcc method this toolkit performs the full analysis techniques applied in our previous work and not only covers the correlative coefficients of multi_modal atomic motions but also enables visualization of the results effectively as a heatmap and a complex network diagram powered by standard_software v c the author published_by
