homology driven assembly of non redundant protein sequence_sets nomess for mass_spectrometry to enable mass_spectrometry ms based proteomic_studies with poorly_characterized organisms we developed a computational workflow for the homology driven assembly of a non redundant reference sequence_dataset in the automated pipeline translated dna_sequences e g ests rna deep sequencing_data are aligned to those of a closely_related and fully_sequenced organism representative sequences are derived from each cluster and joined resulting in a non redundant reference_set representing the maximal available amino_acid sequence_information for each protein we here applied nomess to assemble a reference_database for the widely used model_organism xenopus_laevis and demonstrate its use in proteomic applications availability_and nomess is written in c the source_code as well as the executables can be downloaded from http www biochem mpg de cox execution of nomess requires blastp and cd_hit in addition within the shotgun_proteomics workflow identification and quantification of proteins relies on comprehensive databases which are used to calculate theoretical peptide spectra that can be searched against the experimentally_determined ms_ms therefore the database should ideally represent the amino_acid of all the expressed proteins of the biological system this information can be deduced from the sequencing of expressed_sequence ests as well as from rna deep sequencing_experiments these short_reads are assembled into larger contigs using genomic sequence_information of the same organism as a scaffold however for many organisms an accurately assembled genomic_sequence is still lacking leaving investigators with large and redundant sequence repositories that are impractical and of limited use for proteomic_studies to overcome_these we developed nomess an automated pipeline for the assembly of available sequence_information e g ests contigs rnaseq exome_sequencing etc into a non redundant reference dataset based on homology to a closely_related as a test_organism we chose xenopus_laevis which represents a widely used model_organism for developmental and cell_cycle studies because x laevis underwent allotetraploidization sequencing_efforts have been focused predominantly on its diploid cousin x tropicalis whose complete_genome was published in however many experiments can only be carried_out with x laevis due to its larger_size and the availability of species specific reagents using x tropicalis as a scaffold nomess was able to consolidate sequence_information from various repositories e g xenbase uniprot tigr into a single non redundant fasta file containing about protein_sequences which in most cases cover the entire open_reading of the corresponding x tropicalis homolog
