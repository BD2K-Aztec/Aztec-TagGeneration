phy mer a novel alignment_free and reference independent mitochondrial haplogroup classifier motivation all current mitochondrial haplogroup classification tools require variants to be detected from an alignment with the reference_sequence and to be properly named according to the canonical nomenclature standards for describing mitochondrial variants before they can be compared with the haplogroup determining polymorphisms with the emergence of high_throughput and hence greater availability of mitochondrial genome_sequences there is a strong need for an automated haplogroup classification_tool that is alignment_free and agnostic to reference_sequence results we have developed a novel mitochondrial_genome haplogroup defining algorithm using a k_mer approach namely phy mer phy mer performs equally well as the leading haplogroup clas sifier haplogrep while avoiding the errors that may occur when preparing variants to required formats and notations we have further expanded phy mer functionality such that next_generation data can be used directly as input human mitochondrial_dna mtdna sequences can be divided_into distinct lineages known as haplogroups which are important for population_genetics and disease studies conventional mtdna haplogroup assignment involves alignment of the mtdna sequence to a reference_sequence and then matching the list of variants with the best fitting haplogroup in a phylogenetic classification tree mostly phylotree http www phylotree org van existing software_tools include mitotool haplogrep emma h mito http sourceforge net_projects h mito mthap http dna jameslick com mthap haplofind vianello and mtoolbox most of these tools except mtoolbox require a list of mtdna variants properly denoted according to different conventions in use moreover there are currently two mitochondrial reference_sequences in use the traditional revised cambridge reference_sequence genbank nc and the recently created reconstructed sapiens reference_sequence the same variant may be named differently depending on the reference_sequence used as a result haplogroup classification remains cumbersome and error_prone given the need to simplify this process we developed an alignment_free and reference independent algorithm that encompasses the entire_process from sequence input to haplogroup output without requiring additional efforts from the end_user phy mer is a novel algorithm in that it avoids the alignment and variant_calling step unlike all other haplogroup classifiers yet performs equally well with a single command as the leading haplogroup classifiers phy mers k_mer library can be easily updated when there is a new release of phylotree since it is implemented as a python_package with few dependencies phy mer is platform independent it can be run like a unix command offered as a web_service or incorporated into any ngs analysis_pipeline we anticipate wide applicability of phy mer given the ever increasing adoption of ngs_technologies in both research and clinical care_settings
