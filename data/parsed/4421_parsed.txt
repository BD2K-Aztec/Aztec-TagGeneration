statistically identifying tumor_suppressors and oncogenes from pan cancer genome sequencing_data several tools exist to identify cancer_driver based on somatic_mutation data however these tools do not account for subclasses of cancer_genes oncogenes which undergo gain of function events and tumor_suppressor tsgs which undergo loss of function a method which accounts for these subclasses could improve performance while also suggesting a mechanism of action for new putative cancer_genes results we develop a panel of five complementary statistical_tests and assess their performance against a curated set of hiconf cancer_genes using a pan cancer dataset of million mutations we identify patient bias as a novel signal for cancer gene_discovery and use it to significantly improve detection of oncogenes over existing_methods auroc additionally our test of truncation event rate separates oncogenes and tsgs from one another auroc finally a random_forest integrating the five tests further improves_performance and identifies new cancer_genes including cacng hdac hist h e nxf gps and hla_drb since the first cancer genome was sequenced in large_scale studies surveying multiple tumor_types have been released by sequencing paired_tumor exomes and genomes these studies generate catalogs of tumor specific mutations such as single_nucleotide and small insertions_deletions indels mutation data can be used to detect evidence of positive_selection and new potential cancer_genes defined here as genes that exert a pro tumor influence as either oncogenes or tumor_suppressors genes tsgs however tumor mutation_rates vary by several orders_of increasing from acute_myeloid to melanoma particularly in tumors with high_mutation it is likely that most mutations occur incidentally to tumor development therefore mutations and genes must be experimentally_characterized to identify biologically_relevant mutations however due to thenumber of background mutations these experiments pose a high_risk low reward opportunity in general only genes with strikingly nonrandom mutation_patterns or new mutations in known cancer_genes prompt further investigation computational solutions can alleviate this problem by directing investigators to genes that are more likely to be cancer causing existing_methods detect several signals of cancer gene positive_selection including mutation_rate functional impact scores gonzalez intra gene_mutation clustering and recurrence post_translational or dna lesion likelihood earlier work also demonstrated the importance of patient specific mutation_rates in detecting cancer_genes furthermore integrating these complementary approaches can lead to improved_performance one shortcoming of these methods is that they identify cancer_genes but cannot separate likely oncogenes_and oncogenes are of particular interest to biologists as they can provide a direct target for small_molecule however recent_studies show that tumor_suppressors and oncogenes are separable using rates of truncating_mutations mutation clustering and copynumber data see supplementaryfor representative examples it is possible that an ensemble_method that treats oncogenes and tsgs as separate classes would improve performance over existing_methods in addition to suggesting whether new putative cancer_genes operate through gain of function oncogene or loss of function tsg in this study we use a pan cancer dataset of million mutations and manually_curated set of high_confidence hiconf cancer_genes to develop a panel of five statistical_tests the tests detect different signals of positive_selection and are designed to detect putative oncogenes and tsgs in particular we identify patient and cancer type bias as new cancer gene signals and leverage them to markedly_improve detection of oncogenes we then integrate these tests into a random_forest which can simultaneously identify new putative cancer_genes and classify them as likely oncogenes_and we validate by assessing the performance of previous tools and our new methods against several independent panels of known and putative cancer_genes finally we explore the performance of these methods in specific cancer_types and suggest new putative cancer_genes one use of cancer_genome results is the identification of novel cancer_genes this problem has two stages first cancer_genes must be separated from genes bearing only passenger_mutations second cancer_genes must be sorted into likely tumor_suppressors and oncogenes both stages are crucial because mechanism specific predictions are needed to guide downstream_analyses and experiments in this study we gathered a pan cancer dataset of million variants and a manually_curated set of known cancer_genes hiconf panel using these data we designed and assessed a panel of statistical_tests which identify cancer_genes using several signals of positive_selection as well as separate cancer_genes by mechanism of action we also compared the performance of these tests to previous tools in accomplishing these tasks in general we found that hiconf tsgs were easier to detect than hiconf oncogenes several methods had aurocs of or higher including the published tool oncodrive fm and our tests of patient and cancer type bias patient distribution cancer type distribution however the best single method for detecting tsgs was our test of functional impact bias vest mean with an auroc of in contrast hiconf oncogenes were less easily_identified this is concerning because oncogenes provide more direct_targets for drug_development the best performing existing tool for detecting the hiconf oncogenes was oncodriveclust with an auroc of with the exception of truncation rate all of the tests in our panel had aurocs of or greater when detecting hiconf oncogenes particular improvement was observed with unaffected residues which tests for mutation clustering recurrence and had an auroc of and patient distribution which was the best performer with an auroc of two of our tests warrant emphasis patient distribution uses a novel signal of positive_selection it identifies genes with mutations that occur in nonrandom sets of patients particularly genes with mutations that occur in relatively hypo mutated tumors as would be anticipated of genes bearing driver_mutations for identifying the hiconf panel as a whole tsg onc patient distribution is the strongest performer with auroc of another important member of our statistical panel is truncation rate this test is a formalized version of the rule for tsgs put forward by and uses the binomial_distribution to model the expected number of truncation events per gene truncation rate can be used to separate tsgs and oncogenes with an auroc of it is the only method that usefully accomplished this task because the individual_tests of our panel offered complementary strengths we also integrated them into a single model we found that a random_forest built on our five tests rf was effective at separating hiconf oncogenes and tsgs from passenger genes and from one another moreover this integration did not require any loss in performance rf is as good as or better than the individual methods at every classification tasks we assessed we also confirmed these results in several independent_validation gene panels rf identifies many potential pan cancer cancer_genes these include the predicted oncogenes cacng and hist h e and the predicted tsgs hdac gps nxf and hla_drb it also identifies several known cancer_genes through genome_sequencing for the first time including sgk tmem a chd chd and rbm many rf predictions are potentially druggable furthermore additional cancer_genes can be identified when focusing on single cancer_types in fact we found that half of rf predictions within tumor_types were cancer specific these results illustrate the importance of searching for cancer_genes in both the pan cancer and specific cancer settings and suggest many new potential_avenues of research however there remains room for improvement asillustrates some oncogenes and tsgs could not be detected by rf and some were not detectable by any individual test or pre_existing tool supplementary there are two major explanations foremost cancer_genes will be undetectable if they are primarily altered through means other than somatic_mutations in the exome additionally our cancer gene panels may include genes that are involved in later stages of disease_progression such as metastasis and drug_resistance these are true cancer_genes but may be undetectable in the available data as tumor_samples largely come from newly_diagnosed patients fortunately our methods are highly expandable and multiple strategies could improve performance such as i introduction of additional heterogeneous data types ii improved tests iii improved model design and training iv expansion of the hiconf cancer gene_panel
