databases_and mamphea a web_tool for mammalian phenotype enrichment_analysis mamphea is a web_application dedicated to understanding functional properties of mammalian gene_sets based on mouse_mutant phenotypes it allows users to conduct enrichment_analysis on predefined or user_defined phenotypes gives users the option to specify phenotypes derived from null_mutations produces easily comprehensible results and supports analyses on genes of all mammalian_species with a fully sequenced_genome availability http evol nhri org tw mamphea contact to biologically interpret gene_lists generated from high_throughput studies enrichment_analyses on annotations of gene features such as terms of gene_ontology go http www geneontology org have become routine in genomic_research numerous enrichment tools have been developed in the past_few see review by the implementation of novel statistics has provided new tools to deal with gene_sets of special property e g gene_set gsea for genes with an ordered_structure however the power of enrichment_analyses still relies largely on the biological nature of backend annotations used for finding enrichment most mouse mus_musculus mutants generated in laboratories have been designed to aid the study of human_genetics physiology or diseases progression according to the current version of mouse_genome informatics mgi http www informatics jax org nearly genes in the mouse_genome have been mutated and phenotyped in the way that closely_resembles human clinical_examinations the mutant phenotypes characterize the consequence of disturbing or disrupting the information output of a gene and thus are ideal to aid understanding of how genes function at the systems level these unique attributes make the enrichment_analyses incorporating mouse_mutant phenotypes outperform those using go or kegg_pathways http www genome jp kegg the two most widely used backend databases in enrichment_analyses in human disease candidate_gene to whom correspondence should be addressed and in work to understand genetic_bases of neurological_disorders these cases clearly suggest a pressing need for a versatile enrichment tool from the aspect of mutant phenotypes in studying mammalian biology we have therefore developed mamphea mammalian phenotype enrichment_analysis in comparison to toppgene the only other enrichment tool employing mouse phenotypes mamphea has several unique features first mamphea allows users to perform enrichment_analysis not only on phenotypes predefined by mgi but also on user_defined phenotypes to study complex_traits second different types of mutations impact protein functions distinctly to remove potential_biases caused by the use of data derived from differential mutagenesis approaches mamphea allows users to perform analysis of phenotypes exclusively derived from loss_of third in order to give users easily understood results mamphea generates graphical and downloadable output displaying the enriched or depleted phenotypes according to the hierarchical_structure of the phenotypic classification and finally mamphea supports analyses of genes of all mammalian_species with a fully sequenced_genome to date
