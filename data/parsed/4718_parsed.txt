genome_analysis track data hubs enable visualization of user_defined genome_wide annotations on the ucsc_genome track data hubs provide an efficient mechanism for visualizing remotely hosted internet accessible collections of genome_annotations hub datasets can be organized configured and fully integrated into the university of california santa_cruz ucsc_genome and accessed through the familiar browser interface for the first time individuals can use the complete browser feature_set to view custom datasets without the overhead of setting up and maintaining a mirror availability_and source_code for the bigwig bigbed and genome_browser software is freely_available use at http hgdownload cse ucsc edu admin jksrc zip implemented in c and supported on linux binaries for the bigwig and bigbed creation and parsing utilities may be downloaded atthe widespread use of high_throughput has challenged the capabilities of genomic_data visualization_tools as the volume and size of genome_wide datasets outpace the capacity of existing browsing technology in response the university of california santa_cruz ucsc has repeatedly extended its popular genome browsing tool the ucsc_genome to offer increased visualization of remotely hosted large_datasets in recent_years ucsc added browser support for four compressed binary indexed data_formats bigbed and bigwig both developed at ucsc binary alignment map bam and variant_call vcf tabix this allowed individuals to quickly and efficiently view and share genome_wide data hosted on their own local servers using the browsers well established custom track mechanism however the limited configuration and organization options imposed by custom tracks presented a barrier to full integration of large_datasets into the browser leading many research groups to set up mirrors to visualize their tracks in a full local instance of the browser mirrors pose their own drawbacks they tend to have limited visibility and distribution within the research_community and incur a local maintenance overhead to circumvent these limitations ucsc has introduced support for track data hubs internet accessible collections of genome_annotations that can be viewed on the ucsc_genome alongside native annotation tracks track data hubs provide the power and flexibility to organize configure and fully integrate one or more large_datasets into the browser and allow efficient worldwide access to the data through the familiar genome_browser interface individuals experienced in setting up genome_browser mirrors will find that setting up a track data hub is much easier depending on the number and complexity of the datasets a track data hub typically can be set up in a day or two like the distributed annotation system das track data hubs provide access to annotation over the internet but they differ in that the server hosting a track data hub requires only http access instead of a dedicated das server in contrast to the extensible mark up language format of das which may be easier for a simple application to access track data hubs present data in the native format of the data_files with a rich set of options for controlling how that data should displayed although this requires more complicated logic on the client end to parse and display it offers the data contributor more options for configuring and presenting the data track data hub annotations are stored at the remote site as compressed binary indexed files when a hub track is displayed in the genome_browser only the relevant data needed to support the view of the current genomic_region are transmitted to ucsc rather than the entire file the transmitted data are cached on a ucsc server to expedite future access this on demand transfer_mechanism eliminates the need to transmit large_datasets across the internet thereby minimizing upload time into the browser hub tracks are displayed in a separate track group below the browser image and can be configured and manipulated in the same fashion as native tracks they can be incorporated into to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work browser sessions and custom tracks in the same manner as other tracks and the underlying data can be viewed manipulated and downloaded using the ucsc table browser
