data_and large_scale extraction of brain_connectivity from the neuroscientific literature motivation in neuroscience as in many other scientific domains the primary form of knowledge dissemination is through published_articles one challenge for modern neuroinformatics is finding methods to make the knowledge from the tremendous backlog of publications accessible for search analysis and the integration of such data into computational_models a key example of this is metascale brain_connectivity where results are not reported in a normalized repository instead these experimental_results are published in natural_language scattered among individual scientific_publications this lack of normalization and centralization hinders the large_scale integration of brain_connectivity results in this article we present text_mining models to extract and aggregate brain_connectivity results from million pubmed_abstracts and full text publications related to neuroscience the brain_regions are identified with three different named entity recog nizers ners and then normalized against two atlases the allen brain atlas aba and the atlas from the brain architecture management system bams we then use three different extractors to assess inter region connectivity results ners and connectivity extractors are evaluated against a manually_annotated corpus the complete in litero extraction models are also evaluated against in vivo connectivity data from aba with an estimated precision of the resulting database contains over million brain_region mentions and over aba and bams potential brain_region connections this database drastically accelerates connectivity literature_review by providing a centralized repository of connectivity data to neuroscientists availability_and the resulting models are publicly_available at github com bluebrain bluima accessing the vast_amounts of data and knowledge embedded in the previous decades of neuroscience publications is essential for modern neuroinformatics making these data and knowledge accessible can help scientists maintain a state of the field perspective and improve_efficiency of the neuroscientific process by reducing repeated experiments and identifying priorities for new experiments efforts to build models of neural_circuitry must integrate such data into the model_building process to benefit from the data of many years of prior research in the case of metascale brain_region connectivity thousands of experiments have been published in scientific_journals however these have not been systematically normalized andwe demonstrate that an exploitable brain_region connectivity database can be extracted from a very large amount of scientific_articles our models extract large_amounts of connectivity data from unstructured text and compare favorably against in vivo connectivity data they provide a helpful tool for neuroscientists to facilitate the search and aggregation of brain_connectivity data our work builds on top of and french and pavlidis and extends it in several aspects our connectivity extraction model uses a combination of three different extractors including a novel rule_based extractor that achieves state of the art precision models were applied to a comprehensive corpus of over billion words consisting of all available pubmed_abstracts and a very large number of full_text related to neuroscience new model features and extraction filters were added to improve robustness on full text extraction connectivity results are presented to neuroscientist in an interface to rapidly search and evaluate connectivity results we highlight the fact that the presented models are not meant to replace manual and individual evaluation of the connectivity between two brain_regions the objective is to speed up this evaluation and complement in vivo or manually_curated connectivity data we assume that the extracted connectivity data will be reviewed and validated before being included in further analysis or models manual_review is also mandatory since connection extractors have a very limited capacity to differentiate between hypothesized or contradictory connections connections referred from another article or connections supported by experimental_data therefore the efficient representation of connectivity data is important so that domain_experts can rapidly evaluate it a drawback of manual_search as it is most commonly performed for literature_search is the inability to provide feedback on search results more that million manual_searches are performed daily on the pubmed web_site www nlm nih gov services pubmed searches html yet a manual_search performed by a researcher will neither improve future searches nor contribute to the building and curation of a structured knowledge_base in contrast our database interface allows researcher to rate search results collaborative filtering once enough feedback data are collected the models can be retrained to achieve even higher performance this study highlights the differences in complexity and performance between machine_learning and rule based_approaches the former delivers superior_performance but requires a significantly more complex setup in particular in terms of knowledge required model and feature_selection and time for corpus annotation and model training on the other hand rule based_approaches are much simpler and require less time to develop they are also less tightly comparison of the inter region connectivity matrices renormalized between white and blue rows and columns correspond to aba brain_regions left connection matrix from ambca ipsilateral using abas inter region connectivity model with values representing a combination of connection strength and statistical confidence see middle same matrix from ambca but symmetrized connection directionality is ignored since the nlp models do not extract directionality right connection matrix from the results extracted from the literature lit with values representing the number of extracted connectivity statements weighted by the estimated precision of each connectivity extractor bound to the domain they are applied to for example the filters extractor section could be applied to relationship extraction between other entities like neurons or proteins without significant modification however the performance of rule based_approaches is significantly_lower especially in terms of recall in the future we plan to extend the developed rule_based extractors with a large_scale data_driven strategy we also plan to apply the presented models to support the selection of relevant seed regions when performing magnetic_resonance imaging_experiments
