parties a toolbox for paramecium interspersed dna elimination studies motivation developmental dna elimination occurs in a wide_variety of multicellular_organisms but ciliates are the only single celled eukaryotes in which this phenomenon has been reported despite considerable interest in ciliates as models for dna elimination no standard methods for identification and characterization of the eliminated sequences are currently available results we present the paramecium toolbox for interspersed dna elimination studies parties designed for paramecium species that i identifies eliminated sequences ii measures their presence in a sequencing sample and iii detects rare elimination polymorphisms programmed dna elimination during somatic development is widely_distributed in animal_species first discovered by boveri in ascaris worms in the th century the phenomenon has to date been characterized in multiple species of nematodes insects arachnids crustaceans lampreys fish birds and mammals and can involve the programmed reduction of up to of the genome review ciliates the only unicells that undergo somatic dna elimination resemble animals in that they make a germ soma distinction one or more diploid germ_line nuclei and a polyploid somatic nucleus coexist in a unique cytoplasm only the somatic nucleus is transcriptionally_active during vegetative_growth as in metazoans somatic dna elimination in ciliates can silence transposable_elements and cellular genes regulate gene_dosage and determine mating_type among ciliates paramecium is an outstanding model to study dna elimination sexual processes are readily controlled under laboratory conditions and a third of the germ_line genome is lost through two types of reproducible programmed deletions i repeated_sequences are heterogeneously eliminated leading to chromosome fragmentation ii single_copy elements called internal eliminated sequences iess are precisely excised somatic dna is also endoreplicated to reach haploid copies as the iess in the paramecium tetraurelia genome interrupt non coding and coding_sequences their elimination is essential to reconstitute open_reading orfs both types of dna elimination depend on a piggybac domesticated transposase named piggymac which may be guided by short_rna driven epigenetic signals cost decrease in high_throughput hts is allowing researchers to produce massive genome_wide data to study dna elimination but specific bioinformatic_methods are still lacking here we describe parties paramecium toolbox for ies interspersed dna elimination studies with illumina dna_seq paired_end and a somatic reference_genome as input parties performs ies identification quantitates their presence in the sample and detects rare excision polymorphisms benchmarks are provided in supplementary_materials we benchmarked parties using real and simulated_data with the p tetraurelia mb somatic reference_genome and ies reference_set the results are presented in supplementary_materials and can be used to plan optimal cost_effective sequencing_experiments we found the minimal requirement for high_sensitivity ies identification and excision quantification is sequencing of a short insert library of nt paired_end provided the sequencing sample contains at least germ_line dna the parties package is expected to set the standard for quantitative analysis of paramecium genomes and dna elimination conflict of interest none declared
