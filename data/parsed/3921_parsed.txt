genome_analysis real_time metagenomics using k_mers to annotate metagenomes annotation of metagenomes involves comparing the individual sequence_reads with a database of known sequences and assigning a unique function to each read this is a time consuming task that is computationally_intensive though not computationally complex here we present a novel approach to annotate metagenomes using unique k_mer oligopeptide sequences from to amino_acids we demonstrate that k_mer based annotations are faster and approach the sensitivity and precision of blastx based annotations without loosing accuracy a last common_ancestor approach was also developed to describe the members of the community availability_and this open_source application was implemented in perl and can be accessed via a user_friendly website at http edwards sdsu edu rtmg in addition code to access the annotation servers is available for download from http www theseed org figfams and k_mers are available for download from ftp ftp theseed org figfams metagenomics has revolutionized microbial_ecology the extraction purification and sequencing steps have been trivialized by next_generation approaches and environmental_samples are routinely_processed from collection to dna_sequence in a matter of days the bottleneck in metagenomics approaches has become the analysis of the sequences the computational comparison of sequences against all of the known proteins using blastx is limited by computational_resources here we describe a novel approach to analysing metagenomic_sequences using unique signature k_mers that represent members of a protein_family limited additional computational_resources are required when the size of the underlying database doubles as in the best case the search is dependent on the length of the k_mer we implemented an api and web_servers to support the annotation of metagenomes using k_mers
