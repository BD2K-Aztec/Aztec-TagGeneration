systems_biology density parameter_estimation for finding clusters of homologous_proteins tracing actinobacterial pathogenicity lifestyles motivation homology detection is a long_standing challenge in computational_biology to tackle this problem typically all versus all blast results are coupled with data partitioning approaches resulting in clusters of putative homologous_proteins one of the main problems however has been widely neglected all clustering tools need a density parameter that adjusts the number and size of the clusters this parameter is crucial but hard to estimate without gold_standard data at hand developing a gold_standard however is a difficult and time consuming task having a reliable method for detecting clusters of homologous_proteins between a huge set of species would open opportunities for better understanding the genetic repertoire of bacteria with different lifestyles results our main contribution is a method for identifying a suitable and robust density parameter for protein_homology without a given gold_standard therefore we study the core_genome of actinobacteria this allows us to incorporate background_knowledge i e the assumption that a set of evolutionarily closely_related should share a comparably high number of evolutionarily_conserved proteins emerging from phylum specific housekeeping_genes we apply our strategy to find genes proteins that are specific for certain actinobacterial lifestyles i e different types of pathogenicity the whole study was performed with transitivity clustering as it only requires a single intuitive density parameter and has been shown to be well applicable for the task of protein sequence_clustering note however that the presented strategy generally does not depend on our clustering method but can easily be adapted to other clustering_approaches availability all results are publicly_available atfinding clusters of homologous_proteins i e clusters containing only paralogous and orthologous_proteins is a long_standing bioinformatics challenge in the post genome era searching the exact phrase homology detection with pubmed leads to hits the group of peer bork published one of the first review_articles on predicting functions from protein_sequences as early as the availability of next_generation provided us with almost whole genome_sequences scattered over all domains of life the annotation of the emerging sequences is difficult error_prone and impossible to perform in the wet laboratory for each gene protein of each organism individually without appropriate bioinformatics software to date we have more than million bacterial sequenced genes available for download from the national_center ncbi_database the usual starting_point is a pairwise similarity matrix given by local_alignment tools such as basic_local blast that assigns each pair of proteins a similarity value afterwards we pipe this data into clustering tools i e computational_methods for partitioning data_objects into groups such that the objects share_common traits which have been measured with the similarity function over the past_years many tools have been developed for this purpose outline further biological application areas for protein_homology the following tools have proven useful and their accuracy is well studied k means affinity propagation markov_clustering and force as well as transitivity clustering tc although most research concentrated on developing new more sophisticated data partitioning methods one of the major problems has been widely neglected all clustering tools need a set of density parameter s that adjust the number and the size of the clusters a clustering tool cannot know a priori if we seek to find protein_families restrictive parameters or protein superfamilies weak parameters for instance although these parameters are crucial they are hard to estimate without gold_standard data at to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com hand furthermore it is difficult and time consuming to define a good gold_standard which consequently limits us to a small number of proteins from a limited number of organisms clusters of homologous_proteins across a number of organisms allow for studying lifestyle specific genetic repertoires i e the genes that have homologous counterparts in all organisms or in a specific set of organisms such studies can lead for instance to the discovery of mutual proteins shared only among pathogenic strains of a certain phyla thus suggesting new drug_targets and wet laboratory candidates for vaccine_design the quality of such studies is highly dependent on the quality of the clustering process and consequently dependent on the choice of the clustering method and a good estimate of the density parameter s in this study we present a robust method for selecting a suitable density parameter for tc for the task of protein_homology tc is a clustering method that has been shown to perform well when trying to identify protein_families and protein superfamilies based on sequence_similarity using all protein_sequences from actinobacteria we build our method upon two assumptions i clusters of size equal to the number of input organisms here are likely to contain housekeeping_genes and thus should be over represented and clusters greater than the number of input organisms are more likely to contain many false_positives non homologous_genes maximizing i while minimizing ii allows us to estimate a meaningful threshold for discovering clusters of homologous_proteins without manually_curated gold_standard associations for any of the proteins given this threshold we compute and analyze the core_genome of the actinobacteria we further divide them into four different groups of pathogenicity non pathogens nps human_pathogens hps animal pathogens aps and opportunistic_pathogens ops supplementary we then study the class specific genetic repertoire of the actinobacteria the phylum actinobacteria is one of the biggest clades of bacteria their members show a high_diversity throughout different lifestyles and can cope with a variety of different habitats many of these bacteria are important for biotechnological production processes as well as human and animal medicine here we focus on selected species of the following so_called cmnr group corynebacteria mycobacteria nocardia and rhodococcus our main motivation for this study and our main focus of attention are the corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis it causes caseous lymphadenitis in animals with dramatic effects on livestock all over the world all cmnr organisms selected for this study share_common properties with impact on the design of effective vaccinations they all share a common cell_wall organization for instance for vaccine_design accurate homology_information about the protein space in this group is important e g for reducing drug_target side_effects and negative effects on the other microorganisms that are part of the hosts microbiome there have been several studies about the actinobacterial evolution refer to most of them concentrated on phylogenetic_tree solely based on the dna sequence_information of the s rna despite the many advantages of this method it cannot provide insights into the evolutionary_relationship on a species level gao and gupta b used only a limited dataset of only a few genes that were expected to be conserved along the phylum for phylogenetic_tree in several recent_studies best bidirectional hits from genome_wide all versus all blast results of all genes were used for homology detectionor this strategy however neglects the impact of careful blast cutoff evaluation as well as the effect of transitive dependencies in the similarity function gene a may be similar to gene b which is similar to gene c but gene c is not similar to gene a these problem instances can be repaired with clustering tools such as tc however the problem of finding a reasonable density parameter remains with tc as well as with any other clustering method in the following section we briefly describe the actinobacterial dataset used afterwards we give a short introduction to tc followed by our main contribution a robust method for estimating a meaningful similarity threshold tcs density parameter we will describe how we study the robustness of our approach we further support our strategy by computing a revised phylogenetic_tree based on the whole genetic repertoire of the actinobacteria we will discuss our results and present core genomes specific to the four aforementioned pathogenicity classes to sum up we studied the actinobacterial genetic repertoire with respect to four pathogenicity lifestyles we used blast and tc for this purpose here our main novel contribution was the estimation of a robust similarity threshold for tc therefore we set the density such that we balance the size of the core_genome number of clusters with exactly genes proteins putative true_positives and the number of unreasonably larger clusters putative false_positives based on the cluster size_distribution we studied the robustness of our method by using random_sampling and achieve stable and reasonable core genomes for similarity thresholds between and we receive similar results for the exclusive repertoire of the corynebacteria and mycobacteria respectively in conclusion our results suggest that we may use the intrinsic information contained in the cluster size_distribution at least in the phylum actinobacteria to deduce a reasonable density parameter for robust and accurate protein agreement with the oma homology detection tool depicted is the development of the f measure as a function of the clustering threshold the red box marks the pick range derived by using our model q t remarkably the best f measures agreements with oma are achieved for clustering_results with thresholds in pick range that we suggested using our method the red dotted line indicates the threshold these venn diagrams depict the number of shared clusters in each possible intersection of the four different kinds of pathogenicity with at least three proteins for conservative and optimistic see_text these intersections are disjoint for example the intersection of the non pathogenic core_genome and the human pathogenic core_genome does not contain the human pathogenic only clusters the core_genome contains all clusters which contain proteins of all species we marked the np hp ap op only clusters and the core_genome itself with bold font for an intersection of two areas we used italic font homology clustering for future work with bacterial_genomes we suggest using blast e values between optimistic and conservative when using bidirectional blast hits only for homology detection remarkably the same range is also suggested by comparing the agreement of our clustering result with the results from the oma project our method however is limited by the level of biological_diversity among the set of species to be studied as we only use the intrinsic information that is hidden in the dataset we rely on a certain level of homogeneity hence we can expect a reduced accuracy for more diverse sets of genomes here we applied the methods to prokaryotes only to use eukaryotic_genomes some adaptions would be necessary mainly the factor that defines the number_of unrealistically large_clusters must account for the fact that eukaryotes underwent more duplication_events we would suggest the training of this parameter against a small gold_standard
