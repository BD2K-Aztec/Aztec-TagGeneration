automated_detection and tracking of many cells by using d live_cell data motivation automated fluorescence microscopes produce massive_amounts of images observing cells often in four dimensions of space and time this study addresses two tasks of time lapse imaging analyses detection and tracking of the many imaged cells and it is especially intended for d live_cell of neuronal nuclei of caenorhabditis_elegans the cells of interest appear as slightly deformed ellipsoidal forms they are densely_distributed and move rapidly in a series of d images thus existing tracking_methods often fail because more than one tracker will follow the same target or a tracker transits from one to other of different targets during rapid moves results the present method begins by performing the kernel_density in order to convert each d image into a smooth continuous function the cell_bodies in the image are assumed to lie in the regions near the multiple local maxima of the density_function the tasks of detecting and tracking the cells are then addressed with two hill climbing algorithms the positions of the trackers are initialized by applying the cell detection method to an image in the first frame the tracking method keeps attacking them to near the local maxima in each subsequent image to prevent the tracker from following multiple cells we use a markov_random mrf to model the spatial and temporal covariation of the cells and to maximize the image forces and the mrf induced constraint on the trackers the tracking procedure is demonstrated with dynamic d images that each contain neurons of c elegans fluorescence_microscopy imaging of live cells has been a powerful_tool cellular and molecular_dynamics in many applications automated microscopes generate vast numbers of images of the observed cells and the images are often in four dimensions of space and time the cells in these images are densely_distributed move rapidly and are often similar in appearance it is thus impossible in practice to manually track hundreds of such cells as their movement is captured in a sequence of images this has led to growing interest in computational_methods that can automatically detect and track multiple moving cells the appearance of imaged cells can vary from globular to more complicated forms they move independently or sometimes their movement is coordinated cell tracking_methods have been developed for particular cases of interest in general tracking procedures consist of two steps i relevant objects are segmented from the background in each frame by using for example the watershed algorithm and ii each of the segmented objects is then linked to the nearest object in the subsequent frame to reduce the number of failures in the process of matching nearest_neighbors closeness is defined not only on the spatial distance between the objects but also on other available information such as variations in volume morphology intensity and other features the integration of such information is essential when the imaged cells move in a complex manner however in several studies such information is limited or even unavailable for instance when fluorescent cells are much smaller than the optical resolution of microscopes it is difficult to evaluate morphological_features because most objects have similar appearances this is especially true when the objects have inherently similar shapes are closely_spaced and are barely distinguishable from the background in such cases tracking must be done using only the central coordinates of the cells this study tackles the problem of tracking many cells while relying only on the central coordinates the cells of interest appear as slightly deformed ellipsoidal forms in addition they move rapidly in coordination with one another widely used tracking_methods such as nearest matching methods particle filters and graph_based optimization often fail because trackers change from the followed target to a different one turnover or because two or more trackers coalesce on the same target during rapid moves one way to overcome such difficulties is to utilize a spatiotemporal pattern to whom

follow each object individually many such turnovers and coalescences occur in the transition of objects in particular when using nearest_neighbor matching of segmented objects the occurrence of only a few turnovers can trigger a series of many tracking failures however when cells are known to move in a coordinated way and the transition pattern is modeled such errors can be corrected by successful trackers which can return the failed trackers to their correct positions in other words unlike the independent tracking of multiple cells the performance is enhanced by allowing the trackers to interact cooperatively by sharing the direction and distance of the moves the present method aims to improve the tracking_performance by utilizing the spatiotemporal covariation of the moving cells the proposed method relies on the kernel_density kde and several optimization modules it begins by using kde to convert each image to a smooth continuous density_function in d space the cells in the image are assumed to appear as slightly deformed ellipsoidal forms and to lie in the regions around the local maxima of the density functions the tasks of detecting and tracking the cells are addressed by using hill climbing algorithms for the continuous functions for detecting the cells we introduce a new optimization method the repulsive parallel hill climbing rphc algorithm which detects all of the existing local maxima and thus reduces the chances of failing to detect the darker and smaller objects the trackers are initialized at the detected positions in the first frame the tracking algorithm keeps them near the local maxima which change with time to prevent the trackers from turnovers and coalescences we used a markov_random mrf prior to model the spatial and temporal covariation of the moving cells by using the mrf induced cooperation the present method tries to keep the trackers near to the varying local maxima of the density functions by optimizing the image forces under a constraint on the covariation of the objects the present method is an extension of which proposed similar tracking_methods based on the particle filter and mrf priors they aimed to track the movements of several tens of targets interacting with each other this study differs from their works in the prior construction as shown in later in addition this study is conducted for a much larger number of targets e g several hundreds of cells while the motions of targets are more strongly correlated than those considered by the previous_studies the tracking procedure will be demonstrated below with data that we acquired from live_imaging of neuronal nuclei of caenorhabditis_elegans
