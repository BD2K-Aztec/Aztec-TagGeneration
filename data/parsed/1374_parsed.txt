data_and development of a robust classifier for quality_control of reverse_phase protein arrays motivation high_throughput reverse_phase rppa technology allows for the parallel measurement of protein expression levels in approximately samples however the many steps_required in the complex protocol sample lysate preparation slide printing hybridization washing and amplified detection may create substantial variability in data_quality we are not aware of any other quality_control algorithm that is tuned to the special_characteristics of rppas results we have developed a novel classifier for quality_control of rppa experiments using a generalized_linear and logistic function the outcome of the classifier ranging from to is defined as the probability that a slide is of good quality after training we tested the classifier using two independent_validation datasets we conclude that the classifier can distinguish rppa slides of good quality from those of poor_quality sufficiently well such that normalization schemes protein expression_patterns and advanced biological analyses will not be drastically impacted by erroneous measurements or systematic variations availability_and the classifier implemented in the supercurve r package can be freely downloaded at http bioinformatics mdanderson org main oompa overview or http r forge r project org projects supercurve the data used to develop and validate the classifier are available at http bioinformatics mdanderson org moar the majority of known biological effector_molecules diagnostic_markers and pharmaceutical targets are proteins historically investigations have focused on single proteins the ability to profile the expression of multiple proteins has added a major new dimension of information on biological and clinical processes a technology that accomplishes that is reverse_phase rppa rppa offers a powerful_tool for defining more than protein expression_profiles for over a samples simultaneously in an experiment typically an rppa experiment is performed by extracting protein lysates from biological_samples making a series of dilutions of the lysates printing the lysates onto nitrocellulose coated glass_slides hybridizing the samples with primary and enzyme tagged secondary_antibodies then adding a substrate of the enzyme to generate a colorimetric signal the signal_intensities which reflect the abundance of the correspondingproteins in the hybridized samples are then detected and quantified by any number of approaches such as those used by the software microvigene vigenetech inc http www vigenetech com micro vigene htm this software computes the mean net and mean total values of the signals to ensure data validity a positive control derived from the same lysate extract of the mixed cell_lines is repeatedly spotted on each slide each sample and positive control on an rppa slide usually has five dilution steps undiluted and a typical rppa slide contains subgrids and each subgrid has the dilution series of samples and positive controls therefore an rppa slide contains up to spots which can accommodate up to samples and controls a large amount of data can be obtained from a single experiment thus an experiment requires extensive data_handling including quality_control qc rppa technology has been used in a variety of studies such as those involving cellular signaling_pathway activation discovery of biomarkers of treatment response and survival disease classification for diagnostic and prognostic purposes and identification of new drug_targets most studies that have used rppa have concentrated on biological analyses however to our knowledge no study has been published that explores qc for rppa slides it is common for an rppa experiment to result in some slides of poor_quality due to experimental variation that arises even under optimal conditions to avoid poor rppa images and subsequent spurious datawhich may have adverse_impact on normalization lead to wrong conclusions take extra time to process and require extra space to storeit is crucial to exclude slides with poor_quality in the early_stages of data_processing current qc strategies are based on a visual_examination of slide images or correlation_coefficient analysis on a limited number of replicates if there are replicates on a slide however when analysing a large number of slides visual_examination is labor_intensive and time consuming moreover the qc criteria for visual_examination may vary from examiner to examiner which may lead to inconsistent or inaccurate results the alternative correlation_coefficient analysis indicates a predictive relationship between two variables but not reproducibility or reliability in general the development of a qc model consists of defining descriptive categories selecting features and constructing the model the descriptive categories are quality_criteria with predictors being used to measure the criteria in this study each qualitative category corresponds to the nature of an rppa slide in practice biologists are interested in excluding unreliable slides from further analysis by dividing the slides into two categories one category that consists of slides that are excluded from further analysis referred to as slides of poor_quality hereafter and a second category that consists of slides that are used in the actual data analysis referred to as slides of good and fair quality hereafter the classification_problem arises when the categories established for the slides vary from biologist to biologist to tackle that problem we define the quality of an rppa slide using an exhaustive set of quantitative predictors in a generalized_linear glm and a logistic function by which an outcome of a glm calculation is transformed to the probability that the slide is of good quality we demonstrate here the quantitative features model training and model validation of our rppa qc model background intensity and uneven patches an ideal rppa image is one in which sample spots are visualized without background or with an evenly_distributed light background an uneven dark background makes it hard to detect and quantify the true spot intensity background patches with various levels of darkness may cause a biased estimation of the true spot intensity the sources of the background signal can be background staining from the nitrocellulose coating of the glass_slide and contamination from the hybridization and washing procedures varia tion in the positive controls the intensities of positive control spots are expected to be equal because they are technical_replicates a visualized intensity variation among the positive control spots indicates uneven hybridization an uneven background or irreproducible technical_replicates we used cohens kappa test to evaluate the agreement in the slide quality categorization from the different experts for each dataset the experts significantly agreed on their visual categorizations with an average p value of e for cohens kappa p values ranged from e to e to finalize the categorization of the slides we assigned a score to each category was good was fair and was poor averaged the scores from the different experts for each slide and used and as cutoffs a slide with an average_score smaller than or equal to was classified as a poor slide a slide with an average_score between and was a fair slide and a slide with an average_score larger than or equal to was a good slide as a result the training_set had good fair and poor slides one of the validation sets n had good fair and poor slides the other validation_set n contained good fair and poor slides supplementary the process that the experts used to set up the criteria and perform the quality_evaluation was completed prior to and independent from model development in this study we developed a classifier for assessing the quality of rppa slides by using a glm and logistic function the glm is a flexible generalization of ordinary least square regression and the logistic function computes probability which allows for the prediction of a discrete outcome when a cutoff is chosen the glm is more robust than the linear_regression because it allows the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to correlate with its predictive value the classifier calculates the probability that a slide is of good quality to ensure that the classifier operates with a high_level of accuracy we first fitted a glm to all features that were potentially useful in predicting the response variable we then tested the fit of the model after each coefficient was removed from the model during a stepwise_regression process the stepwise_regression ensures that a model still adequately fits the data after variables are eliminated from the model in the iterative process the features left in the model after aic stepwise selection were the slopes and coefficients of variation of the positive control intensities and the drs and an index of the percentage of good spots for the sample intensities the utility of a predictive_model depends on its external_validity that is its ability to maintain accuracy when applied to data from settings that are different than those on which the model was developed the application of our classifier to two independent datasets that were also evaluated by expert visual_examination resulted in discrepancies between the model_prediction and the visual_evaluation a re evaluation of the involved slides by the examiners increased the predictive_accuracy of the classifier the rppa core facility at the university of texas md_anderson has hybridized more than rppa slides each year because the classifier was developed and implemented in the supercurve r package http bioinformatics mdanderson org oompa in it has automated the rppa production line saved a tremendous amount of time for the rppa experts who previously provided visual examinations of slide quality and provided high_quality data without bias to world_wide customers these high_quality rppa data have been applied to characterize and provide outcome predictions for studies of human colon and rectal_cancer cancer_genome network a breast_cancer cancer_genome network b ovarian_cancer endometrial_cancer cancer_genome research network and pan cancers all of the rppa slides fabricated by the rppa core facility are designed with samples that have five dilution steps in order to maximize predictability the classifier was developed based on predictive features obtained from the individual dilution steps therefore the limitation of the classifier is that it is specific to the slide design the current version of the classifier can predict the quality of an rppa slide only if it has five dilution steps however the approaches used to define the classifier could be readily applied to alternative slide designs
