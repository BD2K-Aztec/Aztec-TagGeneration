systems_biology identification of functional cnv region networks using a cnv gene_mapping algorithm in a genome_wide scale motivation identifying_functional relation of copy_number regions cnvrs and gene is an essential process in understanding the impact of genotypic variations on phenotype there have been many related works but only a few attempts were made to normal populations results to analyze the functions of genome_wide cnvrs we applied a novel correlation measure called correlation based on sample set css to paired whole_genome tilepath array and messenger_rna mrna microarray_data from hapmap individuals with normal phenotypes and calculated the confident cnvrgene relationships two cnvr nodes form an edge if they regulate a common set of genes allowing the construction of a global cnvr network we performed functional enrichment on the common genes that were trans regulated from cnvrs clustered together in our cnvr network as a result we observed that most of cnvr clusters in our cnvr network were reported to be involved in some biological_processes or cellular_functions while most cnvr clusters from randomly constructed cnvr networks showed no evidence of functional enrichment those results imply that css is capable of finding related cnvrgene pairs and cnvr networks that have functional significance copy_number cnv is one type of human genomic structural_variation and is recognized as a major source of human genetic_variability occupying a larger proportion of the genome than single_nucleotide specially there have been several studies to find the impact of cnv on gene_expression phenotypes much of the variation in messenger_rna mrna transcript_levels may be compensated for by regulatory_networks but understanding how genetic_variants affect_gene has provided an essential framework and model for elucidating the causes of various types of phenotypic_variation including diseases research investigations on the impact of cnv on phenotypes are generally association studies using various types of gene_expression and genotyped data from specific disease samples versus samples with normal phenotypes proposed an approach to detect variation patterns by integrating gene_expression and copy_number data from breast_cancer samples found that copy_number of cnvr that harbors salivary amylase gene amy is correlated_positively with salivary amylase protein level found cnvgene relationships through analysis on cnv and a set of genes which have similar patterns in breast_cancer samples analyzed the role of cnv in the development of breast_cancer in conjunction with genes in the whole genomic area profiled gastric_cancer cell_lines and found that differentially_expressed are located in the recurrent region of gains_and these results imply that those genes are important gastric cancer_genes generally these studies focus on the abnormal copy_number regions cnvrs in specific disease samples also many of these focus on cnvs that harbor genes the global impact of dna_copy on the transcriptome has not been studied especially for people with normal phenotypes a representative investigation of the impact of cnvs on the phenotypes of normal people in terms of gene_expression was made by who inferred relationships between dna_copy and gene_expression levels of normal phenotyped hapmap samples using a linear_regression however they focused on the genes that lie in or close to cnvrs distance to a cnvr mbp considering that there are many more cnvrs that do not harbor genes detected only a small portion of the relationships between genotype and phenotype recent work byaimed to identify the collaborating cnvs that are responsible for hematopoietic tumorigenesis they first found gains_and that are commonly_detected in the majority of hematopoietic tumor_samples then they constructed gain or loss networks by functional analysis of the genes that were harbored in gain or loss pairs cnvrs in the central part of the gain or loss networks harbored the well studied cancerrelated genes likeand many other studies they also focused on cnvrs that harbor genes or gene regulatory_regions however it is notable that they observed several cnvrs that contributed to the same phenotypic_traits by using the concept of a cnvr network
