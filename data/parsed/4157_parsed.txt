databases_and sdop db a comparative standardized protocol database for mouse phenotypic analyses this article reports the development of sdop db which can provide definite detailed and easy comparison of experimental_protocols used in mouse phenotypic analyses among institutes or laboratories because sdop db is fully compliant with international_standards it can act as a practical foundation for international sharing and integration of mouse phenotypic_information recent_progress in functional_genomics has resulted in an enormous volume of experimental_data in the biomedical_field in this context standardized data_formats to describe laboratory workflows are essential for effective archiving and sharing of experimental_results for example the functional_genomics experiment fuge models the components of an experimental activity that are common across different technologies including protocols samples and data also the ontology for biomedical investigations obis provide an integrated ontology for the description of life_science and clinical_investigations http obiontology org page main page although both the fuge and obi provide general components to describe experimental_protocols there has been little effort to provide domain specific components to directly compare differences between protocols for specific experimental assays for that purpose we have developed a new data format termed standardized description of operating procedures sdops which provides an assay specific descriptive framework and enables direct and detailed comparison of procedural parameters using this data format this work presents a comparative standardized protocol to whom correspondence should be addressed database sdop db http www brc riken jp lab bpmp sdop as a practical_application to share compare and evaluate the contents of protocols to enable data comparisons and analyses in the field of large_scale mouse phenotyping
