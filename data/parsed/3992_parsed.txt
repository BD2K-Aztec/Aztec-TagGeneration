revealing aperiodic aspects of solenoid_proteins from sequence_information motivation repeat proteins which contain multiple repeats of short_sequence form a large but seldom studied group of proteins methods focusing on the analysis of d structures of such proteins identified many subtle_effects in length_distribution of individual motifs that are important for their functions however similar analysis was yet not applied to the vast_majority of repeat proteins with unknown d structures mostly because of the extreme diversity of the underlying motifs and the resulting difficulty to detect those results we developed fait a sequence_based algorithm for the precise assignment of individual repeats in repeat proteins and introduced a framework to classify and compare aperiodicity patterns for large protein_families fait extracts repeat positions by post_processing ffas alignment matrices with image_processing methods on examples of proteins with leucine_rich lrr domains and other solenoids like proteins we show that the automated analysis with fait correctly identifies exact lengths of individual repeats based entirely on sequence_information almost of all plant and animal including human proteins are entirely built from or contain large domains that consist of multiple repeats of short_sequence these repeated motifs typically contain between and amino_acids and cannot form independent structures by themselves a subset of repeat proteins that folds into solenoid like structures have motif lengths typically in the range of amino_acids since all repeats in any given protein are homologous it is often assumed that their lengths would be constant and even if not the small differences in the length of individual motifs are usually treated as noise however when a few available d structures of solenoid_proteins were analyzed it was shown that small length variations of amino_acids between individual motifs can modify structure in subtle but functionally important_ways for instance structures of the leucine_rich lrr family are all known to fold into curved solenoid horseshoe like structures and small motif length variations affect their local curvature and hence the specific shape of the binding_cavity and their binding_specificity this feature of lrr proteins is being explored in in silico design of artificial solenoid like proteins with desired shapes and curvatures the interest in detecting and analyzing repeat proteins grew over the last decade as more functionally_important groups of such proteins were discovered this led to the development of many methods for their recognition and analysis based among others on self alignmentradar hmmshhrepid self comparison approaches based on tiling or predefined databases and fourier_transformation repetita results of such structure analysis now available in dedicated resources such as the repeatdb database as analyzed with raphael however nearly all methods focused on the first step of the analysisdetecting the motifsand not on identifying exact lengths and variations thereof at the same time detecting variations in periodic signals in other fields such as cardiographic signals or intense sunspot activities that oscillate with an approximate period of years but with significant variations created a large repertoire of mathematical frameworks that can be applied to detect length variability in solenoidlike proteins here we present a novel approach_called ffas based aperiodicity detection using image_processing fait for the in detail analysis of solenoid like proteins fait is an adaptation of image_processing to the post_processing the graphic representation of results of the sensitive profileprofile alignment_method ffas developed previously in our group we analyze faits performance comparing fait to annotations from our structure based tool console since no standard benchmark exists that contains information about positions and lengths of individual repeat_units for sufficiently_large sets of proteins finally we use fait to analyze variability of several large_families of solenoid_proteins fait is a novel method developed to analyze variations in length of individual repeats in solenoid like proteins and it is the first method developed specifically to detect it only from sequences it can therefore be used to analyze proteins from newly_sequenced and or large_families that were never structurally_characterized it uses information from the profileprofile alignment scoring_matrix calculated with ffas and extracts subtle variations of individual repeats with image_processing fait was benchmarked against an established structure based method and shown to give results closely correlated with those obtained using structural data this allows it to be used on much larger groups of proteins as d structures of only a very small percentage of all repeat proteins are known hhrepid is probably the sequence_based method with the most similar annotation detail but as nearly all existing_methods it was developed to detect repeat domains and not to specifically provide exact positions of individual_units as fait hence the major difference between existing_methods and fait is the analysis of individual_units not the detection of repetitive domains in sequence using a previously annotated protein as reference in ffas comparison is the key feature of our approach as it allows us to precisely detect individual repeats our results indicate that while varying references for cross family experiments yields valuable results to get the best results possible it is preferable to use a familyspecific reference hence using annotated reference protein seems to be a required step to increase the resolution in analyzing repeat sequences we mainly demonstrate the proof_of of our algorithm on the large lrr protein_family using a previously annotated long and extremely periodic sequence however results on other solenoid like protein_families such as ankyrin and armadillo repeats indicate that the fait procedure can be readily adapted to other protein_families with one previously annotated sequence and known length of repeat motifs in fait we also introduce a novel framework using the a score and aperiodicity profiles to analyze large groups of solenoid like proteins and group them by their variability allowing us to investigate structural and sequence flexibility in more detail than currently possible on the pdbflex org webserver we performed such analysis to visualize aperiodicity in subfamilies of lrrs these results also provided additional validation of our method since we compared clustering according to fait with structure based clustering and showed that they are highly_correlated we are currently conducting a larger study in which we use fait to analyze the evolution of aperiodicity in nlr and tlr families as all of our previous methods fait is currently available as an open_source package and will be extended in a future web_server implementation that automatically distinguishes between multiple solenoid families
