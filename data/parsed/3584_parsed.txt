plantmirnapred efficient classification of real and pseudo plant pre mirnas motivation micrornas mirnas are a set of short nt non_coding that play significant roles as post transcriptional_regulators in animals and plants while some existing_methods use comparative genomic_approaches to identify plant precursor mirnas pre mirnas others are based on the complementarity characteristics between mirnas and their target_mrnas sequences however they can only identify the homologous mirnas or the limited complementary mirnas furthermore since the plant pre mirnas are quite different from the animal pre mirnas all the ab_initio methods for animals cannot be applied to plants therefore it is essential to develop a method based on machine_learning to classify real plant pre mirnas and pseudo genome hairpins results a novel classification_method based on support_vector svm is proposed specifically for predicting plant pre mirnas to make efficient prediction we extract the pseudo hairpin sequences from the protein_coding of arabidopsis_thaliana and glycine_max respectively these pseudo pre mirnas are extracted in this study for the first time a set of informative features are selected to improve the classification_accuracy the training samples are selected according to their distributions in the high_dimensional sample space our classifier plantmirnapred achieves accuracy on the plant datasets from eight plant_species including a thaliana oryza_sativa populus_trichocarpa physcomitrella_patens medicago_truncatula sorghum_bicolor zea_mays and g max the superior_performance of the proposed classifier can be attributed to the extracted plant pseudo pre mirnas the selected training_dataset and the carefully selected_features the ability of plantmirnapred to discern real and pseudo pre mirnas provides a viable method for discovering new non homologous plant pre mirnas availability the web_service of plantmirnapred the training_datasets the testing datasets and the selected_features are freely_available nclab hit edu cn plantmirnapred derived from hairpin precursors pre mirnas mature micrornas mirnas are non_coding that play_important in gene_regulation by targeting mrnas for cleavage or translational_repression mirnas are involved in many important biological_processes including plant development signal_transduction and protein_degradation however systematically detecting mirnas from a genome by experimental_techniques is difficult as an alternative the computational_prediction are used to analyze the genomic_dna and to obtain the putative candidates for experimental_verification since many mirnas are evolutionarily_conserved in multiple species methods that use comparative_genomics to identify putative mirnas have been presented mirfinder predicted the potential mirna of in the arabidopsis_thaliana genome it is based on the conservation of short_sequences between the genomes of arabidopsis and oryza_sativa microharvestor can identify candidate plant mirna homologs for a given query mirna the approach is based on a sequence similarity_search step followed by a set of structural filters the mirnas of vigna unguiculata are identified through homology alignment of highly_conserved mirnas in multiple species although these methods are effective in identifying new conserved mirnas they cannot discover novel mirnas with less homology on the other hand since mirnas in plants often have near perfect matches to their target_mrnas methods that are based on the complementarity characteristics have also been proposed mircheck jones searches for the new mirnas whose target_sites are conserved in a thaliana and o sativa findmirna predicts potential arabidopsis mirnas from candidate pre mirnas that have corresponding target_sites within transcripts in order to decrease the number of mirna candidates the predicted candidates are required to have orthologs in rice mimatcher also predicts the plant mirnas through exploiting the complementarity of plant mirnas however since the candidates that are complementary to target_mrnas are enormous within intergenic_regions and introns rigorous criteria such as conservation among multiple species are introduced to significantly reduce thepage
