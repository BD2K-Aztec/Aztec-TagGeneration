structural_bioinformatics addendum topology and prediction of rna pseudoknots it has come to our attention that several concepts and results underlying the gfold software presented in our article topology and prediction of rna pseudoknots reidys et_al are also present in earlier work by bon et_al orland and zee pillsbury et_al b vernizzi et_al and pillsbury et_al a here we briefly examine these works in relation to the results of our paper the classification and expansion of pseudoknotted rna_structures in terms of the topological genus of an associated fatgraph or double line graph were first proposed by orland and zee and bon et_al although fatgraphs were applied to rna_secondary already by penner and waterman and penner the enumerative results initiated by orland and zee are based on matrix models while our generating functions are derived via representation theory zagier enumeration results on rna_structures according to genus were already obtained by vernizzi et_al again using the formal framework of the matrix model genus as well as other topological invariants of fatgraphs were introduced and studied as descriptors of proteins in penner et_al pillsbury et_al a report recursion relations of time complexity o n to generate rna_structures of genus one in the context of an rna_folding algorithm that is substantially different from our algorithm gfold aside from not incorporating loop based energy models gfold is not restricted to genus one rna_structures the four basic irreducible shadows of genus one in theorem of our paper appeared first in bon et_al pillsbury et_al b the shadows of reidys et_al are derived from i the notion of irreducibility formulated by kleitman and ii the work on pseudoknot shapes by jin and reidys reidys and wang irreducibility is equivalent to the concept of primitivity introduced by bon et_al inspired by the work of dyson the equation to compute the genus of a fatgraph is classical going back to euler and was first applied in the context representing rna_structures by orland and zee and bon et_al
