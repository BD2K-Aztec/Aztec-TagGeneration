data_and webglore a web_service for grid logistic_regression webglore is a free web_service that enables privacy preserving construction of a global logistic regression_model from distributed data_sets that are sensitive it only transfers aggregated local statistics from participants through hypertext transfer protocol secure to a trusted server where the global model is synthesized webglore seamlessly integrates ajax java_applet servlet and php technologies to provide an easy to use web_service for biomedical_researchers to break down policy barriers during information_exchange in the biomedical context a major_challenge to ensure sufficient power of a predictive_model is to obtain enough samples this is especially important for scenarios like rare disease_prognosis where individual institutions do not have enough observations with the massive adaptation of electronic_health it becomes possible to combine_information across institutions to build powerful global models there are however reality challenges in combining raw_data because of the privacy concern to address privacy challenges researchers proposed many privacy preserving models to facilitate data_sharing including models using generalization noisy perturbation and a hybrid of both techniques please refer to fungs review these models try to enforce confidentiality through introducing indistinguishability however may alter values in the original data results based on such perturbed data cannot be reliably trusted for example in applications like medical_surveillance and healthcare decision_support an alternative_solution is instead of releasing data to share model through secure multiparty computing which approaches leverage security enhanced protocols e g transmitting aggregated statistics to offer a practical solution and shed lights on building accurate predictive_models without disclosing sensitive raw_data in this manuscript we target at constructing a collaborative framework for logistic_regression through secure multiparty computing we focus on horizontally partitioned data i e using information from locally hosted databases containing different observations that share the same attributes i e horizontal partitions of stackable sets of patient_records which is most common for cross institutional studies attendance the task creator initiator can trigger the computation at any time so that the server starts to interact with all participants when the computation begins webglore works in an asynchronized manner in each iteration newtonraphson step the server combines intermediary results collected from participants the server renews and distributes the value of globally estimated parameters of the current iteration the optimization terminates when it meets the accuracy requirement or the iteration number exceeds the maximum iteration limit each participant can retrieve reports for the global model or the local model to compare with these reports contain important statistic graphs and variables sensitivity specificity area_under roc_curve and hosmer_lemeshow tests we also plot the roc_curve and the reliability diagram for the models finally webglore provides each participant with an interface to test additional local observations using the global model because webglore does not access individual records users have to handle missing_data check attribute consistency and ensure data_quality we picked the myocardial_infarction dataset records which was collected in edinburgh uk to demonstrate our system these records were partitioned and in four sites we selected nine non redundant features in this dataset including pain in left_arm pain in right arm nausea hypoperfusion st_elevation new q waves st_depression t wave inversion and sweating the binary response indicates the presence of disease we listed two tables from the webglore report summarizes the model performance in terms of discrimination and calibration various metrics like area_under auc f score sensitivity specificity and type_i were listed for discrimination regarding calibration the web_service calculates the calibration error also known as brier score i e mean squared error from predictions to observations and conducts two types of hosmerlemeshow tests h test and c test to evaluate the goodness_of shows information regarding estimated parameters a small pvalue indicates the corresponding parameter plays_a in prediction results in tables mentioned earlier in the text match exactly with those of a logistic regression_model that was trained on the combined data from all four individual_datasets which validates our system in addition webglore generatesfunding ahrq grant u hs edm forum and nih grants r lm and u hl in part conflict of interest none declared
