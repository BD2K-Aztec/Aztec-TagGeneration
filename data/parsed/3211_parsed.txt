genome_analysis nebula a web_server for advanced chip_seq analysis motivation chip_seq consists of chromatin_immunoprecipitation and deep_sequencing of the extracted dna_fragments it is the technique of choice for accurate characterization of the binding_sites of transcription_factors and other dna associated proteins we present a web_service nebula which allows inexperienced users to perform a complete bioinformatics_analysis of chip_seq results nebula was designed for both bioinformaticians and biologists it is based on the galaxy open_source framework galaxy already includes a large number of functionalities for mapping reads and peak_calling we added the following to galaxy i peak_calling with findpeaks and a module for immunoprecipitation quality_control ii de_novo motif_discovery with chipmunk iii calculation of the density and the cumulative distribution of peak locations relative to gene transcription_start iv annotation of peaks with genomic_features and v annotation of genes with peak information nebula generates the graphs and the enrichment statistics at each step of the process during steps nebula optionally repeats the analysis on a control dataset and compares these results with those from the main dataset nebula can also incorporate gene_expression or gene modulation data during these steps in summary nebula is an innovative web_service that provides an advanced chip_seq analysis_pipeline providing ready to publish results availability nebula is available atchromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high_throughput chip_seq is a technique that allows identification of binding_sites of dna associated proteins most of the existing_tools for chip_seq analysis are ifficult to use by non bioinformaticians these tools map sequenced_reads to the reference_genome or predict binding_site locations chip_seq for a review several tools exist for peak filtering motif_discovery and genome feature association such tools are often command_line applications r packages or their use on the web is restricted to a limited number of sequences data quantity chip_seq analysis solutions offering a graphical_interface such as the main galaxy server cistrome cisgenome and the web version of ceas can be very useful in particular for biologists when performing the first steps of chip_seq analysis galaxy main or further analysis of predicted binding_sites cistrome cisgenome and ceas however none of these solutions provides the full set of tools needed for a complete chip_seq analysis supplementary our goal was to develop a framework in which biologists could analyze their chip_seq with minimal help of bioinformaticians from read_mapping to the analysis of binding_site properties however bioinformaticians can also benefit from using such a framework we developed a pipeline for advanced chip_seq analysis that i is web_based ii modular iii includes several tools for data quality_control and iv produces graphical output and necessary statistics
