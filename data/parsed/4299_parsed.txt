genome_analysis smashcommunity a metagenomic annotation and analysis tool smashcommunity is a stand alone metagenomic annotation and analysis_pipeline suitable for data from sanger and sequencing_technologies it supports state of the art software for essential metagenomic tasks such as assembly and gene prediction it provides tools to estimate the quantitative phylogenetic and functional compositions of metagenomes to compare compositions of multiple metagenomes and to produce intuitive visual representations of such analyses availability smashcommunity source_code are available atmetagenomics allows the culture free characterization of natural and host associated microbial_communities and provides an understanding of their structure dynamics and functionality as well as the environmental_factors that shape them although the volume of metagenomic_data being deposited to public_repositories is increasing exponentially and more large_scale studies are underway there are still no standards for experimental and computational_methods required to analyze such datasets making it hard to compare results from these studies web_servers such as camera img m and mg rast host published metagenomic_datasets and enable users to perform additional and comparative_analysis on them however there is an imminent need for stand alone computational_pipelines that enable in house analysis of new metagenomic_datasets using standardized_methods and comparison of datasets from different environments mg rast and the megan stand alone tool perform functional and phylogenetic_analyses of metagenomes however they do not estimate quantitative abundances as they simply count the reads mapping to known genes or speciesa measure strongly affected by gene length and genome_size they also do not assemble metagenomic_reads and are thus unable to identify
