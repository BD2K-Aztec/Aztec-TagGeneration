data_and fast integration of heterogeneous_data for predicting gene function with limited annotation motivation many algorithms that integrate_multiple functional association networks for predicting gene function construct a composite network as a weighted_sum of the individual networks and then use the composite network to predict gene function the weight assigned to an individual network represents the usefulness of that network in predicting a given gene function however because many categories of gene function have a small number of annotations the process of assigning these network weights is prone to overfitting results here we address this problem by proposing a novel approach to combining multiple functional association networks in particular we present a method where network weights are simultaneously optimized on sets of related function categories the method is simpler and faster than existing_approaches further we show that it produces composite networks with improved function prediction_accuracy using five example species yeast mouse fly esherichia coli and human availability networks and code are available from the past_decade has seen a dramatic_increase in the quantity and variety of publicly_available genomic and proteomic_data and a parallel increase in the number of computational_methods to integrate these heterogeneous data in generating predictions about protein and gene function see noble and ben hur for a review many of these methods often called gene or protein_function prediction_algorithms use the same basic framework first they generate so_called functional association networks that capture information about shared gene or protein_function implicit in each dataset then they integrate these networks to generate a single composite network which they input along with a set of labels that describe gene function to a kernel or network based classification algorithm e g once trained these classification algorithms assign to whom correspondence should be addressed discriminant values to each gene that can then be thresholded to generate hypotheses about the function of unlabeled genes the functional association_network is a natural and widely used representation for capturing information about shared gene function from high_throughput data_sources in this representation nodes correspond to genes or proteins and the edges are weighted according to the evidence implied by a given data source for shared function of the connected nodes these edge_weights are calculated using a similarity_metric matched to a given data type for example the pearsons_correlation pcc is often used to measure pairwise similarities between gene_expression once calculated it is relatively easy to translate these networks into kernels for kernel_based learning methods e g by using a diffusion kernel an important step in predicting gene function is the construction of a composite network from multiple functional association networks a common approach is to construct a function specific composite network as a weighted_sum of the individual networks such that the weight of each network is determined based on the networks predictiveness of a set of positively labeled genes that are deemed to have the same specific function the positive gene labels are derived from online_databases such as gene_ontology go kegg and enzyme commission ec these databases provide a controlled_vocabulary describing categories of gene function and curated lists of genes_annotated to these functions there are two challenges in constructing function specific composite networks first because many functional_categories have only a few annotations it is difficult to assign network weights without overfitting second for an algorithm to be widely_applicable it must be fast and scalable to combine dozens of networks with over nodes genes each here we investigate a number of network weighting_schemes to avoid_overfitting in particular we propose a new approach that we refer to as simultaneous weights sws sw is based on our previous algorithm genemania which constructs function specific composite network by solving a constrained linear regression_problem however instead of assigning function specific network weights we simultaneously optimize the weights on a group of related function categories by solving a single constrained linear regression_problem we evaluate the impact of several regularization schemes such as lasso elastic_net ridge regularization on our previous weighting_scheme here we first evaluate sw and compare its performance to several other approaches various regularized linear regression_methods the tss algorithm and a simpler correlation based method described below using the yeast benchmark networks we then show analogous results using mouse fly human and e coli benchmark data we have introduced a new network weighting_scheme for combining multiple_networks that are derived from genomic and proteomic_data in order to construct a composite network that is predictive of gene function we have shown that by fitting network weights that are simultaneously optimized on a group of functions from the same branch of go we greatly improve prediction_performance we have shown that we can obtain these sws by solving a constrained linear regression_problem in our experiments the sw method results in a significant_improvement in predicting gene function in yeast mouse and fly in human and e coli sws performs only slightly better than a uniform network combination this is because these networks tend to be sparser than the other networks making it hard to assign accurate network weights in our experiments we have observed that adding a small amount of ridge regularization to sw results in a slight performance improvement the regularization_parameter can be set using cv alternatively we have observed good performance by setting it to n n i e of the total number of observations our results show that fitting the sws to go categories in the same hierarchy with a broad range of specificities those withannotations outperform more specific groupings of the go categories note that because we adjust the target vector t c to balance the number of positives_and in each category c the larger go categories contribute more to the overall target vectort vector vectort on the other hand there are many more categories withannotations in summary we have demonstrated the feasibility and the utility of constructing a single composite network with sws for predicting various go categories unlike a fixed network combination with uniform weights sws account for noisy and redundant networks this observation can in turn speed up gene_function from multiple_networks
