a regression_framework incorporating quantitative and negative interaction data improves quantitative_prediction of pdz_domain peptide interaction from primary sequence motivation predicting protein interactions involving peptide recognition domains is essential for understanding the many important biological_processes they mediate it is important to consider the binding_strength of these interactions to help us construct more biologically_relevant protein_interaction that consider cellular_context and competition between potential binders results we developed a novel regression_framework that considers both positive quantitative and negative qualitative interaction data available for mouse pdz_domains to quantitatively predict interactions between pdz_domains a large peptide recognition domain_family and their peptide ligands using primary sequence_information first we show that it is possible to learn from existing quantitative and negative interaction data to infer the relative binding_strength of interactions involving previously_unseen pdz_domains and or peptides given their primary sequence performance was measured using cross_validated hold out testing and testing with previously_unseen pdz domainpeptide interactions second we find that incorporating negative data improves quantitative interaction prediction third we show that sequence_similarity is an important prediction_performance determinant which suggests that experimentally collecting additional quantitative interaction data for underrepresented pdz_domain subfamilies will improve_prediction availability_and the matlab_code for our semisvr predictor and all data used here are available at http baderlab org data pdzaffinity modular domains are the major building_blocks of eukaryotic_proteins and interaction networks these domains usually fold independently and are present in various combinations within a single protein to create a rich repertoire of functionally diverse proteins from a more limited domain set an important subclass of these domains peptide recognition modules prms bind to short extended and linear_peptide segments in target_proteins to mediate proteinprotein_interactions in eukaryotic_cell signaling_systems characterizing the interactions of these peptide recognition modules will help us map and understand the many biological_processes they mediate prms generally bind their peptide ligands in the weak m affinity binding_strength range and sensitive in vitro experimental_techniques like phage_display and peptide protein microarrays have been used to map the binding_specificities and protein interactions of large sets of sh sh ww and pdz_domains however these experimental_techniques are resource_intensive and cannot be readily applied to new members and alleles of prms that are increasingly being collected by genome_sequencing and population_based genetic_variation studies the international ideally a computational_model could be developed to predict whether a prm will bind to a peptide given their primary sequences such a model could be used to predict protein interactions from newly_sequenced and the effect of mutations on known prm mediated protein interactions to guide subsequent experimental_characterization computational domainpeptide interaction prediction has been studied for multiple prms such as sh sh pdz ww and mhc domains which are a special_case of peptide binding_domains that do not mediate proteinprotein_interactions these approaches except forour goal is to predict binding_strength of a previously_unseen pdz domainpeptide pair based on the primary sequence of the domain and peptide and quantitative interaction data to address this we applied regression_analysis to published pdz_domain peptide binding_affinity data obtained using a combination of protein microarray and fluorescence_polarization experiments inferring the relative_strength of proteinpeptide interactions mediated by peptide recognition modules prms will lead to better understanding of cellular_processes here we show that it is possible to predict affinity of pdz domainpeptide interactions based on primary sequence_information we also show that incorporating both positive_and interaction data using a novel semisvr approach improves prediction this approach is also successful at predicting which pdz domainpeptide pairs are likely to interact binary prediction based on the experimental_data a threshold of m separates quantitative positive data from qualitative negative data changing this threshold to more stringent values i e and m did not change our results supplementary although our method is mainly based on sequence_similarity it is interesting to analyze how much physicochemical_factors contribute to our prediction_performance to investigate this we assessed how well each of properties from the factor encoding can be used individually for quantitative_prediction of pdzpeptide interactions using semisvr we found that isoelectric_point hydrophilicity scale polarity average accessible_surface van_der parameter epsilon and steric parameter are most important for performance in decreasing order suggesting they are the physicochemical_factors that mostly modulate the binding_strength of pdzpeptide interactions supplementary given that physical_forces between the domain and the peptide d structures determine affinity and our observation that semisvr performance correlates with sequence_similarity between pdz_domains in testing and training_sets we postulate that natural pdz_domains with similar sequences have similar d structures that determine affinity in similar_ways this is supported by the observation that pdz specificities are found conserved from worm to human it has been shown that it is easy to mutate pdz_domains to bind non natural ligands however we only see a limited set of pdz_domain specificities in nature these observations are consistent with a constrained model of pdz specificity evolution where a set of initial pdz_domain specificities evolved and that these were then expanded to form a finite number of subfamilies each functionally_similar down to the level of affinity determination this model_predicts that each subfamily has a characteristic structure and mode of determining binding_affinity with a ligand regardless we find that information useful for prediction is taken from the entire pdz domain_family and this improves prediction_performance compared with using a nave nearest_neighbor based predictor as our method is trained on interaction data of natural pdz_domains it may not do well at quantitative interaction prediction involving synthetic pdz_domains that have multiple mutations not found in our training data we have noticed in other work that synthetic mutations may cause large changes in specificity and presumably affinity this may occur by drastically changing the binding_mode for instance by causing the peptide to rotate we do not notice these types of large specificity changes arising from small sequence differences in natural pdz_domains possibly because they disrupt normal pdz function the reduced predictive_ability on synthetic pdz_domains at least for specificity has also been recently noticed however we were not able to test this due to lack of sufficient affinity data on synthetic pdz_domains we observed that some pdz_domains share identical subsequences in the and binding positions but bind the same peptides with different affinity for example both dvl and dvl share identical subsequences in their binding positions yet bind to peptide caspr with m and m kd respectively assuming the affinities are measured accurately suggests that additional sequence_positions are modulating the binding_strength of pdzpeptide interactions this is supported by previous work showing that sets of non binding positions coupled with a binding_site contribute to the binding_energy it has also been found that mutations in these sites may affect the structure of the binding_site and thus alter binding_affinity although our best predictor was obtained using the full pdz sequence the performance was only somewhat improved on average compared with using either or binding positions this may be due to the limitation of our sequence based_approach that fails to capture structural_features of pdz_domains and their ligands that are important for binding additional experimental_data about how structural_variation in the binding_site combined with affinity data would be useful in the future to further address the importance of non binding_site positions on affinity the binding_strength of domainpeptide interactions may also be affected by the presence of other partners bound it will be interesting to examine the potential competition of pdz binding_sites bound by multiple pdz_domains expressed at different concentrations using our method it will also be important to extend our method in the future to consider co operativity the performance of the semisvr depends on sequence_similarity of test pdz_domains to those in the training_set with sufficient binding_peptides the human scribble pdz_domain we tested is fairly close to domains in the training_set similar and thus is a good test of our approach because of this we expect our method is immediately applicable to pdz_domains in multiple species that are close to the domains in our training_set we thus used our method to predict relative affinities for a set of reasonably close mouse and human pdz_domains domain sequence_identity to putative mouse and human pdz ligands and included it as a convenient starting set see supplementary tables s and s which is useful for prioritizing future_experiments our results highlight the need to collect experimental domainpeptide binding data covering pdz sequence_space to improve prediction_methods this means we need to measure page
