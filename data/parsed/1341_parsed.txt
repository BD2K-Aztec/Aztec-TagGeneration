data_and detecting biological network_organization and functional gene orthologs we developed a package tripletsearch to compute relationships within triplets of genes based on roundup an orthologous gene database containing genomes these relationships derived from the coevolution of genes provide_valuable in the detection of biological network_organization from the local to the system level in the inference of protein functions and in the identification of functional orthologs to run the computation users need to provide the gi ids of the genes of interest a logic triplet of genes is a set of three genes with a logic relationship for example gene c is present in a genome if and only gene a and b are both present we developed a method to effectively search for those triplets by incorporating phylogeny balancing into the phylogenetic profiles of triplets we found logic triplets to be very powerful in the detection of biological network_organization and identification of key_genes and their protein functions including adjacent and distant proteins in a pathway and even interactions among different pathways at the system level here we provide the programs to search those logic triplets based on a large phylogenetic profile matrix containing bacteria genomes and orthologous gene_clusters the matrix was generated through roundup one of the largest gene orthologs databases on the internet containing bacteria archaea and eukaryotes among possible logic relationships involving three genes the four types inare most likely to be present in real cellular_networks in addition we also developed methods to detect if instead of if and only if iff relationships for the four types because our study suggested the former might be very common please see list to whom correspondence should be addressed the four basic logic relationships and their corresponding network organizations black dots represent chemical_compounds type c is present in a genome iff a and b are both present type c is present in a genome iff a is present or b is present type c is present in a genome iff a is present and b is absent it means protein b may inhibit enzyme a or c type c is present in a genome iff one of either a or b is present terminology iff means if and only if of iff logic relationship types search for iff relationships and search for if relationships in supplementary_material for details as our study suggested logic triplets can be very helpful in the detection of biological network_organization at different levels for example a predicted logic triplet fabh is present iff either fabf or fabb is present matches exactly to the relationship of the three genes in escherichia_coli in fatty_acid if fabh is responsible for the initiation of elongation then the subsequent rounds of elongation can be carried_out by either fabf or fabb see supplementaryfor details in addition logic triplets reveals the function and network location of putative genes a triplet tdce is present iff both ybiw and pfld are present indicates that enzymes coded by ybiw and pfld function closely with the one coded by tdce indeed although there is not yet any experimental_data on those two genes other computational studies have suggested such a link as well interestingly logic triplets are also suggestive of translation regulation a triplet lldd is present iff one of either acca or accd is present may seem odd at first in e coli lldd catalyzes the production of pyruvate which is then converted to actyl coa acca and accd are the two subunits of acetyl_coa carboxyltransferase however a recent study suggests that accd binds to the mrnas of acca and accd to inhibit the translation and that such binding is mutually_exclusive with the substrate_binding for catalytic_activity therefore the suggestion from the triplet that those two subunits cannot coexist in some bacteria is possible finally logic triplets can identify functional orthologs the gene_pairs with similar function but no sequence_similarity for example an influential paper studied the formation of disulfide_bond in bacterial_proteins while most bacteria contain dsba and dsbb which function sequentially to form the bond several major bacterial phyla do not have dsbb the study finally identified vkor as the functional ortholog of dsbb through experiments with our method a strong triplet dsba is present iff either dsbb or vkor is present would pinpoint the missed gene quickly in summary logic triplets are useful in the detection of biological network_organization the inference of protein_function and the identification of functional orthologs our package tripletsearch provides the phylogenetic profile matrix of large_number across a wide_spectrum of bacteria genomes and a group of userfriendly programs to search for those triplets users can also create customized phylogenetic matrix from genomes available at our roundup website_http roundup hms harvard edu retrieve
