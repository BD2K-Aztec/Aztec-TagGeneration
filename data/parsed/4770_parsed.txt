data_and ucsc data integrator and variant annotation integrator two new tools on the ucsc_genome web_site provide improved ways of combining information from multiple datasets optionally including the users own custom track data and or data from track hubs the data integrator combines columns from multiple data tracks showing all items from the first track along with overlapping items from the other tracks the variant annotation integrator is tailored to adding functional_annotations to variant_calls it offers a more restricted set of underlying data tracks but adds predictions of each variants consequences for any overlapping or nearby gene_transcript when available it optionally adds additional annotations including effect prediction scores from dbnsfp for missense_mutations encode regulatory summary tracks and conservation scores availability_and the web_tools are freely_available atthe ucsc_genome database contains a wealth of genomic_datasets one of its strengths is the suite of web_tools at http genome ucsc edu for visualizing and extracting data from the database in combination with the users own custom track data as well as data provided via track hubs for over a decade the table browser has provided the capability to extract textual data from any data track with many options such as filtering by values format conversion and sequence output however its abilities to combine data from multiple tracks are limited it provides an intersection function that retains items in the selected track that overlap with items in a second track however the identities and attributes of items in the second track are not retained so it is not possible to associate items in one track with items in another track over the years many users of the ucsc_genome have requested that capability so we have developed a new tool the data integrator di to provide a flexible and open_ended query interface for combining data columns from multiple tracks one common request is to add annotations to a users custom track of variant_calls for example the name of any gene that the variant intersects variant functional_annotation is a well studied problem v c the author published_by the di and vai offer two new complementary ways to interactively mine data from the ucsc_genome database making a useful addition to the existing table browser future plans for the di include adding selection from related database tables where applicable drag reorder of output columns filters on inputs and outputs and more options for configuring intersection of items future plans for the vai include vcf output hgvs notation http www hgvs org mutnomen and more annotation choices
