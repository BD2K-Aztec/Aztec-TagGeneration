bioinformatics_discovery sequence_analysis bacterial gras domain proteins throw new light on gibberellic_acid response mechanisms gibberellic acids gas are key plant_hormones regulating various aspects of growth and development which have been at the center of the green revolution gras family proteins the primary players in ga signaling_pathways remain_poorly using sequence_profile searches structural comparisons and phylogenetic_analysis we establish that the gras family first emerged in bacteria and belongs to the rossmann fold methyltransferase superfamily all bacterial and a subset of plant gras proteins are likely to function as small_molecule methylases the remaining plant versions have lost one or more adomet sam binding residues while preserving their substrate_binding residues we predict that gras proteins might either modify or bind small_molecules such as gas or their derivatives gibberellic acids gas are a large family of diterpene molecules that are currently known to be synthesized by plants fungi and bacteria in plants they are key hormones that regulate various aspects of development such as seed_germination stem elongation leaf expansion flower_development and asymmetric_cell in roots the major plant players implicated in ga response are gras family proteins which include diverse members such as ga insensitive gai repressor of ga rga della short root scarecrow scr and nodulation signal_pathway and nsp and nsp while the gras family has been studied intensely for more than a decade as the so_called green revolution genes there is little clarity about their actual mode of action in ga pathways genetic and molecular studies have suggested that at least members of the gras family have functions related to ga signaling in arabidopsis of these gai and rga help in establishing repressive chromatin as the default state at promoters of genes that are regulated by ga the presence of ga results in recruitment of gai to the ga receptor a protein of the hydrolase superfamily which in turn results in the gai being targeted for proteasomal destruction via ubiquitination by a f box skp complex thus ga sensitive genes are derepressed in the presence of a ga signal in contrast several gras members such as scl appear to act as positive_regulators downstream of ga by removing the block imposed by the negative_regulators such as gai and rga consistent with their opposing_roles in ga signaling mutations in certain members of this superfamily result in dwarfing of plants others result in overgrowth and on rare occasions different alleles of the same gene cause either dwarfing or overgrowth additionally application of external ga is able to rescue the effects of loss_of in another member of the gras family scr in relation to asymmetric_cell during root_development to restore normal development of endodermis middle cortex and cortex cells gras proteins have been localized in the nucleus and are implicated in transcription related functions that are not clearly understood in terms of mechanisms in large part this lack of understanding of the gras family functions stems from a previously_published sequence_analysis study that erroneously reported a relationship between them and metazoan stat_proteins other erroneous relationships have also been reported for the gras family and include the purported presence of a leucine_zipper or a sh_domain these erroneous relationships have contributed to unsupported assumptions that they must be conventional transcription_factors indeed there have been several experimental_studies that have built on this and attempted to show dna_binding for certain gras proteins although this cannot be confirmed for other related proteins thus a unified mechanism for the action of the gras proteins could considerably help in understanding their apparently opposite roles with respect to ga signaling through sequence_profile searches structural comparisons and phylogenetic_analysis we establish that the gras family belongs to the rossmann fold methyltransferase superfamily that first emerged in bacteria we further show that ancestral bacterial gras proteins are likely to function as active small_molecule methylases in contrast the majority of plant gras domains show disruptions of their adomet sam binding residues while preserving their substrate_binding residues suggesting that they might function as small_molecule binding_domains to whom correspondence should be addressed in this work we falsify the previously_published relationships that were proposed for the gras domain and highlight the presence of bacterial versions we show that the gras domain contains a version of the rossmann fold methyltransferase which is likely to bind or modify ga or derivative molecules the evolutionary_history of the gras family parallels that of the gid like hydrolases which also appear to have been horizontally transferred from bacteria to plants close to the origin of land_plants in a more general sense these findings are in line with our recent_studies that suggest that several components of eukaryotic regulatory_systems have their ultimate origins in bacterial small_molecule metabolism systems which have been repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes at different points in their evolutionary_history importantly our finding provide a new way of looking at this group of plant regulatory_proteins that have been often described as being at the heart of the green revolution
