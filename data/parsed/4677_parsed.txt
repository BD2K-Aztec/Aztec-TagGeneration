tiquant software for tissue analysis quantification and surface_reconstruction motivation tiquant is a modular software_tool for efficient quantification of biological_tissues based on volume data obtained by biomedical image modalities it includes a number of versatile image and volume processing chains tailored to the analysis of different tissue_types which have been experimentally_verified tiquant implements a novel method for the reconstruction of three_dimensional surfaces of biological_systems data that often cannot be obtained experimentally but which is of utmost_importance for tissue modelling in systems_biology availability_and tiquant is freely_available use at msysbio com tiquant windows osx and linux are supported during the last decades sophisticated techniques for imaging of cells and tissues have been established however the translation of this information into new knowledge is hampered by the difficulty to form consistent hypotheses on the complex_interplay between components of biological_systems resulting either in physiological_function or a diseased state in recent_years mathematical_models became increasingly important addressing this question by formalizing the relations between and the interplay of these components in well controlled model scenarios the construction and parameterization of informative models however crucially depends on our ability to quantify structure and dynamic_behavior of tissues by image_processing and analysis techniques moreover modeling often requires information that cannot be obtained by available imaging methods either because the structure of interest cannot be accessed experimentally or due to technical_limitations for example while in most cases the two_dimensional d structure of surfaces in tissues can relatively easily be obtained the reconstruction of the full three_dimensional d picture usually is much more complicated cell margins e g can easily be obtained in d using a beta_catenin or phalloidin staining but in most available d microscopy software an automated_segmentation and quantification of the corresponding individual cells is not possible existing_methods for the reconstruction of cell_surfaces typically rely on a proper segmentation of cells quantification of individual cell_surfaces is required in many situations for example in liver physiology cell shapes determine cell_cell areas that in turn impact metabolic transmembrane fluxes and thus liver_function moreover surfaces often represent a conceptual or functional boundary rather than an actual biological structure that can be explicitly stained and imaged for example liver is subdivided in many small functional_units called lobules only in few species such as pig the surface of these lobules is represented explicitly by an anatomical membrane like structure while in most other species including human nothe borders between the functional and anatomical units experimentally very hard to determine however detailed knowledge of the full d shape of liver lobules is essential to quantify the anatomy of key vascular systems in liver as the sinusoidal or bile networks which is of utmost_importance to understand the interplay of components in this article we present comprehensive software for the analysis and quantification of tissue that implements inter_alia a novel method for the reconstruction of d surfaces the technique is applicable to well established and widely used imaging_techniques even if staining of some cellular_structures is incomplete
