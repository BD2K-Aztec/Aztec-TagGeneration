systems_biology inference of protein kinetics by stochastic modeling and simulation of fluorescence_recovery experiments motivation fluorescence_recovery frap is a functional live_cell imaging_technique that permits the exploration of protein dynamics in living_cells to extract kinetic_parameters from frap data a number of analytical_models have been developed simplifications are inherent in these models which may lead to inex haustive or inaccurate exploitation of the experimental_data an appealing alternative is offered by the simulation of biological_processes in realistic environments at a particle level however inference of kinetic_parameters using simulation based models is still limited results we introduce and demonstrate a new method for the inference of kinetic parameter_values from frap data a small number of in silico frap experiments is used to construct a mapping from frap recovery curves to the parameters of the underlying protein kinetics parameter_estimates from experimental_data can then be computed by applying the mapping to the observed recovery curves a bootstrap process is used to investigate identifiability of the physical_parameters and determine confidence regions for their estimates our method circumvents the computational_burden of seeking the best fitting parameters via iterative simulation after validation on synthetic data the method is applied to the analysis of the nuclear_proteins cdt pcna and gfpnls parameter_estimation results from several experimental samples are in accordance with previous_findings but also allow us to discuss identifiability issues as well as cell to cell variability of the protein kinetics implementation all methods were implemented in matlab r b monte_carlo were run on the hpc cluster brutus of eththe development of modern microscopy systems coupled with advances in fluorescent protein technology and sophisticated computational_methods have made it possible to visualize track and quantify fluorescent molecules within living_cells functional live_cell imaging_techniques such as fluorescence_recovery frap are increasingly used by biology laboratories to explore the dynamic_behavior of proteins in vivo during a typical frap experiment molecules tagged with a fluorescent protein such as the green fluorescent proteingfp in a subcellular region are irreversibly bleached by a short laser_pulse then the recovery of the fluorescence due to unbleached molecules moving into the bleached region is measured by standard time lapse microscopy analysis of this recovery data aims at providing information regarding the diffusion and binding of the bleached molecules reflecting biomolecular_interactions within the cell conventional quantitative frap analysis focuses on parameters associated with the shape of the recovery curve e g value of plateau and half_maximal recovery time easily estimated using curve_fitting techniques however this approach provides a limited understanding of protein kinetics and is heavily dependent on the experimental_setup especially on the time frame of observation to estimate the kinetic_parameters of the underlying molecular_processes including association and dissociation_constants relative_size of mobile and immobile pools and protein diffusion_rates model based quantitative frap analysis is necessary modeling_approaches traditionally rely on developing streamlined models of the diffusion binding and photobleaching processes to derive approximate closed_form of fluorescence recovery the parameters yielding recovery curves that correspond best to the data are chosen as the most likely explanation of the underlying protein kinetics over the past_years a variety of models have been proposed broadly classified into diffusion models reaction models and reaction diffusion models depending on the phenomenon considered dominant it has also been observed that the frap recovery curve is composed of two phases a first phase with fast dynamics where the recovery is mainly attributed to diffusion diffusion regime and a second phase with slower dynamics where the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com recovery is regulated by binding and unbinding events turnover regime models giving rise to a sum of exponential terms have been extensively used for quantitative analysis in the reaction models domain exponential expressions are derived through compartmental modeling_approaches pioneered in where the presence of one or two exponential terms is dictated by the number of binding_sites an alternative compartmental modeling_approach is proposed in which again results in a theoretical curve with two exponential terms here the coefficients of the terms are non linear_functions of all physical_parameters diffusion_coefficient binding unbinding rates of the underlying molecular kinetics the derivation of explicit parametric expressions for frap curves relies on simplifying assumptions about cellular nuclear geometry d d nature of diffusion isotropic or anisotropic binding_site number one or many and distribution homogeneous or heterogeneous to name a few the accuracy of these approximations is however difficult to determine furthermore it has been shown that different models or different parameter_sets of the same model can fit frap curves equally well indeed contrasting estimates of the kinetic_parameters of even the same molecule species have been reported in various studies at the same time the use of averages of several cell profiles is common practice in traditional frap analysis which may mask the underlying biological_information contained in single_cell measurements in the past_years the availability of computational_resources of ever increasing power has stimulated modeling and simulation of molecular mobility and interactions at a particle level and within realistic environments stochastic hybrid models coupling continuous diffusion dynamics with discrete random interaction events and providing a realistic account of the complexity of the cellular_environment can be built and simulated in reasonable time analysis of the fit between simulated and experimental recovery curves allows one to invalidate hypotheses on the values of kinetic_parameters unfortunately in this context a parameter inference_method cannot be obtained easily by numerical optimization of the fit as the repeated simulation of the system for iteratively refined values of the parameters is computationally_demanding to account for this existing simulationbased methods propose the a priori creation of a large dataset of simulated frap curves for varying combinations of kinetic parameter_values obtained by gridding the parameter_space van parameter_inference from experimental_data is then performed by searching in the dataset the simulated curve that fits best the experimental one thus forcing the estimates to take values on the grid of simulated parameters in this article we propose an alternative approach for the inference of the kinetic_properties of proteins within living_cells the key idea and novelty of our method is the construction of a mapping from recovery curves to the parameters of the underlying molecule kinetics the method is based on the numerical_simulation of a stochastic hybrid model of protein diffusion and binding in a realistic setup at a particle level it assumes that frap recovery curves are represented through a sum of exponentials then a relatively small number of simulations for different physical parameter_values is used to train an artificial_neural ann implementing the required mapping of physical_parameters to the parameters of frap recovery curves given an experimentally_determined recovery curve inference of the underlying kinetic_parameters then simply amounts to fitting the data with a sum of exponential curve and feeding the obtained recovery parameters to the mapping in addition a bootstrap process is used to compute confidence_intervals on the parameter_estimates through the a priori construction of the mapping our method circumvents the burden of resimulating the model iteratively every time a parameter estimate is sought unlike existing_methods our method provides interpolation within the range of parameters of the simulated curves this allows us to reduce the number of simulations required and yet provide estimates that are not biased toward values fixed a priori at the same time the bootstrap process allows us to investigate the identifiability of the physical model_parameters we validate the proposed method first in silico and then through the analysis of in vivo data for the nuclear_proteins cdt pcna and gfpnls our method predicts behavior in accordance with earlier_findings and provides elements for the discussion of cell tocell variability
