bioinformatics_discovery promoter proximal ccctc factor binding is associated with an increase in the transcriptional pausing index motivation it has been known for more than decades that after rna_polymerase rnapii initiates transcription it can enter into a paused or stalled state immediately downstream of the transcription_start before productive elongation recent_advances in high_throughput facilitated the discovery that rnapii pausing at promoters is a widespread physiologically regulated phenomenon the molecular_underpinnings of pausing are incompletely_understood the ccctc factor ctcf is a ubiquitous nuclear_factor that has diverse regulatory_functions including a recently_discovered role in promoting rnapii pausing at splice_sites results in this study we analyzed ctcf binding_sites and nascent transcriptomic_data from three different cell_types and found that promoter proximal ctcf_binding is significantly associated with rnapii pausing promoter proximal pausing of rna_polymerase rnapii has emerged as a widespread and important step in the regulation of transcription the role of pausing is not completely_understood but initial evidence suggests that it allows for precise and rapid transcriptional_response to stimuli such as developmental cues or cellular stressors the underlying_mechanisms of rnapii pausing are thought to be complex recent_publications have reported a few key_factors that regulate polymerase pause site entry and release including gaga c_myc ell and xrn however it is not clear whether and how many other complexes are also involved as such this area merits_further the ccctc factor ctcf is a multifaceted gene regulator with demonstrated roles in transcriptional_activation repression insulation imprinting and chromatin_remodeling in shukla et_al published a seminal article which reported for the first time that ctcf can facilitate exon_inclusion by promoting rnapii pausing at splice_sites another recent study postulated that ctcf may regulate vascular_endothelial transcription in part by mediating rnapii pausing given these reports and recent_observations that at least of ctcf binding_events are proximal to promoters we hypothesized that ctcf_binding may be a cofactor in mediating promoterproximal rnapii pausing to investigate this possibility we analyzed genome_wide nascent rna data global nuclear run on followed by sequencing gro seq and empirically determined ctcf binding_sites from the only three cell_types for which both datasets are publicly_available human cell_lines imr lung fibroblast and mcf breast_cancer and mouse_embryonic mes for each cell_type we divided promoters according to whether ctcf was bound upstream downstream of the tss section the number of promoter proximal ctcf binding_sites was highly_variable across cell_types supplementary_material gro seq data provide a density_map of transcriptionally engaged rnapii across the genome by purifying sequencing and mapping nascent rnas using recently_published gro seq data we calculated rnapii pausing indices at refseq annotated promoters in three different cell_types and assessed whether promoter proximal ctcf_binding is associated with elevated rnapii pausing indices section we made two novel observations genes that exhibit promoter proximal ctcf_binding defined as within nt downstream of the tss have a significantly_greater rnapii pausing index than genes that do not supplementary_material for example in imr cells the median pausing index at promoters with proximal ctcf binding_sites is fold_greater permutation_test p mann whitneywilcoxon test p than at promoters without proximal ctcf binding_sites the highly overlapping range of pausing indices between the two categories of promoters indicates that while ctcf_binding may be associated with pausing it is by no means necessary or sufficient regions of ctcf_binding are enriched for motifs with elevated cytosine c content as such the observed association between ctcf binding_events and increased pausing index could be explained by nucleotide_composition i e cytosine enriched regions may be responsible for the association with pausing independent of ctcf_binding to test this we repeated the analysis in each cell_type with computationally predicted ctcf binding_sites section based on the known c rich motif we did not observe any association with pausing supplementary_material which strongly suggests that sequence_composition alone is not sufficient to explain the association_signal but rather the physical binding of ctcf is required the association between ctcf_binding and the promoterproximal pausing index is position dependentthat is the further upstream downstream from the tss ctcf is bound the less of an association there is with rnapii pausing the association between ctcf_binding and pausing index is shown each imr promoter was classified based on the presence yes or absence no of an empirically determined imr chipchip or computationally predicted ctcf binding_site in the first nt downstream of its tss x axis the pausing index at each promoter was calculated section and transformed using the formula log pausing index for visualization purposes y axis the boxes in the plot cover percentiles and the bar within each box represents the median the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point that is no more than times the interquartile_range from the box mann whitneywilcoxon non parametric test p values are indicated for the relevant comparisons the position specific effect on the association of ctcf_binding with promoter proximal rnapii pausing is shown the x axis represents the distance nt from the tss vertical dashed_line of annotated refseq genes longer than kb the y axis depicts a normalized difference in median pausing index between promoters with a ctcf_binding event chip_seq chip_chip peak and promoters without a ctcfbinding event no chip_seq chip_chip peak as such the value horizontal dashed_line represents no difference in median pausing index between the two groups a positive value represents increased pausing in promoters with a ctcf_binding event and a negative value represents decreased pausing in promoters with a ctcf_binding event results are shown for three cell_lines two human imr mcf one mouse mes cells supplementary_material for example in mes cells ctcf_binding within nt downstream of tsss is highly significantly associated with pausing permutation_test p however this association is dramatically weakened for ctcf_binding within nt upstream downstream of tsss permutation_test p a recent study identified a novel role for ctcf in polymerase pausing at splice_sites to facilitate exon_inclusion our findings provide the first indication that ctcf is associated with promoter proximal pausing it is important to note that the study does not demonstrate that ctcf_binding is necessary or sufficient for promoter proximal pausing substantial additional experimental work is required to uncover the molecular_underpinnings of the observed association between ctcf_binding and rnapii dynamics the greatest degree of association with pausing is observed for ctcf binding_sites that are immediately downstream of the tss therefore an appealing mechanism for the observed association is steric hindrancethat is stably bound ctcf may serve to hinder rnapii processivity if this is the case it is likely that many other transcription_factors with binding_sites immediately downstream of tsss also associate with rnapii pausing it will be possible to test this hypothesis as more transcription_factor tf chip_seq and gro seq data are generated from the same cell_type we note however that because even sites that are upstream of the tss are somewhat associated with pausing steric_hindrance is not likely to be the only mechanism involved
