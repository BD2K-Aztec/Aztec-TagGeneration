genetics_and trinculo bayesian and frequentist multinomial_logistic for genome_wide of multi category phenotypes motivation for many classes of disease the same genetic risk_variants underly many related_phenotypes or disease_subtypes multinomial_logistic provides an attractive framework to analyze multi category phenotypes and explore the genetic_relationships between these phenotype categories we introduce trinculo a program that implements a wide_range of multinomial analyses in a single fast package that is designed to be easy to use by users of standard genome_wide software availability_and an open_source c implementation with code and binaries for linux and mac osx is available for download at http sourceforge net_projects trinculoof the many associations discovered by genome_wide a large number are shared across multiple_traits and many more predict different subtypes of the same disease a significant challenge for researchers is finding statistical_techniques that leverage this genetic sharing to increase power and discover new biology multinomial_logistic provides a powerful and flexible framework to carry out association_analyses across multiple_traits the frequentist version has been used in studies of disease subphenotypes and in cross disorder association studies bayesian extensions have been used to select between different models of genetic sharing across multiple_traits however these studies have fitted the models in an ad_hoc manner using inefficient r or stata packages the lack of a single flexible tool for multinomial_logistic has made using these methods difficult for most users especially when compared to the availability of fast user_friendly tools for binary_logistic such as plink to address this we provide a software_package that implements a wide_range of multi category logistic analyses in a single efficient and user_friendly program
