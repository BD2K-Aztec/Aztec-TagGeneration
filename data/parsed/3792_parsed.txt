databases_and pubdna finder a web database linking full_text to sequences of nucleic_acids pubdna finder is an online repository that we have created to link pubmed central manuscripts to the sequences of nucleic_acids appearing in them it extends the search capabilities provided by pubmed central by enabling researchers to perform advanced searches involving sequences of nucleic_acids this includes among other features i searching for papers mentioning one or more specific sequences of nucleic_acids and ii retrieving the genetic_sequences appearing in different articles these additional query capabilities are provided by a searchable index that we created by using the full text of the papers available at pubmed central at the time of writing and the sequences of nucleic_acids appearing in them to automatically extract the genetic_sequences occurring in each paper we used an original method we have developed the database is updated monthly by automatically connecting to the pubmed central ftp site to retrieve and index new manuscripts users can query the database via the web_interface provided availability pubdna finder can be freely accessed atthe biological_literature is the main source of information reporting empirically validated genetic_sequences such as for instance pcr_primers and probes as result researchers usually need to review the available literature to search for sequence_data which can be a hard and time consuming task pubmed central is currently the main source of open_access full text papers reporting genetic sequence_data however the search_engine provided by pubmed central does not support researchers to retrieve papers containing the genetic_sequences specified by the user and to automatically identify and extract the sequences of nucleic_acids mentioned in the retrieved_articles pubdna finder is an online repository linking pubmed central manuscripts to the different genetic_sequences appearing in them it extends the search capabilities provided by pubmed central to whom correspondence should be addressed by allowing researchers to i retrieve all articles containing the genetic_sequences specified by the userfeaturing both exact and approximate matching ii retrieve all the sequences appearing in the manuscripts matching a keyword based query and iii retrieve all articles matching a keyword based query and containing the sequences specified by the user pubdna finder currently contains the papers available from pubmed central at the time of writing the database is automatically updated on a monthly basis to retrieve and index new manuscripts
