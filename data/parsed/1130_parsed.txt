genome_analysis comtar a web_tool for the prediction and characterization of conserved microrna targets in plants motivation micrornas mirnas are major regulators of gene_expression in plants and animals they recognize their target messenger_rnas mrnas by sequence complementarity and guide them to cleavage or translational arrest so_far the prediction of plant mirnatarget pairs generally relies on the use of empirical parameters deduced from known mirnatarget interactions results we developed comtar a web_tool for the prediction of mirna_targets that is mainly based on the conservation of the potential regulation in different species we used data generated from a pipeline applied to transcript datasets of angiosperms that was used to build a database of potential mirna_targets of different plant_species the database contains information_describing each mirnatarget pair their function and evolutionary_conservation while the results are displayed in a user_friendly interface the tool also allows the search using new mirnas availability_and the web_site is free to all users with no login requirements atmicrornas mirnas are small_rnas processed from larger precursors with foldback structures by ribonuclease type_iii enzymes the mature_mirnas are assembled into argonaute complexes and recognize target messenger_rnas mrnas by partial base complementarity to control their translation and stability ancient mirnas conserved across angiosperms with important biological_roles have been identified some of them even found in gymnosperms ferns lycopods and mosses the prediction of mirna_targets in plants usually relies on the total number and position of mismatches and the minimum_free mfe hybridization usually mirna_binding are conserved during evolution and their conservation between arabidopsis_thaliana and rice has been exploited to identify_mirnas and targets jones more recently it has been shown that the conservation of the target_sites using partial genomic_information can be used to identify new targets for conserved mirnas in plants here we present comtar a web_based application for the identification of mirna_targets in plants based on sequence_conservation during evolution the tool allows users to analyze the variations of known mirna_targets during evolution and to predict new mirna_targets we developed a web_tool comtar that allows the characterization of mirnatarget interactions in different plant_species the tool also allows the prediction of new candidates based mainly on the conservation of the mirnatarget pair with a relaxed number of mismatches an advantage of the tool presented here is that evolutionary_conserved mirnatarget interactions might be likely involved in relevant biological_processes the approach requests that mirna targeting should be able to occur in the context of a minimum set of interacting parameters in different species therefore the sequence of the target itself does not need to be conserved a previous_report using a similar strategy but using a fewer species and datasets was successfully used to detect targets previously validated in a thaliana and to predict and experimentally validate new targets in a thaliana the web_tool can also be used in a reverse way to search for species where a gene of interest is potentially regulated by an mirna comtar allows users to predict and characterize mirna regulated_genes by focusing on the conservation of the potential targeting it provides an alternative strategy to other predictions tools based solely on empirical parameters
