from phenotype to genotype an association study of longitudinal phenotypic markers to alzheimer's disease_relevant snps motivation imaging genetic_studies typically focus on identifying single_nucleotide snp markers associated with imaging phenotypes few studies perform regression of snp values on phenotypic measures for examining how the snp values change when phenotypic measures are varied this alternative approach may have a potential to help us discover important imaging genetic_associations from a different perspective in addition the imaging markers are often measured over time and this longitudinal profile may provide increased power for differentiating genotype_groups how to identify the longitudinal phenotypic markers associated to disease sensitive snps is an important and challenging research_topic results taking_into the temporal_structure of the longitudinal imaging data and the interrelatedness among the snps we propose a novel task correlated longitudinal sparse regression_model to study the association between the phenotypic imaging markers and the genotypes encoded by snps in our new association model we extend the widely used norm for matrices to tensors to jointly select imaging markers that have common effects across all the regression tasks and time points and meanwhile impose the trace norm regularization onto the unfolded coefficient tensor to achieve low_rank such that the interrelationship among snps can be addressed the effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by both clearly improved prediction_performance in empirical evaluations and a compact set of selected imaging predictors relevant to disease sensitive snps neuroimaging genetics is an emerging_research field where brain_imaging is used as quantitative phenotypes to investigate the role of genetic_variation in brain structure and function it holds_great for a systems_biology of the brain to better understand complex neurobiological systems from genetic_determinants to cellular_processes to the complex_interplay of brain structure function behavior and cognition disorders of the nervous_system are associated with complex neurobiological changes which may lead to profound alterations at all levels of organization genome_wide gwas have been increasingly performed to correlate high_throughput singlenucleotide polymorphism snp data to large_scale imaging data to facilitate such association analysis many studies used a hypothesis driven approach by making significant reduction in one or both data types for example some whole brain studies focused on a small number of genetic variables e g and some whole_genome studies examined a limited number of imaging variables e g many snps have been identified as risk_factors for alzheimers_disease ad see those in the alzgene database www alzgene org so_far most studies focus on selecting and associating snps to ad status or imaging phenotypes very few studies have been done to directly examine how the snp values change when phenotypic measures are varied i e via regression of snp values on phenotypic measures this alternative approach may have a potential to help us discover important imaging genetic_associations from a different perspective in this study we perform such an initial analysis for finding phenotypic imaging markers that are related to snps from or proximal to alzgene candidates neuroimaging measures have been widely_studied to predict disease status and or cognitive_performance however whether these measures coupled with their longitudinal profiles have sufficient power to infer relevant genotype_groups is still an under explored yet important topic in ad research a simple strategy typically used in longitudinal_studies e g is to analyze a single summarized value such as average change rate of change or slope this approach may be inadequate to distinguish the complete dynamics of cognitive trajectories and thus become unable to identify the underlying genetic_structure
