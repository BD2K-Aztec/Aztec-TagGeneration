dynamic changes of rna_sequencing expression for precision_medicine n of pathways mahalanobis_distance within pathways of single subjects predicts breast_cancer survival motivation the conventional approach to personalized_medicine relies on molecular data ana lytics across multiple patients the path to precision_medicine lies with molecular data analytics that can discover interpretable single

extend our previous approach with the application of statistical mahalanobis_distance md to quantify personal pathway level deregulation we demonstrate that this approach n of pathways paired_samples

biologically_significant clinically_relevant and are predictive of breast_cancer survival p n invasive car cinoma tcga rna_sequences conclusion n of pathways md provides a practical approach towards precision_medicine the method generates the magnitude and the biological_significance of personal deregulated pathways results derived solely from the patients transcriptome these pathways offer the opportunities for deriving clinically actionable decisions that have the potential to complement the clinical interpret ability of personal polymorphisms obtained from dna acquired or inherited polymorphisms and mutations in addition it offers an opportunity for applicability to diseases in which dna changes may not be relevant and thus expand the interpretable omics of single subjects e g personalome through the incorporation of molecular data into the patient_care process personalized_medicine is drastically changing the healthcare landscape however truly precise medicine has not been obtained since completion of the human_genome in the inclusion of molecular data in medicine has improved our ability to make accurate diagnoses prognoses and treatment_plans relying on large cohorts limits the application of many of these techniques however while inherited or acquired dna_polymorphisms provide powerful insight in the pathogenicity of many mendelian_diseases and in cancer a single subject interpretation of the transcriptome may provide insight and could be deployed in diseases incurred by other insults than dna_damage or inheritable defects conventional transcriptome analyses rely on multiple patient data that can mask idiosyncratic signals from a single patient and these approaches may lead to treatments only effective for the average patient gene level expression signatures found in cross patient studies do not adequately inform treatment_plans for all cancer patients therefore there is a need for better methods to understand the biological underpinning at the single patient level in response to these issues we developed a global computational framework n of pathways n of pathways is founded upon three principles single patient data represent the entire statistical universe significance and interpretation are derived from genesets pathways and pathway level information is used to answer_questions of clinical importance principle allows for detection of individual signals that traditional cohort level studies can overlook principle anchors the results in mechanism and this affords dimension_reduction and interpretation principle provides quantitative and qualitative measures to address questions relating to patient_care the first application of the n of pathways framework the n of pathways wilcoxon method successfully predicted lung_adenocarcinoma patient_outcomes using paired_normal and tumor rna_seq samples from a single subject a follow_up study established it could accurately identify experimentally deregulated pathway in ovarian and breast_cancer while the n of pathways wilcoxon identified deregulated pathways with a statistical relevant it did not quantify the magnitude of deregulation in this study we extend and refine the n of pathways framework by developing a novel application of mahalanobis_distance md to create a clinical_relevance metric crm providing insight on the magnitude of the deregulation in addition to the biological_significance the design of n of pathways md eliminates the formers reliance on ranks e g wilcoxon_test while producing a measure of effect that is interpretable on the biological scale we employ breast_cancer gene_expression data to show increased sensitivity while not increasing false_positives in comparison to the wilcoxon approach finally we utilize the crm to predict breast_cancer survival rank_based nonparametric approaches can suffer a decreased efficiency compared to appropriately implemented bootstrap randomization and t test procedures further the wilcoxon procedure we previously utilized assumes that the pairs are chosen randomly and independently from a population it is presumable that gene_expression values do not satisfy this assumption we aimed to address these concerns via an evolution of our approach into the n of pathways md method results from our exploration of tcga breast_cancer data show n of pathways md improves upon our earlier n of pathways wilcoxon approach the success of the n of pathways framework for breast_cancer builds upon the insights developed in our previous_investigation of tcga lung_adenocarcinoma data as tcga data share similarity in data generation storage and format as well as other aspects n of pathways md continues to maintain the practicality of self contained geneset testing additionally the method provides a pathwaylevel deregulation clinically_relevant metric that is predictive of clinical_endpoints our simulation_study of the methods ability to detect synthetically deregulated pathways indicates that n of pathways md outperforms n of pathways wilcoxon its ability to identify entire mechanistically interpretable pathways deregulated from subtly degs is very powerful this feature provides a strategy to assess the notion that complex_diseases may derive from multiple changes of small effect that lead to larger phenotypic outcomes furthermore we note the signed nature of the n of pathways md score that the method cannot detect deregulated pathways that are not primarily up or downregulated in other words if a pathway has approximately_equal numbers of genes above and below the line of equal expression n of pathways md would likely not identify the pathway as deregulated it is debatable whether such a specific form of departure reflects true deregulation or simply a highly_variable pathway notes using the diametric extreme phenotypes we produced all possible pairs of dfs years patients dfs n with dod years patients dod n within these pairs of diametrically opposed patients the gene level log_fold centered around zero indicating no systematic shift in expression we applied the n of pathways framework to these pairs in pursuit of phenotypically deregulated pathways displayed are the pathways detected most often found deregulated at least times in the pairs that also share functional information similarity with an independent gold_standard gs of go bp terms section every patient studied was deregulation in this pathway i e not just a few patients causing deregulation in pairs note that deg geneset enrichment and gsea using all diametric extreme patients detected and pathways respectively fdr none of these pathways were functionally_related to the gs our biological replicate analysis indicates n of pathways md produces slightly fewer false_positives than wilcoxon there may be some concern over the somewhat inflated rate of false_positives for certain samples this might be attributed to true pathway deregulation explained by measurement variability or some aspect of the replication that led to unequal distribution of mrna_molecules we note that this analysis is highly contingent on proper preprocessing and normalization normalization is particularly problematic in rna_seq as many normalization techniques fail to compensate for library size gene length and guaninecytosine content notably n of pathways did not exhibit a bias towards longer median length of their genes supplementary a nor higher gene intensities within the pathway supplementary b however there is a bias towards detecting larger pathways as deregulated supplementary cd applying n of pathways md to breast_cancer data results in the discovery of sensible deregulated pathways and produces metrics predictive of survival this aspect validates the notion that n of pathways md not only provides a metric interpretable at the pathway level but also is related to important clinical_endpoints the most commonly deregulated pathways are associated with the hallmarks of cancer including deregulation in dna_replication and cell_cycle we also utilized the principal_components of the md crms section to identify clinical_subtypes such as estrogen_receptor er and clinical metastatic stage the former is not significant wilcoxon p pc data not shown the latter is significant wilcoxon p pc data not shown additionally the breast_cancer findings strengthen our previous indication that nof pathways was predictive of lung_adenocarcinoma survival demonstrating the robustness of our techniques for different cancer_types survival_prediction is possible from tumor gene_expression alone supplementary but the gene_signatures may lack interpretability and clinically actionable targets n of pathways is designed to first discover deregulated pathways at the individual_subject level followed by learning classifiers cross subjects in contrast gene_expression classifiers work directly on gene_expression which may not be functionally deregulated at the individual_subject level as pointed_out by simon n of pathways also allows for more power in discovering group comparisons at the pathway level that traditional differential mrna_expression followed by enrichment studies as summarized by n of pathways md refines our wilcoxon approach we acknowledged in our previous work that independence assumptions of the n of pathways wilcoxon_signed were not met however the fact that a predictive and interpretable signal was captured gave credibility to the n of pathways approach n of pathways md improves over our previous work as it does not violate any such statistical foundations careful readers may note that we have avoided the notions of hypothesis_testing and prefer the term identified pathways to significantly_deregulated pathways the md deregulation criterion outlined in section provides a metric to identify an up or downregulated pathway but does not rely on the notion of a p value we do retain the p values and associated multiplicity corrections for the wilcoxon approach in order to faithfully replicate that methodology further study is required to create a statistically complete approach the introduction of n of pathways md provides many avenues for extension the method can be adapted to more than paired_samples multiple samples could be obtained from within a tumor and the pathway scores would measure intratumor_heterogeneity along the same vein multiple samples could be obtained from a patient over time thus the geneset scores would measure longitudinal_change in key pathways to predict response to therapy or to make timely prescriptive decisions additionally the n of pathways framework could potentially provide a basis for improved small sample normalization techniques or additional ontological information could be employed to weight genes within a pathway and reflect gene importance in biochemical dynamics it remains to be shown whether the patient specific deregulated pathway s identified in the current study can be predictive and it will be addressed in future_studies n of pathways can also be applied to various scales of biology e g dna methylation patterns or microrna expression we hypothesized that creating a biologically_relevant pathway level measure of effect will improve interpretability and detection while maintaining statistical precision we have established a novel application of statistical md n of pathways md to quantify geneset deregulation using gene_expression data from paired_samples derived from a single subject this study further validated our n of pathway framework by predicting breast_cancer survival from the pathway level metric of deregulation we evaluated the precision and accuracy of n of pathways md and compared it to our existing wilcoxon approach we found improvement in geneset deregulation detection while not suffering increased false_positive the modification of our approach is a pathway level approach to produce a crm in single subjects and quantifying the deregulation induced under the disease condition e g tumor sample for each pathway in addition we are currently evaluating prospectively the method to predict_future hospitalization in a clinical_trial n of pathways md provides a practical approach towards precision_medicine the method gives clinically actionable results derived solely from the patient the entire transcriptome does not need to be measured allowing for targeted experiments across multiple gene_expression platforms reducing cost and providing flexibility the method generates the magnitude and the biological_significance of personal deregulated pathways results derived solely from the patients transcriptome these pathways offer an opportunity for applicability to diseases in which dna changes may not be relevant and thus expand the interpretable omics of single subjects e g personalome
