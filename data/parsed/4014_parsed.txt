structural_bioinformatics ring networking interacting residues evolutionary_information and energetics in protein_structures motivation residue interaction networks rins have been used in the literature to describe the protein d structure as a graph where nodes represent residues and edges physicochemical interactions e g hydrogen_bonds or van_der contacts topological network parameters can be calculated over rins and have been correlated with various aspects of protein_structure and function here we present a novel web_server ring to construct physicochemically valid rins interactively from pdb files for subsequent visualization in the cytoscape platform the additional structure based parameters secondary_structure solvent_accessibility and experimental uncertainty can be combined with information regarding residue conservation mutual_information and residue based energy scoring_functions different visualization styles are provided to facilitate visualization and standard plugins can be used to calculate topological parameters in cytoscape a sample use case analyzing the active_site of glutathione_peroxidase is presented availability the ring server supplementary methods examples and tutorials are available for non commercial use at url http protein bio unipd it ring the last years have seen the advent of network representation to tackle the complexity inherent in many problems in biology by focusing on the network_properties of a system it is often possible to gain a new level of insight into apparently unpredictable systems the most studied example in biology is protein_interaction where nodes represent proteins and connections between nodes physical_interactions tools have been developed to visualize and analyze such networks with cytoscape probably being the most widely_accepted standard platform due to its open structure and extendibility more recently there has been a growing interest in representing protein_structures as so_called residue interaction networks rins rins consider single amino_acids in the protein_structure as nodes and connections as physicochemical interactions such as covalent_bonds and non covalent contacts e g hydrogen_bonds the intuitive idea is to analyze a structure with the same approach as a protein ring allows the user to limit the generated network to buried residues conserved_residues or both intuitively limiting rin analysis to a network of conserved_residues will help to focus on the essential interactions for a protein active_site as shown in the following case study
