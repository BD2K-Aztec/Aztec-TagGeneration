systems_biology integrating literature constrained and data_driven inference of signalling_networks motivation recent_developments in experimental methods facilitate increasingly larger signal_transduction datasets two main approaches can be taken to derive a mathematical_model from these data training a network obtained e g from literature to the data or inferring the network from the data alone purely data_driven methods scale up poorly and have limited interpretability whereas literature constrained methods cannot deal with incomplete networks results we present an efficient approach implemented in the r package cnorfeeder to integrate literature constrained and data_driven methods to infer signalling_networks from perturbation experiments our method extends a given network with links derived from the data via various inference methods and uses information on physical_interactions of proteins to guide and validate the integration of links we apply cnorfeeder to a network of growth and inflammatory signalling we obtain a model with superior data fit in the human liver_cancer hepg and propose potential missing pathways information about signalling_networks is increasingly abundant thanks to novel high_throughput methods large_amounts of data about the interactions among proteins is available which is encompassed in unsigned and undirected proteinprotein_interaction pins more precise but with less coverage_information is derived from literature and is often described by means of signed and directed causal interactions among proteins these give rise to what we will call here prior_knowledge networks pkns pkns are partially collected in different databases e g kegg reactome wikipathways and several are accessible via the portal pathway_commons these databases typically contain literature derived interactions curated with different degrees of stringency and based on experimental publications under different experimental_conditions using different cell_types pkns are for example very useful to study topological_properties of networks or to map data ideker and sharan terfve and saez rodriguez however they are not functional in the sense that they cannot be used for simulation of a signalling process and therefore prediction of the outcome of a certain experiment which is fundamental to understand signal_transduction and its alterations the most common way to model a signalling network is to write down its biochemistry and subsequently translate it to a mathematical form typically a system of differential_equations however information in pkns often lacks the required mechanistic detail in these cases logic formalisms are a useful approach since all they need is to add logic_gates to the existing signed and directed interactions one can generate logic_gates by manual_curation based on literature for example reviewed in an alternative to manual_curation consists of generating a logic model from the pkn that is subsequently trained to experimental_data this method implemented in the bioconductor_package cellnoptr http www ebi ac uk saezrodriguez software html provides context specific models with predictive_power it is efficient at handling large_amounts of data as the space of possible models is limited by the prior_knowledge this key feature of the approach however is also its main limitation there might be missing links as databases are not complete and the effect of cross_talk between pathways is often not taken into account in the canonical linear representation of the pathways hence adding links to the pkn based on the dedicated data can lead to an improved goodness_of with a different and complementary perspective different reverse_engineering methods have been used to infer networks from perturbation experiments using data_driven methods that do not rely on prior_knowledge of the network most of these methods were first developed for transcriptional data but can be applied also to signalling data for example in bayesian_networks were used to infer the connections between proteins with high_throughput data collected using a micro western array two mutual_information based to whom correspondence should be addressed the author s published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work approaches the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular_networks aracne and the context likelihood of relatedness clr were also applied to the same dataset to corroborate the results different methods were also applied in the context of the dream initiative www the dream project org for the dream predictive signalling network challenge twelve research groups inferred signalling_networks from perturbation experiments data and were evaluated based on the accuracy of their predictions of the outcome of the network under different experimental_conditions one of the methods that performed best in this task was a simple approach strictly data_driven that encodes significant effects of stimuli and inhibitors on measured proteins in a causeeffect network these purely data_driven methods need to consider all possible topologies and thus in general need more data and scale up worse than methods that rely on a given topology such as cellnoptr furthermore the resulting data_driven networks that we will call here ddns are limited to interactions between perturbed and measured nodes that are only a subset of the nodes involved in the pathways thus ddns are not as biologically interpretable as the pkns and mapping ddns to pkns is not simple as one link in the inferred network can generally correspond to multiple links in the pkn hence it is not trivial how to correctly map this relationship in this article we attempt to combine the strengths of literature based and data_driven inference methods we describe a procedure implemented in the r package cnorfeeder to integrate prior_knowledge encoded in the pkn with data_driven information obtained using reverse_engineering approaches pins are used to prioritize links and to provide experimental support for them and thus help to discriminate among options and add_information on integrated links the resulting network is then trained against experimental_data to obtain a final refined model that has a better fit to data with respect to the pkn highlighting plausible links that were missing in the pkn we illustrate its application with a signalling network encompassing multiple pathways and readouts trained with data from the liver_cancer cell hepg we show how cnorfeeder provides a significantly_improved fit based on links supported by known interactions among proteins the method was applied to a dataset of a human liver cell_line from the dream_challenge where the phosphorylation of seven proteins akt erk ikb jnk p hsp mek is measured min after combinatorial stimulation with four ligands tnfa il a igf tgfa and four inhibitors pi k ikk p mek the level of phosphorylation of proteins is measured using the luminex xmap assay and provides a value of the phosphorylation in arbitrary_units that can be used to compare values at two conditions in our case we compare the values between and and this change is a proxy of the induced activation of the corresponding protein the normalization of this data to a value between and is achieved using a method based on a set of thresholds as described in according to the cellnoptr pipeline the pkn was first compressed removing all non observable and non controllable nodes and then expanded as described in to include all possible combinations of and and or gates compatible with the network obtaining a total of hyperedges additionally links inferred using feed were integrated in the network according to the procedure previously described and the integrated_network was used for optimization using cellnoptr fixing the influence of the integration penalty on the number of integrated links selected by the optimization_process on the fit of the optimal model to the data in terms of mse was tested as shown in as expected a low value of obtains the best fit but at the price of a high number of integrated links included in the optimal model with an increase of the value of decreases the number of selected integrated links but worsens the fit to the data with only the integrated link tnfa ikk is included in the optimal model the presence of this link is well supported by the data since it lowers the mse from the optimal fit obtained with cellnoptr using as input the non integrated_network to the integrated links can be ranked as shown inaccording to the highest value of allowing their selection and thus according to their effect on the improvement of the fit a lower number of links is selected when using the pin to additionally penalize unsupported links highlighted in dark grey in those links combined with the information from the pin suggest possible missing connections in the pkn for example in the pin there is an interaction between the adaptor irs and the kinase pdk that would justify the link igf akt in the compressed network since in the pkn in supplementary_material igf binds to its receptor and pdk regulates akt links igf igfr and pdk akt in supplementary note that inthe compressed networks are shown and thus intermediates igfr irs s and pdk are not present therefore the path igf igfr irs s pdk akt is supported by a combination of literature and interaction data similarly to support the link tnfa ikk there is a validated interaction between the tnfa receptor and cot a protein that activate ikk leading to the combined pathway tnf tnfr cot ikk inand b the results of cellnoptr optimization with are shown using as input the compressed network and the integrated_network respectively in the upper panels optimal models are shown links selected by the optimization_algorithm are represented with continuous line if derived from the pkn and dotted line if integrated using feed in the lower panel the improvement in the fit is shown from to which is particularly large for proteins ikb mek and akt in this case study using the same parameter setting networks integrated using aracne and clr do not provide an improvement of the fit whereas bayesian_networks obtain an mse of see_supplementary as for the computational times feed clr and aracne inferred the network in second whereas bayesian_inference took h on a cluster to evaluate the scalability of our method we applied cnorfeeder to a larger dataset obtained also in the cell_lines hepg comprising stimuli inhibitors and readouts we obtained comparably good results see_supplementary furthermore we investigated the ability of our method to capture feedback_loops which are fundamental in the regulationof signal_transduction we constructed a toy model containing a negative_feedback and simulated_data at two different time points and min we used feed as a reverse_engineering method to retrieve from the data a link of the feedback that was missing in the pkn and then applied a recently implemented package of cellnoptr www cellnopt org that looking also at the second time point was able to select all links of the feedback_loop see_supplementary for further details a b mapping of the pkn to the pin a represents the subgraph of the pin that include only nodes belonging to the pkn dark grey and nodes used in the mapping of integrated links light grey the network was plotted with r package igraph the same colour code is used for the edges as expected shortest_paths between nodes in the pkn dark grey are generally shorter than paths used to map integrated links light grey this is highlighted also in b where the density of the shortest path_length in terms of number of edges is plotted for integrated links for links in the pkn and for random links exploit data from all multiple combinatorial perturbation experiments it is not the purpose of this study to compare reverseengineering methods which would require a larger set of benchmark networks with known topology and a more realistic simulation of experimental_data the spirit of the article is more in line with the lesson derived from the dream challenges that different approaches can provide complementary insights into the same problem we have thus employed various approaches and we plan to extend it to others in the future furthermore some reverseengineering methods can use prior_knowledge in particular bayesian_inference methods so that we could use the pkn or results from the training with cellnoptr to guide a further search for novel links to conclude the integration of literature constrained and data_driven inference methods overcomes the limitations of both for purely data_driven inference methods the poor scalability as the search_space increases exponentially and limited biological interpretability since they are limited to measured and perturbed proteins excluding intermediate ones and for methods constrained to prior_knowledge their inability to overcome incompleteness in the networks we propose here an approach and software_package to combine them that is effective and extendable to include other methods
