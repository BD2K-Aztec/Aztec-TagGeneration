sesame sequence sorter amplicon explorer genotyping based on high_throughput multiplex amplicon_sequencing characterizing genetic_diversity through genotyping short amplicons is central to evolutionary_biology next_generation ngs_technologies changed the scale at which these type of data are acquired sesame is a web_application package that assists genotyping of multiplexed individuals for several markers based on ngs amplicon_sequencing it automatically assigns reads to loci and individuals corrects reads if standard samples are available and provides an intuitive graphical_user gui for allele validation based on the sequences and associated decision_making tools the aim of sesame is to help allele identification among a large number of sequences availability sesame and its documentation are freely_available under the creative commons attribution noncommercial sharealike unported licence for windows and linux fromsince the breakthrough of pcr in the s researchers have been using various dna_markers and approaches to characterize the genetic_diversity such as microsatellites single_strand sscp and amplified_fragment aflp however direct_sequencing of dna_loci from a large number of individuals was costly and labor_intensive this was even further an issue for nuclear_markers where cloning must precede sanger_sequencing to disentangle alleles technical_advances involved in next_generation ngs_technologies including clonal amplification roche or single_molecule sequencing smrt pacific bioscience open new horizons where gigabases of dna_sequences can be obtained easily one can take advantage from these innovations to directly and massively sequence amplicons however this approach necessitates tagging individual amplicons and sorting out real alleles from reads with sequencing_errors we have created sesame as a user_friendly web_application package for analyzing amplicon sequences obtained through ngs where the amplicon is completely covered by a read it includes automatic sequence assignation to multiple_markers and individuals via oligonucleotide tags it provides an intuitive point and click interface to validate sequences as allele from individual based variant alignments the results are exported as genotypes or sequences of alleles to our knowledge no similar software has been published that accomplishes all these tasks obtaining high number of sequences for amplicons from nuclear_markers brings new challenges with regard to deciphering alleles from each other and distinguishing weakly amplified alleles from sequencing_errors with this respect bioinformatics_tools did not cope yet with the analysis of amplicons sequenced in this highthroughput environment moreover user_friendly tools are needed for sorting and analyzing this type of data as end_users are interested in the biological_information and do not necessarily have programming or sharp bioinformatics skills sesame fills this gap and makes routine sequencing as dna_barcoding of a large number of amplicons at hand sesame is resolutely oriented toward biologists with regard to user_friendly interfacing and easy installation furthermore most functions to support analyses are unique and provide a strong and productive framework for highthroughput amplicon_sequencing conflict of interest none declared
