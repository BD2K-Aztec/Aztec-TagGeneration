genome_analysis identification of human specific transcript variants induced by dna insertions in the human_genome motivation many genes in the human_genome produce a wide_variety of transcript variants resulting from alternative exon splicing differential promoter usage or altered polyadenylation site utilization that may function_differently in human cells here we present a bioinformatics method for the systematic identification of human specific novel transcript variants that might have arisen after the humanchimpanzee divergence results the procedure involved collecting genomic insertions that are unique to the human_genome when compared with orthologous chimpanzee and rhesus_macaque genomic_regions and that are expressed in the transcriptome as exons evidenced by mrnas and or expressed_sequence ests using this procedure we identified transcript variants that are specific to humans were associated with known genes and the remaining transcripts were located in unannotated genomic_loci the original source of inserts was mostly transposable_elements including l alu sva and human endogenous_retroviruses hervs interestingly some non repetitive genomic_segments were also involved in the generation of novel transcript variants insert contributions to the transcripts included promoters terminal exons and insertions in exons splice donors and acceptors and complete exon cassettes comparison of personal genomes revealed that at least seven loci were polymorphic in humans the exaptation of human specific genomic inserts as novel transcript variants may have increased human gene versatility or affected gene_regulation the human_genome acquired many genetic_modifications after the humanchimpanzee divergence some of which may have played a significant role in the evolution of human traits the transcription_factor foxp a gene involved in human speech and language shows accelerated evolution in humans and alterations within this gene may have been responsible for changes in the transcription of central_nervous development genes the har f non coding_gene expressed to whom correspondence should be addressed during cortical development was shown to have increased the rate of nucleotide_sequence substitution in humans in addition at least three human protein_coding have been shown to originate from ancestrally non coding_dna interestingly loss of gene function has also been suggested to play a role in the acquisition of human specific phenotypes for example myh and base were inactivated by a frameshift_mutation krthap and serpina by a nonsense_mutation and cmah moxd and s a a by an exon deletion human specific sequence modifications in cis_regulatory that alter gene_expression and hence may have driven the developmental evolution of humans have also been identified insertion of dna_fragments into a genome plays an important role in the shaping of the genome including the insertion of mobile_elements such as sines and lines retroviruses retrogenes and mitochondrial dnas hazkani most inserted dnas accumulate sequence substitutions and are eventually inactivated however some integrated genetic_elements develop interactions with proximal genes altering the structure or regulation of the adjacent genes in many cases the insertion of alu sequences is deleterious due to strong activation of splice_sites which disrupts host gene_transcript integrity and leads to many genetic_diseases this type of destructive insertion a mechanism known as exonor gene trapping is eventually removed from the gene_pool by strong negative_selection therefore most alu exons that survive are involved in alternative_splicing allowing a substantial portion of the transcript to encode the original functional proteins exonized alu_elements can evolve to acquire protein_coding potential increasing protein versatility the line l retrotransposon intrinsically possesses a polyadenylation_signal and promoter_activity l elements inserted into introns often break the host gene into two separate transcripts by a mechanism called gene breaking alu and l transposable_elements have been found in many human proteincoding_genes implying that they have played_important in gene evolution in this study we developed a bioinformatics method to systematically identify human specific transcript variants that might
