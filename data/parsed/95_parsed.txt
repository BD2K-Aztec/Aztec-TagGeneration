genome_analysis a computational strategy to adjust for copy_number in tumor hi c data motivation the hi c technology was designed to decode the three_dimensional conformation of the genome despite progress towards more and more accurate contact_maps several systematic_biases have been demonstrated to affect the resulting data matrix here we report a new source of bias that can arise in tumor hi c data which is related to the copy_number of genomic_dna to address this bias we designed a chromosome adjusted iterative correction_method called caicb our caicb correction_method leads to significant improvements when compared to the original iterative correction in terms of eliminating copy_number bias availability the method is available at https bitbucket org mthjwu hicapp our knowledge of the higher_order structure of the genome has rapidly expanded over the last decade with the development of several methods able to elucidate the non linear spatial conformation of the genome one important contribution was the development of a chromatin_conformation c based method called hi c which enables high_throughput analysis of spatial_structures of chromatin recent improvements of the hi c protocol led to a characterization of chromatin_structure from many species at increased resolution from the original mb map to the most recent kb map increasing effort has since been devoted to studies of the biological_function and consequences of the d chromatin architecture such as its role in promoter_enhancer regulation and associations between chromatin conformation and dna replication_timing as well as local mutation_rates hi c data at different resolutions may enable researchers to infer different levels of genomic interactions for instance a mb resolution elucidates the overall folding principles of chromosomes which were found to be consistent among different cell_types within each species a kb resolution provides chromosome domain information which is associated with histone_marks and a kb kb resolution enables detailed studies of chromatin looping such as enhancer promoter or enhancer enhancer interactions which can be specific to different cell_types raw hi c data has been observed to have both technical and biological biases with three predominant sources of bias identified so_far fragment length gc bias and mappability to correct for these biases many software_packages have been developed in order to generate an unbiased interaction map hicpipe and hicnorm are explicit correction methods which fit probabilistic and regression_models respectively to normalize the raw hi c map these approaches require a priori_knowledge of the biases another method used in software such as hiclib and hicorrector performs an iterative correction ic which does not require a priori_knowledge of the biases such methods use a matrix balancing or scaling algorithm to iteratively correct for all possible biases based on the assumption that all loci should have equal representation in the data if there is no bias ic based_methods generate a bias vector defined as ic bias icb denoted as b below that converts the raw matrix r to a normalized matrix nij bibjrij in which i and j represent two genomic_loci because of ease of application and high running speed easy transformation between the raw and normalized matrices and no requirement of the explicit_information on biases ic based_methods also called icb correction have become the most widely used hi c normalization approaches that can correct for both known and unknown biases in many current applications a novel source of bias that can arise in hi c data is related to the copy_number of genomic material this type of bias has so_far been unaccounted for since most hi c applications investigate normal_tissue and healthy cell_line samples which have mostly uniform copy_numbers of chromosomes however once tumor_samples are analyzed biases related to copy_number become important and need to be corrected for in order to obtain an accurate view of the interaction map between genomic_locations so_far limited hi c experiments have been carried_out on tumor_samples associate editor dr john hancock the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com for a genome with non uniform copy_number such as that of tumor_cells dna copy_number can introduce critical bias in hi c data because genomic_locations with a higher copy_number have a greater chance to be sequenced in the hi c protocol and genomic_locations with low copy_number might not be detected at all in hi c data we first identified the bias caused by dna_copy by analyzing the encode k hi c data surprisingly we found that the copy_number bias still existed after within chromosome icb correction further analyses demonstrated that the icb method can correct for copy_number biases within each chromosome but not between chromosomes which also cannot be adjusted for simply by using total or average contact counts of chromosomes by utilizing the count distance curve between the contact counts and the genomic_distance between the contact pairs we converted the problem of removing the biases across chromosomes to the problem of minimizing the differences across count distance curves of different chromosomes we thus designed a linear regression_based chromosome level adjustment method called caicb which is based on the icb protocol to correct for this bias we performed the analyses on multiple resolution contact_maps mb kb kb and kb and found that the performance of our caicb correction is significantly better than the original icb method in terms of correcting for copy_number biases our analyses show that the three previously_identified bias factors are also accurately corrected for by caicb furthermore the caicb correction is robust when using a small subset of genomic ranges instead of using the whole_genome contact_map and is easy and fast to apply even for extremely high_resolution maps our method does not require copy_number data for the samples for which hi c data is available and has the potential to adjust for other biases in hi c data without a priori_knowledge our proposed method caicb is able to efficiently correct for the copy_number bias as well as other potential_biases in tumor hi c data without a priori_knowledge of these biases our method is suitable for extremely high_resolution hi c maps because it can achieve robust results when using a small subset of genomic ranges instead of using the whole_genome contact_map the method does not require copy_number data for the samples for which hi c data is available and has the potential to adjust for other possible biases in hi c data without their priori_knowledge despite the fact that copy_number data is not required for the caicb correction algorithm it would be preferable to monitor copy_number bias in the data before and after normalization when analyzing hi c data in tumor_samples this observation arises because for extreme cases such as high_level amplification or near homozygous_deletion which accounts for less than of all locus pairs in k cells but may account for a larger fraction in other tumor_cells the contact counts might either be too high or too low to be corrected for by current methods in these cases careful evaluation of normalization results is necessary to prevent making biased conclusions notably we found that within chromosome copy_number biases are very effectively corrected by the original icb method therefore downstream_analyses such as hi c loops identified by hiccups are not biased even when using icb corrected hi c maps because the background model is built locally within each chromosome however downstream_analyses using the genome_wide background such as the identification of significant contacts by fit hi c can be significantly biased in icb corrected hi c maps this bias is largely eliminated by using the proposed caicb correction furthermore the caicb correction makes the hi c contact counts comparable across the genome and has potential application for comparing hi c data between tumor and normal cells with different genomic copy_numbers
