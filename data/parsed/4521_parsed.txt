tadtool visual parameter identification for tad calling algorithms eukaryotic_genomes are hierarchically_organized into topologically_associating tads the computational_identification of these domains and their associated properties critically depends on the choice of suitable parameters of tad calling algorithms to reduce the element of trial and error in parameter selection we have developed tadtool an interactive plot to find robust tad calling parameters with immediate visual_feedback tadtool allows the direct export of tads called with a chosen set of parameters for two of the most common tad calling algorithms directionality and insulation index it can be used as an intuitive standalone application or as a python_package for maximum flexibility availability_and tadtool is available as a python_package from github https github com vaquerizaslab tadtool or can be installed directly via pypi the python_package index tadtool chromosome_conformation c studies specifically their high_throughput derivative hi c have revealed the hierarchical folding of eukaryotic_genomes chromatin has been found to be typically organized into genomic_regions with a strong enrichment of intra chromosomal contacts these regions termed self or topologically_associating tads can range in size from hundreds to thousands of kilobases with smaller domains often being nested within larger ones a number of algorithms to identify tads computationally have been developed among the most popular and intuitive are the directionality index and insulation index the former calculates upstream and downstream contact biases for each locus along the genome tad boundaries are then generally demarcated by strongly directionally biased loci the latter uses a rectangular sliding_window approach to sum up contacts within a given region_surrounding each locus as tads are regions of increased contacts they can easily be identified via contact count cutoffs the properties of identified domains critically depend on the parameter choice of the applied tad calling algorithms for the directionality index the window_size around a locus for which biases are computed primarily determines the size of the identifiable tads the cutoff used for biases strongly influences the sensitivity_and of tad identification changing the window_size and contact cutoff in the insulation index algorithm has similar effects finding suitable robust parameters for the data_set of interest is often a multistep iterative process of testing and recalculation to reduce the element of trial and error and to facilitate the meaningful identification of self associating domains we have developed tadtool an interactive plot that assists in choosing relevant tadcalling parameters with immediate visual_feedback
