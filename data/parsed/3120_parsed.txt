structural_bioinformatics msmexplorer visualizing markov_state models for biomolecule folding simulations markov_state models msms for the study of biomolecule folding simulations have emerged as a powerful_tool for computational study of folding dynamics msmexplorer is a visualization application purpose built to visualize these msms with an aim to increase the efficacy and reach of msm science in kinetics based markov_state models msms for biomolecule folding simulations conformation space is partitioned according to natural free energy_barriers avoiding problematic clustering approximations since their introduction in programs for generating these models have seen substantial interest and use current visualization_tools for msms are essentially manual inhibiting visual_analysis of msms and slowing down figure production for publications indeed it has become clear that visualization is now a key bottleneck in the use of msms to understand kinetic phenomena of interest msmexplorer is an application to address this visualization bottleneck specifically msmexplorer has three primary_aims to provide a tool for efficient visual_analysis of msms to streamline the production of publication ready figures for common msm network_visualization types to synthesize disparate msm research_tools into a single intuitive graphical_interface a visualization_tool for msms for biomolecule folding simulations called msmexplorer has been developed for the purpose of increasing the efficacy of doing folding science with msms the program is currently being used for visual_analysis and visualization production for publications in the pande lab active development will continue to refine msmexplorer to further achieve its primary aim of advancing folding simulation research
