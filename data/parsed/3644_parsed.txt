gene_expression predicting in vitro drug_sensitivity using random_forests motivation panels of cell_lines such as the nci have long been used to test drug_candidates for their ability to inhibit proliferation predictive_models of in vitro drug_sensitivity have previously been constructed using gene_expression generated from gene_expression these statistical_models allow the prediction of drug response for cell_lines not in the original nci we improve on existing techniques by developing a novel multistep algorithm that builds regression_models of drug response using random_forest an ensemble approach based on classification and regression trees cart results this method_proved successful in predicting drug response for both a panel of breast_cancer and glioma_cell outperformed other methods based on differential_gene and has general_utility for any application that seeks to relate gene_expression data to a continuous output variable implementation software was written in the r language and will be available together with associated gene_expression and drug response data as the package ivdrug at http r forge r project org contact advances in high_throughput drug_screening technologies in the past_years have enabled the testing of hundreds of thousands of drug_candidates on panels of cancer_cell an important goal is applying this information to predict drug response in different cell_lines specific to certain cancer_types and ultimately clinical tumor_samples the enormous diversity of tumor_biology even within cancers from the same tissue makes this aim especially challenging several attempts to create predictive_models of drug response have made use of the nci a panel of human cell_lines originally derived from human_cancers spanning nine different tissues of origin the developmental therapeutics program dtp at the national_cancer has screened nearly compounds against these cell_lines since the origin of the nci program in the late s cell_lines from a particular tissue of origin were eventually shown not to be highly_predictive of human tumors of the same tissue type nevertheless the to whom correspondence should be addressed overall pattern of inhibitory_responses from a particular drug across all cell_lines proved highly useful as a drug response fingerprint that could help pinpoint drug mechanism and efficacy the nci has been extensively molecularly_characterized using a variety of high_throughput assays including five independent gene_expression microarray_experiments utilizing a number of different platforms first applied nci basal resting gene_expression data produced without application of a drug to create predictive_models of drug activity gene_signatures of drugs from genes were created using a weighted voting algorithm which predicted a binary response sensitive or resistant based on an association between gene_expression and drug response the contribution of each gene expression_level in the training_set to the model was weighted by the statistical_correlation between the expression_level for that gene across all cell_lines and the experimentally_determined drug_sensitivity across all cell_lines using this approach one third of the original drugs could predict drug_sensitivity at significant levels p when tested on cell_lines from the nci that had been held out from the original training_set used differential_gene between sensitive and resistant_cell to define a drug signature they showed that signatures produced from the top and bottom responding cell_lines for each drug could be used to create a categorical model for cisplatin and paclitaxel in a panel of bladder_cancer then by screening compounds in the dtp database against the same cell_line panel the authors identified compounds predicted to be effective at inhibiting growth in of cell_lines the top compound hit proved to be a potent_inhibitor of growth in bladder_cancer although the rest of the predictions were not systematically tested recently developed a phenotype based screen_based on the nci signatures developed from ras activation pi k activation as well as tumor_samples from basaldefined breast_cancer were first compared with expression states in cell_lines from the nci cell_lines were ranked by statistically defined similarity to signatures the pearsons_correlation between signature similarity and drug response in the database was then used to identify drugs with similar response patterns although the results were not systematically experimentally tested one drug simvastatin showed the ability to inhibit_tumor of basal type breast_tumors in a mouse_model in an attempt to build on these promising approaches we asked whether the existing_methods could be improved in three specific ways i creation of drug gene_expression based onwe tested the method on two external datasets i breast_cancer tested with the two drugs simvastatin and pepleomycin ii seven glioma_cell tested with fda_approved oncology drugs we have created a novel algorithm for predicting in vitro drug response from a signature of basal gene_expression unlike previous methods this approach incorporates multivariate interaction of input variables gene_expression levels automatically indentifies core cell_lines associated with each drug and models drug response as a continuous variable as demonstrated this approach outperforms a comparable method based on univariate differential_gene although statistical_tests of differential_gene have been an important tool for the analysis of microarray_data interactions between the biological_pathways that drive gene_expression levels provide another layer of information that can be mined using multivariate approaches such as random_forest since regression trees incorporate variable interactions as a natural consequence of data partitioning they provide an ideal algorithmic approach for incorporating variable interactions in the creation of a gene_expression techniques for explicitly encoding gene_gene such a multifactor_dimensionality mdr may also be worthwhile to investigate in future work although single trees do not generally provide the statistical_power of other multivariate techniques ensemble methods such as random_forest that randomly sample from both cases and input variables have shown to be competitive with class leading techniques such as support_vector and stochastic gradient_boosting diaz uriarte and alvarez in addition random_forest requires little or no parameter_tuning and is therefore suitable for machine_learning tasks such an in silico screen that require the creation of a large number of statistical_models the heterogeneity of cell_line panels such as the nci presents a challenge to the creation of drug gene_expression previous workers have created models using only cell_lines from the nci showing extreme_values of ic response to any particular drug however defining resistant and sensitive cell_lines becomes problematic when many drugs show ic distributions across the nci that are not normally or uniformly_distributed using a ranked based definition of drug_sensitivity may also produce nonoptimal training_sets for drugs in which the ic distribution is skewed to overcome these obstacles we created a novel approach to identify core cell_lines for each drug using the case proximity metric in random_forest we note that another group has recently_published a method for associating drugs with sets of core cell_lines however this approach was based on a fully linear method does not incorporate variable interactions and was not used to develop predictive_models of drug response functional screens that combine basal gene_expression and drug response from panels of cell_lines such as the nci may prove to be an important tool for the discovery of compound leadsespecially for complex and heterogeneous_diseases such as cancer by experimentally testing the inhibitory profiles of fdaapproved cancer drugs in seven glioma_cell we have provided one of the most complete validation tests to date of this approach the predictive algorithm that we have developed can be generalized to other problems in machine_learning that require the generation of predictive signatures from large_numbers of input variables that may exhibit a high degree of noise and self correlation
