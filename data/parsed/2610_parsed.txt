jmodeltest org selection of nucleotide_substitution models on the cloud the selection of models of nucleotide_substitution is one of the major_steps of modern phylogenetic_analysis different tools exist to accomplish this task among which jmodeltest jmt is one of the most popular still to deal with large dna alignments with hundreds_or of loci users of jmt need to have access to high_performance clusters including installation and configuration capabilities conditions not always met here we present jmodel test org a novel web_server for the transparent execution of jmt across different platforms and for a wide_range of users its main benefit is straightforward execution avoiding any configuration execu tion issues and reducing significantly in most cases the time required to complete the analysis availability_and jmodeltest org is accessible using modern browsers such as firefox chrome opera safari and ie from http jmodeltest org user registration is not mandatory but users wanting to have additional functionalities like access to previous_analyses have the possibility of opening a user account the statistical selection of best fit models of nucleotide_substitution is relevant for the phylogenetic_analysis of dna sequence_alignments with the advent of nextgeneration_sequencing ngs_technologies many researches are moving from phylogenetics to phylogenomics in which large sequence_alignments typically include hundreds_or of loci phylogenetic resources therefore need to be adapted to a high_performance paradigm so as to allow demanding analyses to keep up with the increasing availability of genome_wide data jmodeltest jmt was recently_developed to profit from technical optimizations and parallel_computing jmt uses phyml to obtain maximum_likelihood of model_parameters and implements different statistical criteria for model_selection including hierarchical and dynamical likelihood_ratio akaikes and bayesian information criteria aic and bic and a performance based decision theory method jmt can take advantage of high_performance hpc environments such as supercomputers and clusters however execution in hpc environments is not trivial i installing configuring and optimizing parallel software are generally cumbersome for non hpc experts ii access to hpc resources generally implies long waiting_times or at least significant variability in the response time and iii it is difficult to estimate in advance the computational_resources needed to overcome_these we introduce jmodeltest org a web_service for executing jmt transparently on hpc infrastructures jmodeltest org can distribute jmt jobs across multiple public or private clouds such as amazon_web aws ec adopting optimal hpc configurations jmodeltest org considers the available resources at each site to minimize execution times and scales the resources up and down depending on the workload such an easy access to hpc resources will allow users to focus more on their research rather than on secondary tasks like resource provision installation configuration execution and optimization of parallel environments
