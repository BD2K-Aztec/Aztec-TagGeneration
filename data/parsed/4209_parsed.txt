services for prediction of drug_susceptibility for hiv proteases and reverse_transcriptases at the hiv drug research_centre the hiv drug research_centre hivdrc has established web_services for prediction of drug_susceptibility for hiv proteases and reverse_transcriptases the services are based on two proteochemometric models which accepts a protease or reverse_transcriptase sequence in amino_acid form and outputs the predicted drug_susceptibility values the predictions are based on a comprehensive analysis where all the relevant inhibitors are included resulting in models with excellent predictive capabilities availability_and the services are implemented as interoperable web_services rest and xmpp with supporting web_pages to allow for individual analyses a set of plugins were also developed which make the services available from the bioclipse workbench for life_science services are available at http www hivdrc org services hiv_protease and reverse_transcriptase rt are two major drug_targets in hiv therapy with several drugs developed to inhibit their functions however the hiv_virus is capable to escape current antiviral_therapy directed at these targets by evolving into drugresistant variants with highly complex mutation_patterns drugs show different efficiency for different viral_strains and it is important to pick the medication which most efficiently can block hiv on individual patient basis several attempts have been made to produce models to predict drug_susceptibility based on the sequenced hiv but the current models are commonly trained only on data for one drug and hence do not make full use of the available information expert systems are also present which build on the experience of physicians and are hence unable to extrapolate and predict the effect of novel mutations the services presented here are founded on proteochemometric models for hiv proteases and reverse_transcriptases a technology which typically produces accurate_predictions based on more information to whom correspondence should be addressed we here present two web_services that predict drug_susceptibility for pis and nrtis from the mutation_patterns of different hiv_strains genome_sequences the services are based on a comprehensive analysis of hiv_protease and rt inhibitors using data from all drugs in each model resulting in a proteochemometric model with excellent predictive_ability the implementation as web_services allows for programmatic_access to the services and for inclusion in workflows the binding_sites for nnrtis and nrtis are different so these compounds cannot be incorporated into one proteochemometric model a separate proteochemometric model for predictions of nnrti drugs is in development
