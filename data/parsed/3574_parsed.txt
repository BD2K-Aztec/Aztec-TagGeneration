pinsnps structural and functional analysis of snps in the context of protein_interaction we present a practical computational_pipeline to readily perform data analyses of pro teinprotein interaction networks by using genetic and functional information mapped onto protein_structures we provide a d representation of the available protein_structure and its regions sur face interface core and disordered for the selected genetic_variants and or snps and a prediction of the mutants impact on the protein as measured by a range of methods we have mapped in total genetic_disorder related snps from omim cancer related variants from cosmic and snps from dbsnp all result data can be downloaded by the user together with an r script to compute the enrichment of snps variants in selected structural regions high_throughput experiments are routinely performed to decipher genetic metabolic and protein_protein ppins and bioinformaticians are compelled to develop efficient and accurate tools to assist decision_making based on available data from multiple sources bioinformatics applications which merge available genomic interaction and structural data can be broadly classified into exploratory or predictive tools the former comprises of tools which map and visualize the merged data while predictive tools are quantitative estimators of the potential impact of snps variants and offer an assessment in terms of scores or pseudo free_energy metrics in this application we use d interactome networks and their homologs to highlight how human variants and disease_causing may affect protein_function and complex stability recent_studies have used the structural_information of ppins to understand_the of binding_partner selection these reliable_methods only consider the interactions that have a representative d structure or a close homolog with a d structure to add weight to the existence of the observed protein interactions or network links in a given ppin multiple studies have pointed_out that the interfaces of protein_complexes harbours mutations associated with diseases b the evaluation of the impact of genomic_variation on coding_regions can be enhanced by mapping snps to distinct regions of protein_structure i e surface interface or core to generate a comprehensive mapping of available v c the author published_by
