emdomics a robust and powerful method for the identification of genes_differentially between heterogeneous classes motivation a major_goal of biomedical_research is to identify molecular_features associated with a biological or clinical class of interest differential_expression has long been used for this purpose however conventional methods perform poorly when applied to data with high within class heterogeneity results to address this challenge we developed emdomics a new method that uses the earth movers distance to measure the overall difference between the distributions of a genes expression in two classes of samples and uses permutations to obtain q values for each gene we applied emdomics to the challenging_problem of identifying genes associated with drug_resistance in ovar ian cancer we also used simulated_data to evaluate the performance of emdomics in terms of sensitivity_and for identifying differentially_expressed gene in classes with high within class heterogeneity in both the simulated and real_biological emdomics outperformed competing approaches for the identification_of and emdomics was significantly more powerful than conventional methods for the identification of drug_resistance associated gene_sets emdomics represents a new approach for the identification of genes_differentially between heterogeneous classes and has utility in a wide_range of complex biomedical conditions in which sample classes show within class heterogeneity availability_and the r package is available atgenomic methods enable the measurement of tens_of to millions of molecular analytes in parallel from a single sample a major_goal of biomedical_research is to use these technologies to identify molecular_features e g gene_expression associated with a biological or clinical class of interest leading to improved understanding of disease_pathogenesis and the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics statistical_methods have beenin this work we proposed to use the distance between the distributions of expression values for array based data or normalized read_counts for sequence_based data to_identify when there is a high_level of heterogeneity between and within the groups we developed a new method emdomics based on the earth movers distance emd for computing the distance between the distributions of expression values or normalized read_counts and for the identification of genes significantly_differentially between heterogeneous groups conventional methods such as t test based or fisher exact testbased approaches perform well for the identification of genes_differentially between homogeneous classes of samples however many problems in biology and biomedicine contain samples that show both significant intra_and class heterogeneity if the sources and structure of the heterogeneity are known ahead of time then they may be incorporated into the analysis using conventional approaches e g stratification inclusion of an interaction_term however frequently the sources and structure of intra group heterogeneity are unknown in these cases failure to account for the presence of intra group heterogeneity will result in high intra group variance driving high p values even for genes that may truly be associated with a biological class our analyses on both simulated_and show that considering whole distributions with emdomics has more power to capture heterogeneity and identify genes and gene_sets that are expressed differently between two heterogeneous groups the emdomics method has several strengths and limitations its primary strength is that it is a robust non parametric method which does not make any assumptions about the distributions or differences between the two classes being compared and thus has significantly more power than conventional approaches for identifying differential omics features between heterogeneous classes thus the method can be applied in a wide_variety of settings to compare distributions of omics_data between two classes a further strength of the method is that efficient algorithms are available to compute emd however there is no free lunch in statistics and emdomics has a few limitations first emdomics can currently only be used for two class problems and cannot be used with quantitative or multiclass labels second because emd is based on comparing the histograms of the two groups it requires at least a moderate sample_size samples per class and will tend to perform poorly when there are few samples third a significant emd value does not allow any inference to be made regarding the direction or structure of an association it provides evidence that a gene is expressed differently in some way between two classes which can then lead to further follow_up analyses and experimental_studies to more precisely characterize the association and its clinical and biological_significance despite the methods limitations our data suggest that emdomics is a powerful new approach for identifying_differentially between heterogeneous classes of samples although we demonstrate one application of emdomics it can apply to identify other genomics data types such as copy_number data as well as to other types of populations such as populations of single_cell measurements given ongoing major efforts to generate massive omics_datasets ranging in scale from single_cell genomics to population_based omics studies in molecular_epidemiology to investigate a wide_array of questions in biomedicine we expect emdomics to be a useful new tool for the identification of genes and gene_sets differentially_expressed between heterogeneous classes of samples area under the curve auc true_positive tpr and false_positive fpr of emdomics cvm and ks tpr and
