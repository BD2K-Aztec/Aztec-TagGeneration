pdiviz analysis and visualization of protein dna_binding interfaces specific recognition of dna by proteins is a crucial step of many biological_processes pdiviz is a plugin for the pymol molecular_visualization system that analyzes proteindna binding interfaces by comparing the solvent_accessible of the complex against the free protein and free dna the plugin provides three distinct three_dimensional visualization modes to highlight interactions with dna bases and backbone major and minor_groove and with atoms of different pharmacophoric type hydrogen_bond donors acceptors hydrophobic and thymine methyl each mode comes in three styles to focus the visual_analysis on the protein or dna side of the interface or on the nucleotide_sequence pdiviz allows for the generation of publication quality images all calculated data can be written to disk and a command_line is provided for automating tasks the plugin may be helpful for the detailed identification of regions involved in dna_base and shape readout and can be particularly useful in rapidly pinpointing the overall mode of interaction availability_and freely_available melolab org pdiviz as a pymol plugin specific recognition of dna by proteins is a prerequisite of many biological_processes and is essentially understood when analyzed at a three_dimensional d structural level the steadily_increasing number of proteinnucleic acid complexes deposited in the protein_data by end of now allows for a more fine_grained structural analysis of the key determinants of proteindna_interactions these interactions may be broadly classified into base readout sequence_dependent interactions with dna bases via the major or minor_groove and shape readout detection of global or local variation of the canonical dna shape however proteindna_interactions are complex and a simple recognition code does likely not exist d visual_analysis of proteindna complexes today often requires the use of several computer programs for contact analysis and visualization here we present pdiviz a plugin for the pymol molecular_visualization system schr dinger llc that is specifically_designed to visualize proteindna interfaces and to focus visual_analysis on various aspects of proteindna_interactions
