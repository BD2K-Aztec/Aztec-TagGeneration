gene_expression cellmix a comprehensive toolbox for gene_expression deconvolution gene_expression data are typically generated from heterogeneous biological_samples that are composed of multiple cell or tissue_types in varying proportions each contributing to global gene_expression this heterogeneity is a major confounder in standard analysis such as differential_expression where differences in the relative proportions of the constituent cells may prevent or bias the detection of cell specific differences computational deconvolution of global gene_expression is an appealing alternative to costly physical sample separation techniques and enables a more detailed analysis of the underlying biological_processes at the cell_type level to facilitate and popularize the application of such methods we developed cellmix an r package that incorporates most state of the art deconvolution methods into an intuitive and extendible framework providing a single entry_point to explore assess and disentangle gene_expression data from heterogeneous_samples availability_and the cellmix package builds on r bioconductor and is available from http web cbio uct ac za renaud cran web cellmix it is currently being submitted to bioconductor the packages vignettes notably contain additional information examples and references
