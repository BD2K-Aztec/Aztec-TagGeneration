structural_bioinformatics sspro accpro almost perfect prediction of protein secondary_structure and relative_solvent using profiles machine_learning and structural_similarity motivation accurately predicting protein secondary_structure and relative_solvent is important for the study of protein evolution structure and function and as a component of protein_d pipelines most predictors use a combination of machine_learning and profiles and thus must be retrained and assessed periodically as the number of available protein_sequences and structures continues to grow results we present newly trained modular versions of the sspro and accpro predictors of secondary_structure and relative_solvent together with their multi class variants sspro and accpro we introduce a sharp distinction between the use of sequence_similarity alone typically in the form of sequence_profiles at the input level and the additional use of sequence_based which uses similarity to sequences in the protein_data to infer annotations at the output level and study their relative_contributions to modern predictors using sequence_similarity alone sspros accuracy is between and for accpro and no other predictor seems to exceed however when sequence_based is added the accuracy of sspro rises to for accpro thus by combining both approaches these problems appear now to be essentially solved as an accuracy of cannot be expected for several well known reasons these results point also to several open technical_challenges including i achieving on the order of accuracy without using any similarity with known proteins and ii achieving on the order of accuracy using sequence_similarity alone availability_and sspro sspro accpro and accpro programs data and web_servers are available through the scratch suite of protein_structure predictors at http scratch the prediction of protein structural_features such as secondary_structure and relative_solvent are useful for the study of protein evolution structure and function and as modular components of protein_d pipelines most of the best predictors use a combination of machine_learning and evolutionary_information in the form of multiple_alignment profiles and thus must be retrained and assessed periodically as the available protein data continues to grow here we present the results obtained by modifying and retraining sspro and accpro two widely used predictors of secondary_structure and relative_solvent respectively and broadly assessing prediction_performance in these fields it has been known for two decades that evolutionary_information in the form of profiles calculated on similar sequences helps predictors in the case of secondary_structure for instance performance accuracy improves by roughly percentage_points when profiles are used in the input as opposed to raw sequences alone it is also known that using profiles in the output by predicting the secondary_structure of each sequence in an alignment and taking the majority of each column leads to a smaller improvement over using the raw sequences alone furthermore using profiles in both the input and the output usually leads to no significant_improvement over using profiles in the input alone machine_learning predictors developed during the past_two have been almost exclusively focused and evaluated on their ability to predict the secondary_structure or relative_solvent from the sequence or the profile alone the past_decade of work has not produced major prediction improvements resulting in a set of competing predictors with similar methods training_datasets protocols and most importantly similar prediction performancesfor instance roughly around for secondary_structure this is despite the number of experimentally solved structure deposited in the protein_data pdb which has significantly_increased over the same period and continues to increase faster each year however besides using sequence_similarity to create input profiles there is potentially a second way of using sequence_similarity to leverage the growth of the pdb and improve predictions namely if a portion of a query_sequence is similar to a sequence in the pdb it may be possible to use the annotation of the pdb sequence to annotate the query_sequence in lieu or in combination with the prediction produced by the machine_learning this is what we call sequence_based although the correlation between sequence_similarity and structure similarity is not perfect to whom correspondence should be addressed it is well known that two domains with similar sequences will in general have similar structures there are good reasons to suspect that sequence_based may be effective a simple analysis of the pdb entries released between and figs and reveals that as of today only of the amino_acids deposited in the pdb each month belong to protein regions with no similarity to sequences previously deposited in the pdb furthermore this percentage is decreasing year after year finally when we examine the large redundancy reduced and representative set of all proteins uniref we find that of its sequences have at least one domain with a similarity of to a sequence in the pdb thus in short the main purposes of this article besides the upgrade of existing predictors is to study in detail the effectiveness of sequence_based for secondary_structure and relative_solvent prediction alone and how it can be combined with predictions derived by machine_learning with profiles to improve the overall stateof the art results obtained following the two protocols described in section are summarized in the accuracy of the predictors on the pdb full and pdb ante datasets is obtainedfollowing the p protocol whereas the accuracy of the predictors on the pdb post dataset is obtained following the p protocol using both sequence_similarity and sequence_based sspros accuracy is on pdb full and when trained on pdb ante pdb entries released before may and evaluated on the recent pdb entries in pdb post released after may this is considerably better than any other existing predictor including the previous release of sspro this result combined with the initial analysis performed on the pdb and uniref databases see section highlights the interest of systematically combining sequence_based with profile_based machine_learning without using sequence_based the accuracy of the best secondary_structure predictors including sspro is estimated to be between and thus lower than the accuracy of sspro after combining the raw predictions with the ones based on known protein_structures it is useful to contrast the combination of both approaches with the use of sequence_based alone for instance using sequence_based alone predictions can be made for of the amino_acids in the dataset pdb post with an overall accuracy of sspros accuracy as a function of sequence_similarity and identity is reported in showing that as soon as similar sequences can be found in the pdb even with low sequence_identity or similarity with the target protein the prediction_accuracy significantly increases sspro is also the only secondary_structure predictor made publicly_available for download which includes both profile generation and sequence_based modules similarly at the accessibility threshold accpro accuracy is on pdb full and on pdb post above any other predictor and about better than the accuracy of the previous accpro release a similar detailed_evaluation of the predictors accuracy as a function of sequence_identity and similarity is provided in results for sspro and accpro multi class variants sspro and accpro also show significant improvements sspro is the eight class version of sspro predicting the protein secondary_structure using the eight different classes assigned by dssp the sequence_based analysis is available for the first time for this kind of predictor and results in an accuracy of on pdb full and on pdb post a improvement over the last published accuracy of the sspro predictor accpro is the class version of accpro predicting if an amino_acid is buried or exposed for different relative_solvent thresholds accpro prediction_accuracy is in the hard case accessibility threshold and is now comparable with the accuracy of accpro note that both predictors have no other existing method to be directly compared with finally redundancy in the sspro and accpro training_sets was reduced using first a sequence_identity threshold this is a common practice in the field established over the years through many trial and errors and aimed at balancing multiple constraints in particular redundancy reduction versus training_set size however there is nothing fundamental about such a threshold and one might be concerned by the existence of proteins in the training and test_sets that are remotely homologous with a level of sequence_identity which could lead to overestimating the accuracy of the predictors to address this point first note that we used a more stringent redundancy reduction procedure than a simple identity cutoff by using an additional hssp distance cutoff see section second we conducted one additional set of tests for each test protein in pdb full we used psi_blast to extract any segment of length at least with sequence_identity of at least with any other protein in the training_set in total of amino_acids in the test_set were found to occur in such segments leaving ofnote accuracy reported for the pdb full and pdb ante datasets is obtained following protocol p and accuracy reported for the pdb post dataset is obtained following protocol p accuracy reported for accpro is the accuracy at the accessibility threshold accuracy of the newly trained versions of sspro and accpro are reported in bold font previous published accuracy of the predictors is also reported accuracy of distill and psipred are reported for the same datasets using the downloadable packages made available by the authors see section
