inferring combinatorial association logic networks in multimodal genome_wide screens motivation we propose an efficient method to infer combinatorial association logic networks from multiple genome_wide measurements from the same sample we demonstrate our method on a genetical genomics dataset in which we search for boolean combinations of multiple genetic_loci that associate with transcript_levels results our method provably finds the global solution and is very efficient with runtimes of up to four orders_of than the exhaustive_search this enables permutation procedures for determining accurate false_positive and allows selection of the most parsimonious model when applied to transcript_levels measured in myeloid_cells from genotyped recombinant inbred_mouse we discovered that nine gene_clusters are putatively modulated by a logical combination of trait loci rather than a single locus a literature_survey supports and further elucidates one of these findings due to our approach optimal solutions for multi_locus logic models and accurate estimates of the associated false_discovery become feasible our algorithm therefore offers a valuable alternative to approaches employing complex albeit suboptimal optimization strategies to identify complex models availability the matlab_code of the prototype implementation is available on http bioinformatics tudelft nl or http bioinformatics to explain complex biological_phenomena it is of vital importance to measurein the same sampleall relevant complementary biological variables and to measure these at a genome_wide scale for this reason many multimodal screens have been performed that have complemented transcriptional_profiling with among others copy_number measurements transcription_factor binding_assays methylation status profiling or genotype_calls a common aim in analyzing these multimodal datasets is to find associations between the biological variables measured to infer their regulatory_role consider for instance a study in which expression_profiles and genome_wide genotype data were obtained in hematopoietic_cells from a panel of fully homozygous recombinant inbred_mouse this genetical genomics approach to whom correspondence should be addressed enables the determination of expression_quantitative eqtls characterized by strong associations between the genotype and the observed expression levels in the absence of a strong direct association between the genotype and gene_expression real multi_locus interactions may still be present due to epistatic interaction such interactions may not be detectable as marginal direct_associations between the genotype and gene_expression to alleviate this approaches which evaluate the joint association of multiple_loci and a phenotype of interest are required several approaches have been proposed to attack this problem these approaches differ mostly regarding the way the associations are modeled and the strategy employed to solve the combinatorial_optimization some approaches follow what could be loosely termed a two stage approach where all two locus models are first evaluated which in stage two are used in a greedy search to yield multilocus models approaches employing more advanced strategies to traverse the space of possible models are represented by a genetic_programming approach and markov_chain mcmc approaches associated with bayesian analyses since twostage approaches have been demonstrated to be suboptimal and advanced search_strategies such as mcmc are very sensitive to their implementation and parameter_settings and are not guaranteed to be optimal an approach that finds a provably global solution to a selected model within reasonable time is highly_desirable of particular interest is the method ofwhich is used for the pair scan analysis that is available on the genenetwork on http genenetwork org stress the importance of performing a global search rather than relying on greedy searches by pre selecting markers based on their marginal_effects to deal with the computational_complexity associated with such an optimization_problem the authors present a method to find global optima of a linear regression_problem for up to three predictors that is fast enough to be employed in permutation procedures in contrast to the class of additive models employed by and many other approaches we follow others and employ boolean combinatorial logic to explicitly incorporate interactions in the eqtl inference to this end we infer combinatorial association logic cal networks that combine the observed genotypes through and or and xor
