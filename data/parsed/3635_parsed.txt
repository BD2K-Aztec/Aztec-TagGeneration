predac h a user_friendly platform for antigenic surveillance of human influenza a h n virus based on hemagglutinin sequences motivation timely surveillance of the antigenic dynamics of the influenza_virus is critical for accurate selection of vaccine_strains which is important for effective prevention of viral spread and infection results here we provide a computational platform called predac h for antigenic surveillance of human influenza a h n virus based on the sequence of surface protein hemagglutinin ha predac h not only determines the antigenic variants and antigenic cluster grouped for similar antigenicity to which the virus belongs based on ha sequences but also allows visualization of the spatial distribution and temporal_dynamics of antigenic clusters of viruses isolated from around the world thus assisting in antigenic surveillance of human influenza a h n virus availability_and it is publicly_available from the seasonal influenza_viruses i e the influenza a h n a h n and b virus causes continual epidemics to human society due to their frequent antigenic_drift timely surveillance of the antigenic dynamics of influenza_viruses is critical for selection of appropriate vaccine_strains the world_health who established a global influenza surveillance network which is composed of national influenza centers from all over the world to monitor the spread and antigenic_variation of influenza_viruses who despite these global efforts vaccine mismatches occasionally happen given the feasibility of rapid and high_quality sequence_determination a number of sequence_based computational_approaches have been developed to understand the antigenic properties and previously we developed a computational_method predac to infer antigenic clusters for human influenza a h n virus based on protein_sequences of the immunodominant part of ha ha by accurate capture of the antigenic characteristics of the virus predac proved helpful to improve the accuracy of vaccine recommendation in mainland_china here we made it easy to use for the public and further built a user_friendly platform predach for antigenic surveillance of human influenza a h n virus this could assist in timely and accurate selection of vaccine_strains
