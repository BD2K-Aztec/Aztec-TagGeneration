sequence_analysis plaac a web and command_line application to identify proteins with prion like amino_acid prions are self templating protein_aggregates that stably perpetuate distinct biological_states and are of keen interest to researchers in both evolutionary and biomedical_science the best understood prions are from yeast and have a prion forming domain with strongly biased amino_acid most notably enriched for q or n plaac is a web_application that scans protein_sequences for domains with prion like amino_acid users can upload sequence files or paste sequences directly into a textbox plaac ranks the input_sequences by several summary scores and allows scores along sequences to be visualized text output_files can be downloaded for further analyses and visualizations saved in pdf and png formats availability_and http plaac wi mit edu the ruby based web framework and the command_line software implemented_in with visualization routines in r are available at http github com whitehead plaac under the mit_license all software can be run under os x windows and unix prions are proteins that can switch from non aggregated states to self templating highly_ordered aggregates this property allows them to confer stable changes in biological_states that are of great interest in molecular and evolutionary_biology for example they create neurodegenerative_diseases perpetuate activity states in neural synapses and provide access to a broad realm of phenotypic diversification in microbes the ability to identify potential prion like proteins from sequence_data would speed the search for new prions across a wide_variety of taxa we previously_developed a hidden_markov hmm to identify candidate prions and parse these candidates into prion like domains prlds and non prlds on the basis of amino_acid aa composition briefly the hmm has two hidden_states for prld and background and the output symbols are the aas the output probabilities for the prld state were constructed based on the aa frequencies in the prlds of four prions of saccharomyces_cerevisiae that were known at the time this algorithm and extensions have since been used in several studies to identify prion like sequences in yeast and also in humans in which several proteins with prlds are associated with als and related neurodegenerative_disorders here we describe a web_based front end to the prion prediction algorithm plaac and give an overview of implementation and extensions further details are provided on the plaac web_site multiple_sequences and whole proteomes to scan multiple protein_sequences including whole proteomes the user again pastes or uploads them in fasta_format upload is recommended for more than a few sequences l core and parameters may be adjusted and background frequencies may be computed directly from the provided sequences not recommended if uploading or pasting just a few sequences the user is presented with a summary table with a row for each uploaded protein ranked by corescore from highest to lowest and then may select candidates in this summary list to generate plots for further visualization output ranking and scores multiple_sequences are ranked for prion like properties by the corescore metric which is the maximum sum of per residue log likelihood_ratios for any subsequence of length l core that falls entirely within the prld state in the hmm viterbi parse provided a sequence of this length exists and is undefined nan otherwise in addition we compute a score llr for log likelihood_ratio that is otherwise identical to corescore but without the requirement that the sequence falls entirely within the prld state of the hmm parse because llr does not impose a hard cutoff it can be useful when doing exploratory whole proteome analyses e g on the overall distribution of near prlds however examining whether the region with the highest llr score falls entirely within the prld state in the hmm parse may be informative e g when selecting domains to clone for studies of candidate prlds fused to reporter proteins algorithm updates since the publication of the aa frequencies for the prld state of the hmm have been updated based on candidate prlds that showed switching behavior or strong amyloid_formation experimentally see source_code for details these updated aa frequencies were used in later publications a subsequent algorithm called papa that uses aa scores derived from a random_mutagenesis screen can downweigh many of the apparent false_positives from and can give sharper predictions for the results of point_mutations it appears that a small number of hydrophobic_residues can speed amyloid_formation in regions otherwise highly_enriched for polar uncharged residues such as q and n plaac and papa are complementary as plaac identifies such regions and papa has been validated only on such regions single scores based on local averages of per residue aa scores do not adequately capture the trade_off between hydrophobic and polar uncharged residues we reimplemented papa and included this score in the output and visualizations along with predictions of intrinsically unfolded protein regions from a reimplementation of foldindex it is also important to note that there are several known prions that are not strongly q n rich e g het s prp mod but as systematic experimental screening for prion like propagation is lacking for non q n rich proteins it is difficult to estimate the false_negative of these algorithms plaac has been developed as a web_application to allow users to scan single protein_sequences as well as whole proteomes for the presence of prlds we have also augmented the original algorithm with additional scores making unified comparisons possible
