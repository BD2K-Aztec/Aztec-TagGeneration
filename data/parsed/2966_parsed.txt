mimeanto profiling functional rna in mutational interference mapping experiments the mutational interference mapping experiment mime is a powerful method that coupled to a bioinformatics analysis_pipeline allows the identification of domains and structures in rna that are important for its function in mime target rnas are randomly mutated selected by function physically separated and sequenced using next_generation ngs quantitative effects of each mutation at each position in the rna can be recovered with statistical certainty using the herein developed user_friendly cross_platform software mimeanto mime analysis tool availability_and mimeanto is implemented in c using the boost library as well as qt for the graphical_user and is distributed under gpl http www gnu org li cences gpl the libraries are statically linked in a stand alone executable and are not required on the system the plots are generated with gnuplot gnuplot iostream https github com dstahlke gnuplot iostream serves as gnuplot interface standalone executables including examples and source_code can be downloaded from https github com maureensmith mimeanto rna has long been believed to mainly serve as a blueprint for proteins however a large diversity of so_called noncoding_rnas have been discovered lately to regulate virtually all cellular_processes characterizing functional_domains and structurefunctionrelationships in rna is a major_challenge as classical experimental_approaches are time consuming and require substantial investigator expertise to overcome these obstacles we recently_developed mime where rna is randomly mutated selected byfunction e g binding to a protein physically separated and sequenced using ngs consequently quantitative effects of mutations at every nucleotide position can be recovered after a single experiment the mutation frequencies recovered from ngs in the functionally selected vs non selected pools contain information about the function and structural commitment of each nucleotide within the analyzed rna i e a mutation that does not affect selection is not required for the function of the rna since ngs_reads r from the mime experiment are confounded by errors introduced during library_preparation and sequencing see allowing the relative dissociation_constant of mutation m at nucleotide position i kd m kd w i to be re computed in a jackknifelike fashion for each position j jni above r m w i j denotes the number of reads that carry a mutation m at position i and a wildtype residue at position j i and e j j w m i denotes the expected probability of falsely detecting a wild_type at position i as a mutant m which is used for error_correction in this note we present the user_friendly cross_platform software mimeanto which evaluates mime data following error_correction statistical ascertainment and quality_assessment mathematical foundations and a user_manual are provided as supplementary texts mimeanto has a wizard like graphical_user guiding through the data analysis procedure in three steps i data input and assessment ii sequencing and reverse transcription error_correction and iii quantification of raw effects and quality filtering note because rna is structurally flexible our method is unique as it allows to characterize functionally_relevant structure s of the rna which can inform fundamental_research as well as drug_design
