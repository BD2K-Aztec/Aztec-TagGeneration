cgmisc enhanced genome_wide association_analyses and visualization high_throughput and sequencing_technologies facilitate studies of complex genetic_traits and provide new research_opportunities the increasing_popularity of genome_wide gwas leads to the discovery of new associated loci and a better understanding of the genetic_architecture underlying not only diseases but also other monogenic and complex phenotypes several softwares are available for performing gwas analyses r environment being one of them results we present cgmisc an r package that enables enhanced data analysis and visualization of results from gwas the package contains several utilities and modules that complement and enhance the functionality of the existing software it also provides several tools for advanced visu_alization of genomic_data and utilizes the power of the r language to aid in preparation of publication quality figures some of the package functions are specific for the domestic dog canis familiaris data availability_and the package is operating system independent and is available from https high_throughput and sequencing has opened several new research_opportunities to study complex genetic_traits and genome_wide gwas is a popular way to analyse genotyping_data from segregating populations widely used gwas softwares include plink emmax gcta and genabel a single software_package is rarely sufficiently complete to cover all aspects of a typical genome_wide analysis_pipeline transferring data between different softwares is often a laborious process one advantage of the genabel package that often makes it the software of choice is that in addition to gwas specific functionalities it provides access to the r r development core language and community contributed packages here we developed a number of algorithms and solutions to several common gwas tasks some of these solutions aim at facilitating production of publication quality data results visualization see e g several cgmisc functions have been used to produce results and visualizations for peer_reviewed e g here we present these and more functions in the form of the documented and supported r package cgmisc
