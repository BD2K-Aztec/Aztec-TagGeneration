sequence_analysis mgaviewer a desktop visualization_tool for analysis of metagenomics alignment data numerous metagenomics projects have produced tremendous amounts of sequencing_data aligning these sequences to reference_genomes is an essential analysis in metagenomics studies large_scale alignment data call for intuitive and efficient visualization_tool however current_tools such as various genome_browsers are highly_specialized to handle intraspecies mapping results they are not suitable for alignment data in metagenomics which are often interspecies alignments we have developed a web browser_based desktop_application for interactively visualizing alignment data of metagenomic_sequences this viewer is easy to use on all computer systems with modern web_browsers and requires no software installation availability http weizhonglithe advances of next_generation have promoted big waves of metagenomic_projects in study of microbiomes under different environments such as ocean and human_body an essential step in metagenomic_data analysis is to align the sequencing_reads against the available microbial_genomes visualization is an intuitive way to analyze large_scale alignment data in genomic studies there are many visualization_tools available some are web browser_based such as ucsc_genome lookseq and jbrowse some are standalone programs such as tablet genomeview mapview igb igv samscope and so on however these sophisticated visualization_tools are specialized in handling intraspecies alignment results i e query and reference are same species they are not suitable for interspecies alignments from metagenomic_datasets where query and reference can be from different species there are fundamental_differences between intraspecies and interspecies alignments the former only involves one reference_genome and represent features like single_nucleotide and alternative_splicing but the latter involves multiple often reference microbial_genomes to visualize interspecies alignments a tool needs to show the wide_range of alignment similarities to as low as for dnas and for proteins and to handle thousands of reference_genomes the global ocean sampling study first introduced fragment recruitment plots to illustrate the metagenomic alignment data however its underlying software is not available to the public here we present metagenomic alignment viewer mgaviewer a platform independent web browser_based tool for visualizing alignment data it does not rely on web_server and relational_database for image generation and data_retrieval it can be simply used as a standalone desktop program to analyze local data it can also be included in a web_server like other web_based genome_browsers mgaviewer has an interface for users to select one or more metagenomic_samples and a reference from a list of reference_genomes to generate the plot the screenshots of mgaviewer are shown in the plot shows alignments from eight metagenomic_samples to a reference_genome the x axis is the genome coordinate and y axis is alignment identity alignments are coloured by sample and are represented as points or lines depending on zoom level the bottom of the plot shows genes of the reference_genome and the top shows the genome_coverage for each sample icons at left and right bottom corners are for zoom resize and reset users can also zoom or pan the map by mouse the inside circular images are zoomed views of the plot we tested mgaviewer on million alignment datasets between metagenomic_samples from camera and genomes from ncbi mgaviewer provides real_time visualization for almost all these datasets except a few hundred very large_datasets which need extra several seconds for data loading and plotting mgaviewer is already adopted by camera project in its alignment resources which will be described in a separate publication mgaviewer can be used to analyze alignment data not only for prokaryotic species but also for viruses and small eukaryotic_organisms
