sequence_analysis codon optimization online cool a web_based multi_objective platform for synthetic gene design codon optimization has been widely used for designing synthetic genes to improve their expression in heterologous host_organisms however most of the existing codon optimization tools consider a single design criterion and or implement a rather rigid user_interface to yield only one optimal sequence which may not be the best solution hence we have developed codon optimization online cool which is the first web_tool that provides the multi objective codon optimization functionality to aid systematic synthetic gene design cool supports a simple and flexible interface for customizing various codon optimization parameters such as codon adaptation_index individual codon_usage and codon pairing in addition users can visualize and compare the optimal synthetic sequences with respect to various fitness measures user_defined dna_sequences can also be compared against the cool optimized sequences to show the extent by which the users sequences can be further improved availability_and cool is free to academic and non commercial users and licensed to others for a fee by the national university of singapore the advent of synthetic_biology ushered in the new era of life_science research where synthetic genetic_circuits e g artificial biomolecules usually nucleotides can be constructed and inserted into the living host to perform novel biological_functions such as a metabolic_pathway a specific cell_signalling response and or novel gene_regulation however the desired biological_functions can be achieved only if the synthetic genes are properly expressed within the host organism therefore it is highly required to develop a systematic framework that rationally designs the synthetic genes for optimal expression in the recombinant host factors_affecting the expression of recombinant genes have been well studied the codon_usage pattern which relates to relative_abundance of trna isoacceptors has been implicated as one of the crucial determinants of heterologous protein expression_level however experimental_studies have shown that the precise factors and their relative_contributions are unclear computational_tools such as jcat synthetic gene designer and optimizer have been developed to quantify and optimize the codon_usage frequency of the coding_sequence in terms of the hosts codon adaptation_index cai or individual codon_usage icu moreover the optimization of codon pairing also known as codon context cc has been demonstrated to be effective in improving heterologous gene_expression additionally the presence of hidden stop_codons hsc also prevents off frame reading thereby reducing resource wastage and maximizing the hsc count might increase gene_expression thus several design factors should be simultaneously considered for better synthetic gene design to address such a need for incorporating multiple design_parameters including cai icu cc and hsc in codon optimization we have developed a new web_server application codon optimization online cool using a multi objective framework which has been presented in a recent work
