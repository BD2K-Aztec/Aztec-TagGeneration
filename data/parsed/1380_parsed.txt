gene_expression differential_gene analysis using coexpression and rna_seq motivation rna_seq is increasingly being used for differential_gene analysis which was dominated by the microarray_technology in the past_decade however inferring differential_gene based on the observed difference of rna_seq read_counts has unique challenges that were not present in microarray_based analysis the differential_expression estimation may be biased against low read_count values such that the differential_expression of genes with high read_counts is more easily detected the estimation bias may further propagate in downstream_analyses at the systems_biology level if it is not corrected results to obtain a better inference of differential_gene we propose a new efficient algorithm based on a markov_random mrf model called mrfseq that uses additional gene coexpression data to enhance the prediction power our main technical contribution is the careful_selection of the clique potential functions in the mrf so its maximum a posteriori estimation can be reduced to the well known maximum flow problem and thus solved in polynomial time our extensive experiments on simulated and real rna_seq demonstrate that mrfseq is more accurate and less biased against genes with low read_counts than the existing_methods based on rna_seq alone for example on the well studied maqc dataset mrfseq improved the sensitivity from to for genes with low read_counts availability mrfseq is implemented in c and available atnext generation sequencing_technologies have been widely used in genomics research rna_seq one of the most exciting applications of next_generation is used to reveal the complexity of tanscriptomes in biological_systems many unprecedented discoveries are being made by rna_seq such as the inference of novel isoforms characterization of the modes of antisense regulation and study of intergenic expression_patterns in recent_years rna_seq has taken a major role in the quantitative analysis of gene_expression and transcript variant discovery in the past_decade most of these applications were dominated by microarray based_technologies in these quantitative_assays rna populations are partially sequenced and the obtained read sequences are aligned back to the reference_genome the aligned_reads are then assigned to genes based on the common regions that they share in the alignment the number of reads assigned to a gene is called the read_count of the gene which has been shown to be nearly linearly correlated with the expression_level of a gene differential_gene analysis is to identify if genes express differently between biological conditions of interest given rna_seq read count_data detecting differentially_expressed de or equally expressed ee genes can be done by checking if the observed difference of the read_counts is significant or not i e greater than some natural random variation to test the significance of the difference between rna_seq read_counts the distribution of read_counts was first assumed to be poisson in however the poisson_distribution may underestimate the variance of read_counts and cause unexpected false_positives in differential_gene analysis to solve the problem negative_binomial distributions were applied to rna_seq read data and have become the state of the art statistical_model other than the methods based on the poisson or negative_binomial distributions two data_driven probabilistic methods bayseq and noiseq have also been proposed moreover given annotated or inferred mrna_transcripts or isoforms of genes some statistical_methods for detecting differential_expression at the transcript_level have been published_recently because the expression_level of a gene with known or inferred isoforms can be calculated by simply summing up the expression levels of its isoforms these transcript_level methods can be used as alternative_methods for detecting differential_expression of isoforms although the accuracy of these methods clearly depends on the quality of the provided isoforms although the statistical_properties of rna_seq have been well studied and taken into account in the above statistical_methods these methods suffer from the following issues first it has been observed that statistical_power increases with read_count to whom correspondence should be addressed values note that the read_count of a gene is proportional to the gene expression_level multiplied by the gene length as a result long or highly_expressed are more likely to be detected as de genes compared with their short and or lowly_expressed counterparts this bias in de gene detection is unavoidable even when normalization or rescaling is applied to read count_data it is known that the selection_bias on de genes if uncorrected may lead to biased downstream_analyses second the dependency among the expression of genes is not used in these methods in gene_expression analysis based on microarray_data the prior_knowledge of gene coexpression patterns has been used to improve the performance of algorithms for detecting phenotype related pathways searching for significant pathway regulators identifying differential gene_expression and the classification of microarray_data in particular to obtain more accurate inference of de genes wei and li proposed a markov_random mrf model that integrates the gammagamma model based on microarray_data and gene coexpression_networks extracted from kegg_pathways such that de genes can be determined by the maximum a posteriori map estimation of the mrf model their experimental_results demonstrate that the additional gene coexpression information can help detect more subtle changes of gene_expression e g local disturbances within known pathways and significantly improve the overall prediction_accuracy of de genes however due to the difference between continuous microarray intensity values and discrete rna_seq read_counts the mrf model in cannot be applied to rna_seq immediately moreover because the map estimation problem for an mrf model is generally np_hard the mrf model in was solved by a heuristic_method iterated conditional modes which provides an approximately optimal prediction with no confidence_scores in this work we propose a novel mrf model mrfseq combining rna_seq read_counts with the prior_knowledge of gene coexpression_networks to infer de genes different from the mrf model in we choose the clique potential functions of the mrf model carefully so that the map estimation of de genes can be reduced to the wellknown maximum flow problem on flow networks based on the work of kolmogorov and zabih because the maximum flow problem is polynomial time solvable our mrf model can be solved exactly in polynomial time moreover we introduce a loopy belief_propagation method to calculate the confidence of each inferred de or ee gene our extensive experiments on simulated and real rna_seq demonstrate that mrfseq achieves a much improved overall estimation performance by gaining considerable sensitivity without losing precision a detailed analysis of the prediction results indicates that the de genes predicted by mrfseq are distributed more evenly across different values of read_counts than those recovered by the existing_methods using rna_seq alone hence mrfseq can help alleviate the selection_bias of de genes against genes with low read_counts our analysis further shows that most of the de or ee genes that can be correctly_predicted from rna_seq alone are also correctly_predicted by mrfseq implying that the use of the prior_knowledge of gene coexpression does not introduce new biases in the differential analysis result moreover we compare mrfseq with a recently_published transcript_level method cuffdiff on the real rna_seq using the annotated transcriptome from ucsc hg the comparison shows that mrfseq is much more sensitive than cuffdiff the rest of this article is organized as follows
