databases_and curation integration and visualization of bacterial_virulence in patric motivation weve developed a highly curated bacterial virulence_factor vf library in patric pathosystems resource integration center www patricbrc org to support infectious_disease research although several vf databases are available there is still a need to incorporate new knowledge found in published experimental_evidence and integrate these data with other information known for these specific vf genes including genomic and other omics_data this integration supports the identification of vfs comparative_studies and hypothesis_generation which facilitates the understanding of virulence and pathogenicity results we have manually_curated vfs from six prioritized niaid national_institute of allergy and infectious_diseases category ac bacterial_pathogen genera mycobacterium salmonella escherichia shigella listeria and bartonella using published_literature this curated information on virulence has been integrated with data from genomic functional_annotations trancriptomic experiments protein_protein and disease information already present in patric such integration gives researchers access to a broad array of information about these individual genes and also to a suite of tools to perform comparative_genomic and transcriptomics analysis that are available at patric availability_and all tools and data are freely_available at patric http patricbrc org virulence_factors vfs are an important class of gene_products that help pathogens to evade a specific hosts defensive mechanisms to establish infection in a specific environmental condition thereby resulting in a disease_state for that host studying vfs facilitates our understanding of pathogenicity and infectious_disease mechanisms and helps researchers to develop new methods for disease prevention and therapy there are a few existing vf databases that provide comprehensive collections of bacterial vf genes such as vf database vfdb http www mgc ac cn vfs mvirdb http mvirdb llnl gov and victors http www phidias us victors these resources link published information about virulence directly to the genes or to protein_families that contain the genes other resources like uniprot and kegg kyoto_encyclopedia designate specific genes as vfs without necessarily showing the published support of this declaration despite these resources there remains a need to further identify vf genes link them with published experimental_evidence and integrate that data with the wealth of omics_data that can reveal protein_function expression_patterns or other information that show the genes role in virulence and the disease processes the pathosystems resource integration center patric is the all bacterial bioinformatics resource center designed to support basic and applied biomedical_research on bacterial infectious_diseases patric supports a variety of diverse data types such as genomics transcriptomics proteinprotein_interactions d protein_structures and dna_sequence typing data with their associated metadata patric also provides analysis tools for genome_annotation comparative_genomics transcriptomics pathways hostpathogen interaction and disease related information integrating bacterial vf genes is a logical next step in these data_integration effort in the present work we manually_curated vfs from six prioritized national_institute of allergy and infectious_diseases niaid category ac bacterial_pathogen genera http www niaid nih gov topics biodefenserelated biodefense pages cata aspx mycobacterium salmonella escherichia shigella listeria and bartonella and integrated the curated information into patric in addition we also integrated the vf information from vfdb and victors into patric the resulting integrated information can be easily accessed and visualized through patrics web_interface by leveraging the curated vfs the information from both vfdb and victors and the preexisting patric resources patrics vf module enables users to access the comprehensive omics and host pathogen disease information about the vf genes perform comparative_genomic and transcriptomics analysis for these vfs and store the analyzed information in their private workspace the private workspace then becomes an important hypothesis generating capability for bench biologists to advance vf knowledge and develop counter measures to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work
