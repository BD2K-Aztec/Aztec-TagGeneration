gene_expression magic access portal to a cross_platform gene_expression compendium for maize to facilitate the exploration of publicly_available zea_mays expression data we constructed a maize expression compendium making use of an integration methodology and a consistent probe to gene_mapping based on the b sequence release of z mays the compendium is made available through a web_portal magic that hosts a variety of analysis tools to easily browse and analyze the data our compendium is different from previous initiatives in combining expression values across different experiments by providing a consistent gene_annotation across different platforms owing to its importance as sustainable food and feedstock maize genomics is of high academic and industrial relevance as a result microarrays have been widely_applied to interrogate the maize transcriptome with currently maize gene_expression experiments being publicly_available in online repositories such as geo and arrayexpress however cross_platform differences the lack of consistent platform and measurement descriptions and inconsistent gene_annotations in maize complicated the straightforward use of these data to integrate the data from different array platforms in a readily usable single compendium we resolved gene_annotation inconsistencies by reannotating probes of previously_published zea_mays arrays using the published maize genome_sequence and made measurements comparable across different platforms experiments using an adapted version of the data_integration method described by this resulted in a cross_platform expression compendium containing microarrays covering genes additional gene information was integrated from various external sources experimental annotations were manually_curated a web access portal magic with a specialized set of exploration and analysis functionalities provides public access to this compendium
