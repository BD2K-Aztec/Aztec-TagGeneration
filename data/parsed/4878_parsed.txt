von bertalanffy a cobra toolbox extension to thermodynamically constrain metabolic models_motivation in flux_balance of genome_scale stoichiometric models of metabolism the principal constraints are uptake or secretion_rates the steady_state mass conservation assumption and reaction directionality here we introduce an algorithmic pipeline for quantitative assignment of reaction directionality in multi compartmental genome_scale models based on an application of the second law of thermodynamics to each reaction given experimental or computationally estimated standard metabolite species gibbs_energy and metabolite_concentrations the algorithms bounds reaction gibbs_energy which is transformed to in vivo ph temperature ionic_strength and electrical_potential results this cross_platform matlab extension to the constraint based reconstruction and analysis cobra toolbox is computationally_efficient extensively documented and open_source ludwig von sought a theory encompassing universal principles applying to systems in general von and emphasized the role of thermodynamics in understanding biological_systems in modeling the overall behavior of a genome_scale stoichiometric model of metabolism one of the key constraints is reaction directionality which is required to follow the second law of thermodynamics at constant temperature pressure ph_and this requirement means that the stoichiometrically weighted_sum of transformed gibbs_energy of net substrates must exceeds that of net products with experimentally_derived or computationally estimated standard reactant gibbs_energy of formation if one assumes a typically narrow physiological_range of reactant concentrations one may constrain reaction directionality on a genome_scale the constraint based reconsruction and analysis cobra toolbox is a growing suite of matlab functions for quantitative_prediction of cellular_metabolism here to whom correspondence should be addressed we introduce an extension of the cobra toolbox for quantitative assignment of stoichiometric model reaction directionality via integration of experimentally_derived and group contribution estimates of standard gibbs energies of formation and reactant concentrations encoded in a single extensively documented pipeline is a thorough thermodynamic treatment of the necessary transformation of such data to in vivo temperature as well as compartment specific ph ionic_strength and electrical_potential for multi compartment_models the pipeline automatically generates extensive statistics and figures focusing on quantitative reaction directions that disagree with reconstruction directions manually assigned from literature the cobra toolbox supports model exchange via the sbml and libsbml thereby the extension reported herein may be applied to an arbitrary mass and charge balanced metabolic reconstruction this pipeline facilitates the quantitative thermodynamic assignment of reaction directionality using experimentally_derived standard metabolite species gibbs energies of formation together with group contribution estimates the code is appropriate for reaction thermodynamics at biochemically relevant ph ionic_strength and electrical_potential ranges the stoichiometric metabolic reconstruction can be multicompartmental but should pass certain quality_controls such as elemental and charge balance of each reaction
