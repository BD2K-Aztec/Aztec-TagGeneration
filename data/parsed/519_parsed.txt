genetics_and assessing association between protein truncating variants and quantitative_traits motivation in sequencing studies of common diseases and quantitative_traits power to test rare and low_frequency variants individually is weak to improve power a common approach is to combine statistical_evidence from several genetic_variants in a region major challenges are how to do the combining and which statistical_framework to use general approaches for testing association between rare_variants and quantitative_traits include aggregating genotypes and trait_values referred to as collapsing or using a score based variance_component test however little attention has been paid to alternative_models tailored for protein truncating variants recent_studies the important role that protein truncating variants commonly referred to as loss of function variants may have on disease_susceptibility and quantitative levels of biomarkers we propose a bayesian modelling framework for the analysis of protein truncating variants and quantitative_traits results our simulation_results show that our models have an advantage over the commonly used methods we apply our models to sequence and exome array data and discover strong evidence of association between low plasma triglyceride_levels and protein trun cating variants at apoc apolipoprotein c availability software is available from http www well ox ac uk rivas mamba contact advances in dna_sequencing and customized exome arrays are quickly transforming the landscape of genomic studies of diseases and related quantitative_traits in sequencing studies of common diseases and quantitative_traits power to individually test any rare or low_frequency variant is typically weak in attainable sample_sizes hence to boost the ability to detect signal evidence is combined across variants when designing such an aggregation test there are three main_questions to consider across which biological units should variants be combined which variants mapping within those units should be included which statistical_models should be used as for the first question an obvious choice of biological unit across which to combine variants is the gene and we focus on this throughout the article considering all the coding_sequence of the gene as the relevant unit an alternative would be to combine variants across all genes within a pathway but this adds several complications not least because of the currently rather imprecise knowledge of biological_pathways within a gene one could include all observed variants but this would be likely to include many neutral variants and or variants with opposite_direction of effects both of which can lead to loss of power under many statistical_methods the ideal approach would be to combine only those variants that affect the trait of interest this is however difficult in practice because these will not be known in advance one approximation would be to include only the variants with functional effects even this is challenging with current limited knowledge of the function of coding variants in the human_genome commonly used predictors of the function of non synonymous variants can often be unreliable one class of variants where functional prediction is much more straightforward is that which truncates the resulting protein product stop gain frameshift coding splice disrupting the functional prediction is made based on the translational consequence of a mutation against a reference transcript set for example gencode protein truncating variants ptvs are typically subject to nonsense_mediated nmd a cellular_mechanism that detects nonsense_mutations and prevents the expression of truncated proteins resulting in loss of function of that copy of the protein to a first approximation ptvs are thus likely to have the same functional_consequence namely loss of function to whom correspondence should be addressed we have developed and studied a novel statistical_method for assessing the association between ptvs and a quantitative_trait the approach is formulated in a bayesian statistical_framework and can be used in a bayesian_framework or in providing a test_statistic for frequentist application bayesian application is recommended in ranking genes for follow_up in a discovery dataset the frequentist application allows calculation of p values for association which can be helpful in settings where these are required we have presented two versions of the method in the first sem all ptvs are assumed to have effects in the same direction this would be appropriate for example if all ptvs were thought to result in loss of function of that copy of the gene we also described a more general version of the approach allowing different classes of ptv in terms of their effect on trait_values we see the major application of this more general method in taking a more nuanced view of the consequences of ptvs and distinguishing between those likely to be subjected to nmd and those that escape nmd e g many or all ptvs in the last exon of the gene and may result in gain of function as our biological understanding of the nmd mechanism increases we expect that it will add power to allow potentially different effects for ptvs escaping nmd for example by applying gem nmd in which they may have similar effects or different effects and sem in which their effect on the trait would be the same even though the molecular consequences of the mutation would be different finally we have established and replicated an association between ptvs in apoc and lowering of plasma triglyceride_levels
