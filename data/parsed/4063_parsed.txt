robust quantitative scratch assay the wound_healing assay or scratch assay is a technique frequently used to quantify the dependence of cell motilitya central process in tissue_repair and evolution of diseasesubject to various treatments conditions however processing the resulting data is a laborious task due its high_throughput and variability across images this robust quantitative scratch assay algorithm introduced statistical outputs where migration_rates are estimated cellular behaviour is distinguished and outliers are identified among groups of unique experimental_conditions furthermore the rqsa decreased measurement errors and increased accuracy in the wound boundary at comparable processing_times compared to previously_developed tscratch availability_and the rqsa is freely_available at http ophid utoronto ca rqsa rqsa scripts zip the image sets used for training and validation and results are available at since cell_migration is significant in repair processes and disease advancement such as metastasis and cancer angiogenesis it can be used as a parameter to describe the state of health of various cell_lines furthermore quantification of cell_migration can be used to measure the effect of drug_treatments on the same cell_line the wound_healing assay wha is used to quantify motility by monitoring the evolution of a wounded monolayer of cells the experimental set up consists of growing a confluent monolayer of cells under specific conditions i e treated or not treated with a drug then creating a wound or scratch on each layer well and then imaging all wounds multiple times over a period of time since the rate how wounds close may depend on conditions used measuring wound areas from individual images are used to estimate migration_rates and thus quantify condition specific cell_motility provide_extensive insight on experimental_design considerations and workflow of the wha measurements in order to obtain reliable results it is necessary to measure wound areas across multiple replicates of the same cell condition and record multiple frames per replicate to determine_whether changes are statistically_significant to make this task feasible an automated system is required to process the high volumes of data and make measurements independent of image artefacts such as uneven illuminations smudges or scratches on the well plate lid in addition to some variation of initial wound width and shape sample images of wound areas are shown in supplementary_material the robustness and improved_performance of the rqsa algorithm was evaluated over a robustness seta set of images n with various features such as high low image illumination resolution cell confluence and stray cells in the wound_area open wound areas and wound estimate were measured with the rqsa algorithm and tscratch were compared to manual measurements shows the error in open wound_area for this subset section in supplementary_material describes these metrics of comparison with more detail and discusses the robustness of the algorithm a paired_t was performed on the errors in open wound_area and errors in wound estimate using both methods where resulting p values p determined that there is a statistical_difference between both methods overall rqsa showed better representation of the wound boundaries resulting in a more accurate estimate of migration_rates over all conditions both methods were tested using a validation_set and results were compared by determining r from the fitted curves in both experimental_conditions the non treated condition with rqsa shows an r value centered at suggesting that the open wound areas vs frame from the rqsa algorithm yield a better description of the temporal_behavior of the wound and shows less variability across time points meanwhile the lower r values of the tscratch polynomial fits suggest that measurements fluctuate highly from one frame to the other the rqsa was run using an additional independent set with a different cell_line and treatments to demonstrate its robustness results of both datasets with statistical_analysis including average migrations rates uncertainties identified possible well outliers and are further discussed in section of supplementary_material future_directions for the rqsa include the incorporation of cell segmentation routines to provide a morphological and proliferation assessment on individual cells and implementation of parallel_computing techniques to decrease processing_times and increase efficiency conflict of interest none declared
