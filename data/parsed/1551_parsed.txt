gene_expression efficient methods for identifying mutated driver pathways in cancer motivation the first step for clinical_diagnostics prognostics and targeted_therapeutics of cancer is to comprehensively understand its molecular_mechanisms large_scale cancer_genomics projects are providing a large_volume of data about genomic epigenomic and gene_expression aberrations in multiple_cancer one of the remaining challenges is to identify driver_mutations driver_genes and driver pathways promoting cancer proliferation and filter out the unfunctional and passenger ones results in this study we propose two methods to solve the so_called maximum_weight submatrix problem which is designed to de_novo identify mutated driver pathways from mutation data in cancer the first one is an exact method that can be helpful for assessing other approximate or and heuristic_algorithms the second one is a stochas tic and flexible method that can be employed to incorporate other types of information to improve the first method particularly we propose an integrative model to combine mutation and expression data we first apply our methods onto simulated_data to show their efficiency we further apply the proposed methods onto several real_biological such as the mutation profiles of head_and samples glioblastoma tumor_samples and ovarian carcinoma_samples the gene_expression were also considered for the later two data the results show that our integrative model can identify more biologically_relevant gene_sets we have implemented all these methods and made a package called mutated driver pathway finder which can be easily used for other researchers cancer is a complex disease which has been one of the most serious threats to human_health people have realized that cancer is related to genome aberrations that include gene_mutations copy_number and so on through these aberrations the cancer_cells can acquire the ability of infinite proliferation while normal cells dont due to the self correction mechanism another dreadful feature of cancer_cells is that some of them can spread to other tissues through blood_circulation or lymphatic system this largely reduces the effectiveness of surgery to treat_cancer generally the genome aberrations in cancer_cells can be divided_into two types one type is neutral to cancer proliferation and the other can promote the cancer cell to proliferate infinitely and diffuse we usually call the former type of mutations as passenger mutation and the latter as driver_mutation undoubtedly finding out the driver_mutation driver gene as well as driver pathway is a key to understand_the of cancer_progression which further aid in designing_effective drugs to treat_cancer with the development_of a huge number of mutation profiles of samples for many cancer_types are available now designing_effective bioinformatics_tools to mine useful information from these data is a challenging_task in gene level much effort has been devoted to detect the genes with significantly_higher mutation_rate across samples than background_mutation several studies have detected some important gene_mutations in cancer_progression but they cant capture the heterogeneity of genome aberrations many studies found that there is little overlap between the gene_mutations of two samples even if they come from the same patient it is well known that different gene_mutations may target the same pathway therefore it is necessary to shift the point_of from gene to pathway level which is helpful to capture the heterogeneous patterns in cancer there have been several studies to discover the mutation_patterns in pathway level most of them are based on known information about pathways and try to find out which ones are significantly perturbed however this kind of methods has one obvious limitation they only consider those known pathways taking_into the incompleteness of knowledge about pathways it is indispensable to develop new algorithms to discover mutated driver pathways or gene_sets without relying on prior_knowledge given the huge number of genes in the whole_genome it seems to be an unsolvable problem to enumerate and test all the to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as candidates due to the enormous_number of possible gene combinations several recent_studies about combinatorial patterns of mutations in cancer shed light on how to solve this problem they found that driver pathways often cover a large number of samples more importantly usually a single mutation is enough to perturb one pathway in other words the mutation of genes in one pathway usually exhibit mutual_exclusivity there have been several studies using these rules to expand the existing pathway based_methods and identify completely new gene_sets proposed the method mutual_exclusivity modules memo to detect modules that obey the mutual_exclusivity rule within a gene functional network constructed based on prior_knowledge in contrast proposed a method that identifies functional_modules without any information other than patterns of recurrent and mutually_exclusive aberrations more recently introduced a novel scoring_function by combining two measures i e coverage and exclusivity to identify the mutated driver pathway using the mutation data the maximization of this scoring_function is defined as the maximum_weight submatrix problem which was solved by a stochastic_search method however there is still no exact algorithm for solving this problem moreover considering the noise of the mutation data its interesting to incorporate more information into this framework to improve this model in this study we propose two methods to solve the so_called maximum_weight submatrix problem which is designed to de_novo identify mutated driver pathways from mutation data in cancer the first one is based on a binary linear_programming blp model which is an exact method this method can be employed for assessing other approximate or and heuristic_algorithms the second one is based on the genetic_algorithm ga which is a stochastic and flexible method it can be employed to optimize other scoring_functions or incorporate other types of information to improve the first method we have integrated the gene_expression data to achieve this to test the efficiency of our methods we first apply them onto simulated_data and compare them with another method we further apply our methods onto five biological_datasets the results show that our integrative model can identify more biologically_relevant gene_sets than the one without expression data we first applied our blp and ga methods onto simulated_data to test their performance and compare them with the mcmc method to show their efficiency and characteristics
