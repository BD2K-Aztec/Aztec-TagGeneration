genome_analysis copymap localization and calling of copy_number by joint analysis of hybridization data from multiple_individuals the program package copymap identifies copy_number from oligo hybridization and cgh data using a time dependent hidden_markov to combine evidence of copy_number cnvs across multiple carriers copymap is substantially more accurate than standard hidden_markov methods in identifying cnvs and calling cnv carriers moreover copymap provides more precise estimates of cnv boundaries availability the c source_code and detailed documentation for the program copymap is available on the internet atcopy number variants cnvs are segments of the genome that exist in different copy_numbers in the population about of cnvs have two allelic states the remaining have multiple states as cnvs encompass genes as well as non coding_dna they are good candidates for functional variation commonly used method for identifying copy_number variable_sites are representational oligonucleotide microarray_analysis agilent competitive genomic hybridization cgh and tiling arrays these methods interrogate dna using a dense set of probes covering the non repetitive_regions of the genome however the resolution of each individual probe is usually low as cnvs often extend over multiple probes resolution is improved by combining information across neighboring probes hidden_markov hmm methods are among the most commonly_applied tools to analyze such data first proposed by these methods exploit the local correlation of trait status and are computationally highly_efficient more complex versions of these algorithms specifically_designed for cnvs have since been developed and applied to large_datasets however most hmm algorithms analyze datasets one individual at a time thus cnvs that are shared among individuals are only identified after comparing cnv_calls between individuals conceptually this approach has two disadvantages first no detection_power is gained by the fact that multiple_individuals carry the same cnv in most regions of the genome cnvs are rare or absent and therefore models assign a low_probability of transitioning into the cnv state however at a locus known to have variable copy_number in one individual the probability that another individual has a variant copy_number at the same locus should be higher jointly analyzing individuals results in a higher detection rate secondly each time a cnv is identified its borders will be estimated independently of all other individuals jointly estimating the borders from all carriers results in a more efficient use of information this idea has been applied in several recent methods for mapping cnvs in selected regions from genotyping_data i present the program copymap an alternative hmm method for cnv_detection and cnv_calling that jointly analyzes genomewide data for all individuals in a sample copymap is specifically_designed for hybridization arrays but it can also be applied to single_nucleotide genotyping_arrays
