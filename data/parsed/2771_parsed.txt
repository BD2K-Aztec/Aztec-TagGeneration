databases_and maconda a publicly_accessible mass_spectrometry contaminants database mass_spectrometry is widely used in bioanalysis including the fields of metabolomics and proteomics to simultaneously measure large_numbers of molecules in complex biological_samples contaminants routinely occur within these samples for example originating from the solvents or plasticware identification of these contaminants is crucial to enable their removal before data analysis in particular to maintain the validity of conclusions drawn from uni and multivariate statistical_analyses although efforts have been made to report contaminants within mass_spectra this information is fragmented and its accessibility is relatively limited in response to the needs of the bioanalytical community here we report the creation of an extensive manually well annotated database of currently known small_molecule contaminants availability the mass_spectrometry contaminants database maconda is freely_available and accessible through all major brow sers or by using the maconda web_service http www maconda our understanding of biological_systems has considerably improved through recent_developments in mass_spectrometry ms based_metabolomics continuous efforts have been made to improve the quality of metabolome measurements including in sample_preparation data_collection and data analysis the majority of experimental_data reported in the literature has been collected in positive_ion which is reflected in the database also the amount of ms_ms data for contaminants is currently rather limited however the database has the capability to store this type of data as more is recorded by the community as such and to the best of our knowledge this is the first publicly_accessible readily searchable readily implementable into an automated computational_pipeline readily expandable database of mass_spectral contaminants a summary of the maconda features the total database is freely_available in several formats e g tab_delimited csv xml and sql format
