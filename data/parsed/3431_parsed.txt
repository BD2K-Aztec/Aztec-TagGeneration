genome_analysis parsec pattern search and contextualization we present parsec pattern search and contextualization a new open_source platform for guided discovery allowing localization and biological_characterization of short genomic_sites in entire eukaryotic_genomes parsec can search for a sequence or a degenerated pattern the retrieved set of genomic_sites can be characterized in terms of i conservation in model_organisms ii genomic_context proximity to genes and iii function of neighboring genes these modules allow the user to explore visualize filter and extract biological_knowledge from a set of short genomic_regions such as transcription_factor availability web_site implemented_in javascript and c with all_major freely_available at lbgi fr parsec source_code is freely_available at sourceforge net_projects genomicparsec genomic_sites are short genomic_regions with a defined biological_function e g regulation of gene_expression splicing or epigenetic signals most genomic_sites are represented by degenerated motifs with a scattered distribution and can either be specific to a given species or conserved between species the characterization of these sites is a major_challenge in the exploitation of next_generation data and in understanding genome expression the in silico detection of these motifs in complete_genomes is associated with a huge amount of noise consequently the development of a computational platform for accurate definition of genomic_sites requires the integration of various large_scale biological data resources to filter out false_positives parsec pattern search and contextualization is a modular web_service designed for the rapid localization and characterization of genomic_sites the main program exploits an efficient data_structure namely compressed suffix_trees cst to rapidly localize sequences or degenerated patterns in complete eukaryotic_genomes eight species are currently available human mouse rat chicken zebrafish drosophila nematode and yeast this pattern search module is linked to three in house modules for conservation analysis genomic_context analysis and functional filtering as well as to the gominer functional enrichment tool it can be used to filter biologically_meaningful genomic_sequences to complement transcriptomic_data analysis and to further characterize known genomic_sites in contrast to web_services dedicated to genomic pattern searches like tagscan or to functional_interpretation of genomic_regions like great parsec proposes both search and characterization aspects in a single intuitive_interface guiding the user through the discovery path the genomic_context module also based on data from ucsc tables ensgene ensemblsource ensembltogenename trnas allows the detection of gene_candidates spatially linked to the site of interest again a high_level of customization is provided analyses can be performed relative to the two gene boundaries or to the transcription_start several types of genes are available protein_coding mirna snrna snorna trna etc the user can retrieve all genes in proximity of the site or can choose only the closest gene to the site the full set of alternative transcripts of proximal genes with their relative distances to the site is also provided and can be visualized through a link to ucsc for the enrichment module we developed a layer allowing the use of gominer as a simple java_library it allows the functional characterization of a previously_identified set of proximal genes and query sites this can be useful for identification of processes regulated by a transcription_factor for example the functional filtering step allows the selection of sites potentially related to specific molecular_functions biological_processes or cellular_components at each step the results can be saved as browser_extensible bed or comma separated values csv format files and include various links to external resources ucsc ensembl for additional information the algorithmic complexities and running_times of the different modules are provided in supplementary dataset s
