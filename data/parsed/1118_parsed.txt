structural_bioinformatics computational_prediction of n linked glycosylation incorporating structural_properties and patterns motivation n linked glycosylation occurs predominantly at the n x t s motif where x is any amino_acid except proline not all n x t s sequons are glycosylated and a number of web_servers for predicting n linked glycan_occupancy using sequence and or residue pattern information have been developed none of the currently available servers however utilizes protein structural_information for the prediction of n glycan_occupancy results here we describe a novel classifier algorithm nglycpred for the prediction of glycan_occupancy at the n x t s sequons the algorithm utilizes both structural as well as residue pattern information and was trained on a set of glycosylated protein_structures using the random_forest algorithm the best predictor achieved a balanced accuracy of under fold_cross on a curated dataset of n x t s sequons and outperformed sequence_based pre dictors when evaluated on the same dataset the incorporation of structural_information including local contact order surface accessi bility composition and secondary_structure thus improves the prediction_accuracy of glycan_occupancy at the n x t s consensus sequon availability_and nglycpred is freely_available to non commercial users as a web_based server at http exon niaid nih gov nglycpred n linked glycosylation the attachment of glycan to the amide nitrogen of asparagine is an ubiquitous co post_translational in eukaryotic_cells that occurs as the nascent protein is extruded into the endoplasmic_reticulum glycosylation plays an important role in a number of biological_processes ranging from protein_folding sorting and degradation to immune_response n linked glycosylation occurs predominantly at the sequons n x t and n x s with rare occurrence at n x c where x is any standard amino_acid except proline studies suggest that about half of n x t s sequons might be glycosylated and an accurate algorithm that could predict the glycan_occupancy the presence_or of a glycan at these sequons would be useful for understanding and utilizing this ubiquitous co post_translational protein_modification a number of algorithms trained with sequence or sequencebased information have been developed to improve the prediction of n linked glycosylation to that end trained artificial_neural on the surrounding sequence of the n x t s sequons trained ensembles of support_vector classifiers based on sequence neighbors used the random_forest rf algorithm with pairwise patterns andtrained support_vector classifiers based on surrounding sequence whole protein_sequence and sub cellular_localization information statistical_analyses however have demonstrated that in addition to sequence differences there are also structural_differences between protein residues in spatial_proximity to glycosylated versus nonglycosylated sites thus the incorporation of protein structural_information might be expected to improve the prediction of the glycan_occupancy the incorporation of structural_features in the prediction of n linked glycan_occupancy was previously_reported in a conference proceeding however the statistical differences between structure based and sequence_based predictors were not analyzed and no publicly_available software or web_server was provided in this article we report the development of the theoretical basis for and the properties of a novel predictor nglycpred which predicts the glycan_occupancy of n x t s sequons of eukaryotic_proteins nglycpred was trained on n linked glycosylated proteins with structures available in the rcsb_pdb database using the rf algorithm in essence the rf algorithm uses multiple classification trees constructed with different boot strap samples from the original data with each tree participating in the final classification the algorithm is efficient and can handle numeric and nominal values simultaneously the ability to predict n glycan_occupancy should allow for a better understanding of overall protein_structure as well as the aforementioned biological_processes and may also assist in the design of hyperglycosylated immunogens statistical_analyses showed that nglycpred performed significantly better than the sequencebased predictors generated using the same dataset nglycpred is available in the form of a web_server andto our knowledge is the first publicly_available web_server to predict n glycan_occupancy at n x t s sequons that is trained on information derived from experimental_structures five classes of rf predictors were defined predictors trained on structural_properties only predictors trained on sequence only predictors trained on pattern only predictors trained on structural_properties and sequence and predictors trained on structural_properties and pattern see methods section the performances of these predictors were evaluated based on fold_cross of our dataset the performances of the best rf predictors ranked by balanced accuracy the average value of true_positive and false_positive from each of the five classes are shown inour results indicate that the incorporation of structural_information can improve the prediction of glycan_occupancy of n x t s sequons in our study the rf predictors generated using structural_information with or without additional pattern information outperformed the predictors trained on sequence_information with statistical_significance as well as a number of other sequence_based servers that were evaluated on our dataset supplementary overall a comparison between different predictors and their underlying algorithms is complicated by the fact that the predictors and their respective servers were developed and optimized on different datasets nevertheless analyses based on our dataset clearly demonstrated that predictors generated using structural_properties could give better predictions than those generated solely by sequence_information differences in local structural_features between glycosylated and non glycosylated sequons were not only observed in our dataset but also in previous_studies moreover recent evidence has shown that specific amino_acid could directly stabilize the first n_acetylglucosamine of the glycan suggesting that in addition to sequence structural_features could directly affect glycan_occupancy a comparison of the best predictors built on all four and three of the four structural_properties and supplementary suggested that the ss property might be the most important factor in the improvement of the prediction_accuracy surface_accessibility played a lesser role although the sequons with sa less than the threshold had a much higher_tendency to be non glycosylated of the non glycosylated sequons compared with of the glycosylated sequons sa of of the entries out of were above the threshold and thus the property was less effective for improving prediction_accuracy the reason for the lesser_effect of local contact order on prediction_accuracy could be similar for example in the case of l non glycosylated entries were enriched in the set with co of the non glycosylated sequons compared with of the glycosylated sequons co of out of however were below the threshold several limitations are inherent to our current approach the protein_structures used to generate the dataset only encompass a very small subset of the eukaryotic proteome although we only selected crystal_structures with resolution better than to generate the dataset the presence or the conformation of specific amino_acid or sugar residues could still be ambiguous in some cases to increase the reliability of the computational predictions the dataset used in our study was extensively curated since the eukaryotic and prokaryotic n linked glycosylation schemes are different sequons were only selected from pdb files where the proteins were expressed in eukaryotic_systems to reduce the incidences of false_negatives in the dataset the sequons without asn nag linkage from the pdb files were considered glycosylated if they were annotated as such in uniprot the incidences of false_negatives were further reduced by considering as glycosylated sequons for which the asn nag linkage could be modeled in the electron densities from the pdb structure_factor file nevertheless false_negative sequons could still be present in the dataset in cases where the glycosylation site is occupied but both the glycan electron densities were absent and the site was not annotated as glycosylated in uniprot furthermore the ratio of glycosylated to non glycosylated entries in the dataset was adjusted to roughly while the actual ratio of glycosylated to non glycosylated sites in reality is unknown additional curation of the dataset could thus further improve the accuracy of the predictions tuning of some of the rf input_parameters such as the maximum depth of each tree and the number of input variables to be randomly_selected at each node could further optimize the performance of the different predictors the structural_features chosen for the nglycpred algorithm are less sensitive to the exact coordinates of the protein and therefore should be suitable for use with homology_models in our analysis we noticed that the knowledge of side chain torsion_angles improved the prediction of n linked glycan_occupancy data not shown however since side chain torsions are more difficult to predict for homology_models and might differ dramatically before after glycosylation we chose not to include this feature in our models so that the nglycpred algorithm would be applicable to both crystal_structures and homology_models nonetheless it should be noted that the accuracy of the predictions may be affected by the quality of the homology_models also as nglycpred uses structural_properties of the protein as input different predictions would be generated for sequons on sequence identical domains if the tertiary quaternary context is different for example sequons on the outer domain of hiv_gp monomer versus sequons on an outer domain only construct finally we note that differences in glycosylation do occur between different eukaryotic_species e g mammalian versus insect as well as in different tissues of the same organism further improvements in n glycan prediction may be needed to incorporate these variables furthermore as the addition of n linked glycosylation typically occurs during protein_translation with the n x t s sequon recognized by the glycosylation machinery as the nascent polypeptide is synthesized and extruded into the endoplasmic_reticulum the theoretical link between structure based information and n glycan prediction is unclear the protein is not yet folded when n glycans are incorporated differences in n glycan prediction_accuracy between artificially incorporated sites and naturally evolved sites may provide insight into this conundrum the nglycpred algorithm described here should provide better prediction of glycan_occupancy and such a prediction is likely to have a number of applications for example the ability to silence immunodominant epitopes reliably through targeted addition of n glycans should contribute to immunogen design n glycan can also affect half_life and trafficking of protein_therapeutics and correct prediction of glycan_occupancy would be of utility thus despite recent advancement in experimental technology to detect n linked glycosylation a computational algorithm that can quickly identify glycosylation sequons with higher probabilities of glycan_occupancy should be of use
