databases_and cordova web_based management of genetic_variation data cordova is an out of the box solution for building and maintaining an online database of genetic_variations integrated with pathogenicity prediction results from popular algorithms our primary motivation for developing this system is to aid researchers and clin icianscientists in determining the clinical_significance of genetic_variations to achieve_this cordova provides an interface to review and manually or computationally curate genetic_variation data as well as share it for clinical_diagnostics and the advancement of research availability_and cordova is open_source under the mit_license and is freely_available for download at https curated genetic_variation data play_a for researchers genetic_counselors clinicians and patients alike we have created cordova curated online reference_database of variation annotations an out of the box solution for building and maintaining a curated online database of genetic_variations integrated with pathogenicity prediction results from popular algorithms cordova provides a collection of tools for research and clinical genetic_testing designed to i annotate variations from popular pathogenicity prediction_tools ii collect published allele_frequencies iii provide an interface for reviewing and curating variation pathogenicity and allele_frequency data and iv share these annotations to inform fellow clinicians and researchers with up to date data we originally designed this software for dissemination of information on variations in genes causally related to non syndromic hearing_loss as part of the otoscopev r diagnostic platform we then generalized the software to be applicable for management curation and dissemination of any set of variations the leiden open variation database lovd package is currently the only other software aimed at providing an out of the box variation database management system therefore we tested the latest_version of the lovd software lovd version build at the time of this writing and compared it with cordova a general comparison is provided in lovd is a popular and mature tool that stores variation data however we set out to develop a system that aids researchers and clinicians in the context of genetic_testing and provides pathogenicity prediction results to aid in evaluation and determination of clinical_significance of potentially diseasecausing variants cordova is written in php built on the popular codeigniter web_application framework and uses a mysql_database because cordova is built with a popular web framework it is highly configurable and well documented for development lovd is not based on a web_application framework our system provides a front end web_interface for authenticated users to manage the database and a separate interface for browsing publicly_available data standard web security features are native to the codeigniter framework in addition cordova includes a configurable web api for quickly retrieving data in vcf csv xml json and tab_delimited formats by comparison the lovd api output is not configurable and can only be viewed in atom format current examples of cordova installations include the deafness variation database dvdhttp deafnessvariationdatabase org and the vision variation database vvdhttp vvd eng uiowa edu the university of iowa also hosts an internal renal_disease variation database rdvd and a dense_deposit database dddd with plans for a public release in the future
