mecors metagenome enabled error_correction of single_cell sequencing_reads we present a new tool mecors to correct chimeric reads and sequencing_errors in illumina data generated from single amplified genomes sags it uses sequence_information derived from accompanying metagenome sequencing to accurately correct errors in sag reads even from ultra low coverage regions in evaluations on real_data we show that mecors outperforms bayeshammer the most widely used state of the art approach mecors performs particularly well in correcting chimeric reads which greatly_improves both accuracy and contiguity of de_novo sag assemblies availability_and https github com metagenomics mecorsthe vast_majority of microbial_species found in nature has yet to be grown in pure_culture turning metagenomics andmore recently single_cell genomics into indispensable methods to access the genetic_makeup of microbial dark_matter frequently single amplified genomes sags and shotgun metagenomes are generated from the same environmental sample and are methodologically combined e g to validate metagenome bins with single cells or to improve the sags assembly contiguity however a single cells dna needs to be amplified prior to sequencing as usually accomplished by multiple_displacement mda this amplification is heavily biased leading to uneven sequencing_depth including ultra low coverage regions with basically no informed error_correction possible supplementary moreover chimera formation occurs roughly once per kbp during mda further complicating sag assembly while an array of error_correction tools exist for a variety of use cases only one tool was specifically_designed to correct sag data hammer recently refined to bayeshammer we propose a metagenome enabled error_correction strategy for single_cell sequencing_reads our method takes_advantage of largely unbiased metagenomic coverage enabling it to correct positions with too low a coverage for sag only error_correction and to correct chimeric sag reads through non chimeric metagenome reads
