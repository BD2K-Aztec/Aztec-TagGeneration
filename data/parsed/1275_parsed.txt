gene_expression dcgl an r package for identifying differentially_coexpressed genes and links from gene_expression microarray_data gene coexpression analysis was developed to explore gene interconnection at the expression_level from a systems perspective and differential_coexpression analysis dcea which examines the change in gene_expression correlation between two conditions was accordingly designed as a complementary technique to traditional differential_expression dea since there is a shortage of dcea tools we implemented in an r package dcgl five dcea methods for identification of differentially_coexpressed genes and differentially_coexpressed links including three currently popular_methods and two novel algorithms described in a companion_paper dcgl can serve as an easy to use tool to facilitate differential_coexpression analyses contact yyli scbit org and yxli scbit orgfrom the perspective of systems_biology gene coexpression analysis is useful for investigating gene interconnection at the expression_level differential_coexpression analysis dcea which examines the change in expression correlation of gene_pairs between two conditions helps to explore the global transcriptional mechanisms_underlying phenotypic changes compared with traditional differential_expression dea the development of dcea tools is lagged in this work we developed an r package dcgl implementing three previously_proposed dcea methods and two new algorithms reported in a companion_paper submitted for publication log_ratio of connections lrc calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the connectivities of a gene between two conditions average specific connection asc counts the specific connections that exist in only one coexpression_network the weighted genecoexpression network_analysis wgcna weights links with correlation_coefficients and compares the sums of the correlation_coefficients of a gene in contrast our two methods differential_coexpression profile dcp and differential_coexpression enrichment dce are designed based on the exact coexpression changes of gene_pairs and thus can differentiate significant coexpression changes from relatively trivial ones and identify coexpression reversal between positive_and submitted for publication all the five methods are able to identify differentially_coexpressed genes dcgs from microarray_datasets and dce is also able to pick out differentially_coexpressed gene_pairs or links dcls
