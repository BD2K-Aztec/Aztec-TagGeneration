bioinformatics_discovery characterization of the sos meta regulon in the human_gut motivation data from metagenomics projects remain largely untapped for the analysis of transcriptional_regulatory here we provide proof_of that metagenomic_data can be effectively leveraged to analyze regulatory_networks by characterizing the sos meta regulon in the human_gut results we combine well established in silico and in vitro techniques to mine the human_gut data and determine the relative composition of the sos network in a natural setting our analysis highlights the importance of translesion_synthesis as a primary function of the sos_response we predict the association of this network with three novel protein clusters involved in cell_wall biogenesis chromosome partitioning and restriction modification and we confirm binding of the sos_response transcriptional_repressor to sites in the promoter of a cell_wall biogenesis enzyme a phage integrase and a death on curing protein we discuss the implications of these findings and the potential for this approach for metagenome analysis the unprecedented coverage provided by next_generation has enabled direct_sequencing of heterogeneous bacterial_populations in their natural_habitat metagenomics projects therefore offer a unique window into the genetic_composition of microbial_ecosystems to date a substantial amount of work has focused on pathway analysis as a method to analyze and compare metagenomic populations this approach is particularly suited for reconstructing the multispecies genetic organization of metabolic_pathways across a metagenome in contrast nonmetabolic transcriptional_regulatory trns such as stress_responses present a different challenge these networks are typically defined by the functional regulation of their components rather than by their biochemical interconnections and their genetic_composition can vary significantly across bacteria hence the mere presence of a particular gene or set of genes within a metagenomic sample does not imply their belonging to a given trn or the existence of such a network in the sample membership to a trn can be instead defined by the ability of a regulating transcription_factor to bind upstream of and directly regulate an operon in well studied bacterial transcription_factors the binding_motif is known to be conserved at the class or phylum levels if the binding_motif for the regulating transcription_factor is known and can be shown to be conserved for a given subset of the sampled taxa it is hence theoretically possible to reconstruct its associated composite trn or metanetwork at the metagenome level by analyzing sequence_data from metagenomic_projects conservation of the binding_motif can be assessed through comparative_genomics analyses which can also be used to validate robust multispecies scoring_matrices that are well suited for metagenomic analyses the analysis of regulatory_networks at the metagenome level presents several potential advantages over genomic_analyses first it leverages a large and increasing amount of data for regulatory network_analysis second it complements a genome centered perspective by providing a glimpse of the regulatory network_organization in its natural environment finally it can capture the contribution of uncultured organisms and mobile_genetic that are poorly represented in genomic_data here we explore this approach by analyzing the composition of the bacterial sos regulon in the human_gut through in silico and in vitro analyses providing proof_of for the use of metagenomic_data in the inference of regulatory meta networks the sos_response presents several properties that make it a suitable target to validate this type of analysis it is a wellstudied widespread and relatively large network genes in escherichia_coli aimed primarily at addressing dna_damage through the activation of repair enzymes translesion_synthesis polymerases and cell_division inhibitors fernandez de it is also of clinical_relevance due to its implication in virulence mutagenesis and dissemination of antibiotic_resistance through the activation of mobile_genetic in addition it is governed by a repressor lexa with a remarkably different distribution in the two clades that constitute bacteroidetes but it targets a to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work well defined binding_motif in the firmicutes
