circoletto visualizing sequence_similarity with circos we present circoletto an online visualization_tool based on circos which provides a fast aesthetically_pleasing and informative overview of sequence similarity_search results availability_and online version and downloadable software_package for offline use source_code in perl freely_available bat ina certh gr tools circoletto contact ndarz certh grthe calculation of sequence_similarity between two biological_sequences is as old a procedure as the field of bioinformatics the basic_local or blast is a celebrated and highly popular method for the task however and partly because the heritage of such tools goes back to very basic visualization technologies and monochromatic terminals partly because speed and efficiency are still paramount these tools do not come with visualization capabilities yet there is great need for intuitive ways to quickly understand their output and interactive solutions have so_far included linearly stacked pairs of ideograms and highly_efficient graph layouts of large_numbers of nodes representing sequences and edges representing similarity in this context circoletto has been developed to complement such methods in a novel way
