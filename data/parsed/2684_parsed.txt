structural_bioinformatics lddt a local superposition free score for comparing protein_structures and models using distance difference tests motivation the assessment of protein_structure techniques requires objective_criteria to measure the similarity between a computational_model and the experimentally_determined reference structure conventional similarity_measures based on a global super position of carbon_atoms are strongly influenced by domain motions and do not assess the accuracy of local atomic details in the model results the local distance difference test lddt is a superposition free score that evaluates local distance differences of all atoms in a model including validation of stereochemical plausibility the reference can be a single structure or an ensemble of equivalent structures we demonstrate that lddt is well suited to assess local model quality even in the presence of domain movements while maintaining good correlation with global measures these properties make lddt a robust tool for the automated assessment of structure_prediction servers without manual intervention availability_and source_code binaries for linux and macosx and an interactive web_server are available at http swissthe knowledge of a proteins d structure enables a wide_spectrum of techniques in molecular_biology ranging from rational_design of mutagenesis experiments for the elucidation of a proteins function to drug_design while the rapid development of dna sequencing_techniques has been providing researchers with a wealth of genomic_data experimental structure_determination techniques require substantially more effort and consequently the gap between the number of known protein_sequences and the number of known protein_structures has been growing continuously to fill this gap various computational_approaches have been developed to predict a proteins structure starting from its amino_acid despite remarkable progress in structure_prediction computational_models often fall short in accuracy compared with experimental_structures the biannual casp experiment critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure provides an independent blind retrospective_assessment of the performance of different modeling_methods based on the same set of target_proteins one of the main challenges for the casp assessors is to define appropriate numerical measures to quantify the accuracy with which a prediction approximates the experimentally_determined structure in the course of the casp experiment model comparison techniques have evolved to reflect the current state of the art of prediction techniques in the first installments of casp root_mean rmsd between a prediction and the superposed reference structures was used in various forms as the main evaluation criterion however rmsd has several characteristics that limit its usefulness for structure_prediction assessment the score is dominated by outliers in poorly predicted regions while at the same time it is insensitive to missing parts of the model and it strongly depends on the superposition of the model with the reference structure to overcome some of the limitations of rmsd in the context of casp the global distance test gdt was introduced in casp in contrast to rmsd the gdt is an agreement based measure quantifying the number of corresponding atoms in the model that can be superposed within a set of predefined tolerance thresholds to the reference structure for each threshold different superpositions are evaluated and the one giving the highest number is selected the final gdt score is then calculated as the average fraction of atoms that can be superposed over a set of predefined thresholds and a for gdt ha and and a for gdt ts respectively one of the advantages of gdt is that strongly deviating atoms do not considerably influence the score at the same time missing segments in the predictions lead to lower scores besides gdt several other scores for model comparison have been developed to overcome the limitations of rmsd one of the main limitations of measures based on global superposition becomes evident when applied to flexible proteins composed of several domains which can change their relative orientation naturally with respect to each other typically in those cases the global rigid_body superposition is dominated by the largest domain and as a consequence the smaller domains are not correctly matched resulting in artificially unfavorable scores in casp the effects of domain to whom correspondence should be addressed

splitting the target into the so_called assessment units aus that are evaluated separately the definition of aus is carried_out by visual_inspection and is therefore time consuming furthermore the criteria used to define the au are often subjective grishin et_al have proposed an approach to numerically support this decision by analyzing the variability among the predictions for a specific target local superposition free measures based on rotation invariant properties of a structure are an attractive alternative to overcome several of the shortcomings outlined before for example drmsdthe distance based equivalent of rmsdis used in chemoinformatics to assess differences in ligand poses in binding_sites in casp the local distance difference test lddt score was introduced assessing how well local atomic interactions in the reference protein_structure are reproduced in the prediction more recently other nonsuperposition based scores have been proposed e g cad score based on residueresidue contact_areas measures using residue contact similarity or the recall precision f measure rpf dp score which was initially_developed to evaluate the quality of nuclear_magnetic nmr structures also the spheregrinder score was used for the assessment of local accuracy of refinement targets in casp initially most of the scores used in structure_prediction assessment aimed at the evaluation of the protein_backbone or fold thereby focusing on carbon c atom positions however with increasing accuracy of prediction_methods for templatebased models the focus of the assessment has shifted to the evaluation of the atomic details of a model in casp the first scores based on local atomic interactions were introduced in the form of hbscore which quantifies the fraction of hydrogen_bond in the target protein correctly reproduced in the model in casp several scores for assessing the local modeling quality were introduced main_chain reality score hydrogen_bond correctness rotamer correctness and side chain positioning as well as an evaluation of the stereochemical realism and plausibility of models using the molprobity score in this article we expand the initial concept of lddt because the lddt score considers all atoms of a prediction including all side chain atoms it is able to capture the accuracy of e g the local geometry in a binding_site or the correct packing of a proteins core we discuss its properties with respect to its low sensitivity to domain movements and the significance that can be assigned to the absolute score values furthermore we introduce the concept of using multiple reference structures simultaneously and incorporate stereochemical quality checks in its calculation we finally illustrate how lddt can be used to highlight regions of low model quality even in models of multidomain_proteins where domain movements are present
