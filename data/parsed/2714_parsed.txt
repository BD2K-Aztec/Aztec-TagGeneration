structural_bioinformatics ligsift an open_source tool for ligand structural_alignment and virtual_screening motivation shape based alignment of small_molecules is a widely used approach in computer_aided drug_discovery most shape based ligand structure alignment applications both commercial and freely_available ones use the tanimoto coefficient or similar functions for evaluating molecular similarity major_drawbacks of using such functions are the size dependence of the score and the fact that the statistical_significance of the molecular match using such metrics is not reported results we describe a new open_source ligand structure alignment and virtual_screening vs algorithm ligsift that uses gaussian molecular_shape overlay for fast small_molecule alignment and a size independent scoring_function for efficient vs based on the statistical_significance of the score ligsift was tested against the compounds for protein targets available in the directory of useful decoys and the performance was evaluated using the area_under auc the enrichment factor ef and hit_rate hr ligsift based vs shows an average auc of average ef values of and a hr of in the top of the screened library availability_and ligsift software including the source_code is freely_available to academic users at http cssb biol ogy gatech edu ligsift identification of new lead molecules is a major_challenge in the drug_discovery as the experimental screening of large chemical databases is very expensive and depends on how representative the library is virtual_screening vs approaches are frequently used for lead identification which can be then verified under laboratory settings vs approaches can be broadly classified into protein centric approaches e g docking and ligand centric approaches protein centric approaches do not depend on known ligand information and are generally expected to perform better as they enable one to explicitly evaluate proteinligand_interactions however these approaches rely heavily on the quality of the receptor structure and suffer from inherent_limitations of the applied protocol ligand centric vs methods on the contrary do not need receptor information and often use known ligands as a seed to identify potential binders based on their d or d similarity to the known active molecule d vs methods generally represent a molecule as a vector with entries indicating the presence_or of molecular_features these methods are popular as they provide a fast and easy way of fishing out similar active_molecules however the scaffold_hopping potential of such methods is controversial and both molecular_size and complexity negatively_affect the search performance of such methods in contrast d vs methods are computationally taxing due to complexities associated with ligand flexibility and determination of the optimal d alignment nevertheless with improvement in computational power d vs methods have become popular as they capture the physical and functional features required for the biological interaction and are generally capable of scaffold_hopping the scaffold_hopping potential of d methods not only help to reduce false_negatives during vs experiments but also provide_important for bioisostere replacement potential off target interactions and cross_reactivity of existing_drugs three_dimensional methods for aligning small_molecules consist of three basic components a a descriptor to represent the molecule b a scoring_function to assess the alignment_quality and c an optimization procedure to find the best possible alignment with respect to the chosen scoring_function common choices of descriptors include molecular_interaction field based pharmacophore based and shape based representations of small_molecules a number of algorithms for shape based vs have emerged in the last few years each seeks to maximize the shape overlap between the pair of molecules under consideration most use atom centered smooth gaussian functions to model molecular volume as it helps to achieve rapid overlay and can also be performed relatively easily using simple mathematical operations for example rapid overlay of chemical_structures rocs a highly popular closed source algorithm uses a gaussian description of the molecular_shape and chemical nature of the ligand for ligand screening similarly align it tm an opensource tool uses a gaussian description of molecular pharmacophores but follows a different optimization approach to find the best overlay these and other similar tools use the tanimoto coefficient tc or similar size dependent functions for measuring molecular similarity moreover these scoring_functions to whom correspondence should be addressed lack a statistical_model that can indicate the significance of structural chemical match between molecules in this study we present a new open_source ligand based vs algorithm that provides a size independent scoring_function to measure shape and chemical similarity and also reports the p value to assess_the of the match between a pair of molecules performance evaluation of ligsift on the targets in the directory of useful decoys dud set shows overall improved_performance compared with other wellestablished shape based vs methods such as rocs and align it tm vs was performed for all the dud targets using bioactive and both single and multiple database conformers and database molecules were ranked using various shape and chemical similarity_metrics multi conformer models of database molecules were generated using
