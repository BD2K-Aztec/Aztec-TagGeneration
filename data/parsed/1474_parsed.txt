gene_expression dreme motif_discovery in transcription_factor chip_seq motivation transcription_factor tf chip_seq have particular characteristics that provide unique challenges and opportunities for motif_discovery most existing motif_discovery do not scale well to such large_datasets or fail to report many motifs associated with cofactors of the chip ed tf results we present dreme a motif_discovery algorithm specifically_designed to find the short core dna_binding of eukaryotic tfs and optimized to analyze very large chip_seq in minutes using dreme we discover the binding_motifs of the the chip ed tf and many cofactors in mouse es_cell mesc mouse erythrocyte and human cell_line chip_seq for example in mesc chip_seq for the tf esrrb we discover the binding_motifs for eight cofactor tfs important in the maintenance of pluripotency several other commonly used algorithms find at most two cofactor motifs in this same dataset dreme can also perform discriminative motif_discovery and we use this feature to provide evidence that sox and oct do not bind in mes cells as an obligate heterodimer dreme is much faster than many commonly used algorithms scales linearly in dataset size finds multiple non redundant motifs and reports a reliable measure of statistical_significance for each motif found dreme is available as part of the meme suite of motif based sequence_analysis http meme nbcr net it is estimated that the human_genome contains transcription_factors tfs that play_a in regulating transcription by binding to the genome alone or in protein_complexes chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip followed by high_throughput chip_seq is the current method of choice for determining the genomic binding locations of a tf the resolution of chip_seq location data is such that the actual binding location is typically within bp of the predicted location a tf chip_seq experiment generally yields hundreds to tens_of of predicted locations often called chip_seq in addition to providing evidence of direct regulation by the tf proximity to individual genes the chip_seq provide a rich resource for exploring the in vivo dnabinding affinity of the chip ed tf and cofactor tfs that bind_dna in complex or nearby and for discovering the identities of these cofactors ab_initio motif_discovery applied to chip_seq peak regions can usually discover the dna binding_motif of the chip ed tf however most existing algorithms have limitations that make them less than ideal for discovering all the cofactor motifs in a chip_seq dataset one limitation of many popular algorithms is that they do not scale well to inputs containing thousands of sequences as a result many studies to date have used only a fraction say sequences of the available chip_seq peak regions for motif_discovery greatly decreasing the chances of discovering motifs for infrequent cofactors a second limitation is that many algorithms do not provide reliable motif statistics to enable the biologist to discern functional_motifs from statistical artifacts this limitation can cause valid motifs to be ignored or time to be wasted investigating random motifs a third limitation is that most algorithms do not allow two chip_seq to be directly compared finding motifs that are relatively enriched this limitation makes_it to determine_whether two tfs always bind as a heterodimer or even if the motif for the chip ed tf has been found at all other limitations possessed by some algorithms that make them unsatisfactory for chip_seq analysis include only finding a single motif or being hard wired to use a particular type of sequence e g promoters here we describe a novel motif_discovery algorithm lacking the above limitations and demonstrate how to use it to mine chipseq datasets for primary and cofactor motifs and for insights into cooperative or indirect binding by tfs we show that the new algorithm is significantly_faster than several algorithms that are commonly used for analyzing chip_seq yet is able to discover substantially more cofactor motifs the algorithm searches for motifs expressed as simplified regular expressions consensus_sequences allowing wildcards but not variable_length gaps it achieves speed partly by limiting its search to short motifs up to bp wide which turns out to be ideal for identifying and studying the dna_binding of monomeric eukaryotic tfs but may cause it to miss some wider motifs due to binding by large tf complexes our new algorithm has some similarities with a few existing word based_algorithms such as trawler and amadeus but our approach is simpler and we demonstrate that it finds substantially more cofactor motifs consequently our algorithm complements rather than replaces existing motif_discovery tools for the analysis of chip_seq focusing on short core motifs in tf chip_seq appears to be a very profitable approach to understanding patterns of dna_binding by tfs additional insight can also be gained by searching for motifs that are relatively enriched in one chip_seq dataset compared with another the ab_initio discovered motifs can often be associated with the probable tf that binds them by comparison to existing compendia of tf motifs using expression in the chip ed tissue and prior_knowledge as a filter the large_numbers of motifs discovered by dreme that can be reliably assigned to tfs suggests that unassigned motifs may represent binding by other tfs whose motifs are not yet known of course because it is only designed to find short core motifs dreme is intended only to complement existing motif finders such as those tested here a complete analysis of a tf chip_seq dataset should also include a search for longer more complex motifs our motif_discovery algorithm incorporates ideas from several existing algorithms sinha and tompa uses the fishers_exact to measure the significance of enrichment of motifs in two sets of sequences their motifs are not regular expressions but balls the set of words that are within a set hamming_distance from a given word this motif definition treats variations from the consensus word the same regardless of position within the motif real tf motifs are less tolerant of variation in certain positions and this is better captured by regular expressions which explicitly list all the allowed variations if any at each motif position several algorithms including ymf use regular expressions at some stage in the search for motifs but differ from our algorithm in other respects for example ymf only allows a subset of the iupac wildcards and scores motifs using a different statistical_test z_score counting the number of sequences not occurrences is equivalent to the zero or one occurrence per sequence zoops model used by numerous motif_discovery and finding multiple motifs by erasing is reminiscent of meme cisfinder also uses the idea of counting words and computing relative enrichment in two sets of sequences is extremely fast and can find many cofactor motifs in chip_seq unlike dreme however it requires a motif clustering step to partially remove redundant motifs and cannot be restricted to finding short core motifs also in contrast with dreme cisfinder reports a p value for each motif that is not a measure of the significance of the motif but only of a single_word without wildcards matching the motif
