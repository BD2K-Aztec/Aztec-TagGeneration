structural_bioinformatics pepcrawler a fast rrt based algorithm for high_resolution refinement and binding_affinity estimation of peptide_inhibitors motivation design of proteinprotein_interaction ppi inhibitors is a key challenge in structural_bioinformatics and computer_aided drug_design peptides which partially mimic the interface area of one of the interacting_proteins are natural candidates to form proteinpeptide complexes competing with the original ppi the prediction of such complexes is especially challenging due to the high_flexibility of peptide conformations results in this article we present pepcrawler a new tool for deriving binding_peptides from proteinprotein_complexes and prediction of peptideprotein complexes by performing high_resolution docking refinement and estimation of binding_affinity by using a fast path planning approach pepcrawler rapidly generates large_amounts of flexible peptide conformations allowing backbone and side chain flexibility a newly_introduced binding_energy funnel steepness score was applied for the evaluation of the proteinpeptide complexes binding_affinity pepcrawler simulations predicted high_binding for native proteinpeptide complexes benchmark and low_affinity for low_energy decoy complexes in three cases where wet_lab data are available the pepcrawler predictions were consistent with the data comparing to other state of the art flexible peptideprotein structure prediction_algorithms our algorithm is very fast and takes only minutes to run on a single pc proteinprotein_interactions ppis play_a in cellular function thus development of small_molecules that modulate ppis has become a major_challenge in structural_bioinformatics and computer_aided drug_design in particular it is desired to detect small_molecules that will block the ppi without harming the intrinsic catalytic_activity of the target the search for such inhibitors includes drug like small_molecule and short peptide_inhibitors the interaction between two proteins is often characterized by a large interface lacking a significant single binding_pocket therefore peptides which are relatively large inhibitors can be potential leads in the rational_design of inhibitory drugs by mimicking the interacting area nieddu to whom correspondence should be addressed and mochly rosen and both naturally_occurring and synthetic_peptides have been used and these are emerging as promising compounds that efficiently modulate signaling_pathways in vitro and in vivo some inhibitory peptides were designed by deriving a short_linear segment from one of the proteins in a given ppi complex these peptides were successfully able to inhibit interactions with the partner_protein in some of the examples a mutated peptide was used to achieve better results and in others the derived_peptide was stapled to form a stable cyclic peptide generally a derived inhibitory peptide is target specific and may bind to the target protein with good binding_energy using computational measures it was recently shown that linear derived_peptides dominate the interaction_energy of many ppis given an input proteinprotein_complex we wish to derive a suitable peptide from one of the proteins with high_affinity to bind to the other as well as predict the structure of the resulting peptide protein complex simply deriving a rigid peptide with high binding_energy from the input complex is not enough first peptides are highly_flexible molecules containing backbone rotatable bonds and movable side_chains second the input structure might not be of high enough resolution for an accurate prediction finally it might be hard to determine_whether the resulting peptideprotein complex is stable several flexible peptideprotein docking methods have been introduced applied a monte_carlo mc based method for flexible peptideprotein docking which takes_into also protein side chain flexibility their suggested new potential which considers proteinpeptide atom pair interactions and atomic solvation contribution accurately_predicted binding_affinity on the test_set recently an mc based algorithm for subangstrom peptide docking refinement that utilizes the rosetta energy function was introduced by a molecular_dynamics based refinement method was suggested by antes some high_resolution docking algorithms were designed for specific protein receptors most of them are also mc based e g mhc pdz and sh_domains these previous methods for flexible peptide docking have relatively long running_times mostly due to time consuming side chain energy_minimization which is extensively applied in this article we present pepcrawlera new method for flexible peptide docking our algorithm requires as input an initial peptide
