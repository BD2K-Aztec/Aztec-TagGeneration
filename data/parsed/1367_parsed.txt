genome_analysis determination of genomic copy_number emphasizing a restriction_site based strategy of genome re sequencing motivation copy_number abbreviation cna is one type of genomic aberration that is often induced by genome_instability and is associated with diseases such as cancer determination of the genome_wide cna profile is an important step in identifying the underlying mutation mechanisms genomic_data based on next_generation are particularly suitable for determination of high_quality cna profile now is an important time to reevaluate the use of sequencing_techniques for cna analysis especially with the rapid_growth of the different targeted_genome and whole_genome strategies results in this study we provide a comparison of resequencing strategies with regard to their utility applied to the same hepatocellular_carcinoma sample for copy_number determination these strategies_include whole_genome exome and restriction_site rad sequencing the last of these strategies is a targeted sequen_cing technique that involves cutting the genome with a restriction_enzyme and isolating the targeted sequences our data demonstrate that rad sequencing is an efficient and comprehensive strategy that allows the cost_effective determination of cnas further investigation of rad sequencing_data led to the finding that a precise measurement of the allele_frequency would be a helpful complement to the read_depth for cna analysis for two reasons first knowledge of the allele_frequency helps to resolve refined calculations of allele specific copy_numbers which in turn identify the functionally_important cnas that are under natural_selection on the parental alleles second this knowledge enables deconvolution of cna patterns in complex genomic_regions genome_instability including nucleotide mutations chromosomal_rearrangements and dna dose aberrations promotes genetic_variation among these possible genomic_aberrations dna_copy are of high_diversity in normal human populations and are associated with various human_diseases such as birth_defects and neurodegenerative_diseases notably tumourigenesis involves a process of accumulation of chromosomal mutations that induce the activation of oncogenes the loss of function of tumour suppressors and cell_proliferation copy_number cnas in the form of regions of somatic amplification or deletion are an important subclass of chromosomal mutation associated with tumourigenesis investigations of cnas and the biological mechanism through which they occur have shed new light on the human_genome variations that exist among individuals with disease or normal phenotypes many studies have examined the differences in cnas between tumour_cells and normal cells and have estimated the rearrangement phylogeny of cancer_genomes on the basis of their cnas cnas and single_nucleotide snps in humans have revealed extensive genetic_diversity in populations a framework based on evolutionary_genetics has been adopted to understand the disease_causing deleterious cnas or beneficial cnas present in human populations the successful characterization of copy_number profiles is the first step in pinpointing the cnas that have significant biological_roles in disease occurrence and normal phenotypic_variation in the past_years profound advances have been made in the major technologies offering genome_wide scanning of cnas such as array_based with high_density oligo probes snp_genotyping and recently_developed next_generation based_approaches to whom correspondence should be addressed array based_technologies generate analogue fluorescence signals that are prone to noise and short_read sequencing_platforms provide an effective alternative way of identifying cnas next_generation technologies_provide high_resolution nucleotide level digital readouts of the genomic composition of cells especially because the genomes of more and more species have been sequenced and assembled resequencing has become increasingly more convenient for cna analysis than the existing array based_technologies which require significant work to design new sets of probes resequencing strategies for genomes including exome_sequencing and whole_genome wgs confer benefits in detecting cnas and rearrangements both the read_depth and the minor_allele mafs of heterozygous loci estimated from the sequencing_data are informative in inferring copy_numbers low mafs have been used in addition to read_depth to screen for cna segments conferring adaptive advantages and to confirm the breakpoints of cnas however sequencing biases can be introduced from many sources and may negatively impact the precise measurement of read_depth and allele_frequency throughout the genome uneven sampling in dna_fragmentation during library_preparation pcr bias due to the gc_content of fragments and errors in the mapping of reads are all sources of variability in the characterization of genomic_regions in addition to these sources of bias exome_sequencing has an excessive allele bias because of the unbalanced sampling of the two alleles that can result from differences in probe affinity unlike deep coverage wgs_data low coverage wgs_data fail to provide_important the allele_frequencies of heterozygous loci efforts have been made to overcome these shortcomings in the sequencing_data and both gc correction and hidden_markov have been integrated into the statistical_tools used to detect cnas however the success of these efforts has been limited restriction siteassociated dna rad sequencing is a targeted_sequencing technique that involves cutting genomic_dna with at least one restriction_enzyme and isolating the target_sequences from entire genomes rad sequencing was developed to efficiently identify snps map quantitative_trait locis qtls and measure the genetic_structure of natural_populations of various non model_organisms intuitively the majority of cna segments would be covered by densely_packed genome_wide rad reads hence the rad sequencing strategy holds_promise for cna analysis herein we proposed this wet_lab strategy rad sequencing to cover of the genome of a hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc sample for optimal cna analysis using the same sample we systematically compared the performance of rad sequencing with that of the most commonly used alternative_strategies in constructing the cna profile from this study there is sufficient evidence to support the notion that the rad sequencing strategy which allows a precise measurement of both the read_depth and allele_frequency is a comprehensive solution to the problem of cna characterization
