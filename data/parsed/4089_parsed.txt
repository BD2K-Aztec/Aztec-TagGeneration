rubioseq a suite of parallelized pipelines to automate exome variation and bisulfite seq analyses motivation rubioseq has been developed to facilitate the primary and secondary analysis of re sequencing_projects by providing an integrated software_suite of parallelized pipelines to detect exome variants single_nucleotide and copy_number and to perform bisulfite seq analyses automatically rubioseqs variant analysis results have been already validated and published availability http rubioseq sourceforge net primary and secondary data analyses of next_generation studies ngs consist of a set of successive_stages that are repetitively and routinely executed using a wide collection of tools e g quality_control tools read_aligners variant callers and so forth these tools have different origins and usually lack of straight interoperability this issue has driven computational_biologists to demand intuitive efficient and integrated pipelines to facilitate routine ngs_analysis and improve the reproducibility of the results several remarkable efforts have been carried_out in this sense prominent examples_include narwhal a recent proposal to automate illuminas primary analysis and hugeseq a powerful pipeline designed to cover primary and secondary analysis of singlenucleotide variant snvs and copy_number cnv experiments hugeseq uses fastq_files as input to detect and annotate genomic_variants running gatk and samtools however the current version of hugeseq does not support either sample quality_control tools or bisulfite seq bs_seq analysis methods galaxy a large and flexible web_based also provides an ngs toolbox despite its potential galaxys ngs tools are still in and do not support either cnv or bs_seq analysis we present rubioseq an automated and parallelized software_suite for primary and secondary analysis of illumina and solid experiments using standard input and output file_formats and an intuitive xml configuration file the application offers an integrated framework to run parallelized pipelines for variant detection in exome enrichment and methylation studies rubioseq results have been experimentally_validated and accepted for publication
