inps predicting the impact of non synonymous variations on protein_stability from sequence motivation a tool for reliably predicting the impact of variations on protein_stability is extremely_important for both protein_engineering and for understanding the effects of mendelian and somatic_mutations in the genome next_generation studies are constantly increasing the number of protein_sequences given the huge disproportion between protein_sequences and structures there is a need for tools suited to annotate the effect of mutations starting from protein_sequence without relying on the structure here we describe inps a novel approach for annotating the effect of non synonymous mutations on the protein_stability from its sequence inps is based on svm regression and it is trained to predict the thermodynamic free_energy change upon single point variations in protein_sequences results we show that inps performs similarly to the state of the art methods based on protein_structure when tested in cross_validation on a non redundant dataset inps performs very well also on a newly_generated dataset consisting of a number of variations occurring in the tumor_suppressor protein p our results suggest that inps is a tool suited for computing the effect of non synonymous polymorphisms on protein_stability when the protein_structure is not available we also show that inps predictions are complementary to those of the state of the art structure based method mcsm when the two methods are combined the overall prediction on the p set scores significantly_higher than those of the single methods availability_and the presented method is available as web_server at http inps biocomp unibo it the increasing amount of data generated by the several sequencing initiatives calls for accurate and reliable computational_approaches to predict the impact of mutations on the phenotype and possibly for methods to correlate them with diseases more to this the ability of accurately predicting the impact of non_synonymous nssnps on protein_stability is essential for understanding the effects of human_genome variations several methods have been developed so_far to predict the effect of nssnps on the protein_stability some of them require the knowledge of the protein_structure auto mute cupsat dmutant foldx eris popmusic sdm mcsm other methods are based only on protein_sequences iptree stab or can use both protein_sequences and protein_structures i mutant besides the single methods other approaches have been tested such as meta predictors istable filtering approaches based on the available information about mutations in the same protein site and ensemble predictors the available methods were trained under different conditions and on different datasets they address three different questions briefly they can i predict the ddg real values in regression upon residue substitution ii predict whether a residue substitution promotes a ddg increase or decrease two class predictors and iii predict whether a mutation is stabilizing destabilizing or not affecting the protein_stability three class predictors noticeably it is also very difficult to find a good benchmark test_set since all the methods have to deal with the paucity of the available experimental_data almost all methods are trained on data derived from the same source the protherm database in khan and vihinen made a thorough evaluation of the different methods considering them as pure classifiers i e the methods that predicted the ddg real values were converted into classifiers the authors showed that the best performing methods i mutant dmutant and foldx exploit the protein_structure information recently pires et_al a introduced two relevant advancements when evaluating the performance of different methods they described i a more correct way to avoid similarity between training and testing sets when adopting a cross_validation procedure and ii a new independent benchmark consisting of a wide_range of mutations occurring in the tumor_suppressor protein p not present in the original protherm database in this article we take advantage of these efforts and we describe inps a predictor of the impact of non synonymous variations on protein_stability a new method that computes the ddg values of protein variants without requiring the knowledge of the protein_structure we show that when evolutionary_information is taken into account inps performances are very close to those obtained by the state_ofthe methods based on d structure mcsm and duet we also show that inps predictions are complementary to those obtained with mcsm or duet and that their combinations obtained by averaging the predictions outperform previously_introduced and combined approaches
