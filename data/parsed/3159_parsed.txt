gene_expression multiple gene_expression alignment for microarray time series data clustering motivation clustering gene_expression data given in terms of time series is a challenging_problem that imposes its own particular constraints traditional clustering_methods based on conventional similarity_measures are not always suitable for clustering time series data a few methods have been proposed recently for clustering microarray time series which take the temporal dimension of the data into account the inherent principle behind these methods is to either define a similarity measure appropriate for temporal expression data or pre process the data in such a way that the temporal relationships between and within the time series are considered during the subsequent clustering phase results we introduce pairwise gene_expression alignment which vertically shifts two profiles in such a way that the area between their corresponding curves is minimal based on the pairwise_alignment operation we define a new distance_function that is appropriate for time series profiles we also introduce a new clustering method that involves multiple expression_profile alignment which generalizes pairwise_alignment to a set of profiles extensive experiments on well known datasets yield encouraging_results of at least classification_accuracy an important process in functional_genomic is clustering microarray time series data where genes with similar expression_profiles are expected to be functionally_related a bayesian_approach a partitional clustering based on k means and a euclidean_distance approach have been proposed for clustering time series gene_expression they have applied selforganizing maps soms to visualize and to interpret the gene temporal expression_profile patterns a hidden phase model was used for clustering time series data to define the parameters of a mixture of normal_distributions in a bayesian like manner that are estimated by using expectation_maximization em also the methods proposed inare based on correlation measures a method that uses jackknife correlation with or without using seeded candidate profiles was proposed for clustering time series microarray_data as well where the resulting clusters depend upon the initially chosen template genes because there is a possibility of missing important genes a regression_based method was proposed into address the challenges in clustering short time series expression data analyzing gene temporal expression_profile data that are non uniformly sampled and can contain missing_values has been studied in clustering temporal gene_expression was studied by identifying homogeneous clusters of genes in the shapes of the curves were considered instead of the absolute expression ratios fuzzy clustering of gene temporal_profiles where the similarities between co expressed genes are computed based on the rate of change of the expression ratios across time has been studied in the idea of order restricted inference levels across time has been applied to select and cluster genes where the estimation makes use of known inequalities among parameters in pairs of profiles represented by piece wise linear_functions are aligned in such a way to minimize the integrated squared area between the profiles an agglomerative clustering method combined with an area based distance measure between two aligned profiles was used to cluster microarray time series data using natural cubic spline interpolations we re formulated the pairwise gene_expression alignment problem ofin terms of arbitrary functions that are continuously integrable on a finite interval and extended the concept of pairwise_alignment to multiple expression_profile alignment finally we combined k means and em clustering with multiple_alignment to cluster microarray time series data yielding at least classification_accuracy on well known data
