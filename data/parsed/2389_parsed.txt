databases_and improving go semantic_similarity by exploring the ontology beneath the terms and modelling uncertainty motivation several measures have been recently_proposed for quantifying the functional_similarity between gene_products according to well structured controlled_vocabularies where biological terms are organized in a tree or in a directed_acyclic dag structure however existing semantic_similarity ignore two important facts first when calculating the similarity between two terms they disregard the descendants of these terms while this makes no difference when the ontology is a tree we shall show that it has important consequences when the ontology is a dagthis is the case for example with the gene_ontology go second existing similarity_measures do not model the inherent uncertainty which comes from the fact that our current knowledge of the gene_annotation and of the ontology structure is incomplete here we propose a novel approach based on downward random_walks that can be used to improve any of the existing similarity_measures to exhibit these two properties the approach is computationally efficientrandom walks do not need to be simulated as we provide formulas to calculate their stationary distributions results to show that our approach can potentially improve any semantic_similarity measure we test it on six different semantic_similarity three commonly used measures by resnik lin and jiang and conrath and three recently_proposed measures simui simgic by pesquita et_al grasm by couto et_al and couto and silva we applied these improved measures to the go annotations of the yeast_saccharomyces and tested how they correlate with sequence_similarity mrna co expression and proteinprotein_interaction data our results consistently show that the use of downward random_walks leads to more reliable similarity_measures availability we have developed a suite of tools that implement existing semantic_similarity and our improved measures based on random_walks the introduction of ontologies for gene functional_annotation allows us to compare genes by quantifying the similarity of the terms to whom correspondence should be addressed with which they are annotated these comparisons are important as they contribute to the inference of functional_relationships between gene_products by providing a perspective that complements both experimental information and sequence based_approaches standard ontologies usually have a structure that can be modelled by a rooted and oriented tree e g mips genprotec or more generally by a directed_acyclic dag like the gene_ontology go which has become a standard and is the focus of this article in general given two terms comparisons are not straightforward due to the complex structure of the ontologies discuss in detail the issues related to such comparisons here we only mention a few of them for instance comparisons should take into account the position of the terms in the ontology structure as terms in higher levels i e closer to a root term are less specific and likely to be less informative at the same time the depth of the term may not be an exact indicator of its specificity as some edges relations in the ontology may cover a larger conceptual distance whereas others may cover shorter distances calculating the depth of a term becomes even more problematic in dag structures as a term may have multiple parent terms and thus multiple paths of different lengths leading to the root term see column in finally ontologies and annotations are constantly refined and one should not neglect the possibility of new annotations or new terms being added later to the ontologies in order to evaluate our method we need to show that standard similarity_measures are improved when integrated with rwcs therefore we chose the six well known similarity_measures of resnik jiang lin grasm simui and simgic and we compared their performance with the performance of the ism which used these as host measureswe shall indicate these as ism resnik ism jiang and so on respectively the performance was compared using sequence_similarity data co expression data derived from microarray and proteinprotein_interaction data all experiments were performed on the go annotations of the yeast_saccharomyces the versions of the go and of the annotation file dated november and november respectively in the results reported here annotations with evidence code iea nr nd and ic were excluded also when comparing two gene_products which were annotated to several go terms their similarity was taken as the maximum of their pairwise similarities results using the best match average approach
