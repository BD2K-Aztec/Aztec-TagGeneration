databases_and the dgd a database of genome d structure the studies of chromatin d structure help us to understand its formation and function techniques combining chromosome_conformation and next_generation can capture chromatin_structure information and has been applied to several different species and cell_lines we built dgd d genome_database a database that currently collected hi c data on four species for easy accessing and visualization of chromatin d structure data with the integration of other omics_data such as genome_wide proteindna binding data this data source would be useful for researchers interested in chromatin_structure and its biological_functions availability_and the dgd v data browser downloadable files and documentation are available at http dgd the d conformation of chromosome in nucleus is relevant with several important biological_processes such as gene_expression regulation and replication understanding these relationships would provide a new perspective to the studies of chromatin in recent_years the development of chromatin_conformation techniques such as hi c allows us to identify the chromatin_interactions across the whole_genome unbiasedly the technique has been applied to several species such as human mouse drosophila and yeast these datasets have been shown useful in studying the property and function of chromosome organization however there is still a lack of an integrative data source of these kind of data for easy accessing and visualization besides integrating additional information such as genome_annotation and protein binding information could be useful for studying chromatin structures function recent_studies that some important dna_binding are extremely relevant to the chromosome organization and its function for example ccctc binding_factor ctcf is of importance in the formation of chromatin_structure combining dna binding_affinities of these proteins together with hi c data may help us to understand the formation and the functions of the chromatin_structure here we present d genome_database dgd a novel database that collected published d structure of genome currently mainly based on hi c experiment of four different species we organized and displayed the interaction data in an easy way for accessing while integrating genome_annotation data and some important dna_binding information to our knowledge dgd is the first database collecting and displaying chromatin d structure data
