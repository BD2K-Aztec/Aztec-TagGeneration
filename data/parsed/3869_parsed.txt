data_and ranking viruses measures of positional importance within networks define core viruses for rational polyvalent vaccine_development motivation the extraordinary genetic and antigenic variability of rna_viruses is arguably the greatest challenge to the development of broadly effective_vaccines no single viral variant can induce sufficiently broad immunity and incorporating all known naturally circulating variants into one multivalent vaccine is not feasible furthermore no objective strategies currently exist to select actual viral_variants that should be included or excluded in polyvalent vaccines results to address this problem we demonstrate a method based on graph_theory that quantifies the relative importance of viral_variants we demonstrate our method through application to the envelope_glycoprotein gene of a particularly diverse rna_virus of pigs porcine_reproductive prrsv using distance_matrices derived from sequence nucleotide difference amino_acid difference and evolutionary distance we constructed viral networks and used common network statistics to assign each sequence an objective ranking of relative importance to validate our approach we use an independent published algorithm to score our top_ranked wild_type variants for coverage of putative t cell epitopes across the sequences in our dataset top_ranked viruses achieve significantly higher_coverage than low ranked viruses and top_ranked viruses achieve nearly equal coverage as a synthetic mosaic protein constructed in silico from the same set of sequences conclusion our approach relies on the network_structure of prrsv but applies to any diverse rna_virus because it identifies subsets of viral_variants that are most important to overall viral diversity we suggest that this method through the objective quantification of variant importance provides criteria for choosing viral_variants for further characterization diagnostics surveillance and ultimately polyvalent vaccine_development of all infectious threats to global_health viruses with rna genomes have proven to be the most difficult to control viruses such as hiv influenza_virus hepatitis_c and dengue_virus have defied control in part as a result of their extraordinary genetic and antigenic_variation and their consequent ability to evolve rapidly hiv for example can evolve into diverse strains within an individual patient over the course of days or weeks confounding the development of vaccines and antivirals and frustrating diagnostics and surveillance thus the efficacy of even the most immunogenic vaccines is questionable in a field setting where multiple_variants may circulate simultaneously and where novel variants are continuously evolving vaccine studies almost universally acknowledge this challenge but have yet to develop objective_criteria selecting vaccine_candidates that adequately yet parsimoniously capture overall viral diversity in an effort to develop vaccines that maximize the representation of antigenic features present in diverse viral_populations a series of computational strategies have been proposed driven largely by hiv vaccine_research the approaches have included concatenating commonly recognized t cell epitopes creating pseudoprotein strings of t cell epitopes and generating consensus overlapping peptide sets from proteins evolutionary approaches such as the use of consensus_sequences and the most_recent mrca of viral_populations have also been proposed with the assumption that these approaches capture viral diversity unfortunately experimental_studies in animal_models using these strategies have documented underwhelming humoral_immune the most widely_studied approach uses a genetic_algorithm to generate select and recombine in silico potential t cell epitopes into full_length mosaic protein_sequences that can provide greater coverage of global viral_variants than could any single wild_type protein this mosaic protein approach was able to achieve between and coverage of hiv_gag sequences compared with only between and using a single natural gag protein subsequent experimental_studies have demonstrated that these computationally designed vaccines augment the breadth and depth of antigen_specific as compared with consensus or natural sequence hiv_antigens however this approach yields synthetic_peptides with unknown biological_properties that may not be able to be incorporated into a recombinant live_vaccine given the need for an objective strategy to select wild_type viral_variants that might be adapted for polyvalent vaccines we propose a method based on network_analysis in recent_years interest in the analysis and modeling of networks has surged outside the traditional fields of social_science mathematics and computer science network statistics have proven to be powerful_tools for studying diverse phenomena such as social_interactions connections among neurons and the structure of the internet and for optimizing solutions to engineering problems for our purpose it has long been recognized that biological_molecules interact directly and indirectly and network statistics have proven fruitful in drug_discovery studies human disease classification and functional_analyses of gene_regulatory as such it is possible to construct viral networks that explicitly define the positional importance of individual viral_variants in the network based on relationships between biomolecules e g in this article we use a highly_diverse and particularly problematic rna_virus of pigs as a case study porcine_reproductive prrsv this exercise provides proof_of as well as a novel strategy for the control of this virus of critical importance to agriculture we present a detailed topological network_analysis that considers the importance of every individual viral variant i by considering every possible interaction direct and indirect between variant i and j we use network indices from local to global including node degree a series of centrality indices and pagerank the algorithm at the heart of google we then examine how these indices relate to each other and discuss how to choose the most appropriate metric for selecting viral_variants for study and to help guide the development of polyvalent vaccines diagnostic testing_strategies and epidemiological_surveillance our study makes minimal initial assumptions about evolutionary_processes or viral biology and can complement other approaches such as the mosaic protein approach to polyvalent vaccine_design our results demonstrate that a dataset of sequences could be ranked according to three matrices and five network centrality metrics using interaction networks derived from sequence nucleotide difference amino_acid difference and evolutionary distance we were able to score individual prrsv sequences based on their relative importance to the viral network this yielded sequences that were represented in the top sequences in all matrices and provided objective_criteria for selecting viral_variants for polyvalent vaccine_design we identified a single wild_type sequence that covered of putative epitopes derived from the known diversity of prrsv furthermore we documenta relationship between our ranked variants and putative epitope coverage in summary we have demonstrated that it is possible to use network statistics to rank viruses with respect to their overall importance within a network and that the resulting rankings can help guide the selection of viruses for inclusion in vaccines the key insight provided by our work is that it is possible to construct de_novo a virus network from sequence_data and objectively quantify the positional importance of viral_variants within such a network for vaccine_development it is clear that choosing a single_variant as a type strain is problematic and vaccination with all known viral_variants is not technically_feasible consequently there is a need for techniques that filter highly_diverse genomic_datasets and select representative sequences for further study we suggest that the calculation of network indices that describe the relative importance of viral_variants may inform decisions about type strain selection and polyvalent vaccine_development although this approach is flexible and can be implemented using small and less diverse genomic_data more traditional approaches may be more appropriate in these situations of the indices we measured eigenvector centrality provided a robust prediction of variant importance this metric provides a measure of a viral_variants global position rather than its sheer number of connections i e k and describes sequences that are highly_connected and fall within densely populated substructures of the viral network more generally our case study of the prrsv system serves as an illustration of the potential of these techniques in the objective selection of important viral_variants for additional study we demonstrate that it is possible to select only highly ranked sequences and achieve equal or better coverage of putative t cell epitopes than using low ranked sequences and that top_ranked sequences achieve nearly as good t cell epitope coverage as artificial mosaic proteins derived computationally from the full set or sequences the latter conclusion is important because mosaicin porcine reproductive and respiratory_virus using either the top_ranked left bar or bottom ranked right bar viral variant using degree k as the ranking metric exact gray shaded and eight of nine one off white shaded coverage was computed for four test situations i the top and bottom ranked sequences from the nucleotide difference network ii the top and bottom ranked sequences from the amino_acid difference network iii the top and bottom ranked sequences from the evolutionary distance network and iv a mosaic protein generated from all sequences the mosaic sequence was generated by the genetic_algorithm described in all sequences including the mosaic protein were compared against all nine mers generated from unique prrsv variants proteins derived from the aforementioned algorithm may when synthesized have biological_properties that render them unsuitable for inclusion in actual vaccines our method achieves nearly equal coverage by identifying the most important wild_type viruses these viruses if they can be found in reference collections would make excellent candidates for subsequent biological studies with the goal of modifying their immunomodulatory_properties and virulence to the point that they would be suitable vaccine_candidates our results predict that such vaccines would be biologically viable while also conferring broadly cross protective_immunity our approach is likely to be useful given the extraordinarily large_amounts of data currently available as a result of next_generation although existing computational_methods to account for viral diversity are powerful when investigating small numbers of sequences the size of potential tree space and computational_complexity increases faster than exponentially with the number of sequences this forces use of biologyindependent filters e g limiting analysis to geographic_regions considering ease of access to samples or using well characterized genes to produce a dataset that is manageable at the other extreme there is a growing recognition that the use of consensus_sequences although computationally_efficient may not capture the evolutionary_dynamics or phenotypic_variation necessary to generate immunogenetic and broadly effective_vaccines our approach provides a way of distilling this overwhelming diversity and focusing subsequent analyses on a small and objectively chosen subset of viral_variants although biases may be introduced to the genetic_networks due to limitations in source data our approach is fully adaptable to sample_sets with different or no biases such as geographically restricted populations or to virulent populations of viruses notably our network_analyses were conducted and completed in h on a standard ghz desktop computer with gb of ram this suggests that our framework is not prohibitive from a computational perspective we suggest that network centrality_measures in differentiating viral_variants according to how influential they are can inform the selection of type strains for vaccine_design the degree k of a node is the first indication of its centrality intuitively a well connected sequence with a high degree will be traversed by a proportionally larger number of short paths than those sequences with low degrees however it is important to distinguish this metric as a local index it does not take in to account the importance of the neighboring nodes this suggests that a variant although well connected may fall within a relatively sparse area of the network and may not account for a large amount of genetic_information to overcome this restriction the other centrality indices quantify positional importance using global measures accounting for genetic_distance i e the number of edges on the shortest_path connecting i and j eigenvector centrality is particularly useful previous_research has suggested that nodes characterized by higher eigenvector centrality play a more influential role in the structure and dynamics of the networks in which they are nested in our viral networks those variants that have high eigenvector centrality scores are those that contribute disproportionately to global viral diversity acting as core variants that are likely to prove useful in the development of vaccines diagnostic_tests and epidemiological_surveillance strategies another potential metric that provides insight into variant selection is the betweenness of a sequence one biological_interpretation of this index is that it quantifies the probability that node i represents an intermediate step in the evolution between one sequence to another in we demonstrated a positive correlation between sequence degree and sequence betweenness confirming the intuitive idea that sequences of high degree are those with high betweenness the larger the number of neighbors a particular sequence has the greater the probability that the sequence will fall on a shortest_path between other sequences deviations from this correlation indicate gatekeeper sequences i e sequences that represent unique pathways to subsections within the network thus using this metric we are able to quantify a variants importance in two ways first a variant that has a high betweenness score provides a measure of the amount of genetic_information which the variant controls and second if a variant falls outside of the correlation we document it represents a unique_sequence that acts as a bridge to distinct modules within the viral network our rankings of prrsv reference variants reveal that many studies of prrsv biology to date have focused on reference_strains that are not central to the diversity of the virus typically such reference_strains are selected because of ease of access publication history and evaluation of whether the variant represents a particular geographic_location or biological property e g virulence and immunogenicity our analysis shows that selection of such strains may limit the generality of subsequent conclusions additionally current phylogenetic_methods that attempt to classify type strains b although analytically rigorous carry a series of assumptions that introduce biases into variant selection this is particularly true in prrsv where incomplete geographic sampling and a reliance on a gene for inference that is subject to strong immunological pressure has likely resulted in phylogenetic_trees that are suboptimal given these weaknesses and the failings of current_classification strategies seeand references therein we suggest that defining variant importance via network statistics is a promising and productive avenue indeed this approach is best suited for prrsv and other viruses with a large amount of genetic_diversity and little phylogenetic substructure in the case of viruses that sort into clear monophyletic clades it may be impossible to select one variant that represents diversity across clades in this situation we suggest a ranking system based on specific scenarios such as geographically restricted populations virulent populations of viruses or as in our case study the selection of known subtypes an alternate solution is to select sequences from within defined network groups using modularity based clustering heuristics see newman and references therein one strength of our approach is that it makes minimal assumptions about viral biology in assigning the rankings of individual sequences underlying matrices of amino_acid for example do not assign immunological importance to specific protein regions however our approach is very flexible for incorporating biological_information as it is generated for example our approach could easily be applied to specific protein regions that future_studies identify as being immunologically important a weakness however is that the representational framework is restrictive given the dyadic nature of interactions if our goal is to develop an effective vaccine this process may omit components of what is a complex system of interactions indeed research in the hiv field has revealed that induction of protective_immunity is a function of robust mucosal_immunity high_avidity and polyfunctional t cells broad neutralizing_antibodies and optimized vaccine_delivery methods this is in addition to the difficulties associated with viral antigenic diversity however decades of research have been unsuccessful in the development of broadly effective_vaccines for numerous highly_variable pathogens thus our approach to representing variability as a network and ranking variants for further study may prove to be a judicious strategy that aids in the development of efficacious vaccines and targeted control important tasks for future_studies include i improving our knowledge of the biological meanings of different centrality indices ii extending and improving the ranking system through comparative_analyses of similar viruses and iii testing whether the high_ranking individual variants are better in inducing crossprotective immunity than those with lower rankings in vivo furthermore a potential and as yet unrealized application of our approach is the targeted design of vaccines that modify virulence our case study incorporated all sequence_variation but it is possible to select for analysis only sequences of high_virulence vaccines rarely provide full protection from disease and those vaccines that are ineffective may unintentionally select for increased pathogen virulence we posit that given the high likelihood that any vaccine against a highly_variable rna_virus such as prrsv would offer less than perfect protection an alternative goal of vaccination could be to drive viral evolution intentionally toward benignness our ranking_method could provide rational criteria for selecting among highly_virulent types to include in vaccines that may over time drive the population of viruses toward lower virulence
