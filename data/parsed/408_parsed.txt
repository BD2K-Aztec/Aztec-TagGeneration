antarna ant colony based rna_sequence design motivation rna_sequence design is studied at least as long as the classical folding problem although for the latter the functional fold of an rna_molecule is to be found inverse folding tries to identify rna_sequences that fold into a function specific target structure in combination with rna based biotechnology and synthetic_biology reliable rna_sequence design becomes a crucial step to generate novel biochemical components results in this article the computational_tool antarna is presented it is capable of compiling rna_sequences for a given structure that comply in addition with an adjustable full range objective gc_content distribution specific sequence constraints and additional fuzzy structure constraints antarna applies ant colony optimization meta heuristics and its superior_performance is shown on a biological_datasets availability_and engineered rna_molecules are of growing importance with applications ranging from biotechnology to medicine and synthetic_biology in biotechnology several applications use engineered rnas as scaffolds to optimize reactions or to deliver drugs for example rna aptamers can serve as protein_docking sites within scaffolds to organize intracellular reactions or the bacteriophage phi dna packaging motor can be used to generate rna nanoparticles for delivering therapeutic_compounds however biotechnology applications are not restricted to scaffold design but often involve intriguing rna based pathways for instance penchovsky and breaker computationally designed ribozymes to sense oligonucleotides last but not least the application of the crispr_cas system for genetic_engineering is emerging and complementing the well established rnai technology this requires the design of specific rna_molecules see the review of terns and terns another important and growing_area is rna synthetic_biology as reviewed in design examples_include rna based regulators of translation a general rna based framework for microbial engineering on the level of dna protein or mrna srna based cellular circuits the improvement of functional srnas by scaffold engineering or the de_novo design of synthetic transcriptional riboswitches many of these approaches use rational_design based on a secondary_structure model of the targeted rna_molecule and an increasing number of applications use computational_methods for filtering the initial design in principle this is an instance of the inverse folding problem which consists of finding a sequence that fits some secondary_structure constraints rnainverse pursues seed_sequence generation with a subsequent optimization based on local_search the objective_function is either to v c the author published_by within this work we present antarna which solves the rna_inverse for given secondary_structures under additional side constraints using an aco approach besides the explicit target structure features specific target gc_content values sequence constraints and newly_developed implicit structural constraints are incorporated and presented target gc_content constraints allow to request sequences with a desired specific gc_content or from arbitrary controlled gc_content distributions while the latter is unique to antarna the results show that the tool produces on averageantarna ant colony based rna_sequence designsequences that exactly show the targeted gc_content even when additional sequence constraints are enforced the mfe structures of the designed sequences respect the provided structural constraints for almost all targets tested this holds for a broad range of targeted gc values with and without sequence constraints the program was optimized compared and evaluated on various sets of constraints derived from the rfam database the assessment revealed the superior quality of antarna produced sequences over incarnation and rnaifold the prime feature of a sequence and its biological functionality is the structure thus it should be the central objective for sequence design_tools incarnation does not achieve this objective and produced on average high structural distances in our experiments although it was tailored to enable specific gc_content optimization it also shows poor_performance in fulfilling the targeted gc values only its high sequence_diversity partially outperforms other compared methods incarnation applies a two stage optimization approach that first produces gcoptimized seed sequences that are subsequently optimized towards the target structure by rnainverse thus often the gc unaware rnainverse mfe structure optimization counters the gcoptimization in contrast the sequences designed by rnaifold and antarna show both very good structural as well as gc compliance although qualitative comparable on the level of constraint violation the tools show significant differences concerning reliability and sequence_diversity rnaifold is not always producing sequence solutions within the allowed runtime this might be due to the used constraint programming techniques and results in missing sequence designs for many constraint sets in contrast antarna is based on aco and applies a parallel optimization of all constraints thus it always reports a solution sequence with no qualitative loss furthermore antarna produces more diverse sequence_sets compared with rnaifold which shows a trend to non diverse subsequences summarizing the capability of antarna to reliably produce highly_diverse sequences for a given structure coupled with the precise gc targeting will help to explore the sequence_space for rna design_problems the introduced implicit structure constraints enable the user to define parts of the structure in a very vague way this can be of use when the structural context of a specific design target is less important as long as it does not interact with the important and maybe explicitly defined structure domains the improvement and application of the fuzzy constraint concept e g details about position or constraint type specific weighting is a focus of our ongoing work in total the results are promising and encourage further work which will include runtime optimization e g based on parallelization approaches in addition the implicit structure constraint is of great use in future work when modeling multi structure constraints or pseudo knot structures furthermore improving and developing new internal scoring mechanisms and evaluation patterns is subject of ongoing work such that the tool can also handle more complex input structures and their constraints in an adequate way this inevitably results in potentially new parameter setups for which we have to update our understanding of their synergistic_effects on antarna
