sequence_analysis deepblockalign a tool for aligning rna_seq profiles of read block patterns motivation high_throughput methods allow whole transcriptomes to be sequenced fast and cost effectively short rna_sequencing provides not only quantitative expression data but also an opportunity to identify novel coding and non_coding many long transcripts undergo post_transcriptional processing that generates short_rna sequence_fragments mapped back to a reference_genome they form distinctive patterns that convey_information on both the structure of the parent transcript and the modalities of its processing the mir mir pattern from microrna precursors is the best known but by no means singular example results deepblockalign introduces a two step approach to align rna_seq read patterns with the aim of quickly identifying rnas that share similar processing footprints overlapping mapped_reads are first merged to blocks and then closely_spaced blocks are combined to block groups each representing a locus of expression in order to compare block groups the constituent blocks are first compared using a modified sequence_alignment algorithm to determine similarity_scores for pairs of blocks in the second stage block patterns are compared by means of a modified sankoff algorithm that takes both block similarities and similarities of pattern of distances within the block groups into account hierarchical_clustering of block groups clearly separates most mirna and trna and also identifies about a dozen trnas clustering together with mirna most of these putative dicer processed trnas including eight cases reported to generate products with mirna like features in literature exhibit read blocks distinguished by precise start position of reads availability the program deepblockalign is available as source_code from http rth dk resources dba recent development in high_throughput hts technologies have made the demand for efficient algorithms for data_processing more urgent than ever ironically while the sequencing_costs decrease the analysis costs increase and consume the bigger part of sequencing_projects contributing to the demand is the novel possibilities which emerge with these data questions that need to be addressed range from expression analysis to the reconstruction of transcript structures and the recognition of particular classes of coding and non coding transcripts in most settings a reference_genome is available and analysis protocols start with mapping the sequencing_reads to that template genome here we focus in particular on the type of rna sequencing_data that is commonly produced in studies focusing on micrornas a series of publications reported that microrna sized small_rnas are commonly produced not only from microrna precursors but also from most other classes of structured rnas these small_rnas are often but not always produced by dicer several alternative dicer independent pathways that lead to similar small_rnas with microrna like functions have been characterized seefor a recent review the apparent diversity of processing_pathways bears the question to what extent the read patterns in rna_seq contain information on the processing of particular rnas well understood examples_include the characteristic mutual positioning with a overhang of mir and mir products that is characteristicpage we presented an approach deepblockalign and showed that it can be used for a meaningful clustering of ncrnas based solely on read processing_patterns in particular we find that the mapping profiles are well conserved between human and macaque most micrornas as well as the majority of the trnas fall into well separated clusters within the microrna cluster a subcluster contains the majority of microrna offset rnas indicating that deepblockalign is able to precisely distinguish between block groups that share a common core pattern consistent with observation that some snornas are processed by dicer we find the examples clustered together with micrornas several previously unannotated clusters were identified as potential antisense micrornas and as trna derived pseudogenes respectively showing that deepblockalign can be used for annotating unknown read_mapping patterns through unsupervised_clustering the application of deepblockalign for annotation of unknown processing_patterns on a routine basis however will require the development of appropriate measures of statistical_significance such as p or e values this will require further research as it remains_unclear at this point how appropriate background distributions could be constructed future updates of the algorithm also includes a more detailed tuning with respect to match versus mismatch scores we found that this approach is fairly robust against parameter variation for instance we tested the robustness of the deepblockalign algorithm by analyzing the benchmark_dataset using various values of the distance weight parameter dist observing consistent results supplementary the clustering approach can in principle be used for constructing multiple_alignments this could in turn be useful in identifying subtle differences in processing_patterns and assist the investigation of evolution of processing_patterns qualitatively the read based clusters closely_resemble the results of clustering known and predicted ncrnas based on their secondary_structure we suspect that this is not a coincidence since small_rnas are preferentially produced from base_paired regions this suggests that read_mapping patterns are likely to be influenced or even determined by the secondary_structure of the parental rna this signal appears to be stronger than variations depending on sequencing protocol and gc_content that have previously been reported e g by in the case of trnas chemical_modifications are the second major_contribution shaping the read_mapping patterns interestingly there is a single cluster comprising trnas with several different anticodons and isoacceptors that share an almost perfect read processing pattern this observation requires deeper analysis for further explanation the read processing_patterns of loci with low_expression may be biased by random fluctuations thus we have only included patterns with a minimum expression of reads rna_seq with deeper coverage will thus not only improve the clustering_results but also increase the number of block groups and thereby facilitate the detection of novel ncrnas
