systems_biology stringgaussnet from differentially_expressed to semantic and gaussian networks generation motivation knowledge based and co expression networks are two kinds of gene_networks that can be currently implemented by sophisticated but distinct tools we developed stringgaussnet an r package that integrates both approaches starting from a list of differentially_expressed contact henri jean garchon inserm fr availability_and freely_available on the web at http cran r project org web pack ages stringgaussnet analysis of genes_differentially de depending on a condition has become a standard procedure in current biology however identification of biologically_relevant de genes is far from being trivial yet efficient prioritization of de genes is an essential step before undertaking rate_limiting wet_lab in this regard the network_theory appears as a powerful framework the aim is to connect genes the nodes by means of their interactions the edges these interactions may be based on prior_knowledge curated and stored in databases or extracted from the experimental dataset e g using coexpression information sophisticated but distinct tools are available to implement either one of these approaches separately we introduce stringgaussnet an r package that allows inferring gene_networks starting from a list of de genes by integrating both of these approaches with ease and flexibility
