bisque locus and variant specific conversion of genomic transcriptomic and proteomic database_identifiers biological sequence_databases are integral to efforts to characterize and understand biological_molecules and share biological data however when analyzing these data scientists are often left holding disparate biological currencymolecular identifiers from different databases for downstream applications that require converting the identifiers themselves there are many resources available but analyzing associated loci and variants can be cumbersome if data is not given in a form amenable to particular analyses here we present bisque a web_server and cus tomizable command_line for converting molecular identifiers and their contained loci and variants between different database conventions bisque uses a graph traversal algorithm to generalize the conversion process for residues in the human_genome genes transcripts and proteins allowing for conversion across classes of molecules and in all directions through an intuitive web_interface and a url based web_service availability_and bisque is freely_available via the web using any major web_browser http bisque yulab org source_code is available in a public github repository https github com hyulab bisque the proliferation of genomic and proteomic databases has helped us organize and understand biological_molecules and phenomena but has left the scientific_community using many different naming conventions for the same or intrinsically related biological_entities genes proteins and transcripts while there are many tools to convert the identifiers themselves there are insufficient resources to convert loci and variants annotated in reference to these identifiers supplementary due to pervasive sequencing and variant annotation this has led to a routine burden on biologists to convert from one naming convention to another and may lead to errors when building upon other labs research here we present bisque the biological sequence exchange a multi interface utility for converting human genomic transcriptomic and proteomic loci and variants from their reported form into forms useful for downstream research bisque is an extensible conversion framework deployed as a web_server http bisque yulab org for user_friendly conversion among the most popular human database_identifiers it is also available as a programmatic web_service downloadable as a customizable standalone application v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com http github com hyulab bisque and importable as a python module while there are some tools available to perform limited conversion of positions and variants associated with database_identifiers supplementary these often exist as coupled conversionanalysis tools which lack the all to all conversion capability of bisque furthermore variant conversion is typically coupled with much more computationally_expensive functions such as variant annotation what is lacking in these tools is modularitya core design principle of complex systems that allows functional components to be repurposed for other tasks bisque embraces modularity in its own internal_structure through a generalized conversion framework which enables the expansion of its conversion capability bisque is also a module itself with the ability to perform multiple conversions for a scripting task or to act as the conversion engine for a database or analysis tool in this way bisque will be very valuable to the scientific_community as it publicizes vital biological infrastructure
