fast computation for genome_wide using boosted one step statistics motivation statistical_analyses of genome_wide gwas require fitting large_numbers of very similar regression_models each with low_statistical taking_advantage of repeated observations or correlated phenotypes can increase this statistical_power but fitting the more complicated models required can make computation impractical results in this article we present simple methods that capitalize on the structure inherent in gwas_studies to dramatically speed up computation for a wide_variety of problems with a special focus on methods for correlated phenotypes availability the r package boss is available on the comprehensive_r cran at http cran r project org_web boss in analysis of genome_wide gwas it is standard to fit very large_numbers of very similar regression_models a general form of commonly used models iswhere i n indexes subjects in the study y i is the subjects outcome of interest x i is a vector of subject specific adjustment variables g i is the set of genotype dependent_variables and i is an error term the genotype dependent_variables g i vary from model to model within one analysis but the adjustment variables x i remain identical within each analysis if the errors are uncorrelated standard ordinary_least ols or generalized_linear glm efficiently estimate genetic effects g however when the errors are correlated notably greater_efficiency can be obtained by incorporating this structure into the model for instance if repeated_measures on an individual are available either generalized_estimating gee or mixed models can increase power relative to an analysis that uses a single phenotype measure for each individual similarly when subjects are related kinship can be incorporated into a mixed model to increase power a single gee or mixed model analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed involves negligible computing effort but the number of analyses carried_out often extends into several millions meaning more complicated gee and mixed models computation with standard methods can be infeasible some computational speedups are available by capitalizing on the similarity of each regression meaning one can obtain genomewide estimates at a substantially_reduced computational_cost for example introduced an approximation to the maximum_likelihood estimate for mixed models which is currently implemented in probabel in their approach both phenotypic correlation and non genetic effects are estimated once and assumed constant across all models in an analysis when the inclusion of genotype does not change these parameters the inference is close to that obtained from the full fit but can be misleadingly inaccurate when genotype is correlated with non genetic covariates in another example rather than fixing both non genetic effects and variance structure proposed mixed model methods where the variance structure of phenotype is fixed over all markers in which case simple modifications to generalized least_squares procedures can give fast computation of the results this is more complicated to implement and slower than the probabel approximation but makes less assumptions about the nature of the genetic_association however one drawback of a mixed model approach is that results may be invalid if either the correlation_structure or the covariatephenotype relationship is not well specified if the phenotype correlation is due to repeated observations on an individual then gee models provide powerful testing which does not require us to correctly specify either the correlation_structure or the phenotypecovariate relationships that may be complicated however there are no software_packages that can currently implement this on a genome_wide scale in reasonable amounts of time in this article we explore two approaches that substantially reduce the computation required for a broad class of statistical_models each exploits two important features of gwas analyses i few covariates are different in each regression and ii little variation in phenotype is explained by genotype at a particular locus our first approach exploits symmetry in the estimation of single marker models for ordinary_least it is times_faster than current implementations and for mixed models it can reduce computation by a factor of a few hundred our second approach is based on matrix decompositions and applies to a broader class of models including those with multiple_markers and allows model robust variance estimation in the case of linear_mixed it aligns with a proposal byin this article we provided general computational_methods that capitalize on the structure of genome_wide to increase speed boss is composed of two distinct procedures but each takes_advantage of two important features of genomewide_association i few variables change from analysis to analysis and ii_genotype at each locus explains a small component of variation in phenotype recognizing this we demonstrated that one could perform nearly exact estimation and testing in a wide_variety of statistical_models fit with iwls including glm gee and mixed models for a lower computational_cost than currently implemented least_squares this had also been noticed in mixed models but our contribution allows the analyst to use a much b the error in the approximation as a percent of the ols coefficient against the p value herein the approximate coefficient with its associated variance yields identical inference to the ols estimate broader set of tools and for single marker models we provide a method which is substantially faster in particular it is now feasible to take advantage of repeated_measures with gee and doubly robust standard_errors on a genome_wide scale
