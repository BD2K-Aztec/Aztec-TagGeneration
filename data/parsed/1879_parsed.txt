structural_bioinformatics fragsion ultra_fast protein_fragment library generation by iohmm sampling motivation speed accuracy and robustness of building protein_fragment library have important implications in de_novo since fragment based_methods are one of the most successful_approaches in template free modeling fm majority of the existing fragment detection methods rely on database driven search_strategies to identify candidate fragments which are inherently time consuming and often hinder the possibility to locate longer fragments due to the limited sizes of databases also it is difficult to alleviate the effect of noisy sequence_based predicted features such as secondary_structures on the quality of fragment results here we present fragsion a database free method to efficiently generate protein_fragment library by sampling from an inputoutput hidden_markov fragsion offers some unique features compared to existing_approaches in that it i is lightning fast consuming only few seconds of cpu time to generate fragment library for a protein of typical length residues ii can generate dynamic size fragments of any length even for the whole protein_sequence and iii offers ways to handle noise in predicted_secondary during fragment sampling on a fm dataset from the most recent critical assessment of structure_prediction we demonstrate that fgragsion provides advantages over the state of the art fragment picking protocol of rosetta suite by speeding up computation by several orders_of while achieving comparable_performance in fragment quality availability_and source_code and executable versions of fragsion for linux and macos is freely_available to non commercial users at http sysbio rnet missouri edu fragsion it is bundled with a manual and example data fragment library is one of the key components of widely used fragment based protein_structure prediction_methods where complete models of the target structures are generated by combining fragments from the library therefore improving speed accuracy and robustness of fragment library generation have direct impact on the performance of these methods several approaches have been introduced over the last decade for fragment detection ranging from exhaustive_search to more sophisticated profile_hidden hmm_based comparison these methods require a template database against which segment of the target_sequence is matched in order to identify suitable fragments due to large size of the template database that includes all representative structures from the protein_data pdb the search is oftenslow moreover the incomplete coverage of pdb makes_it to map a reasonably large_fragment for the target protein recent_developments in fragment selection using probabilistic_models have shown promising directions to overcome the size and diversity restriction of database driven approaches by sampling local structure from a generative_model here we extend their scope by i sampling fragments of protein_backbone in full atomic detail rather than using a coarse_grained representation or assuming ideality in backbone planarity and ii allowing robustness against noise in sequence_based predicted information like secondary_structure the resulting application fragsion has been compared to the popular database driven fragment assignment protocol of rosetta on template free modeling fm targets from th edition of critical assessment of structure_prediction casp experiment the results show that fragsion i provides slightly better coverage than rosetta at the expense of minor loss in precision and ii computationally much more efficient than rosetta we assessed the performance of fragsion using casp fm domains supplementary_information by simulating in a blind de_novo scenario first we obtained sequences of the target_proteins from casp and executed psipred to predict secondary_structure using a non redundant nr protein_sequence database curated before casp the sequence and predicted secondary_structures were then used to generate fragments for each sequence position with variable fragment_lengths ranging from mer to mer the experimental_structures of target domains were then downloaded from casp and the residues that were not present in experimental_structures were discarded from fragment_libraries finally we assessed the quality of fragment library by superimposing each fragment in the library on to the experimental structure we used two commonly used metrics to measure accuracy of fragment library i precision the proportion of good fragments in the libraries number of good fragments divided by total number of fragments in a library and ii coverage the proportion of protein residues represented by a good fragment number of residues represented by at least one good fragment divided by number of residues of the target we also executed rosettas fragment picker application version with the same input to generate fragment_libraries using a template database created before casp and after excluding all homologues fragments during rosettas fragment picking the results show that there is only some minor difference between the performance of fragsion and rosetta over the entire dataset at various rmsd cutoffs between and a fragsion provides slight advantage in coverage versus while rosetta is slightly better in terms of precision versus average rmsd of fragments for different fragment_lengths are also comparable a for fragsion and a for rosetta to investigate the effect of fragment quality on the performance of de_novo protein modeling we executed abinitiorelax application of rosetta to generate two model pools each pool has models for each target using mer and mer fragments from fragsion and rosetta the average_accuracy of models generated using rosettas fragments is better than fragsions in terms of rmsd a for fragsion and a for rosetta the most accurate_models in terms of tm_score using rosettas fragments outperforms that of fragsions for all targets accuracy of fragsions best prediction in terms of rmsd however is better than rosettas for six targets the models having the lowest rosetta energy generated using fragsions fragment library outperforms that of rosettas for ten targets in terms of rmsd and only for three targets in terms of tm_score in general the accuracy of models generated using rosettas fragments is better than fragsions the most significant_advantage of fragsion is therefore speed average computation time for fragsion takes only s more than times_faster than rosetta with average computation time exceeding min a target by target comparison between fragsion and rosetta is presented in the supplementary document along with analysis on the qualities of the model pools produced using fragments generated by fragsion and rosetta we developed an easy to use software_tool fragsion based on an input_output hidden_markov iohmm to sample structural_fragments for proteins the model based tool without carrying a large_fragment database is light weighted and very fast and has the performance comparable to some widely used fragment generation tool which makes it a useful tool for template free protein_structure modeling
