extending gene_ontology with gene association networks motivation gene_ontology go is a widely used resource to describe the attributes for gene_products however automatic go maintenance remains to be difficult because of the complex logical reasoning and the need of biological_knowledge that are not explicitly represented in the go the existing_studies either construct whole go based on network data or only infer the relations between existing go terms none is purposed to add new terms automatically to the existing go results we proposed a new algorithm goextender to efficiently identify all the connected gene_pairs labeled by the same parent go terms goextender is used to predict new go terms with biological_network data and connect them to the existing go evaluation tests on biological_process and cellular_component categories of different go releases showed that goextender can extend new go terms automatically based on the biological_network furthermore we applied goextender to the recent release of go and discovered new go terms with strong support from literature availability_and software and supplementary document are available atgene ontology go has been widely used to capture the functional information and attributes for gene_products such as predicting gene functional_associations inferring gene_functions in genome_wide predicting protein functions and predicting subcellular_localizations go consists of three independent categories biological_process molecular_function and cellular_component in each category go terms are organized in a directed_acyclic dag to represent a complex hierarchy of biological_events functions or locations till september go has represented a total of terms and gene_annotations from more than species however despite the rapid increase of the go content the go structure is still manually_curated by teams of domain_experts of the participating databases regardless of continually growing and improving requests for new ontological terms manual construction of ontology as a complex and time consuming process has encountered a series of problems that are becoming increasingly difficult to solve first given the large_volume of biological papers_published in every year it hasbeen difficult to maintain consistency in how literature and domain expertise can be translated to terms and relationships in go even with stringent curation standards second although knowledge can be effectively retrieved from the literature using advanced text_mining tools the gap between biological_knowledge and new go terms and relationships still has not been met finally there has been a strong bias in coverage within go toward well studied processes resulting in the lack of coverage problem during the last decade tools have been developed to define new ontology_terms and to discover new relationships between existing go terms using natural_language graph mining and data_integration methods these tools aim to facilitate the effective expansion of go while ensuring validity uniqueness and proper relationships to the existing go however automatic go maintenance remains to be a difficult_task because of the complex logical reasoning and the need of biological_knowledge that are not explicitly represented in the go furthermore the complicated go structure which allows for multiple ancestors and multiple descendants for new go terms increase the level of difficulty for go update for example statistics shows that in the new biological_process terms that have been added to the go between and new terms share at least gene_annotations with the existing terms without gene_annotation prorogation indicating that it is necessary to fully consider the complex multiparent relationships when adding new terms to the go in this article we present a new algorithm called goextender to automatically identify new go terms from the existing biological_network data annotate the new go term with new genes and connect them to the existing go structure comparing to the existing_approaches goextender has the following advantages bullet to the best of our knowledge goextender is the first approach to automatically add new terms to the existing go rather than generating a new go structure bullet a novel edge based clustering method is developed to effectively connect new go terms with multiple parent terms bullet experiments on both biological_process and cellular_component show that goextender is able to identify novel go terms from biological_networks bullet applying goextender to recent release of go has discovered new go terms with solid supports from literature we expect that applying goextender on the newest version of go can help curators rapidly generate new terms and connect them to the go structure to fill the gap between massive biological data and the biological_knowledge represented in go
