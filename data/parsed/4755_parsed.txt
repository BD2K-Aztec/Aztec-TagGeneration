genome_analysis tssv a tool for characterization of complex allelic_variants in pure and mixed genomes motivation advances in sequencing_technologies and computational algorithms have enabled the study of genomic_variants to dissect their functional_consequence despite this unprecedented progress current_tools fail to reliably detect and characterize more complex allelic_variants such as short_tandem strs we developed tssv as an efficient and sensitive tool to specifically profile all allelic_variants present in targeted loci based on its design requiring only two short flanking_sequences tssv can work without the use of a complete reference_sequence to reliably profile highly_polymorphic repetitive or uncharacterized regions results we show that tssv can accurately determine allelic str structures in mixtures with representation of minor alleles or complex_mixtures in which a single str allele is shared furthermore we show the universal utility of tssv in two other independent studies characterizing de_novo mutations introduced by transcription_activator talens and profiling the noise and systematic errors in an iontorrent sequencing_experiment tssv complements the existing_tools by aiding the study of highly_polymorphic and complex regions and provides a high_resolution map that can be used in a wide_range from personal_genomics to forensic analysis and clinical_diagnostics availability_and we have implemented tssv as a python_package that can be installed through the command_line using pip install tssv command its source_code are available at https pypi python org pypi tssv and http www lgtc nl tssv as a consequence of various mechanisms such as dna_recombination replication and repair associated processes the spectrum of human genetic_variation ranges from single nucleotide_differences to large chromosomal events among the different types of genetic changes repetitive_dna show more polymorphism than single_nucleotide and they are important in human_diseases complex_traits and evolution in particular microsatellite variants also known as short_tandem str and their expansion shortening have been linked to a variety of human genetic_disorders and have been used in genotyping and forensic dna_fingerprinting studies kayser and because of the repetitive nature of strs and often the low_level of complexity of the dna_sequences in which they occur characterization of str variability and understanding of their functional consequences are challenging so_far sequencingbased strategies have focused on reads_mapped to the reference_genome and subsequent identification of discordant signatures and classification of associated strs yet the mainstream aligners such as bwa or bowtie do not tolerate repeats or insertions_and indels as a trade_off of run time this limitation leads to ambiguities in the alignment or assembly of repeats which in turn can obscure the interpretation of results moreover the current human_genome reference still remains incomplete and provides only limited information on expected and potentially uncharacterized strs in different individuals consequently strs are not routinely analyzed in whole_genome or whole exome_sequencing despite their obvious applications and their role in human_diseases complex_traits and evolution here we present a method for targeted profiling of strs that reports a full spectrum of all observed genomic_variants along with their respective abundance our tool tssv can accurately to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com profile and characterize strs without the use of a complete reference_genome and therefore minimizes biases introduced during the alignment and downstream_analysis tssv scans sequencing_data for reads that fully or partially encompass loci of interest based on the detection of unique flanking_sequences subsequently tssv characterizes the sequence between a pair of non repetitive flanking_regions and reports statistics on known and novel alleles for each locus of interest we show the performance of tssv on robust characterization of all allelic_variants in a given targeted locus by its application in several case studies forensic dna_fingerprinting of mixed_samples by str profiling characterization of variants introduced by transcription_activator talens in embryonic_stem es_cells and detailed characterization of errors derived from a next_generation ngs experiment in the past_decade advances in sequencing_technologies as well as computational_analysis tools have enabled the study of genomic_variations to dissect the mechanisms by which they exert their function in the case of human_diseases evolution and other complex_traits despite this unprecedented progress structuralvariations and repetitive_dna such as strs or coupling of de_novo mutations present major_obstacles for accurate and reliable allelic analysis in particular most computational_tools are not ideal to identify strs because of biases introduced during alignment as well as strong reliance of algorithms on coverage depth or the presence of split_reads here we present a method tssv that provides a high_resolution map of allelespecific genomic_variants within targeted loci of interest our approach does not rely on the use of a complete reference_sequence to reliably profile highly_polymorphic sequences such as strs or uncharacterized variants at a single_nucleotide however it does require two unique flanking_sequences that harbor the region of interest to identify supporting reads we assess the performance of tssv on profiling known allelic str structures across pure samples from a single individual as well as mixed_samples with variable abundance of allelic str structures that were targeted for sequencing six str_loci were sufficiently covered so that the associated allelic str structures could be reliably resolved the strong imbalance between yield of str_markers is because of the assay designed and optimized for fluorescent_dye based fragment analysis of str_loci used for preparing the sequencing library we show that sensitivity of tssv in determining allelic str structures exceeds mixtures with only representation of minor alleles and more complex_mixtures in which a single str allele is shared the lower boundary of detecting minor_allele is subject to experimental_design and the complexity of the targeted locus that may result in variable rate of slippage and background_noise our detailed analysis of three str_loci provides significant insights into forensic dna_fingerprinting of mixed_samples while it confirms the feasibility of tssv to profile causal allelic expansion of triplet tetranucleotide or more complex repeat structures in variety of human_disorders second we sought to profile and annotate the full spectrum of de_novo mutations introduced by talens that specifically target intron of hdmd in mouse_es the applicability of designed talens to introduce mutations in a targeted locus largely depends on its efficacy because this method lacks a selection procedure detected talen specific editing events were almost exclusively insertions_and that fit the expected mutation_profile of talens although it has recently been reported that talens induce insertions at a much lower frequency than deletions we have observed an extremely balanced rate of insertion_and versus respectively nevertheless talens induced deletions tend to affect more bases than insertions we show that tssv can resolve difficult to call editing events that affect the length of homopolymers based on the variant frequency in talen treated es_cells versus controls moreover the result of tssv analysis of talen treated and control es_cells suggests that observed de_novo structural_variants are predominantly caused by initiation of a double_strand that is repaired by non_homologous mechanism and are not the result of sequencing_errors notably the iontorrent variant caller failed to identify any of the observed variants because of their complexity and therefore does not provide any information on de_novo allelic structures that were introduced as laboratories begin to generate deep coverage sequencing_data to identify low frequent_mutations i e cancer_genomics the robustness and accuracy of ngs_technology and library preparation_methods has become vital after running tssv on a third dataset to identify potential causal_mutations in samples from five dmd patients and one female carrier we observed numerous systematic errors introduced by the iontorrent pgm sequencer or the base_calling algorithms the number of sequencing_reads that support the presence of a new allele was in excess of while no mutation was found after sanger_sequencing of the same libraries moreover the amount of allelic discordant reads were unexpected and could not be biologically explained as five out of six samples were derived from male patients who are expected to have only one copy of the x chromosome across all samples the majority of detected variations were single nucleotide insertions excluding duplications that were mostly the result of a single a insertion surprisingly insertions were predominantly specific to the plus strand that can be the result of flow order in specific sequence contexts although the second base caller improved the deletions and duplications rates that were derived from over or under calling of homopolymers the insertion rates remained_unchanged we further observed a preference for erroneous substitution events that were more pronounced in the second base caller however we were unable to identify motifs that may be associated with observed biases we argue that the result of tssv analysis and its ability to provide a high_resolution map of variants ever more highlights the importance of robust and vigorous assessment of downstream_analysis as we generate volumes of sequencing_data to identify rare_mutations and in the advent of ngs in clinical_diagnosis to demonstrate the added value of tssv over mainstream str profiling tools we ran lobstr and repeatseq on four samples used for resolving allelic str structures because repeatseq hardly reported any str_markers the performance of tssv could only be compared with that of lobstr we show that tssv robustly and accurately resolved allelic str structures with differing complexity tssv outperformed lobstr in reporting the accurate copy_number of major str unit while it provides additional information on allelic str structures and their strand specific frequencies notably tssv excelled in resolving complex_mixtures whereas lobstr failed to differentiate str structures associated with different samples and therefore produced unreliable and inaccurate estimations although lobstr performs well on genotyping diploid samples there is a clear need for tools to resolve mixtures with differing level of complexity and abundance currently the major_limitation of tssv is the sequencing read_length because the detectable allelic structures are restricted to those that can entirely be covered by a single_read thus we envision that the immediate developmental outlook for tssv can be the inference of allelic locus structure by local_assembly of partial reads reads with only one recognizable flanking region combined with the comparative_analysis of coverage of targeted loci and flanking_regions furthermore the promise of novel sequencing_technologies such as pacific_biosciences rs ii and therefore significant increase in read_length will aid the study of larger structural_variations advances in sequencing_technologies and computational_analysis algorithms in unraveling genetic_variations from snps and indels to cnvs have facilitated the study of experimental_data on an unprecedented scale to better understand the functional consequences of genetic_variations tssv complements the existing_tools by aiding the study of unknown uncharacterized or highly_polymorphic and repetitive short structural_variations that can be used in a wide_range from personal_genomics to forensic analysis and clinical_diagnostics
