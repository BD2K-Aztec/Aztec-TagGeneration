penalized logistic_regression for high_dimensional dna_methylation data with case_control motivation dna_methylation is a molecular modification of dna that plays crucial roles in regulation of gene_expression particularly cpg rich regions are frequently hypermethylated in cancer tissues but not methylated in normal_tissues however there are not many methodological literatures of case_control studies for high_dimensional dna_methylation data compared with those of microarray_gene one key feature of dna_methylation data is a grouped structure among cpg_sites from a gene that are possibly highly_correlated in this article we proposed a penalized logistic regression_model for correlated dna_methylation cpg_sites within genes from high_dimensional array data our regularization procedure is based on a combination of the l penalty and squared l penalty on degree scaled differences of coefficients of cpg_sites within one gene so it induces both sparsity and smoothness with respect to the correlated regression_coefficients we combined the penalized procedure with a stability_selection procedure such that a selection probability of each regression_coefficient was provided which helps us make a stable and confident selection of methylation cpg_sites that are possibly truly associated with the outcome results using simulation_studies we demonstrated that the proposed procedure outperforms existing mainstream regularization methods such as lasso and elastic_net when data is correlated within a group we also applied our method to identify important cpg_sites and corresponding genes for ovarian_cancer from over cpgs generated from illumina_infinium humanmethylation k beadchip some genes identified are potentially associated with cancers dna_methylation which is the addition of a methyl_group to the position of cytosine in the context of a cpg_dinucleotide is a molecular modification of dna that plays crucial roles in regulation of gene_expression particularly cpg rich regions are frequently hypermethylated in cancer tissues but not methylated in normal_tissues tremendous amounts of dna_methylation data have recently been generated from high_throughput dna_methylation platforms for example the illumina goldengate array the illumina_infinium humanmethylation k array and the most recent illumina to whom correspondence should be addressed infinium humanmethylation k array are popularly used these platforms are based on genotying bisulfite_converted the results of the array the methylation status of the interrogated cpg_site are a sequence of values one for each locus calculated as the average of approximately replicates of the quantity where u is the fluorescent_signal from an unmethylated allele on a single bead and m is that from a methylated allele a maximum between signal_intensity and is chosen to compensate for negative signals due to background_subtraction the constant is to regularize values where both m and u values are small this value ranges continuously from unmethylated to completely methylated and reflects the methylation_level of each cpg_site many researchers have applied statistical classification methods to select differently methylated loci statistical_approaches developed for gene_expression data may not be applied directly to methylation data since many genes are methylated while only a few genes are differently expressed however disease related cpg regions should still be sparse in which case the problem is equivalent to identify a few relevant_genes from high_dimensional gene_expression data compared with the case_control of gene_expression data there are currently not many methodological_developments for methylation data wang has recently_proposed a likelihood_based uniformnormal mixture_model to select differently methylated loci between case and control_groups one difference of methylation data from gene_expression is that the former ranges between and but this is not an issue in regression frameworks another key feature of dna_methylation data that has not been fully utilized is the group structure within a gene with the illumina humanmethylation k array there are about cpg_sites per gene where methylation_levels of cpg_sites within a gene are usually correlated unlike genotype data with single_nucleotide snps values are continuous thus correlations among them can be observed more precisely note that although cpg_sites within a gene are correlated some cpg_sites might be neutral while some cpg_sites might be causal therefore considering these features of dna_methylation data in this article we proposed a penalized logistic regression_model for correlated cpg_sites within a gene as predictors of a disease status the proposed method can select cpg_sites individually that associated with a disease while grouping effects are encouraged the penalized logistic_regression has been recently used to select snps or genes associated with a disease in high dimensionalinduce the overall sparsity and group sparsity respectively consequently predictors with stronger_effects on responses are more likely to be selected into the model however none of the methods above are designed to encourage selection effects for highly_correlated predictors for the analysis of correlated microarray_gene several variable_selection methods have been developed in the past_decade the fused_lasso imposes the l penalty on the absolute_differences of the regression_coefficients in order to account for some smoothness of the coefficients the elastic_net enet procedure which is a compromise between a ridge_regression penalty and a lasso penalty encourages a grouping effect of highly_correlated variables when genetic network information such as a genetic pathway is available proposed a graph constrained regularization procedure in their method a laplacian matrix representing a graph_structure was imposed on a ridge_regression penalty of the enet procedure such that linked_genes have a smoothness penalty on their regression_coefficients the authors demonstrated that when the information of gene_networks is incorporated into the regularization procedure it can select more relevant_genes than the lasso and enet procedures motivated by the graph constrained procedure by we extended it to the logistic regression_model for the analysis of case control dna_methylation data where our laplacian matrix represents cpg_sites clustered within genes the rest of this article is organized as follows in section we described our statistical_model and regularization procedure for grouped and correlated predictors cpg_sites together with the computational algorithm and the stability_selection procedure we then presented the simulation_results in section where existing main stream variable_selection methods were compared with the proposed method when predictors within a group are correlated section analyzed a real dna_methylation data in a case_control of ovarian_cancer finally we gave a brief discussion of the method and future_research in section in this article we proposed a penalized logistic regression_model for correlated predictors within a group and applied it to highdimensional methylation data in simulation_studies we have demonstrated that the proposed procedure outperforms existing main stream regularization methods such as lasso and enet when data is correlated within a group beadchip some genes in our findings are known to be associated with other types of cancers since we mainly focused on identifying most likely associated cpg_sites through selection probabilities we did not discuss about estimation performance of our proposed method in the case that prediction is desirable we strongly recommend to reobtain unpenalized likelihood estimates based on selected predictors this unpenalized mle is often adopted for better prediction our proposed selection method provides a way to potentially better select cpg_sites that are truly related to the outcomes among tens_of of cpg_sites who are correlated within genes however underlying true correlation_structure of methylation data is much more complicated than what we assumed particularly genes from a pathway may also be correlated with each other to incorporate a prior_knowledge of genetic_pathways may further improve the selection accuracy we are currently pursuing the usage of genetic_pathways information for the dna_methylation data analysis
