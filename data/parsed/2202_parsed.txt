hi jack a novel computational framework for pathway based_inference of host_pathogen downloaded from motivation pathogens infect their host and hijack the host machinery to produce more progeny pathogens obligate_intracellular pathogens in particular require resources of the host to replicate therefore infections by these pathogens lead to alterations in the metabolism of the host shifting in favor of pathogen protein production some computational_identification of mechanisms of hostpathogen interactions have been proposed but it seems the problem has yet to be approached from the metabolite hijacking angle results we propose a novel computational framework hijack for inferring pathway based interactions between a host and a pathogen that relies on the idea of metabolite hijacking hijack searches metabolic_network data from hosts and pathogens and identifies candidate reactions where hijacking occurs a novel scoring_function ranks candidate hijacked reactions and identifies pathways in the host that interact with pathways in the pathogen as well as the associated frequent hijacked metabolites we also describe hostpathogen interaction principles that can be used in the future for subsequent studies our case study on mycobacterium_tuberculosis mtb revealed pathways in humane g carbohydrate_metabolism lipids metabolism and pathways related to amino_acids metabolismthat are likely to be hijacked by the pathogen in addition we report interesting potential pathway interconnections between human and mtb such as linkage of human fatty_acid with mtb biosynthesis of unsaturated_fatty or linkage of human pentose_phosphate with lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in mtb metabolism is an aggregation of chemical_reactions utilized by cellular_processes to generate vital metabolites for survival and growth metabolic_networks are organized in pathways where reactions are connected to each other meaning that substrates input molecules catalyzed by enzymes are transformed to products output molecules these networks are represented as graphs the available information consists of metabolites enzymes genes and relevant annotations usually coming from experiments in model_organisms e g e coli and archived in repositories such as kegg ecocyc metacyc and amaze data that harbours the relevant_information enables the development of computational_methods that identify interconnections between cellular_processes with a focus on metabolic_pathway inference one stream of methods targets synthetic_biology and pathway reconstruction algorithms such as cmpf mrsd metabolic pathfinding and the fmm web_server take as input pairs of source and target metabolites and search for routes in the metabolic_network that satisfy specific constraints such as shortest distance between source and target or minimal switching from one pathway to another another stream of methods targets inference of complex regulatory_modules given sets of gene_expression the aforementioned methods opened new routes for investigating interactions between metabolic_processes simplifying functional mechanisms and deciphering relationships between genes chemical_reactions and metabolites using data from a single_organism however studying the interplay between two different organisms that interact host and pathogen and inferring relationships between them is a more challenging_problem in addition hostpathogen interactions are important for understanding infection mechanisms and developing better prevention and treatment_strategies of infectious_diseases however up to this point state_ofthe computational_methods for studying hostpathogen interactions have aimed primarily at identifying hostpathogen proteinprotein_interactions rather than at the metabolic_pathway level pathogens have the ability to survive and populate inside a host under extremely hostile conditions by invading the hosts immune_response system it is also well established that pathogens upon infection hijack some of the hosts functional processes to produce nutrients required for survival thus inferring pathways in the pathogen that are likely to interact with pathways in the host based on the idea of hijacking metabolites or nutrients is a novel and promising direction for studying hostpathogen interactions we propose hi jack a novel computational framework for inferring metabolic_pathway interactions between hosts and pathogens based on the idea of metabolite hijacking hi jack searches for chemical_reactions required for a pathogens growth that satisfy certain metabolite nutrient_acquisition criteria input to the algorithm is the metabolic_network of a host organism and the metabolic_network of a pathogen both metabolic_networks are represented as directed_graphs and graph_theoretic metrics as well as graph statistics are collected to rank pathways according to their significance in hijacking interactions the same ranking schema is used to identify chemical_compounds that are candidate targets of hijacking by the pathogen as well as chemical_reactions of great interest accompanied by their corresponding pathway details as a proof_of we studied mycobacterium_tuberculosis mtb and we applied hi jack to identify important metabolic_pathway interactions with human we focused on mtb since it is an ancient intracellular bacterium meaning that tuberculosis is an old disease in terms of historical documentation responsible for million deaths per year mtb is also known for its ability to manipulate phagosome to resist destruction by macrophages it is a pathogen extremely resistant to drugs and development of anti_tuberculosis remains an important health problem worldwide hi jack analysis revealed that in human pathways related to amino_acid carbohydrate_metabolism and metabolism of lipids are more likely to be hijacked by mtb strong examples are fatty_acid pentose_phosphate purine_metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism on the mtb side fatty_acid purine_metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated_fatty are ranked higher in our list of pathways moreover we found chemical_compounds that are frequent targets of hijacked chemical_reactions in human hijacking of carbohydrates and lipids is in agreement with evidence coming from the literature which indicates that mtb under very hostile conditions in the host switches to lipids as an alternative source of energy the analysis also revealed that mtb often hijacks compounds from human to produce metabolites linked to cellwall construction the evidence for the hi jack predictions mentioned above include the following principles i proportion of pathways that contain computationally predicted hostpathogen ppis ii proportion of pathways that contain genes required for bacterium optimal_growth iii tissue_specificity of the hijacked pathways in the host and iv linkage of the predicted pathways with known drug_targets our validation principles and some findings coming from literature confirmed the initial_hypothesis and indicate that hi jack has the potential to infer pathway based hostpathogen interactions and identify metabolites likely to be hijacked by the pathogens to our knowledge this is the first study that utilizes metabolic_pathway data from both host and pathogen metabolisms and ranks candidate interconnections at the pathway level based on their global significance in the phenomenon of hijacking vital metabolites also the proposed validation principles have high potentials to be applied in future_studies on hostpathogen interactions we proposed hi jack a novel computational framework for inferring metabolic_pathway associations between host and pathogen the framework defines a metabolite hijacking hypothesis and deploys a simple filtering algorithm to rank hostpathogen interaction pathways based on the idea of metabolite acquisition by the pathogen we also proposed basic_principles of hijacking interactions that support our results by different levels of confidence applicable in future_studies as a case study we focused on mycobacterium_tuberculosis and we revealed possible mechanisms that support pathogen growth and survival we found that amino_acid carbohydrate_metabolism and pathways related to metabolism of lipids are topranked pathways for both human and mtb for mtb frequent pathways are also related to lipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism as well as biosynthesis of fatty_acids in addition our predictions are supported by computational evidence viz hostpathogenppi support significant number of essential genes for optimal_growth and known drug_targets surprisingly of all ranked pathways in mtb are supported by at least one drug_target in addition tissue_specificity analysis for lung_tissue revealed that the top_ranked human pathways have a lot of expressed genes and thus hosting hijacking phenomena is possible nonetheless there is still space for improvements i integrating metabolic_network data from both kegg and metacyc may improve the quality of the results ii we are planning to study more pathogens like m leprae m ulcerans and h influenzae which appear to have very different growth requirements meaning that pathways required for optimal_growth enzymes and transportation mechanisms are different from those in mtb iii refining the hijacking hypothesis by searching for compounds that satisfy a predefined similarity threshold as defined by a compound similarity_metric like tanimoto coefficient is very interesting extension d from the software_development perspective the implementation of a more general algorithm that identifies hijacking points given an arbitrary number of steps away from the targeted reaction is an interesting idea for the future
