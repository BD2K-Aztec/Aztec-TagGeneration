sequence_analysis sighunt horizontal_gene finder optimized for eukaryotic_genomes motivation genomic islands gis are dna_fragments incorporated into a genome through horizontal_gene also called lateral_gene often with functions novel for a given organism while methods for their detection are well researched in prokaryotes the complexity of eukaryotic_genomes makes direct utilization of these methods unreliable and so labour_intensive phylogenetic searches are used instead results we present a surrogate method that investigates nucleotide base_composition of the dna_sequence in a eukaryotic_genome and identifies putative gis we calculate a genomic signature as a vector of tetranucleotide mer frequencies using a sliding_window approach extending the neighbourhood of the sliding_window we establish a local kernel density estimate of the mer frequency we score the number of mer frequencies in the sliding_window that deviate from the credibility interval of their local genomic density using a newly_developed discrete interval accumulative score dias to further improve the effectiveness of dias we select informative mers in a range of organisms using the tetranucleotide quality_score developed herein we show that the sighunt method is computationally_efficient and able to detect gis in eukaryotic_genomes that represent non ameliorated integration thus it is suited to scanning for change in organisms with different dna composition availability_and source_code and scripts freely_available for download athorizontal gene_transfer hgt occurs when a dna_sequence passes between organisms otherwise than by reproductive descent it results in a relationship of orthologous sequences that is not tree like and contains reticulations notorious examples_include antibiotic_resistance plasmids transferred between bacterial_strains pathogenicity islands incorporation of retroviruses and artificial hgt in the forms of genetically_modified organisms when a horizontally transferred gene becomes fixed in a population it is termed a genomic island gi relatively frequent hgt occurs between organisms of similar complexity such as between prokaryotes but successful hgt between domains and kingdoms is also known incorporation of the alien sequence into a recipient genome must be compatible with survival of the cell it should not for example knock_out an essential gene in eukaryotes distortion of the open_reading with hgt is less likely due to the sparseness of coding_sequences yet alien genes face molecular_biological limitations relating to metabolism in the recipient organism when genes are transferred from prokaryotes to eukaryotes the genetic_code difference might hinder correct protein_translation in cases of hgt between eukaryotes incorrect intron splicing would render the gene_product altered and potentially dysfunctional nevertheless successful implementation of hgt in a suitable place within the genome could result in expression of the relevant protein proteins encoded in a gi that could be expressed in the recipient organism might provide a novel highly adaptive function to find such a gi is to discover exciting information that is often transformative for the given research field hgt detection is well studied in prokaryotes having started from measuring variability of oligonucleotide frequency along the genome eukaryotic_genomes however are comparatively heterogeneous in their composition and much more extensive that situation complicates the hgt search therefore those methods developed for prokaryotes fail either due to their inability to handle the sequence heterogeneity or because their computational requirements skyrocket researchers studying hgt in eukaryotes use two types of methods surrogate and comparative surrogate methods use nucleotide base_composition of the dna_sequence they have been applied in the form of chaos game representation clustering based on tetranucleotide composition comparative_methods are computationally_intensive because they compute phylogenetic comparisons between large_numbers of identified genes or they use local_alignment comparisons against a reference_sequence database they require prior annotation of a genome an extensive database of comparable orthologues and computationally_intensive phylogenetic_analyses despite these limitations the results from comparative_methods are considered most reliable as they enable identification of hgt and the donor organism in the form of testable_hypotheses therefore methods have been developed to reduce the candidate dataset for gis while balancing the numbers of false_positives to whom correspondence should be addressed to date the effort in eukaryotic_genomes has been demonstrated consistently to fail on these criteria due to the genome heterogeneity in eukaryotes thus leading to the need for an expanding reference_database for comparative_analyses we show here however that genome complexity may be overcome by carefully examining the pattern of genomic signature along a sequence we use both the selection of tetranucleotides with greatest interspecific variability in their frequencies and local composition shifts that take into account natural_variation of tetranucleotide frequency changes along a chromosomal arm to locate regions that differ and might thus represent recent acquisitions via hgt we estimated mer density and its variance in the reference_genomes comparing the mers using tes we selected the most informative mers these were used for all subsequent analyses we present here a tool for identifying genomic_regions as candidates for hgt assessment in eukaryotes to our knowledge this is the first surrogate method primarily optimized for eukaryotic_genomes it detects non ameliorated hgt in large genomic_sequences it is computationally_efficient and its implementation provides step_wise user access to results that enables data exploration and analytical optimization we demonstrated good success in using sighunt to find introduced gis across kingdoms and gis in real genomic_sequences particularly in some fungi considering from a biological_perspective reproduction within this group hgt might be more common in fungi than in other eukaryotes with hgt_events being relatively common within the group one could speculate that some of these will be non ameliorated and thus easily detectable using surrogate methods the further example of galdieria within which gis were plentiful across the genome seems to corroborate this
