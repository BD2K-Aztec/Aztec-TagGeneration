multiple instance learning of calmodulin binding_sites motivation calmodulin cam is a ubiquitously conserved protein that acts as a calcium sensor and interacts with a large number of proteins detection of cam binding_proteins and their interaction sites experimentally requires a significant effort so accurate methods for their prediction are important results we present a novel algorithm mi svm for binding_site and evaluate its performance on a set of cam binding_proteins extracted from the calmodulin target_database our approach directly models the problem of binding_site as a large margin classification_problem and is able to take into account uncertainty in binding_site location we show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the standard svm formulation and illustrate its ability to recover known cam binding_motifs a highly_accurate cascaded classification approach using the proposed binding_site method to predict cam binding_proteins in arabidopsis_thaliana is also presented availability matlab_code for training mi svm and the cascaded classification approach is available on request contact calmodulin cam is an intracellular_calcium sensor protein that interacts with a large number of proteins to regulate their biological_functions and exhibits sequence_conservation across all eukaryotes ca plays a very important role in many cellular_functions ranging from fertilization and cellular division to neuronal spiking due to the importance of calcium_signaling in cells identifying proteins that bind cam and determining the location of the cam binding_site in them can help in gaining a better understanding of cellular function in general and the role of calcium in different cellular_processes in particular this article_presents a highly_accurate computational_approach that can identify the location of a cam binding_site in a protein solely on the basis of its amino_acid helping avoid the significant effort of performing such experiments in the lab our approach uses sequence_information alone which ensures its wider applicability in comparison to methods that rely on structural_modeling cam binding_sites are known to be contiguous in sequence often occurring through an amphiphilic alpha_helix o this makes cam binding_site amenable to a sliding_window classification approach as applied in recent work the method byuses a hierarchical neural_network classifier trained on the basis of amino_acid averaged over a fixedsize window showed that a simple sliding_window to whom correspondence should be addressed support_vector svm trained on average amino_acid achieves similar performance in this article we present a novel formulation of the binding_site prediction_problem that is based on the framework of multiple instance learning mil in mil positive examples come in bags for a positive bag it is assumed that at least one of the examples is indeed positive whereas negative bags contain only negative_examples we use this for binding_site by forming a positive bag out of fixed size sequence windows that overlap the annotated binding_site this allows us to model the uncertainty in actual binding_site locationexperimental methods may not precisely locate a binding_site and may include a region that is larger than the true binding_site due to limitations of budget and experimental_procedures furthermore modeling binding_sites this way facilitates the use of sequence representations that are position dependent yielding a more detailed model of the binding_site this allows learning of motifs that are characteristic of the binding_site mil has been applied in a variety of other problem domains such as object_tracking protein identification and prediction of proteinligand binding_affinities our results show that the proposed mi svm has higher accuracy than the classical multiple instance svm and is also faster to train mi also performs better than a standard svm thereby improving on existing work of we also compare the merits of several ways of representing binding_sites and demonstrate the ability of our method to learn motifs that are associated with cam binding finally we show how the resulting binding_site predictor can be used as the basis for a classifier that predicts cam binding_proteins with improved accuracy over earlier work
