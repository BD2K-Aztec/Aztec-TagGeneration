databases_and targethub a programmable interface for mirna gene interactions motivation with the expansion of high_throughput understanding different kinds of genome level data is a common task microrna mirna is increasingly profiled using high_throughput microarrays or next_generation the downstream_analysis of mirna_targets can be difficult although there are many databases and algorithms to predict mirna_targets there are few tools to integrate mirnagene interaction data into high through put genomic_analyses results we present targethub a couchdb database of mirnagene interactions targethub provides a programmer friendly interface to access mirna_targets the web_site provides restful access to mirnagene interactions with an assortment of gene and mirna identifiers it can be a useful tool to integrate mirna_target interaction data directly into high_throughput bioinformatics analyses availability targethub is available on the web atunderstanding genome level data is a recurring task in molecular_biology research made more challenging with the development of numerous high_throughput one interesting aspect of genome biology involves micrornas mirnas which are gaining significant attention for their regulatory_roles in human_pathologies mirnas are frequently profiled using high_throughput such as microarrays or next_generation the downstream_analysis of mirna data generated from such massive platforms needs efficient bioinformatics_methods mirnas regulate the expression of protein_coding by inhibiting translation and in some cases by cleaving the associated messenger_rna mrna many computational_methods predict such regulation based on sequence_features such as complementarity and free_energy of mirna mrna and their duplex potential mirna_targets are often identified by seeking agreement among multiple prediction_methods for a particular interaction currently several databases including tarbase mirecords mirgator and mirgen contain mirna_target predictions from multiple methods the web_sites of these databases provide graphical interfaces to manually access and search the data however for a complete mirna high_throughput analysis it is currently necessary to download the complete database of target information and write customized scripts to parse the data as there is no support for programmatic_access to subsets of the mirnagene interaction data here we present targethub a new programmer friendly database of mirnagene interactions targethub is a schema free database that can be accessed as a web_service from any modern programming_language using a simple hypertext transfer protocol http call this interface supports automatic integration of mirna_target information into high_throughput mirna data analyses the targethub web_site can also be used to manually access and search the mirnagene interactions with mirna identifiers and an assortment of gene identifiers powered by genesmash targethub offers a web_site and web_service to access mirna gene interactions it is a restful database with a programmerfriendly interface through the api maintaining a local copy of targethub is hassle free due to the built in support for replication in summary targethub can be a useful tool to integrate mirna_target information into high_throughput genomic_analyses
