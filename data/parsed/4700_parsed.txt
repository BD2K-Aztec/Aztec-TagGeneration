bioinformatics_discovery structural_bioinformatics tospovirus ambisense genomic rna_segments use almost complete repertoire of stable tetraloops in the intergenic_region the intergenic_regions of the ambisense rna_segments of viruses from the tospovirus genus form large extended rna_structures that regulate virus_replication using comparative structure analysis we show the presence of conserved alternative conformations at the apical parts of these structures in one conformation a branched y shape the proximal hairpin arms are mostly capped by exceptionally stable tetraloop motifs the tetraloop hairpins are folded in both virus and virus complementary sense rnas and different tetra loops can functionally replace each other folding simulations show that the branched y shape structures can undergo a conformational_transition to alternative extended rod like conformations functional_importance of both alternatives is supported by nucleotide covari ations the balanced equilibrium between alternative structures is evi denced by native gel_electrophoresis of mutant rna_transcripts with shifted equilibria the tetraloops play a role in the stability and dynamics of structures but may also be recognized by proteins involved in translation and or replication viruses of the genus tospovirus are plant infecting pathogens that possess ambisense genomic rna_segments these ambisense segments m medium and s small yield viral rna_transcripts of opposite polarities with non overlapping protein_coding the ends of vrna sense the polarity of the negative sense rna packaged in the virion and vcrna virus complementary transcripts overlap in the intergenic_regions igr the tospovirus m and s rna_transcripts are not polyadenylated like the majority of eukaryotic mrnas instead they contain a rich sequences in the utr of mrnas encoded in the igrs that contain long stretches of a rich and u rich sequences this results in the folding of extended stem_loop that have been suggested to regulate the translation and or transcription_termination of mrnas of both polarities the determinants of the regulatory_functions of tospovirus igr structured domains are not yet known the structures frequently called hairpins in the tospovirus literature may fold into various shapes with branched or unbranched apical parts at the top of the a urich stem loops e g here we investigate the hairpins formed by the tospovirus m and s rna igr domains searching for conserved structural_features comparison of predicted tospovirus igr structures shows that their conserved hairpin arms exhibit a striking bias in the loop_sequences to form tetraloops in the proximal arms of both vrna and vcrna structures using a considerable part of the known repertoire of extra stable tetraloop motifs a probability of such a bias to be determined by chance alone is negligible given a structure with two tetranucleotide hairpin loops what is a constrained motif by itself two stable tetraloops such as gnra and ynmg would randomly occur with probability in an uniform nucleotide distribution for gnra uncg conservation of these motifs in different viruses is not determined just by shared_ancestry because various tetraloop types are found in homologous hairpins showing that the tetraloops were evolved several times a probability of such independent events in different viruses and segments to be determined by chance being the product of sequence_motif probabilities is negligible this shows that the observed bias is determined by strong evolutionary_constraints these constraints suggest fast cotranscriptional formation of the metastable branched configurations that may delay the folding of more stable extended alternative stem loops the energy_barrier for this transition is determined by simultaneous disruption of two hairpins with total stacking free_energy of kcal_mol in bp capped by stable tetraloops thus the transition times may be considerable and effectively trap tospovirus igrs in branched configurations such kinetic trapping in a metastable conformation is supported by the igr folding simulations and the experimental study of alternative structures supplementary the coupled covariation pattern involving more than two bases is an indicator of a fine_tuned conformational_transition and multiplenote the loop closing pairs are shown in lowercase the nucleotides in the loops other than stable tetraloops are shown by dots in the tetraloop type column coupled covariations boxed in the s segment vrna structures examples of functionally_important cotranscriptional rna_folding are known functional interchangeability of tetraloop types is usually explained by their exceptional stabilities however the majority of tospovirus m segment gaaa tetraloops are closed by a u a base_pair which neither confers the exceptional stability nor is a frequent gaaa closing pair furthermore the gaaa tetraloops fold significantly_slower than ynmg ones and have folding kinetics comparable with the loops with an arbitrary sequence thus it seems that certain features other than just thermodynamic_stability and folding_rate are important in the tospovirus rna tetraloop replacements both gnra and ynmg tetraloops are able to form tertiary_interactions with various receptors in rna e g and also can be recognized by proteins for instance the less stable ugaaaa motif present in many tospovirus m segments specifically_binds the phage n peptide furthermore by analogy to the behavior of the phage n peptide targets the gtv vcrna proximal loop gaaaa containing the extruding adenine from the gaaa like fold is expected to retain comparable binding_properties the tospovirus igr structures were suggested to stimulate translation by assisting in circularization of mrna their y shape conformation resembles those of some of the plant_virus translational enhancers such as the so_called bydv like cap independent utr translational enhancers remarkably the bydv like cap independent utr translational enhancer left arms have gnrna and gnra loops that have been suggested to determine the binding of the translation factor eif g and recruitment of eif e or other yet unidentified proteins the tospovirus s rna_structures have been shown to act in concert with the viral_proteins n and nss presumably involving nss binding to rna one could speculate that the tetraloop motifs in the tospovirus igr structures determine the binding of translation factors and or other proteins a transition between two rna_structures may determine switching between different processes such as translation transcription and replication replication enhancers may also adopt various y shape or unbranched conformations with diverse loop motifs structurally_diverse igr domains are also folded in the ambisense segments of some viruses of the genera phlebovirus and arenavirus but these structures are not conserved this may be explained by differences in transcription_termination mechanisms further research is needed to elucidate the roles of the tospovirus ambisense igr structures and the function of the diverse tetraloop motifs
