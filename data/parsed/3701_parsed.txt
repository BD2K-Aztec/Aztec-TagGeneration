sequence_analysis priorseditor a tool for the creation and use of positional priors in motif_discovery computational_methods designed to discover transcription_factor in dna_sequences often have a tendency to make a lot of false predictions one way to improve accuracy in motif_discovery is to rely on positional priors to focus the search to parts of a sequence that are considered more likely to contain functional_binding we present here a program called priorseditor that can be used to create such positional priors tracks based on a combination of several features including phylogenetic conservation nucleosome_occupancy histone_modifications physical_properties of the dna helix and many more availability priorseditor is available as a web start application and downloadable archive from http tare medisin ntnu no priorseditor requires java the web_site also provides tutorials screenshots and example protocol scripts contact computational discovery of transcription_factor in dna_sequences is a challenging_problem that has attracted a lot of research in the bioinformatics community so_far more than a hundred methods have been proposed to target this problem and the number of publications on the topic is steadily_increasing there are two general approaches for discovering potential transcription_factor with computational_tools one is to examine regulatory_regions associated with a group of genes that are believed to be regulated by the same factors and search for patterns that occur in all or most of these sequences this approach often referred to as de_novo motif_discovery can be used when we have no prior expectations as to what the binding_motifs might look like one concern with this approach however is that it might be necessary to consider rather long sequence_regions to ensure that the target_sites are indeed covered since binding_motifs for transcription_factors are usually short and often allow for some degeneracy the resulting signal_to can be quite low making_it to properly discriminate motifs from background another problematic issue is that dna_sequences inherently contain a lot of repeating patterns such as tandem_repeats and transposable_elements which to whom correspondence should be addressed can draw focus away from the target binding_motifs when searching for similarities between sequences the other general motif_discovery approach called motif scanning searches for sequence matches to previously_defined models of binding_motifs for instance in the form of position_weight pwms the main_drawback with motif scanning is that it tends to result in an overwhelming number of false_positive according to the futility theorem put forward by a genome_wide scan with a typical pwm could incur in the order of false hits per functional binding_site which would make such an approach practically infeasible for accurate determination of binding_sites the problem here lies not so much in the predicted binding_patterns themselves since many of these would readily be bound by transcription_factors in vitro in vivo however most such binding_sites would be nonfunctional perhaps because the chromatin conformation around the sites precludes access to the dna or because the target factors require the cooperative_binding of additional factors nearby to properly exert their regulatory_function one way to improve accuracy in motif_discovery is to try to narrow down the sequence search_space as much as possible beforehand for instance by masking out portions of the sequences that resemble known repeats or considering only sequence_regions that are conserved between related species introduced a measure they called regulatory potential which combines phylogenetic conservation with distinctive hexamer frequency profiles to identify possible regulatory_regions this measure calculates a score for each position along the sequence and regions receiving higher scores are deemed more likely to have a regulatory_role regulatory potential can be considered as an example of a positional prior since each position is associated with an a priori probability of possessing some specific property positional priors can be used as an aid in motif_discovery by assigning high prior values to regions that we consider more likely to contain functional_binding and then focus the search on these regions besides conservation and oligonucleotide frequencies other features that can be relevant for assigning prior values include localized physical_properties of the dna_double distance from transcription_start or other binding_sites chip_chip and chip_seq and potentially tissuespecific epigenetic_factors such as the presence of nucleosomes and associated histone_modifications many of the aforementioned features have previously been applied and shown to improve the performance of motif_discovery by themselves see e g bellora and it has also been demonstrated that further gain can be achieved by integrating information about multiple features see e g we present here a program called priorseditor which allows users to easily construct positional priors tracks by combining various types of information and utilize these priors to potentially improve the motif_discovery process
