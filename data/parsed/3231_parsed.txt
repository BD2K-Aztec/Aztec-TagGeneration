systems_biology network based analysis of genotype_phenotype between different inheritance modes motivation recent_studies on human disease have revealed that aberrant interaction between proteins probably underlies a substantial number of human genetic_diseases this suggests a need to investigate disease inheritance_mode using interaction and based on which to refresh our conceptual understanding of a series of properties regarding inheritance_mode of human disease results we observed a strong correlation between the number of protein interactions and the likelihood of a gene causing any dominant diseases or multiple dominant diseases whereas no correlation was observed between protein interaction and the likelihood of a gene causing recessive diseases we found that dominant diseases are more likely to be associated with disruption of important interactions these suggest inheritance_mode should be understood using protein interaction we therefore reviewed the previous_studies and refined an interaction model of inheritance_mode and then confirmed that this model is largely reasonable using new evidences with these findings we found that the inheritance_mode of human genetic_diseases can be predicted using protein interaction by integrating the systems_biology perspectives with the classical disease genetics paradigm our study provides some new insights into genotypephenotype correlations decades of research into human genetic_diseases revolutionized by the application of innovative technologies including nextgeneration_sequencing and genome_wide has led to the accumulation of an impressive amount of diseasegene associations on the other hand the rapid development of proteomic_technologies provides an extensive protein interaction map that improves our understanding of the complex genotypeto phenotype relationships among human_diseases and their associated genes this provides an opportunity to reevaluate the traditional models about human genetic_diseases an important molecular_mechanism that underlies genotype to phenotype relationship is the inheritance modes including either dominant mode that a single mutated allele of relevant gene is enough to affect or recessive mode that both mutated_alleles are necessary although the rapid accumulation of diseasegene associations and protein interaction data promise to improve our understanding of the disease inheritance_mode and how it interrelates to the human_diseases at a systems level the incorporation of inheritance_mode has been rarely seen in recent large_scale studies protein network based study has been proven to be a valuable strategy for understanding the molecular_mechanism human_diseases recently the network perturbation model has been proposed as an alternative molecular_mechanism of human_diseases arguing that the inheritance_mode should also be recognized at the network level in this model failures in the connectivity of protein_interaction pin that alter the network_topology underlie human_diseases it was observed initially in caenorhabditis_elegans that mutations of gene rbap can cause the loss of a subset of interactions while leaving the gene partially functional subsequently a number of studies have provided strong evidence that mutations causing specific loss of interaction not necessarily complete loss of gene_product frequently occur in diseases schuster many disorders such as charcot_marie creutzfeldt jacob disease and alzheimer syndrome were found to be protein interaction related_diseases researchers also suggested that aberrant protein interactions involving gene htt may contribute to the pathology of huntington a recent study demonstrated that in frame mendelian disease mutations are highly_enriched on protein interaction interfaces suggesting that protein interaction plays a role in the pathogenesis of a substantial number of genetic_diseases so_far the classical model of genotype to phenotype relationship is gene centric assuming that a mutation causes complete loss of a gene_product however the networkperturbation model suggests that in principle the understanding of mendelian_inheritance should take into account of the interaction between two genes to our knowledge two recent_studies analyzed the connection between inheritance modes of human genetic_diseases and protein interactions schuster bockler and to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com schuster bockler and bateman collected known protein interaction altering mutations from scientific literatures and observed a significant_enrichment of autosomal_dominant ad mutations versus autosomal_recessive ar mutations zhong et_al found that ad disorders are more frequently associated with in frame mutations than ar disorders a mutation_type that frequently leads to defective protein interaction rather than complete gene loss given the previous_findings about the correlation between interaction and inheritance_mode it is highly probable that protein network_properties can differentiate between different inheritance modes here by taking_advantage of comprehensive protein interaction data and a large number of mendelian_diseases with known inheritance_mode we conducted a systematic study to show the correlation between protein network and inheritance modes and refined a likely interaction based model to explain the correlation unlike non pathological variations and out frame disease mutations it has been found recently that in frame disease mutations are significantly_enriched on interactions interfaces the in frame mutations were suggested more likely to alter protein interaction and were found to be able to distinguish between ad and ar disorders these suggest protein network can provide novel insights into genotype_phenotype between different inheritance modes we therefore analyzed a series of network_properties between ad and ar inheritances and found i network_connectivity strongly correlated with the likelihood of a gene causing ad diseases disease risk and the ability of a gene causing multiple ad diseases pleiotropy ii ad diseases are more likely to be associated with the bottleneck genes whereas no significantschematic illustration of ad ar genes with multiple interactions protein interaction can be used as a molecular basis to understand the correlation between network_connectivity and ad disease and the pleiotropy of ad disease genes whereas it is not appropriate for explaining the pleiotropy for ar disease genes b schematic diagram of the differences between ad and ar disease genes ad disease genes are shown as orange nodes located in functional center of pin as hubs core members and bottlenecks of modules whereas ar disease genes are shown as green nodes segregated at the periphery of pin resulting in large network distances from other ar disease genes associated with different diseases network based analysis of genotypephenotype correlations correlation was found for ar diseases to explain the results we refined a model based on previous_studies and supported with more evidence it was argued that network based study may improve our conceptual understanding of the term pleiotropy on account of diverse disorders that result from losing different interactions of the same gene however our study suggests that the pleiotropy of ar disease genes should be treated_differently from ad disease genes in addition to gene pleiotropy the clinical_features may show striking variation among patients for the same dominant disorder and in some cases show no abnormal clinical_features we expect that with further systematic investigations of the relationship between human ad disorders and gene_networks this variable expressivity and reduced penetrance of dominant diseases together with the pleiotropy would be better understood pleiotropy is also one of the reasons that multiple_diseases co occur in the same patient many comorbid_disease pairs have been shown to share the same pleiotropic gene therefore our study may also suggest different comorbid tendencies between ad disease pairs and ar disease pairs because topological central genes are more essential than other genes our results may suggest that mutations on ad genes are more likely to cause severe_impairment of cell function than mutations on ar genes in our study the proportion of ad genes having mouse lethal orthologs are significantly_higher than that of ar genes test p the connection with important interaction may be one of the reasons why non lethal dominant mutations are sometimes found to cause embryonic_lethality when homozygous the results would be more consistent with the model by analyzing only loss_of for this purpose we compiled genes known to cause disease through haploinsufficiency hi from previous_studies similar results were reproduced by analyzing hi genes supplementary significantly different network_properties were found between hi genes and ar genes whereas no significantly different properties were found between hi genes and other ad genes a recent study has also investigated the relationship between dominant and recessive_mutations in interfaces with the same or different disorders different with this study we only analyzed mutation pairs in the same gene because of the small number of interactions being mapped by mutations on the corresponding interfaces of interacting_proteins the study presented some different results and suggested that ad mutation pairs on corresponding interaction interfaces of interacting_proteins are not likely to cause the same disease we suggest that it is possibly due to the fact that tissue_specific expression imposes spatial restriction on these interactions gain_of and dominant_negative mutations are also important mechanisms of dominant diseases for which the data are not currently available at a large_scale it is possible that some mutations on ad genes are associated with the gain of new interactions or that some dominant mutations give rise to altered gene_product blocking the interaction of wild_type gene_product revised model taking_into of multiple mutation types would be necessary in the future study in addition disease_progression is also associated with mutations causing the change of other molecular_interaction types such as in transcriptional_networks or metabolic_networks integration of different types of molecular_interactions should further improve our understanding of the inheritance modes of genetic_diseases we believe that as more large_scale data of diverse molecular_interactions and more specific disease mutations are detected our knowledge of the genotypephenotype relationship will be highly expanded to which we hope our study made a contribution
