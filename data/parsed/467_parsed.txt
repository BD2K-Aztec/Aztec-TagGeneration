a rate distortion theory for gene_regulatory and its application to logic gate consistency motivation a gene_regulatory in which the modes activation inhibition of the transcriptional regulations are known and in which gene_expression assumes boolean values can be treated as a system of linear equations over a binary field i e as a constraint satisfaction problem for an information code results for currently available gene_networks we show in this article that the distortion associated with the corresponding information code is much lower than expected from null_models and that it is close to when not lower than the shannon bound determined by the rate distortion theorem this corresponds to saying that the distribution of regulatory modes is highly atypical in the networks and that this atypicality greatly helps in avoiding contradictory transcriptional actions choosing a boolean formalism to represent the gene_networks we also show how to formulate criteria for the selection of gates that maximize the compatibility with the empirical information available on the transcriptional_regulatory modes proceeding in this way we obtain in particular that non canalizing gates are upper bounded by the distortion and hence that the boolean gene_networks are more canalizing than expected from null_models a gene_regulatory consists of a set of transcription_factors tf regulating the expression of the genes of a given genome as our knowledge of these regulatory_mechanisms grows steadily the problem of understanding the principles behind their organization and their functioning is becoming a crucial question of systems_biology see while the current_literature is focused mainly on the topological aspects of a gene_regulatory the perspective that we take in this article is to study whether the transcriptional_regulatory modes i e the activation inhibition role of a tf on its target_genes of the gene_networks currently available are distributed randomly on the given network or are organized according to some criterion and how this organization can affect the dynamics of the gene network to formalize this question and to try to understand the rules of this design we use tools from information_theory and in particular we treat a gene network as a code for which the signs of the regulatory actions constitute a particular source word which can be compared with the typical words generated by a corresponding probabilistic_model further details on the terminology in section as a comparison criterion we use the level of coherence of the regulatory actions along the network two regulatory orders emanating from a tf and acting on the same target_gene possibly through intermediate genes are considered coherent when they induce the same behavior on the target_gene i e they both induce activation or repression they are considered incoherent when they induce conflicting behaviors as can be easily deduced from simple examples like feedforward loops ffl in a gene_regulatory incoherence is associated with negative undirected cycles on the signed graph having the genes as nodes the regulations as edges and the modes of the regulations as signs of the edges see an undirected cycle is negative when it contains an odd number of inhibitions provided we associate binary values to the expression of the genes the main_feature of a negative undirected cycle is that no choice of expression can satisfy all constraints imposed by the regulations this satisfiability can be tested by formulating the compatibility as a system of linear algebraic equations over a binary field in combinatorial_optimization such problems are well known to be equivalent to constraint satisfaction problems of exclusive or xor type see if the gene_regulatory is a code and the signs of the regulations specify a codeword then the problem can be studied as a lossy source compression problem see ciliberti and mezard in this framework in particular the level of coherence of the transcriptional regulations can be rigorously computed as the distortion introduced by the source compression problem computing this distortion is a hard problem in the constraint satisfaction literature it is sometimes referred to as maximum xor satisfiability maxxorsat problem and consists in computing the binary gene_expression assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied sat linear equations at steady_state see for the gene_networks currently available the distortion can be quantified with sufficient precision and can be compared with two important quantities i the average distortion of a typical word associated to the same code i e a gene network with the same topology but signs reshuffled ii the best average distortion achievable by any gene network with the same ratio of genes regulations the latter value corresponds to the shannon bound provided by the rate distortion theorem we show in the article that the distortion of the currently available gene_networks is much lower than the one of a typical sequence of the same code and that it is comparable with when not better than the shannon bound this atypicality implies that in our gene_networks the signs of the transcriptional regulations are highly_organized and far from random in particular the origin of the low distortion can be traced in the scarcity of dual mode tf i e of tf acting both as activators and as repressors our calculation suggests a practical reason for such an organization single mode tf lower the distortion and hence help in avoiding conflictual transcriptional orders in which different tf induce contradictory actions on a downstream_gene in a gene network represented as a signed graph the regulatory actions represent two body interaction_terms i e the value of a gene acting as a tf multiplied by that of its target_gene with the sign of the corresponding edge or in system theoretic language single input single output siso regulations when multiple genes act simultaneously as tf on a target_gene the overall regulation can be described as a superposition of these siso terms an alternative assumption common in the gene network literature is that the transcription of a gene having multiple regulators is decided by some logical combination of the inputs this corresponds to replacing superpositions of two body terms with a single multibody term miso multi input singleoutput action one of the major_drawbacks of the boolean_networks obtained in this way is the arbitrarity in the choice of the gates due to the lack of systematic methods for gates disambiguation based on experimental_evidence see e g for a few attempts in this direction mostly based on inference from microarrays the approach that we take in this article is to try to identify classes of boolean gates such that the steady_state miso predictions for the regulation overlap as much as possible with the corresponding siso predictions in terms of perturbative expansions this corresponds to asking that the two body projections of the complex multibody terms be coherent with the corresponding two body terms whenever the latter are not ambiguous the rationale behind this choice is that the only type of information currently available in large_scale gene_networks is precisely compendia of siso regulatory signs we will show in the article that under this assumption a natural choice is to associate canalizing gates i e and or type of gates see to positive undirected cycles and possibly non canalizing gates to negative undirected cycles the property of low distortion of the gene_networks then reflects in a low amount of non canalizing gates in the boolean formulations of the gene_networks with respect to null_models looking at the corresponding dynamics we observe that in spite of the higher canalization our gene_networks seem to be more sensitive to perturbations than the corresponding null_models this appears to be due to the near acyclic and massively_parallel feed_forward architecture of the networks in which noncanalizing gates have the effect of breaking the steady_state global symmetry of the basic inputoutput motifs
