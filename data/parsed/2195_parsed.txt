sequence_analysis high_quality snp_calling using illumina data at shallow coverage motivation detection of single_nucleotide snps has been a major application in processing second generation sequencing sgs data in principle snps are called on single base differences between a reference_genome and a sequence generated from sgs short_reads of a sample genome however this exercise is far from trivial several parameters related to sequencing quality and or reference_genome properties play essential effect on the accuracy of called snps especially at shallow coverage data in this work we present slider_ii an alignment and snp_calling approach that demonstrates improved algorithmic approaches enabling larger number of called snps with lower false_positive in addition to the regular alignment and snp_calling as an optional feature slider_ii is capable of utilizing information about known snps of a target_genome as priors in the alignment and snps calling to enhance its capability of detecting these known snps and novel snps and mutations in their vicinity the ability to perform an unambiguous alignment of sequence_reads and the detection of sequence_variants is an essential task in processing the output of second generation sequencing as this technology evolves algorithms used in alignment and single_nucleotide snp_calling need to be modified to adapt to rapidly_changing parameters such as read_length overall read quality the number of reads and the sequence_coverage being generated furthermore information about reference_genomes in particular known polymorphisms have the potential to improve the alignment and snp_calling accuracy for example the current human reference_sequence typically used for alignment reflects within any region a single haplotype that will contain private snps as well as ones of low_frequency within the human population such polymorphic regions through their generation of an alignment mismatch will impede the ability to determine nearby mutations of interest a commonly used application for alignment and snp_calling from illumina_reads is the maq aligner maq uses to whom correspondence should be addressed hash tables to align the most probable sequence of each read to a reference_genome and then uses the bayesian theorem to construct consensus_sequence from these aligned and calibrated most probable reads a list of snps are called on differences between the reference_sequence and the consensus and filtered by a set of threshold cutoff parameters such as snp quality_score minimum and maximum coverage the maximum allowed number of snps in a small window dense snps and the size of this small window previously we reported on the ability of the slider algorithm to use a merge sort approach for aligning the probability prb values at each position of illumina short_reads by utilizing the probability_values to reconstruct likely sequences from each read slider was able to achieve considerably_higher alignment_accuracy reducing the number of mis mapped_reads arising due to sequence error the algorithmic approach of slider_ii continues to utilize the probability of all four possible nucleotides generated by illumina to improve the overall alignment this information has also been incorporated to improve snps calling quality in brief slider_ii high snp_calling accuracy is a result of higher alignment_accuracy of slider higher snp_calling capability achieved in utilizing information provided in prb data and higher snps filtering accuracy bullet high alignment_accuracy while most aligners are designed to align the most probable sequence higher alignment_accuracy is achieved by slider by aligning the prb sequences for all four bases slider_ii uses the merge sort approach of slider to align seeds of the first bases higher quality bases of each read and then extend these seeds to full reads bullet after the alignment step slider_ii utilizes more information provided in prb data for snp_calling bullet using all four prb values in a consensus construction yield a more discriminatory probability accumulation compared to only using the probability of the most probable base mpb bullet with heterozygous snps the expectation is to have approximately_equal coverage representation for the reference nucleotide and the allele nucleotide however this coverage due to the low numbers is likely to be skewed in favor of one nucleotide or another since probability accumulates exponentially to the level of coverage such coverage unbalance is likely to mask the probability of the under represented nucleotide therefore in order to overcome this slider_ii builds a coverage probability consensus that only include data when the reference nucleotide has a lower probability than some threshold value again having the probability_values of all four nucleotides enables more accurate filtering of these bases page we utilized illumina lanes of human breast_cancer whole_genome paired_end sequence_data representing a total of million_reads ranging in size from to bases these data were processed using both slider_ii version and maq version reads were first aligned to the human_genome hg resulting in an average coverage of for each aligner snps were called and sorted in descending order using the snp score for slider_ii and the phred like consensus quality_score provided by maq we used the concordance of the called snps with the ensembl variation database version snps to compare snp_calling accuracy we postulate that a higher_level of concordance with the variation database given its large size and yet relative rarity of snps in the reference can only reflect a higher degree of accuracy in snp_calling although snp concordance does not give an exact estimate of snp_calling accuracy it provides a good relative measure of performance concordance provides a lower boundary of this accuracy and an upper boundary to the novel snps in the sample for example in a set of n called snps if we have a concordance of x this means that bullet our snps calling accuracy is at least x it is exactly x when the sample data contain only known snps bullet the snps in our sample data has at most x novel snps the percentage of novel snps is exactly x when we have no calling errors therefore if the sample data contain y novel snps and y x novel snps accuracy is z and z y x shows the concordance of top scored snps for slider_ii without using known snps as priors slider_ii a with known snps as priors slider_ii b and for maq at minimum coverage depths of and whereas for slider_ii the called snps concordance is correlated with their scores the maq concordance dropped_significantly for snps reported with high quality_scores this phenomenon appears to be contributed by snps generated as a result of alignment to paralogous or duplicated regions since maq does not have the capability of filtering out such snps to provide a more comparable analysis we filtered out snps indicating sequence_coverage higher than within the page maq output in order to reduce those inaccurately called snps at high quality_scores shows that slider_ii using the probabilities of all four bases is able to identify more snps with higher accuracy than maq the results in figures and also show that the usage of polymorphism priors slider_ii b enables the detection of a larger number of snps with substantially_higher calling accuracy shows the output overlap for slider_ii snps not including prior_knowledge of known snps with score greater than counting or about top scoring snps and all of the maq called snps with coverage in the rangesnps slider_ii does not rely on such heuristic values instead utilizes the expected ratio of polymorphism in the reference_genome for identifying snps at each position in addition an automated approach filters out paralogous snps without a user instantiated cut_off value for maximum coverage in this article we presented a comprehensive snps calling tool from prb values of illumina short_reads which aligns illumina short prb reads to a reference_genome utilizes alignment information in calibrating all four prb values and accumulates bases probability using bayes approach and finally snps are called on nucleotide_differences between the accumulated bases probabilities and the reference_genome when our confidence in a consensus accumulated from the reads is higher than our confidence of the used reference each called snp is associated with a single score that ranks its accuracy among the set of called snps snps that are likely to be a result of genomic_rearrangements are either down scored or removed as an optional feature known snps of a target_genome can be utilized as priors in alignment and snps calling which increases the capability of detecting known snps results show that slider_ii calls more snps with higher accuracy than the leading competitive tools fromwe see that the concordance with ensembl known snps for slider_ii is higher than that of maq at every output size for example at concordance of slider_ii was able to call more than million snps whereas maq called about million snps we contribute this higher snps calling accuracy of slider_ii to two factors the use of prb values prb values result in higher alignment_quality and more discriminatory probability accumulation outcome compared to qcal value of the mpb which enabled
