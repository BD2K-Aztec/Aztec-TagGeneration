a bio inspired computing model for ovarian_carcinoma classification and oncogene detection downloaded from motivation ovarian_cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer_deaths in women in the western_world for in ovarian_cancer benign_tumors turn malignant but the point of transition is difficult to predict and diagnose the year survival_rate of all types of ovarian_cancer is but this can be improved to if the cancer is found and treated before it spreads beyond the ovary however only of all ovarian_cancers are found at this early_stage therefore the ability to automatically identify and diagnose ovarian_cancer precisely and efficiently as the tissue changes from benign to invasive is important for clinical treatment and for increasing the cure_rate this study proposes a new ovarian_carcinoma classification model using two algorithms a novel dis cretization of food_sources for an artificial_bee dfabc and a support_vector svm for the first time in the literature oncogene detection using this method is also investigated results a novel bio inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms combining dfabc and svm was applied to ovarian_carcinoma and oncogene classification this study used the human ovarian cdna expression database to collect patient samples and genes in each pathological_stage feature_selection were used to detect and extract notable oncogenes we then used the dfabc svm model to examine these oncogenes dividing them into eight different classifications according to their gene_expressions of various pathological stages the average accuracyof the eight classification experiments was this research also found some oncogenes that had not been discovered or indicated in previous scientific_studies the main contribution of this research is the proof that these newly_discovered oncogenes are highly related to ovarian or other cancers availability_and ovarian_cancer is a common gynecological_cancer which is the fifth leading cause of cancer_deaths in women in the western_world the overall year survival_rate for ovarian_cancer is about a statistic that has remained_unchanged in america for the past_years ovarian_cancer patients generally go through three major pathological stages benign borderline and invasive for those whose ovarian_cancer is diagnosed in the early pathological_stage the survival_rate is higher however the transition from a symptomatic benign ovarian_tumor ovt to a cancerous malignancy is difficult_to and estimate ca is commonly used for ovarian cancer_screening but its specificity or sensitivity is insufficient for early detection many recent scientific_studies have noted that gene_expressions are highly related to the identification of ovarian cancer_stages in these studies the microarray has been used extensively and shown to be a promising tool microarray_analysis has revealed specific genes called oncogenes which biological_experiments have apparently indicated are causally related to ovarian_cancer based on this same analysis pathologists have further observed the variations of gene_expressions in these specific ovarian genes and compared the levels of gene_expression in different pathological stages and conditions biological and statistical computing can be used to represent gene_expressions for such comparisons particularly during the progressive states as a tumor transitions from benign to invasive ovarian_cancer tissue therefore gene_expression analysis has become increasingly important because of its excellent_performance in both bioinformatics and biomedical_studies of the human_genome system however gene_expression analysis is a complex process and requires a large dataset in order for enough useful information to be extracted thus computer based analysis and classification of diseases can be helpful for diagnostics the support_vector svm is one artificial_intelligence method which has recently become popular mainly because it can process classification and predication via different core parameters and is more capable of making predictions using different types of datasets in addition the svm formalism is also a graphical and mathematical tool for the design specification simulation and verification of systems in recent_years the bio inspired algorithm has become increasingly useful as an optimization tool by simulating biologically peculiar social_behavior such as mating or foraging bio inspired algorithms quickly search for the optimal_solution and achieve the effect of stable convergence therefore this study proposes to apply the parameter_optimization method i e a discretized food_source for an artificial_bee dfabc algorithm to an svm model to develop a hybrid dfabcsvm classification model which achieves fast convergence and has good prediction capability when handling complex and varying types of ovarian_cancer datasets in addition the proposed model is compared with those of several pioneering studies regarding ovarian_carcinoma prediction in this study a novel bio inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms of dfabc and svm were applied to the classification of ovarian_carcinoma and the prediction of oncogenes the average_accuracy of predicted target oncogenes in eight classifications was over according to the literature oncogenes are reportedly related to various cancers and five genes pappa cxcl pfkfb gnb and bcl are associated with ovarian_cancer at different pathologic stages in addition two oncogenes znf and mtmr are first time to associate with the cancer this research seeks to develop a new bio inspired algorithm to quickly search for specific ovarian_cancer biomarkers which is typically a laborious process and the resulting specificity and sensitivity is typically insufficient for the early detection of ovarian_cancer improving the survival_probability for ovarian_cancer patients requires the precise location of efficient tumor_markers as tumors transition from benign to invasive thus future work will focus on confirming the expressions of these genes using experimental methods such as real_time western_blotting and immunohistochemistry we believe that our discovery of new stage specific genes can allow for the development of a rapid_screening platform for oncogenes and thus improve early_diagnosis of various types of cancer
