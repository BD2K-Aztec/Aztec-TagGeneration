structural_bioinformatics preddimer a web_server for prediction of transmembrane helical dimers here we present preddimer a web_tool for prediction of dimer structure of transmembrane tm helices preddimer allows i reconstruction of a number of dimer structures for given sequence s of tm protein_fragments ii ranking and filtering of predicted structures according to respective_values of a scoring_function iii visual ization of predicted d dimer structures and iv visualization of surface_hydrophobicity of tm helices and their contacting interface regions represented as d maps results we implemented online the original preddimer algorithm and benchmarked the server on tm sequences whose d dimer conformations were obtained previously by nuclear_magnetic in the most of tested cases backbone root_mean deviations of closest predicted conformations from the experimental reference are below a a randomization test displays good anticorrelation between values of the scoring_function and statistical_significance of the prediction by chance going beyond a single dimer conformation our web_tool predicts an ensemble of possible conformations which may be useful for explanation of a functioning of bitopic membrane_proteins e g receptor_tyrosine availability_and preddimer can be accessed for free on the web attransmembrane tm domains of bitopic proteins comprise just a single helix for particular class of such proteins with high biological importancereceptor tyrosine_kinases rtks it has been shown that tm fragments play_a in dimerization and activation of these receptors by controlling orientation of their intracellular kinase domains the knowledge of spatial_structures of dimers of tm fragments of bitopic proteins is important for understanding the functioning of these molecules upon their oligomerization in the cell_membrane being reasonable alternative to experimental separate files or combined zip archive similar result page can be created for an existing dimer structure using analyzing mode mode of the server
