databases_and deriving the consequences of genomic_variants with the ensembl api and snp effect predictor a tool to predict the effect that newly_discovered genomic_variants have on known transcripts is indispensible in prioritizing and categorizing such variants in ensembl a web_based the snp effect predictor and api interface can now functionally annotate variants in all ensembl and ensembl genomes supported species availability the ensembl snp effect predictor can be accessed via the ensembl website at http www ensembl org the ensembl api http www ensembl org info docs api api installation html for installation_instructions is open_source contact as costs of resequencing and genotyping fall increasing amounts of variation data are being produced that cannot be annotated effectively without access to considerable computational_resources and genomic annotation databases often the most valuable information to know about a variant is the effect the observed alleles have on transcripts which may aid selection of variations for genotyping studies and in turn have a part to play in the discovery of new drug_targets and other biologically_significant loci deriving this information manually is laborious and error_prone impractical for large sets of data and impossible without access to suitable genomic annotation resources of critical interest is the existence of any novel variant positions within a dataset and what information is available for known variant loci although these answers are available through dbsnp the process of submitting the data to the ncbi to be processed and annotated can often take months and requires the data to be made public even before the developments reported in this article ensembl could also be used to derive similar annotation by setting up a full local ensembl_database containing the variant information and running scripts from the ensembl variation database production pipeline other tools available for the annotation of single_nucleotide snps in humans are comprehensively reviewed in karchin variation api exists to retrieve variation data such as snps insertions_and from ensembl databases entities such as variants are represented as objects created by adaptors that act as factories for generating specific objects example code demonstrating the use of the api to derive consequences for a list of variant positions is shown in supplementary documentation on the api is found at http www ensembl org info docs pdoc ensemblvariation index html given a variant position the api retrieves overlapping transcripts from the ensembl core database and determines where in the transcript structure the variant falls if the variant falls within an exon new codons for each variant allele are derived and compared to the reference codon the location of the variant relative to regulatory_regions is also assessed using the ensembl functional_genomics database where available the results including amino_acid changes and relative positions in the cdna and peptide_sequences are stored in the resulting transcript variation objects along with one or more named consequence types at present ensembl provides only a perl api but enabled by the open_source nature of the project python pycogent http pycogent sourceforge net examples query ensembl html pygr http code google com p pygr wiki pygronensembl apis have been created as yet these do not encompass the full scope of ensembl and hence do not include consequence prediction functionality the snp effect predictor tool can be used to quickly and accurately_predict the effects of variants on ensembl annotated transcripts up to variant loci can be uploaded in a file to http www ensembl org with the time taken to return results scaling linearly with the number of variants uploaded within a species calculation time will also vary by species depending on the number of transcripts a file containing variants in homo_sapiens takes s to return results an equivalent calculation in danio_rerio takes s users with more than variants may download a standalone script to run locally that produces identical results the script can be configured to connect to both the public ensembl_database as well as any combination of local and remote databases a wider_range of input file_formats is also supported including the commonly used pileup variant format the provision of a simple web_interface to powerful algorithms that transparently process large data_volumes is a valuable asset to users without computing expertise and also to those who need a quick and easy way to retrieve annotation for novel variants having this tool integrated with the extensive rich annotation available on the ensembl website will facilitate interpretation and analysis of the data direct use of the ensembl variation api enables users to incorporate consequence prediction into their variation software and pipelines providing predicted consequences for an unlimited number of variants by optimizing code and database access times it is possible to retrieve consequences for distinct variants in h sapiens in s for d rerio this takes s the flexibility of the ensembl api means that consequences can be predicted for any species with an ensembl gene_set or using any valid ensembl_database on users own systems using these features in coalition with others in the api enables the creation of advanced pipelines that can produce biologically_important information from high_throughput experimental_data such information is invaluable both as a screening system for variants and as an aid in the study of phenotypically linked variants
