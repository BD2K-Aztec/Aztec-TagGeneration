protein protein binding_affinity prediction on a diverse set of structures motivation accurate binding_free functions for protein_protein are imperative for a wide_range of purposes their construction is predicated upon ascertaining the factors that influence binding and their relative importance a recent benchmark of binding_affinities has allowed for the first time the evaluation and construction of binding_free models using a diverse set of complexes and a systematic_assessment of our ability to model the energetics of conformational changes results we construct a large set of molecular_descriptors using commonly available tools introducing the use of energetic factors associated with conformational changes and disorder to order transitions as well as features calculated on structural ensembles the descriptors are used to train and test a binding_free model using a consensus of four machine_learning whose performance constitutes a significant_improvement over the other state of the art empirical free energy_functions tested the internal workings of the learners show how the descriptors are used illuminating the determinants of proteinprotein binding availability the molecular descriptor set and descriptor values for all complexes are available in the supplementary_material a web_server for the learners and coordinates for the bound and unbound structures can be accessed from the website proteinprotein_interactions are involved in almost all biological_processes and the structural and thermodynamic characterization of protein_interaction is a major_goal of functional_genomics as progress is made in the structural annotation of interaction networks determining binding_free is recognized as an important step in the modelling of biological_systems the calculation of proteinprotein binding_affinities is also fundamental to many endeavours in structural_bioinformatics ranging from the discovery of peptide to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as therapeutics and docking to protein_engineering de_novo interface design and computational mutagenesis ben understanding the determinants of protein binding is thus a question of huge practical relevance and the construction of accurate and efficient binding_free functions of great_importance methods of calculating proteinprotein binding_free vary dramatically from one another in terms of physical plausibility accuracy and computational_cost at one end of the spectrum lies exact methods such as free_energy and thermodynamic integration and end_point methods such as mm pbsa and linear interaction analysis while in principle highly_accurate these methods use extensive molecular_dynamics or monte_carlo sampling and are usually only applicable where the bound and unbound states have significant_overlap thus they can only be applied to proteins for which conformational changes are minimal and are only practical on a case by case basis or for low_throughput studies empirical energy_functions are much faster and fall into three categories the first of these are statistical_potentials in which the relative positions of atoms or residues observed in experimental_structures are used to infer a potential of mean force second are thermodynamic equations in which the energy is calculated as a sum of terms arising from relevant phenomena the relative_contributions of the terms can be determined by linear_regression against known binding_affinities or by other other means third there are functions which implicitly estimate binding_free due to their being optimized for purposes such as docking estimating free_energy differences between mutants or identifying biological assemblies most previous binding_free models have been parametrized and or evaluated on a narrow range of proteins flexible proteins were either explicitly rejected or implicitly underrepresented due to datasets being derived from previous_works further the complexes comprised either exclusively of protease_inhibitor pairs or mostly protease_inhibitor interactions with a few others such as the insulinthe recent_publication of a large set of binding_free has allowed an unprecedented opportunity to construct and evaluate predictive energy models we have derived a large molecular descriptor set covering many aspects of protein binding including unbound to bound transitions desolvation effects and entropy changes this descriptor set was used to train and evaluate four binding_free models these models and their consensus can predict binding_energies with greater_accuracy than previous empirical functions even when the ensemble and conformational descriptors are omitted for the rigid proteins tested the consensus model can predict the affinities to within the accuracy expected from experimental and environmental uncertainties the internal working of the learners also allow the evaluation of feature importance this shows that the london dispersion energy vibrational entropy statistical_potentials and interface packing terms have the most predictive value and that hydrophobic burial and hydrogen_bonding are also important determinants of binding_affinity additionally retraining the models using descriptor subsets revealed that knowledge of unbound to bound conformational changes improves the performance of the consensus model and that the greatest improvement is attained when energies are averaged over conformational_ensembles this work also highlights the importance of using experimental_data validated by multiple experiments and provides a benchmark of high_quality affinities for a diverse range of complexes
