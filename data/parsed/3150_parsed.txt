structural_bioinformatics multilign an algorithm to predict secondary_structures conserved in multiple rna_sequences motivation with recent_advances in sequencing structural and functional studies of rna lag behind the discovery of sequences computational_analysis of rna is increasingly important to reveal structurefunction relationships with low_cost and speed the purpose of this study is to use multiple homologous_sequences to infer a conserved rna_structure results a new algorithm called multilign is presented to find the lowest free_energy rna_secondary common to multiple_sequences multilign is based on dynalign which is a program that simultaneously aligns and folds two sequences to find the lowest free_energy conserved_structure for multilign dynalign is used to progressively construct a conserved_structure from multiple pairwise calculations with one sequence used in all pairwise calculations a base_pair is predicted only if it is contained in the set of low free_energy structures predicted by all dynalign calculations in this way multilign improves prediction_accuracy by keeping the genuine base_pairs and excluding competing false base_pairs multilign has computational_complexity that scales linearly in the number of sequences multilign was tested on extensive datasets of sequences with known structure and its prediction_accuracy is among the best of available algorithms multilign can run on long_sequences nt and an arbitrarily large number of sequences availability the algorithm is implemented in ansi c and can be downloaded as part of the rnastructure package at rna_sequences have been discovered to play remarkably diverse roles such as catalysis gene_expression regulation and sequence recognition recent_studies show that there are a large number of rna_transcripts that do not encode_proteins the functional and structural roles of these rnas are of great to whom correspondence should be addressed interest with current_techniques however it is slow and expensive to experimentally determine structures for the majority of those rna thus structural and functional analysis of rna_molecules has lagged behind the rate of sequencing leaving a large_gap needing to be filled structure_prediction is an attractive tool for studying all the currently available sequences rna_secondary defined as the sum of canonical base_pairs a u g u and g c is commonly predicted and these predictions have been used to design structures discover functional rna_sequences in genomes study folding design sirna sequences and facilitate comparative_sequence the prediction of lowest free_energy structures with a dynamic_programming is a popular_approach for making such predictions in this approach a nearest_neighbor energy_model with a set of thermodynamic_parameters derived from optical melting experiments on small_rna models is used to evaluate possible structures and the dynamic_programming guarantees that the most stable structure will be found only or fewer known base_pairs are predicted by free_energy for sequences shorter than nt the prediction is worse for longer_sequences with average accuracies for small and large_subunit rrna when multiple homologous_sequences are available evolutionary_conservation can be used to improve rna_secondary prediction_accuracy rna_sequences often change during evolution but rna_structures are generally conserved in order to preserve function the set of structures that multiple different sequences can adopt is smaller than the number of structures each can adopt independently so determining the conserved_structure is more accurate a number of computational_approaches have been applied to this problem as previously reviewed some of the algorithms require a fixed initial alignment as input the drawback to this is that the initial alignment based on nucleotide matching may not reflect the correct alignment because of compensating changes in the sequence this imperfect alignment can seriously restrict prediction_accuracy introduced a dynamic_programming to find optimal consensus structures and sequence_alignment simultaneously without being constrained to apage multilign algorithm flowchart illustrating progressive calculations of s sequences the index sequence is used with each other sequence as input to dynalign the cycle is repeated for multiple iterations using the same index sequence for all iterations a structure is predicted for each sequence with the final iteration the computational_complexity for this algorithm is o n in memory and o isn in time for i iterations of calculation for average sequence_length of n multilign combines free_energy and comparative_sequence to predict rna_secondary of multiple_sequences with higher or comparable accuracy to dynalign it has among the best accuracy as compared with other algorithms that predict conserved structures for multiple_sequences
