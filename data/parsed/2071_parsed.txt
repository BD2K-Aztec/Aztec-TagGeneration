systems_biology global_network using multiscale spectral signatures motivation protein_interaction provide an important system level view of biological_processes one of the fundamental problems in biological network_analysis is the global_alignment of a pair of networks which puts the proteins of one network into correspondence with the proteins of another network in a manner that conserves their interactions while respecting other evidence of their homology by providing a mapping between the networks of different species alignments can be used to inform hypotheses about the functions of unannotated proteins the existence of unobserved interactions the evolutionary_divergence between the two species and the evolution of complexes and pathways results we introduce ghost a global pairwise network aligner that uses a novel spectral signature to measure topological_similarity between subnetworks it combines a seed and extend global_alignment phase with a local search_procedure and exceeds state of the art performance on several network_alignment tasks we show that the spectral signature used by ghost is highly discriminative whereas the alignments it produces are also robust to experimental_noise when compared with other recent_approaches we find that ghost is able to recover larger and more biologically_significant shared sub networks between species availability an efficient and parallelized implementation of ghost released under the apache license is available atwe present a novel method for the global pairwise_alignment of biological_networks such alignments are crucial in analyzing the increasing amount of experimental_data being generated by high_throughput techniques such as yeast_two tandem_affinity mass_spectrometry and chip_seq that reveal biological_interactions within the cell a solution to the global network_alignment is an injective mapping f from the nodes of one network g v g e g into another network h v h e h such that the structure of g is well preserved this global mapping allows us to measure the similarity between proteins in g and those in h in terms of shared interaction_patterns by exposing large subnetworks with shared interactions patterns across species a network_alignment allows us to transfer protein function_annotations from one organism to another using more information than can be captured by sequence alone for example it has been shown that across species the protein with the most similar sequence does not always play the same functional role and that topological information can be used to disambiguate sequence similar proteins and determine functional orthology additionally by looking at the magnitude of structure conserved between g and h we can measure the similarity between these networks and infer phylogenetic_relationships between the corresponding species we can also hypothesize the existence of unobserved interactions missing edges remove noise from error_prone high_throughput experiments and track the evolution of pathways our approach to the global network_alignment uses a novel measure of topological node similarity that is based on multiscale spectral signatures these signatures are composed from the spectra of the normalized laplacian for subgraphs of varying sizes centered around a node we combine this highly_specific yet robust node signature with a seed and extend alignment strategy that explicitly enforces the proximity of aligned neighborhoods the initial alignment is improved by means of a local search_procedure we implement these ideas in our network_alignment software ghost which exceeds state_ofthe accuracy under several different metrics of alignment_quality there has been significant interest in the network_alignment and previous work can naturally be divided_into three main categories approaches to local_network approaches to network_querying and approaches to global_network because we are introducing a system for global_network we restrict our discussion to the relevant work in this area introduced isorank which uses a recursively defined measure of topological_similarity between nodes in different networks they proposed an eigenvector based formulation to discover a high_scoring matching developed isorankn which extends isorank with a new algorithm for multiple network_alignment based on spectral clustering use a local_search heuristic which they call piswap to iteratively improve an initial alignment that is based solely on sequence_data the graemlin aligner was originally developed byto discover evolutionarily_conserved modules across multiple biological_networks later it was extended to perform global multiple network_alignment however this approach to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com relies on a variety of additional information about the networks being aligned including phylogenetic_information further sample alignments are required for the parameter learning_phase of graemlin recently multiple_attempts have been made to tackle the biological network_alignment using graph_matching klau introduced a non linear integer program to maximize a structural matching score between two given networks and then showed how the problem can be linearized yielding an integer_linear and finally suggested a lagrangian relaxation approach to the integer_linear later elextended this approach and improved the upper and lower bounds of the relaxation implementing their approach in the natalie software_package the hopemap approach of tian and samatova used an algorithm that iteratively merges conserved connected components explore the use of a number of graph_matching methods particularly the path and graduated assignment methods which attempt to find a permutation matrix between vertices of the networks being aligned that maximizes a score that is a combination of the structural_similarity and conserved interactions of the matched vertices this optimization is np_hard and they must rely on a relaxation to discover an approximate solution many similar graph_matching approaches have been applied to shape matching in computer graphics and computer vision all of these matching based_approaches require a large number of constraints to be placed on the set of potential alignments usually in the form of homology_information between the proteins of the networks being aligned to run in a reasonable amount of time these constraints vastly reduce_the and help bring these computationally burdensome methods into the realm of tractability however the hard constraints introduced by the homology_information can have a negative effect on the ability of these methods to discover truly novel functional homologs between highly divergent_species in a way these methods focus more on discovering conserved patterns of interactions between proteins that are already posited to be homologous rather than on performing a truly de_novo and unconstrained alignment of biological_networks that is merely guided by homology_information ghost takes a hybrid_approach where the initial alignment can be constrained by some aspect of the scoring_function but the local search_procedure allows exploration into regions of the alignment space that do not adhere to the original constraints the graal family of programs like isorank performs unconstrained and global pairwise_alignments of biological_networks originally introduced graal which measures the topological_similarity of nodes in different networks based on the distance between their graphlet_degree signatures and aligns the networks using a seed and extend strategy milenkovicetmilenkovicet al then introduced h graal which relies on the same graphlet_degree signatures used by graal but performs the alignment of the networks by solving the linear assignment problem via the hungarian algorithm finally introduced mi_graal which combines these two alignment strategies it relies on a seed and extend alignment procedure but uses the hungarian algorithm only to compute the assignment between local neighborhoods of the two graphs that maximizes the sum of their linear scoring_function mi_graal also incorporates a number of other topological metrics in addition to the graphlet_degree signatures to help quantify the topological_similarity between nodes our network aligner ghost combines a novel spectral signature to measure topological_similarity with a seed and extend alignment procedure and an iterative local_search step in sections and we show that ghost performs much better than current aligners at the network self alignment task in section we compare an ensemble of alignments produced by different aligners as we vary their parameter_settings to trade_off between the topological and biological quality of the alignments they produce ghost consistently outperforms the other aligners in these tests and is able to produce alignments higher overall quality this improved quality will be useful for more accurate comparative systems_biology we have introduced ghost a novel framework for the global_alignment of biological_networks at the heart of ghost is a new spectral multiscale node signature that we combine with a seed and extend approach and a local search_procedure to perform global_network the spectral signature is highly discriminative and robust to small topological variations we verify this robustness in section showing that ghost outstrips the competition in aligning the s cerevisiae protein_interaction to noisier variants of itself in these experiments as well as the self alignment of the m loti network the accuracy of ghost is significantly_higher than that of either isorank or mi_graal these experiments are of particular interest as the ground_truth is known and the ability of different aligners to uncover shared topological_structure can be accurately measured we find that the alignments produced by ghost consistently dominate those produced by the other aligners when producing an alignment of approximately the same biological quality ghost yields alignments with substantially_higher topological quality than either isorank or natalie furthermore at a similar level of topological quality ghost produces alignments that have far more biological_relevance than those produced by mi_graal finally ghost consistently produces alignments that exhibit a more competitive trade_off between topological and biological quality than the other aligners we considered see
