cluepedia cytoscape_plugin pathway insights using integrated experimental and in silico data the cluepedia cytoscape_plugin is a search tool for new markers potentially associated to pathways cluepedia calculates linear_and statistical_dependencies from experimental_data genes proteins and mirnas can be connected based on in silico and or experimental information and integrated into a cluego network of terms pathways interrelations within each pathway can be investigated and new potential associations may be revealed through gene protein mirna enrichments a pathway like visualization can be created using the cerebral plugin layout combining all these features is essential for data interpretation and the generation of new hypotheses the cluepedia cytoscape_plugin is user_friendly and has an expressive and intuitive visualization availability http www ici upmc fr cluepedia and via the cytoscape_plugin manager the user_manual is available at the cluepediaintegrating heterogeneous expression data and functional network information is essential for understanding cellular_processes and their dynamics within the versatile framework of cytoscape tools for ontology analysis and gene function predictions were developed cluepedia provides a comprehensive view on a pathway or process by investigating experimental and in silico data from different perspectives gene interrelations mirnas regulatory aspects proteinprotein_interactions as well as the functional context in conjunction with cluego
