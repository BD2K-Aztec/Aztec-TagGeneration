distancescan a tool for promoter modeling the state of the art in promoter modeling for higher_eukaryotes is predicting not single transcription_factor tfbss but their combinations the new tool utilizes a previously_developed of distance distributions of tfbs pairs we model the random_distribution of distances and compare it with the distribution observed in the query_sequences comparison of the profiles allows filtering out the noise and retaining the potentially functional combinations this approach has proved its usefulness as a filtering technique for the selection of tfbs pairs for promoter modeling and is now implemented as a tool in r as an input it can use the outputs of three different tfbs and motif predictive tools gibbs_sampler for motifs match tm and meme fimo for pwm based search the output is a list of predicted pairs on overrepresented distances with assigned scores p values and plots showing the distribution of pairs in the input_sequences availability the tool is available at https www omnifung hki jena de rpad distance scan index htm contacta promoter model is a combination of sequence_elements modulating transcription and characterizing promoters of a certain gene or group of genes it is widely_accepted that in higher_eukaryotes transcription_factors tfs tend to cooperate and act in most cases in a synergistic manner and that it is this cooperation that confers the required specificity of transcriptional_regulation therefore co regulation of genes entails the existence of a characteristic combination of transcription_factor tfbss in their promoters such combination can be characterized not only by the set of tfbs but also by the distances between the constituents the distance between the binding_sites should allow the cooperating factors to physically interact we suppose that the false_positive of the tfbs are distributed randomly whereas the distances in the functional tfbs combinations are non random the principle possibility to use distances as a distinguishing_feature was proven in the investigation of the behavior of real experimentally_characterized tfbs pairs that have been shown to whom correspondence should be addressed to bind cooperating tfs such composite elements ces are combinations of two or more tfbss which provide synergistic_action of the tfs qualitatively different from a purely additive effect the most comprehensive collection of composite elements can be found in the transcompel database we could show that each real ce can be characterized by a preferred distance or set of distances we have also shown that the approach of distance distributions can correctly identify the distance in real ces
