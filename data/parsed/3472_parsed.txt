pboost a gpu based tool for parallel permutation_tests in genome_wide downloaded from motivation the importance of testing associations allowing for interactions has been demonstrated by marchini et_al a fast method detecting associations allowing for interactions has been proposed by wan et_al a the method is based on likelihood_ratio with the assumption that the statistic follows the v distribution many single_nucleotide snp_pairs with significant associations allowing for interactions have been detected using their method however the assumption of v test requires the expected_values in each cell of the contingency_table to be at least five this assumption is violated in some identified snp_pairs in this case likelihood_ratio may not be applicable any more permutation_test is an ideal approach to checking the p values_calculated in likelihood_ratio because of its non parametric nature the p values of snp_pairs having significant associations with disease are always extremely_small thus we need a huge number of permutations to achieve correspondingly high_resolution for the p values in order to investigate whether the p values from likelihood_ratio are reliable a fast permutation tool to accomplish large number of permutations is desirable results we developed a permutation tool named pboost it is based on gpu with highly_reliable p value estimation by using simulation_data we found that the p values from likelihood_ratio will have relative_error of when cells in the contingency_table have expected count less than five or when there is zero expected count in any of the contingency_table cells in terms of speed pboost completed permutations for a single snp pair from the wellcome_trust wtccc genome data wellcome_trust within min on a single nvidia tesla m device while it took min in a single_cpu intel_xeon e to finish the same task more importantly when simultaneously testing snp_pairs for permutations our tool took only min while the cpu program took h by permuting on a gpu cluster consisting of nodes we completed permutations for all snp_pairs reported with p values smaller than in the wtccc datasets in week availability_and the source_code and sample data are available at http bioinforin genome_wide gwas single_nucleotide snp_pairs have significant associations with diseases via the combination of their main effects and interactions this effect is referred to as associations allowing for interactions proposed an efficient likelihood_ratio method and reported snp_pairs having significant associations allowing for interactions this method is based on v test and requires adequate expected count in each cell of the contingency_table otherwise the statistic may not follow the v distribution and the likelihood_ratio is not applicable cochran suggested a rule of thumb that at least cells should have expected counts larger than or equal to five there are also discussions claiming that there should be no cell with zero expected count in gwas it is common to see snp_pairs whose contingency_tables violate this rule thus we like to examine the likelihood_ratio results with the permutation_test method in a permutation_test the p value is calculated as n n where n is the number of permutations with statistics at least as extreme as the one of the original data and n is the total number of permutations the resolution of the p value is n clearly a large number of permutations are required to estimate a very small p value in gwas we always need the p value to be extremely_small due to the multiple testing issue in the wtccc datasets around snps remain after initial quality check the total number of snp_pairs reaches the p value needs to be smaller than to denote significance when multiple_testing such as bonferroni_correction is applied the development of graphics_processing gpus enables fast implementation of permutation here we implemented a gpubased permutation_test tool using this tool we investigated the eligibility condition of the likelihood_ratio we also examined snp_pairs with associations allowing for interactions reported by likelihood_ratio pboost makes it possible to test associations allowing for interactions using permutation the empirical rule requiring that no cells having expected count less than five is conservative it can be relaxed to that cells having expected count less than five and no cell having zero expected count in this article we only focused on the identified snp_pairs in fact there are a lot more non significant snp_pairs in type i diabetes dataset which also violate the above rule some of them might be significant testing these snp_pairs remains an open challenge
