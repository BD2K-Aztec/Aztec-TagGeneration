structural_bioinformatics data safe havens in health research and healthcare motivation the data that put the evidence into evidence_based are central to developments in public_health primary and hospital_care a fundamental challenge is to site such data in repositories that can easily be accessed under appropriate technical and governance controls which are effectively audited and are viewed as trustworthy by diverse stakeholders this demands socio technical solutions that may easily become enmeshed in protracted debate and controversy as they encounter the norms values expectations and concerns of diverse stakeholders in this context the development of what are called data safe havens has been crucial unfortunately the origins and evolution of the term have led to a range of different definitions being assumed by different groups there is however an intuitively meaningful interpretation that is often assumed by those who have not previously encountered the term a repository in which useful but potentially sensitive data may be kept securely under governance and informatics systems that are fit for purpose and appropriately tailored to the nature of the data being maintained and may be accessed and utilized by legitimate users undertaking work and research contributing to biomedicine health and or to ongoing_development of healthcare_systems
