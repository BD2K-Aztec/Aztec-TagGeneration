new directions for diffusion based network prediction of protein_function incorporating pathways with confidence motivation it has long been hypothesized that incorporating models of network noise as well as edge directions and known pathway_information into the representation of proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks might improve their utility for functional inference however a simple way to do this has not been obvious we find that diffusion state distance dsd our recent diffusion based metric for measuring dissimilarity in ppi_networks has natural extensions that incorporate confidence directions and can even express coherent pathways by calculating dsd on an augmented graph results we define three incremental versions of dsd which we term cdsd cadsd and capdsd where the capdsd matrix incorporates confidence known directed edges and pathways into the measure of how similar each pair of nodes is according to the structure of the ppi_network we test four popular function prediction_methods majority vote weighted majority vote multi way cut and functional flow using these different matrices on the bakers yeast ppi_network in cross_validation the best performing method is weighted majority vote using capdsd we then test the performance of our augmented dsd methods on an integrated heterogeneous set of protein association edges from the string database the superior_performance of capdsd in this context confirms that treating the pathways as prob abilistic units is more powerful than simply incorporating pathway edges independently into the network availability all source_code for calculating the confidences for extracting pathway_information from kegg xml files and for calculating the cdsd cadsd and capdsd matrices are available from http dsd one of the most well studied problems in computational network biology is the prediction of protein functional labels from distance and neighborhood structure in the proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network in based on the observation that paths through high degree hub nodes in the ppi_network were less informative than short paths through protein nodes with fewer interaction_partners introduce the diffusion state distance dsd metric that is able to quantify topological_similarity in a ppi_network in a more fine_grained way diffusion based_methods had been previously_proposed for clustering similar proteins and for ranking candidate_disease but by explicitly taking an l norm of the vector of the random_walks to all other nodes in the network to measure the distance between nodes dsd is able to capture a more global view of the network than other prior work we are aware of with the exception of vavien for candidate disease gene ranking and isorank n which also is based on a global embedding but for a very different problem network_alignment showed that when a dsd based distance is substituted for ordinary next hop shortest_path distance in four classical network based function prediction_methods functional label prediction_performance for the go gene_ontology as well as all three levels of the mips munich information center for protein_sequences ontology improved across the board in cross_validation experiments on both the saccharomyces_cerevisiae and the s pombe ppi_networks however these results were based only on a simple undirected model of the ppi_network which additionally assumed that all the edges listed in the biogrid data were uniformly correct on the other hand it is well established both that there is noise in the ppi interaction_network data and that some interactions are naturally directed in the ppi_network in addition looking just at pairwise interaction data as edges does not fully capture all the information that is known about the ppi_network in particular there is increasingly available data on biological_pathways for example tgf binds tgf receptor which phosphorylates smad which with importin enters the nucleus and binds dna to regulate expression in this article we revisit the dsd metric we designed in earlier work for function prediction in the ordinary undirected ppi_network we find that its diffusion based framework gives a natural way to incorporate edge confidences and directed edges when known however the main contribution of this article is to show that there is a way to capture the cohesiveness of known pathways by calculating dsd on an augmented network and that this way of representing pathways results in better performance than just incorporating the pathway edges themselves for most but not all of the function prediction_methods we study we show this first in cross_validation on the standard network consisting of just experimentally_verified physical_interaction edges from s cerevisiae and then on an integrative network with heterogeneous protein association data edges derived from the string database to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

original_work for commercial re use please_contact permissions_oup comincorporating confidence and pathways into our diffusion based distance_metric dsd we studied whether it was best to incorporate pathway_information as edges or as controlled access highways in an augmented graph we showed that the augmented graph improved the best function prediction method we tested weighted majority vote especially in our experiments on the string database where there were additional edges whose correlation with function was weaker the performance of other methods was not as clearly served by the augmented pathways capdsd improved functional flow in the noisier string setting but not on biogrid the performance of multi way cut degraded across the board we hypothesize that the methods that will improve using capdsd versus just cadsd are those that use only some sort of information about the local neighborhood of a node to predict its function here making pathways closer with highways is helpful whereas the amount of distortion in augmenting the graph causes too much noise for more global methods such as multi way cut functional flow has both local and global aspects so its mixed performance would be consistent with this theory finally the best modern function prediction_methods are all integrative methods and may do something more sophisticated than adding in data from other high_throughput data_sources as edges with different confidences thus the next step would be to integrate our results into a hybrid method along these lines we note that all code for calculating the confidences for extracting pathway_information from kegg xml files and for calculating the cdsd cadsd and capdsd matrices is available from http dsd cs tufts edu capdsd
