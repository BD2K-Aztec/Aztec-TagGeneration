databases_and waprna a web_based application for the processing of rna_sequences mrna mirna seq technology is becoming the leading technology to globally profile gene_expression and elucidate the transcriptional_regulation mechanisms in living_cells although there are many tools available for analyzing rna_seq few of them are available as easy accessible online web_tools for processing both mrna and mirna data for the rna_seq based user community as such we have developed a comprehensive web_application tool for processing mrna seq and mirna seq data our web_tool waprna includes four different modules mrna seq and mirna seq sequenced from solid or solexa platform and all the modules were tested on previously_published experimental_data we accept raw_sequence with an optional reads filter followed by mapping and gene_annotation or mirna prediction waprna also integrates downstream functional_analyses such as gene_ontology kegg_pathway mirna_targets prediction and comparison of genes or mirnas different expression in different samples moreover we provide the executable packages for installation on users local server availability waprna is freely_available for use at http waprna big ac cn the executable packages and the instruction for installation can be downloaded from our web_site contact rna_seq is a recently_developed revolutionary approach for transcriptome_profiling and mirna analysis using next_generation it can allow us to study rna in further depth and more accurate measurement studies using this method have already altered our view of transcriptome and mirna recently a lot of methods have been developed to process the different aspects of rna_seq such as short_reads mapping gene_annotation and differential geneexpression analysis meanwhile several web_services for rna and microrna analysis have also been developed such as rquant web magia
