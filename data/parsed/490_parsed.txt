genetics_and asafe ancestry specific allele frequency_estimation in a genome_wide gwas of an admixed population such as hispanic americans ancestry specific allele_frequencies can inform the design of a replication gwas we derive an em_algorithm to estimate ancestry specific allele_frequencies for a bi_allelic marker given genotypes and local ancestries on a way admixed population when the phase of each admixed individuals genotype relative to the pair of local ancestries is unknown we call our algorithm ancestry specific allele frequency_estimation asafe we demonstrate that asafe has low error on simulated_data genome_wide gwass in humans have focused on populations of european origin hispanic americans however have descended from ancestral africans europeans and native_americans hispanics exemplify an admixed population one that has descended from multiple ancestral_populations after discovering that an allele is significantly associated with a trait in a gwas of admixed individuals it would be useful to know the alleles ancestry specific frequencies for a sample of hispanic individuals an ancestry specific allele_frequency would be the frequency of the allele amongst the chromosomes in the sample that have a particular ancestral origin either african european or native_american at the marker such frequencies provide information about which populations the discovered association might also be present in thereby informing the choice of study population for replication to obtain estimates of ancestry specific allele_frequencies one might find the allele_frequency in each reference_panel however this approach is impossible for a marker that is present in the admixed sample but absent from a reference_panel this situation arises when the reference_panels are genotyped on a snp_array and when the admixed individuals have sequence_data even for a marker that is typed in the reference_panels this approach suffers when the reference_panels do not exactly match the ancestral_populations for example none of the populations in the genomes_project the genomes_project consortium are nonadmixed native_american the admixture and structure programs can use admixed genotypes to estimate ancestry specific allele_frequencies but require genotypes from reference individuals of known ancestry in order to identify the frequencies with particular ancestries furthermore admixture assumes linkage equilibrium amongst markers and structures linkage model assumes linkage equilibrium amongst markers descended from the same ancestral population in contrast we utilize estimates of local_ancestry such as those from the rfmix program estimates of local_ancestry from such programs utilize haplotype_frequencies and thus make use of linkage_disequilibrium at markers genotyped in all the reference_panels one can directly obtain ancestry specific allele_frequencies from the phased genotypes and corresponding phased local_ancestry estimates however atmarkers not genotyped in a reference_panel the phasing of the local ancestries relative to the genotypes is unknown and further methodology is needed to obtain ancestry specific allele_frequency estimates here we derive an em_algorithm asafe to estimate ancestryspecific allele_frequencies at a bi_allelic marker in a three way admixed diploid population given admixed local ancestries and genotypes at the marker with each admixed individuals genotype allele order relative to ancestry order unknown the major advantage of asafe over alternative ancestry specific allele frequency_estimation approaches is that asafe is applicable to markers in the admixed sample that are absent from a reference_panel furthermore asafe takes_advantage of linkage_disequilibrium based information by using local_ancestry calls describe a somewhat similar algorithm to asafe but only for two way admixture and in the slightly different setting of estimating the ancestral allele_frequency in several closely_related ancestral_populations such as the native_american ancestors of columbians puerto_ricans and mexicans they do not provide a publicly_available implementation of their method we provide a publicly_available implementation of our algorithm and a description of its performance on simulated hispanic data our algorithm applies to any diploid admixed population descended from three ancestral_populations so our method is not restricted to human populations as more gwass are performed in admixed_populations such as hispanics it is becoming increasingly important to estimate ancestry specific allele_frequencies for bi_allelic markers we derived an em_algorithm to estimate ancestry specific allele_frequencies given data on a way admixed population and provide a publicly_available implementation of the algorithm
