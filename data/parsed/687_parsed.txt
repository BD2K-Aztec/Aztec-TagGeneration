gene_expression bayesian prediction of tissue regulated splicing using rna_sequence and cellular_context motivation alternative_splicing is a major contributor to cellular diversity in mammalian_tissues and relates to many human_diseases an important goal in understanding this phenomenon is to infer a splicing code that predicts how splicing is regulated in different cell_types by features derived from rna dna and epigenetic modifiers methods we formulate the assembly of a splicing code as a problem of statistical_inference and introduce a bayesian_method that uses an adaptively selected number of hidden_variables to combine subgroups of features into a network allows different tissues to share feature subgroups and uses a gibbs_sampler to hedge predictions and ascertain the statistical_significance of identified features results using data for cassette exons rna features and tissue_types derived from mouse_tissues http genes toronto edu wasp we benchmarked several methods our method outperforms all others and achieves relative improvements of in splicing code quality and up to in classification error compared with the state of the art novel combinations of regulatory_features and novel combinations of tissues that share feature subgroups were identified using our method alternative_splicing enables individual genes to generate different transcripts by selectively including or excluding rna_sequences high_throughput shows that over of human genes are alternatively_spliced mostly in a tissue dependent_manner the importance of alternative_splicing is evidenced by numerous examples of genes whose functions are switched depending on which alternative transcript_isoform is expressed plus analyses showing that a large fraction of human disease mutations affect splice site_selection these results underscore the importance of accounting for splicing regulation when modeling gene_expression for over two decades researchers have sought to define splicing regulatory models in the form of a mapping from genomic_features to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as a comparison of methods for predicting tissue regulated splicing in mouse using the metric of code quality measured in bits see main text and cellular conditions to predicted abundances of alternative transcripts in the words of an important long_term goal in the community is to determine a splicing code a set of rules that can predict the splicing pattern of any primary transcript_sequence recently we described the assembly of a mouse splicing code that can be used to predict the regulatory_properties of previously_uncharacterized exons predict regions in the unspliced transcript that when mutated led to changes in splicing patterns and reveal novel regulatory_mechanisms our purpose here is to i describe a dataset and evaluation method that researchers can use to improve and extend splicing codes ii introduce a bayesian technique that uses hidden_variables to model relationships between features and splicing changes within a network and iii benchmark several machine_learning compares our bayesian technique to several other methods in terms of code quality which is the amount of genomewide splicing variability accounted for by rna sequence_features see below the result labeled tissue only indicates how much splicing variability is accounted for by tissue type i e that different tissues have different overall levels of splicing most of the methods
