loctree predicts localization for all domains of life motivation subcellular_localization is one aspect of protein_function despite advances in high_throughput imaging localization maps remain incomplete several methods accurately_predict localization but many challenges remain to be tackled results in this study we introduced a framework to predict localization in lifes three domains including globular and membrane_proteins classes for archaea for bacteria and for eukaryota the resulting method loctree works well even for protein_fragments it uses a hierarchical system of support_vector that imitates the cascading mechanism of cellular sorting the method reaches high levels of sustained performance eukaryota q bacteria q loctree also accurately distinguishes membrane and non membrane_proteins in our hands it compared favorably with top methods when tested on new data availability online through predictprotein predictprotein org as standalone version at http www rostlab org services loctree the method introduced here loctree predicts protein subcellular_localization through a consistent new framework that ignores many of the relevant_features needed for the success of previous methods such as no predicted aspects of protein_structure and function nevertheless it seemed to reach high levels of sustained performance aside from adding new aspects among the novel aspects was the large number of localization classes predicted for eukaryota for bacteria and for archaea loctree outperformed other methods on almost all data_sets tested implicating an improved ability to capture localization signals in the protein_sequence one example for the success in plucking implicit information is the high_precision in the distinction between membrane and globular watersoluble proteins our implicit distinction appeared as good as that of the best expert method for predicting integral_membrane helices another important novelty is the robustness of the method against sequencing_errors and its success when applied to protein_fragments this is particularly important in light of high_throughput of analyzing ancient_dna with short_reads and of the fact that almost of all proteins have multiple domains this power along with the overall improvement in performance may recommend this new tool as an ideal starting_point for comparing the proteomes between organisms and for using localization predictions to aid the prediction of protein_function we imagine that the framework for the method will prove extendable and that future methods will become better simply by using more experimental_data and more sequences
