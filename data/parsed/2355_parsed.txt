bioimage_informatics imglib generic image_processing in java imglib is an open_source java_library for n dimensional data representation and manipulation with focus on image_processing it aims at minimizing code duplication by cleanly separating pixel algebra data access and data representation in memory algorithms can be implemented for classes of pixel types and generic access patterns by which they become independent of the specific dimen sionality pixel type and data representation imglib illustrates that an elegant high_level programming interface can be achieved without sacrificing performance it provides efficient implementations of common data types storage layouts and algorithms it is the data model underlying imagej the knime image_processing toolbox and an increasing number of fiji plugins availability imglib is licensed under bsd documentation and source_code are available at http imglib net and in a public repository at https github com imagej imglib many algorithmic concepts from computer vision and image_processing are applicable to the analysis of biological image data however re using existing code is often difficult because it is implemented for a specific data type limited image size or fixed number of dimensions e g small d grayscale images biological imaging_techniques generate images of varying dimensionality and a multitude of sample_types e g wavelength frequency_spectra diffusion tensors with varying precision improvements in imaging speed and resolution result in gigantic datasets that require well designed strategies for data_handling e g tiled or compressed storage streaming access writing code that is re usable across many combinations of dimensionality sample type and storage strategy is challenging and requires an appropriate abstraction layer we present imglib an open_source image_processing framework that achieves code re usability through a generic interface architecture that abstracts from dimensionality sample type and storage strategy it is highly extensible providing developers with great flexibility in adding new sample_types and image representations that will seamlessly work with existing algorithms and vice_versa imglib shares basic_concepts with the c frameworks itk and vigra kothekothe for n dimensional generic image_processing it is the first framework that introduces generic programming to the java image_processing community we chose java for its simplicity and wide acceptance among biological researchers due to the popular image_processing toolbox imagej imglib is an open_source image_processing framework that increases code re usability by promoting generic implementations it provides an abstraction layer that focuses on flexible and efficient image storage and access the core paradigm is a clean separation of pixel algebra how sample values are manipulated data access how sample coordinates are traversed and data representation how the samples are stored laid out in memory or paged to disc imglib relies on virtual access to both sample values and coordinates facilitating parallelizability and extensibility imglib aims to connect software projects through an interface design that is easily adapted to existing data_structures imglib is the first image_processing library available for java that combines a flexible high_level programming interface with optimal_performance it enables developers of bioimage analysis software to focus on the design of complex algorithms instead of data management conversely software engineers can develop efficient infrastructure without interfering with algorithm design this becomes particularly interesting in the emerging field of bioimage_informatics that is coping with the enormous amount of n dimensional image data generated by recent_developments in microscopy consequently imglib is already being used by several high profile projects of the java bioimaging community it is easily integrated into other projects providing an ideal basis for sharing interoperable generic algorithms
