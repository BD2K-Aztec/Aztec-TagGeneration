systems_biology surreyfba a command_line and graphics user_interface for constraint_based of genome_scale reaction_networks constraint_based of genome_scale has been successfully used in numerous applications such as prediction of gene_essentiality and metabolic_engineering we present surreyfba which provides constraint based simulations and network map visualization in a free stand alone software in addition to basic simulation protocols the tool also implements the analysis of minimal substrate and product sets which is useful for metabolic_engineering and prediction of nutritional_requirements in complex in vivo environments but not available in other commonly used programs the surreyfba is based on a command_line to the glpk solver distributed as binary and source_code for the three major operating_systems the command_line implemented in c is easily executed within scripting languages used in the bioinformatics community and provides efficient implementation of tasks requiring iterative calls to the linear_programming solver surreyfba includes jymet a graphics user_interface allowing spreadsheet based model presentation visualization of numerical_results on metabolic_networks represented in the petri_net convention as well as in charts and plots an understanding of how cellular_phenotypes emerge from interactions between molecular parts encoded in the genome requires computer simulation of genome_scale molecular_interaction due to the scarcity of quantitative information these simulations have been limited to the special_case of metabolic_networks operating under quasi_steady which is modeled by a set of linear relationships between reaction fluxes the model is explored by employing linear_programming optimization where the optimal flux toward any reaction or substance in the model can be determined this approach is referred to as constraint based because it evaluates metabolic_capabilities under the set of constraints representing stoichiometry maximal capacity and reversibility of the reactions this information can be obtained for a particular repertoire of enzymatic_activities predicted from to whom correspondence should be addressed the genome which has permitted reconstruction of genome_scale reaction_networks gsmns for major model_organisms pathogens industrial microorganisms and humans the review of the numerous applications of gsmns is beyond the scope of this article the software presented here stemmed from our work on metabolic_engineering and prediction of gene_essentiality in pathogens constraint based simulations are implemented in the cobra toolbox running under the matlab environment the simpheny software www genomatica com is a commercial solution with a database backend providing visualization of numerical_results on pathway maps visualization is also available in the fba simviz and metafluxnet programs although none of them implements iterative simulations such as flux variability analysis fva or reaction essentiality scans here we present surreyfba a gnu gpl software for constraintbased simulations of metabolic reaction_networks in addition to the standard methods available in existing_tools it implements analysis of minimal substrate and product sets the command_line is available as a binary and source_code for linux windows and macos systems and can be used without dependencies on mathematical_modeling environments it can be easily run using common scripting languages which makes it particularly suitable for the integration with bioinformatics analysis_pipelines we have already implemented jymet a jython graphics user_interface which provides visualization of networks and numerical_results integrated into network diagrams
