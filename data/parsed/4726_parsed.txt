gene_expression translating bioinformatics in oncology guilt by profiling analysis and identification of kif b and cdca as novel driver_genes in carcinogenesis motivation co regulated_genes are not identified in traditional micro array analyses but may theoretically be closely functionally linked guilt by association gba guilt by profiling thus bioinformatics procedures for guilt by profiling association analysis have yet to be applied to large_scale cancer_biology we analyzed full cancer transcriptomes from diverse cancer entities in regard of their similarity of gene_expression using pearsons_correlation cc subsequently highly co regulated_genes jccj were clustered unsupervised to obtain small co regulated networks a major subnetwork containing closely co regulated_genes showed highly significant_enrichment of cancer bio functions all genes except kinesin family_member b kif b and cell_division associated cdca were of confirmed relevance for tumor_biology therefore we independently_analyzed their differential regulation in multiple_tumors and found severe deregulation in liver breast lung ovarian and kidney cancers thus proving our gba hypothesis overexpression of kif b and cdca in hepatoma_cells and subsequent microarray_analysis revealed significant deregulation of central cell_cycle consistently rt_pcr and proliferation assay confirmed the role of both genes in cell_cycle finally the prognostic_significance of the identified kif b and cdca dependent predictors p p was demonstrated in three independent hcc cohorts and several other tumors in summary we proved the efficacy of large_scale guilt by profiling association strategies in oncology we identified two novel oncogenes and functionally characterized them the strong prognostic_importance of downstream predictors for hcc and many other tumors indicates the clinical_relevance of our findings cancer is one of the leading causes of death despite evident improvements in diagnostic_procedures and the development of novel and effective therapies the prognosis of disease remains dismal for many patients a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of cancer development is critical to improve therapeutic_options for a variety of cancers however the identification of genes causally associated with complex_diseases such as cancer remains_challenging and therefore constitutes a major barrier in advancing our limited mechanistic_understanding of the disease simultaneously increasing awareness of the fact that highthroughput gene_expression analysis may reveal valuable insights into cancer_biology led to the establishment of a variety of cancer microarray_datasets and large microarray_dataset repositories however once published these datasets are most often neglected as regards to further analysis in fact meta_analyses of this vast body of data are rarely attempted the reasons are manifold ranging from the difficulty of integrating various technical platforms to the absence of bioinformatics knowledge on the part of primarily molecular oriented scientists and the need for advanced statistics finally these datasets could be subject to alternative analysis strategies to obtain additional information not yielded by standard analysis protocols the concept of transferring gene function_annotation from one gene to another based on the profile of their characteristics guilt by profiling guilt by association gba has been frequently described new biological_relationships have been successfully identified in gba studies including correlated gene_expression correlated phylogenetic profiles and membership within gene_expression clusters to whom correspondence should be addressed y the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as some guilt by profiling studies have exploited genegene relationships by transforming them into gene functional characteristics this occurs when integrating gene_expression or functional_annotations of the respective genes despite such proven success no attempts have been made to include samples from multiple tumor_entities or samples of both types of inference the benefits of such a large_scale gba approach are obvious because genes closely regulated across samples and various tumor_entities may be active in a highly_robust carcinogenic network we therefore hypothesized that integrating_multiple sources of biological_information such as expression_profiling and functional_annotation over thousands of tumor_samples and entities may provide novel insights into key regulatory changes in cancer development and help to identify highly causative_genes using this approach and proving its feasibility we validated the use of bioinformatics gba strategies in large_scale molecular oncology identified two novel oncogenes demonstrated their deregulation in several tumors functionally characterized the novel oncogenes identified corresponding downstream_targets and showed the prognostic_relevance of downstream predictors for hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc as well as many other tumors
