genome_analysis b g far a species centered go annotation repository motivation functional_genomics research has expanded enormously in the last decade thanks to the cost reduction in high_throughput and the development of computational_tools that generate standardize and share_information on gene and protein_function such as the gene_ontology go nevertheless many biologists especially working with non model_organisms still suffer from non existing or low coverage functional_annotation or simply struggle retrieving summarizing and querying these data results the blast go functional_annotation repository b g far is a bioinformatics resource envisaged to provide functional information for otherwise uncharacterized sequence_data and offers data_mining tools to analyze a larger repertoire of species than currently available this new annotation resource has been created by applying the blast go functional_annotation engine in a strongly high_throughput manner to the entire space of public available sequences the resulting repository contains go term predictions for over million non redundant protein_sequences based on blast_search alignments from the simap database we generated go annotation for approximately different taxa making available species with the highest coverage through b g far a second section within b g far holds functional_annotations for non model_organism affymetrix genechips conclusions b g far provides easy access to exhaustive functional_annotation for species offering a good balance between quality and quantity thereby supporting functional_genomics research especially in the case of non model_organisms availability the annotation resource is available at http www b gfar org functional_genomics research has gained importance in the last decade thanks to the fast improvement and cost reduction in to whom correspondence should be addressed high_throughput beyond traditional model species also non model_organisms are in the genomics race and today it is hard to find a biological domain without a functional_genomics initiative this expansion would not have been that successful without the accompanying development of computational_tools that generate standardize and share_information on gene and protein_function the gene_ontology go project is one such standard go is a collaborative_effort aiming at the establishment of a controlled_vocabulary that provides biologically_meaningful annotations for gene_products across species there are two main aspects of this project a the definition of a comprehensive ontology of functional terms and b the generation of an annotation database containing the assignment of go terms to genes and proteins annotation for each organism in the go database is supplied and maintained by the respective consortium member evidence codes ecs are added to each individual annotation to reflect the information_source used in a go term assignment ecs indicate if the annotation is supported by some and which experimental_evidence whether it was transferred and how from related genes or if it was generated by other prediction_methods the large majority of go annotations is centralized in the gene_ontology goa database this resource contains highquality functional_annotations for proteins mostly obtained from the uniprot knowledgebase however the great majority of go corresponds to automatically transferred annotations based on interproscan results currently only a small number of assignments have experimental_evidence or are revised by expert curators while the go project is improving the ontology definition and quality of the goa database it is still far from providing extensive functional_annotation for the wealth of sequence_data that populate public_databases however thanks to the structured and universal nature of go large_scale annotation using an automated process is conceivable and could be feasible given that adequate computational_resources are available such an annotation effort complement current established annotation initiatives by generating preliminary functional labels for sequences not yet covered by any of the reference projects of the go consortium examples of functional data intensive resources in the field of functional_genomics such as the integr and pedant page
