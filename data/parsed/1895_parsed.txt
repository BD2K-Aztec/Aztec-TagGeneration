structural_bioinformatics ftsite high_accuracy detection of ligand_binding on unbound protein_structures motivation binding_site identification is a classical problem that is important for a range of applications including the structure based prediction of function the elucidation of functional_relationships among proteins protein_engineering and drug_design we describe an accurate method of binding_site identification namely ftsite this method is based on experimental_evidence that ligand_binding also bind small_organic of various shapes and polarity the ftsite algorithm does not rely on any evolutionary or statistical_information but achieves near experimental accuracy it is capable of identifying the binding_sites in over of apo proteins from established test_sets that have been used to evaluate many other binding_site prediction_methods availability ftsite is freely_available as a web_based server atlocating ligand_binding is of fundamental_importance for a range of applications such as the structure based prediction of function the elucidation of functional_relationships among proteins protein_engineering and drug_design a number of methods aimed at ligand_binding identification have been developed these include geometric analyses energy calculations evolutionary considerations machine_learning and various combinations of these approaches over the years improvements in methodology have led to an increase in the success_rate of binding_site detection as the top prediction from by surfnet to by vice for the ligsite csc test_set of unbound protein_structures which has been used to evaluate many binding_site detection methods the vice algorithm has not been implemented as a server and the best server currently available is metapocket which seeks consensus among eight different methods and reaches accuracy for the unbound ligsite csc test_set here we describe the energy based method ftsite which is capable of identifying the binding_sites with to whom correspondence should be addressed success_rate as the top prediction for the same ligsite csc test_set and has been implemented as a server ftsite was evaluated using apo structures from two test_sets of proteins that have been previously used in the evaluation of other binding_site prediction_methods these test_sets are the ligsite csc set and qsitefinder set ftsite achieves accuracy rates of and for the ligsite csc and qsitefinder sets respectively when determining the binding_site as the highest ranked consensus_site for each test_set we employed the same assessment_criteria that were used in the respective previous_studies supplementary_material a comparison to other methods is shown in ftsite was able to identify the ligand_binding using only the top_ranked prediction in a number of difficult cases two examples are shown in see the supplementary_material for other examples the ligand from the holo structures is superimposed on the results of the apo structures for comparison in both cases conformational_differences between the holo and apo structures make binding_site detection difficult in the case of amylase the loop formed by residues v g and d closes down on the ligand in the holo form yielding a better defined ligand_binding similarly in the apo form of hiv_protease the ligand_binding right hiv_protease pdb id hsi apo and ida holo c top on the ligsite csc test_set ftsite has an accuracy of using only the top_ranked prediction of the ligand_binding and using the top three bottom on the qsitefinder test_set ftsite has an accuracy of using only the top_ranked prediction is very open and becomes well formed only upon ligand_binding despite the poorly_defined binding_sites present in the apo structures of these two proteins ftsite identifies the binding_site as the top_ranked prediction key to the success of ftsite is the use of multiple molecular_probes rather than a single_probe as implemented in most other energybased methods screening by nmr and x_ray shows that the binding_sites of proteins possess a tendency to bind small organic_compounds that vary in size shape and polarity thus improving the robustness of ftsite to conformational changes although individual probes may bind to other cavities the largest clusters of multiple probes occur in ligand_binding thus ftsite does not rely on surrogate measures of ligand_binding propensity such as pocket volume cavity depth or the ability of binding non polar spheres due to its strong biophysical basis the method provides high_accuracy without evolutionary considerations we note that solvent mapping also had success in identifying druggable binding_sites in proteinprotein_interfaces
