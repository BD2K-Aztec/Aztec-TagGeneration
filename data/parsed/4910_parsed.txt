wesme uncovering mutual_exclusivity of cancer drivers and beyond motivation mutual_exclusivity is a widely_recognized property of many cancer drivers knowledge about these relationships can provide_important cancer drivers cancer driving pathways and cancer_subtypes it can also be used to predict new functional interactions between cancer driving genes and uncover novel cancer drivers currently most of mutual_exclusivity analyses are preformed focusing on a limited set of genes in part due to the computational_cost required to rigorously compute p values results to reduce the computing cost and perform less restricted mutual_exclusivity analysis we developed an efficient method to estimate p values while controlling the mutation_rates of individual patients and genes similar to the permutation_test a comprehensive mutual_exclusivity analysis allowed us to uncover mutually_exclusive pairs some of which may have relatively low mutation_rates these pairs often included likely cancer drivers that have been missed in previous_analyses more importantly our results demonstrated that mutual_exclusivity can also provide information that goes beyond the interactions between cancer drivers and can for example elucidate different mutagenic processes in different cancer groups in particular including frequently mutated long genes such as ttn in our analysis allowed us to observe interesting patterns of apobec activity in breast_cancer and identify a set of related driver_genes that are highly_predictive of patient_survival in addition we utilized our mutual_exclusivity analysis in support of a previously_proposed model where apobec activity is the underlying process that causes tp mutations in a subset of breast_cancer cases availability_and http www ncbi nlm nih gov cbbresearch przytycka index mutual_exclusivity is a frequently observed property in two or more genes having mutations in cancer patients mutually_exclusive gene_pairs i e gene_pairs of which simultaneous mutations in the same patients are less frequent than it is expected by chance are observed within many cancer_types while some are common across multiple different cancer_types the underlying cause of mutual_exclusivity might vary depending on the context in many cases genes_mutated in a mutually_exclusive way have been found to be members of the same functional pathway in such a case the mutual_exclusivity of their mutation pattern can be explained by the pathway centric view of cancer specifically if two genes belong to the same cancer driving pathway then a mutation in just one of them might suffice to dysregulate the pathway and trigger cancer_progression in contrast in a combined analysis of multiple_cancer mutually_exclusive aberrations might represent tissue_specific cancer drivers in fact the sets of mutually_exclusive drivers obtained in pan cancer analysis predominantly included the tissue type specific genes that typically do not share_common pathways yet even within the same tissue type mutual_exclusivity between genes from different pathways is not unusual this type of exclusivity can be explained for example by synthetic_lethality where simultaneous mutations in both genes are detrimental for cancer_progression another not necessarily unrelated possibility is that the mutually_exclusive drivers define different cancer_subtypes within the same tissue type finally mutual_exclusivity can also be observed between less frequently mutated cancer drivers suggesting more subtle relationships between them and their contribution to cancer_progression for example previous_research found that even if the exclusivity between arid b and kras is not significant in any of individual cancer_types separately the pair was shown to be mutually_exclusive when analyzing all cancer_types together as statistical_power was gained mutual_exclusivity can potentially provide_important about cancer including its alternative progression pathways and subtypes it can also reveal important relationships between genes and pathways however most of the analyses of mutual_exclusivity so_far have been focused on limited subsets of genes that were selected based on mutation_rate cut_off typically or depending on datasets or restricted by other criteria one of the factors_limiting the applications of mutual_exclusivity analysis beyond restricted gene_sets was the cost of computing rigorous p values for all gene_pairs of interest statistically pairwise mutual_exclusivity can be estimated by a permutation_test in which the original mutational profile is permuted by swapping random pairs of mutations iteratively while preserving the mutation_rates of genes and patients a possibly faster alternative approach is to use a hypergeometric_test however the hypergeometric_test treats all patients equally ignoring patient specific mutation frequencies which may limit its accuracy to provide a more in depth understanding of mutual_exclusivity in cancer data we started by designing a new and fast heuristic for estimating statistical_significance of mutual_exclusivity relationships our method weighted sampling based mutual_exclusivity wesme estimates p values of mutual_exclusivity while taking_into mutation frequencies of patients it closely approximates the results of the permutation_based method and does so without using the costly permutations of a mutation matrix moreover wesme can compute p values for a subset of genes independently from the rest of genome unlike the permutation method that requires whole_genome permutations by dynamically adjusting sampling depth wesme can provide high_precision p values without a significant increase in computational_cost adopting the same sampling technique we also developed a complementary test weighted sampling based co occurrence wesco to estimate the significance of co occurrence in gene_mutations with wesme at hand we began to explore the information that a comprehensive mutual_exclusivity survey can provide we included all genes with mutations in the analysis without prefiltering in particular we did not exclude very long genes such as muscle protein titin ttn gel forming mucins which often emerge as frequently mutated genes in cancer even after correction with their lengths but are generally assumed to be artifacts interestingly we found that some of these genes have many mutual_exclusivity partners in particular we identified ttn as one of the hubs in the mutual_exclusivity network in breast_cancer and endometrial_carcinoma the high number of mutual_exclusivity partners of ttn prompted us to hypothesize that mutual_exclusivity of its mutations could be a reflection of an underlying mutagenic process that occurs in a specific subgroup of patients to test this hypothesis we reasoned that long and frequently mutated genes might harbor a recognizable signature of the mutagenic process acting on them specifically it has been recently recognized that a subclass of apobec cytidine deaminases which convert cytosine to uracil during rna_editing are a source of mutagenicity in human tumors several other factors such as pol e mutation patient ages at diagnosis known mutagenic exposures or defects in dna maintenance are also associated with characteristic mutation signatures we found that in the case of breast_cancer the mutation pattern of ttn is consistent with the apobec b activity while in endometrial_carcinoma it is consistent with the pol e mutation signature including ttn gene in our mutual_exclusivity analysis allowed us not only to observe interesting patterns of apobec activity in breast_cancer but also to identify a set of driver_genes that is highly_predictive of patient_survival in addition we showed that our mutual_exclusivity analysis supports the model where apobec activity is the underlying process that causes tp mutations in highly mutated breast_cancer cases finally with our method we have been able to uncover mutually_exclusive cancer drivers and novel putative drivers despite their relatively low mutation_rates in the breast_cancer dataset taken together our results demonstrated the utility of our fast statistical_test for mutual_exclusivity and showed that the unrestricted analysis of mutual_exclusivity enabled by the method can provide valuable biological_insights
