a subspace method for the detection of transcription_factor motivation the identification of the sites at which transcription_factors tfs bind to deoxyribonucleic_acid dna is an important problem in molecular_biology many computational_methods have been developed for motif_finding most of them based on position_specific pssms which assume the independence of positions within a binding_site however some experimental and computational studies demonstrate that interdependences within the positions exist results in this article we introduce a novel motif_finding method which constructs a subspace based on the covariance of numerical dna_sequences when a candidate sequence is projected into the modeled subspace a threshold in the q residuals confidence allows us to predict whether this sequence is a binding_site using the transfac and jaspar databases we compared our q residuals detector with existing pssm methods in most of the studied tf_binding the q residuals detector performs significantly better and faster than match and mast as compared with motifscan a method which takes_into interdependences the performance of the q residuals detector is better when the number of available sequences is small availability http r forge r project org projects meet contact deoxyribonucleic_acid dna_sequence are short sequence_patterns with biological_function in the gene promoter_region there are dna_sequence which hint at the interaction between the gene_regulation machinery and the nucleic_acids they are involved in several dna and ribonucleic_acid rna processes such as the binding of some proteins to dna the ribosome binding to mrna and mrna_processing d protein_biosynthesis starts with a transcription process this process for example in eukaryotes is led by several types of rna_polymerase that require special dna_sequences in promoters and a set of transcription_factor tf proteins to whom correspondence should be addressed due to the importance of gene_regulation a major_problem in molecular_biology is to discover the location of the transcription_factor tfbss within the genome but the fact that most tfs bind to short degenerate sequences makes_it to find sequence_patterns to model the binding_sites many algorithms try to characterize these patterns and such algorithms may be classified into consensus based_methods or alignment_based most of the algorithms developed target the location of tfbss these follow one of two strategies i to discover common binding_sites into a set of unaligned sequences of co regulated_genes and ii to make use of the previous_knowledge of sequences to search for a motif within a genome the algorithms which use the previous_knowledge of the binding_site sequences are mostly based on position_specific pssm are matrices of frequencies of each nucleotide in each position of the binding_site some examples of these algorithms are match which uses information at each position to construct a pssm mast based on the qfast algorithm and part of meme suite rvista which uses evolutionary data and iteme which calculates the information_loss of the binding_sites these models assume that the positions in binding_sites are statistically independent however experimental_evidence shows that tfbs have interdependences between positions and some computational studies suggest the same these findings have motivated the development of new strategies which take into account position interdependences models based on markov_chains such as wam are restricted to modeling interdependences between adjacent positions other algorithms estimate non adjacent interdependences using permuted markov_models bayesian_networks variable order bayesian_networks or graphs detectors constructed using these techniques have higher accuracy but require the tuning of many parameters for optimal operation which typically requires a large number of binding_site instances additionally most of these algorithms are computationally_intensive on the other hand a large body of knowledge exists for specific event detection in numerical sequences signals and the conversionin this section we first present the results of the comparison between the q residuals detector match and mast using the motifspresented above and two different backgrounds for each organism then we describe in more detail the comparison between mast and q residuals and show a study of the interdependences we present an analysis of the computational time needed for each one of the studied detection_algorithms and finally we compare the q residuals detector to the results obtained with motifscan one example of detection can be seen in the cmyb motif in a set of tfbss for h sapiens the roc_curves show the performance of the three algorithms using the first background for h sapiens a significant_improvement is observed when the q residuals detector is used in place of mast or match to visualize the performance of the three different detectors in all the studied tfs summarizes the results for q residuals match and mast for the two different backgrounds in each organism for transfac the best number of components usually between and is shown together with the mean auc for each background and method the results for all the studied tfs are available as supplementary_material to quantify the differences in performance between the qresiduals detector and the other algorithms a wilcoxon rank test was performed on the auc distributions using the null_hypothesis that the two distributions are the same versus the alternative hypothesis that auc using q residuals is closer to than when mast or match are used inand the supplementary_material the increment in auc and the significance of the test are displayed and it can be seen that q residuals performs significantly better than match in of the motifs studied and significantly better than mast in of them with p value to better visualize the detectors we present the auc box plots in these box plots represent the auc and its variation when the l o o is applied shows the box plots for the first background and the jaspar motifs corresponding to m musculus in most cases not only is the mean auc closer to one in q residuals results for q residuals detector compared with match and mast algorithms corresponding to the two backgrounds of each organism in transfac the auc shown for each method is the mean of the areas using the cross_validation method and the number of principal_components for q residuals is chosen as the number of components with less variance in the auc the auc is the mean auc improvement of q residuals versus match and mast respectively the level of significance corresponds to the p value calculated when a wilcoxon rank test is performed with the null_hypothesis being that the auc distributions using q residuals detector and the other algorithm are the same and the alternative hypothesis being that the auc distributions calculated with the q residuals detector is closer to one a description of the jaspar motifs and transfac motifs can be found in the supplementary materialbut the variance is also smaller which suggests that the q residuals algorithm behaves more robustly an average of the pr curves obtained in each leave_one iteration is also presented as supplementary_material showing that when these curves are used the q residuals detector also performs better than the pssm algorithms in most of the cases the percentage of positions showing interdependences i dep varies among the studied binding_sites as can be observed in a correlation test was performed between the i dep and the improvement in binding_site detection when q residuals detector was compared with mast the improvement in binding_site detection was derived by subtracting the mean auc for each binding_site calculated using each method results show a significant correlation between the number of strong interdependent sites within a binding locus and the amount of improvement of the q residuals detector over mast as measured in terms of auc performing the test on the results for jaspar database gave a p value the corresponding result for the transfac database was a p value the computational times of the q residuals detector of mast and of our r implementation of match were compared for the detection of tfbs within promoter_sequences to compare the three algorithms the mast algorithm meme version the c code for q residuals using the ideal number of components and our implementation of match algorithm in r with the ideal core similarity were used the background corresponded to background for each organismthis consisted of nucleotides the threshold for each method was set in such a way that the number of positives was similar in the case of mast a p value of p was chosen for q residuals a confidence_interval of c was set and for match the similarity was set to s the time was calculated for iterations of the program the average computational time in detection for the transfac database motifs are s using the qresiduals detector s using mast and s for the r implementation of match the results show that the qresiduals detector is faster than mast and the r implementation of match in all the studied binding_sites the q residuals detector was also compared with motifscan an algorithm which takes_into interdependences using the same criteria as a increase in the roc n auc was required for an improvement to be considered significant the results showed that in of the studied motifs motifscan performs better than either the q residuals detector or the pssms methods that q residuals is the best detector in of the motifs whereas pssm is best in just of them the three detectors perform equally well inare better than motifscan in motifs and motifscan and pssm are better than q residuals in of the motifs the auc performance is shown in the supplementary_material a visualization of the results inshows that the performance of q residuals is more sensitive to the number of positions when the sequences are short the number_of using the q residuals detector increases leading to a smaller auc motifscan performs better in this situation but on the other hand it needs more training sequences so when the number of sequences is small q residuals performs better than motifscan focussing on the motifs which have sequences available in of the cases the auc of q residuals shows it to be significantly the best algorithm whereas motifscan is best in just of the instances in most cases even if motifscan is significantly better than q residuals the q residuals algorithm performs better than pssm methods for this comparison also
