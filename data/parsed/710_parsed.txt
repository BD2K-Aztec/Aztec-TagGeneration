structural_bioinformatics bendix intuitive helix geometry analysis and abstraction the flexibility of helices is important for membrane protein_function and calls for better visualization and analysis software is presented that quantifies and projects the helix axis evolution over time with the choice of uniform or analytic heatmap graphics according to the local geometry bendix supports static molecular_dynamics atomistic and coarse_grained input availability_and bendix source_code including installation_instructions are freely_available sbcb bioch ox ac uk bendix bendix is written in tcl as an extension to vmd and is supported by all major operating_systems contact helix flexibility enables membrane_protein functionality such as receptor_activation molecule transport and channel_gating examples of this can be seen in the voltagegated potassium_channels and the mscs mechanosensitive channel where molecular hinges within channel lining helices elicit gating in addition helix curvature ensures structural_integrity by allowing close packing the dynamics of transmembrane_helices can be explored through molecular_dynamics md_simulations which is becoming an increasingly important tool to complement experimental structural studies however improved methods for analysis and visualization of helix dynamics are needed considerations of helix flexibility are also somewhat compromised by their classical representation as idealized cylinders the prevalence and importance of kinked helices therefore calls for improved helix abstraction and intuitive analysis tools furthermore it is important to make such developments available to the wider community by incorporation into existing publicly adopted visualization software we have therefore developed bendix a program that meets these demands curved helices are prevalent in membrane protein_structures and their flexibility plays_a in biological_function despite this demonstrated importance methods for helix motion analysis are limited we have developed a new tool for analysis of helix conformational_change thus helix characterization in bendix aids structure comprehension and allows interactive analysis visualization and manipulation of both atomistic and coarse_grained simulations intuitive heatmap display of helix curvature at the point of interest allows the user to more readily detect potentially relevant helix distortions over time thus aiding analysis of the relationship between structure dynamic conformational changes and biological_function
