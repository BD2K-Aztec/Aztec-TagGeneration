genetics_and efficient algorithms for tandem copy_number reconstruction in repeat rich regions motivation structural_variations and in particular copy_number cnvs have dramatic effects of disease and traits technologies for identifying cnvs have been an active area of research for over years the current_generation of high_throughput sequencing_techniques presents new opportunities for identification of cnvs methods that utilize these technologies map sequencing_reads to a reference_genome and look for signatures which might indicate the presence of a cnv these methods work well when cnvs lie within unique genomic_regions however the problem of cnv identification and reconstruction becomes much more challenging when cnvs are in repeat rich regions due to the multiple mapping positions of the reads results in this study we propose an efficient algorithm to handle these multi mapping reads such that the cnvs can be reconstructed with high_accuracy even for repeat rich regions to our knowledge this is the first attempt to both identify and reconstruct cnvs in repeat rich regions our experiments show that our method is not only computationally_efficient but also accurate contact structural_variations and in particular copy_number cnvs in which certain regions of the genome appear in multiple copies in different individuals have been shown to affect_gene cause disease and alter an organisms phenotype in order to detect_cnvs a genome of interest donor genome is compared with a known reference_genome many methods based on microarray_technologies and comparative_genomic cgh have been proposed in which a donor genome along with a reference_genome is hybridized to a tiling_array the ratio of intensities donor reference is used to determine the presence of structural_variation which may be a cnv when a donor genome has higher intensity at a particular array location it implies that a cnv may be present although able to accurately estimate the number of copies for a given region these array based_methods are unable to identify the boundaries of cnvs with high_resolution and to whom correspondence should be addressed furthermore are not at all able to identify the boundaries of junctions between cnv copies high_throughput hts technology presents new opportunities to detect_cnvs using paired_end the idea behind these methods is that two reads are generated from a donor sequence which are known to occur a certain distance apart if the two sequences have a different distance when mapped to the reference this indicates the presence of a cnv a few recent_studies have proposed methods to detect_cnvs using datasets generated by hts technologies divided the genome into kb windows and counted the number of reads_mapped to each window depth of coverage furthermore they used a set of fixed regions which are unique among all primates as control windows and calculated the average depth of coverage for those regions then they scaled the results to predict the copy_number of other windows using sequence_data generated with inbred_mouse attempted to predict occurrences of cnvs by using a hidden_markov their method breaks the genome into a series of windows and determines the copy_number state at each window adjacent windows that have the same copy_number state are combined to determine the full region of the cnv unfortunately the boundary resolution for this method is limited by the size of the window which is typically at least kb used a sliding_window approach in order to identify genomic_regions that are suspected to contain cnvs and to estimate the location of their breakpoints this method is able to predict the breakpoints with greater resolution because it is not limited by the choice of window_size both of these methods have successfully identified true cnvs however their focus has been primarily on predicting the genomic_sequence that exist in variable copies more recent methods are based on the discordant paired_end which are the reads_mapped to the reference_genome in an unexpected way discordant reads may indicate the occurrence of cnvs proposed a method to use discordant paired_end to identify structural_variations in this work they identify discordant reads which indicate different types of structural_variations for example insertion deletion or translocation these discordant reads are clustered to provide high_confidence for the occurrence of a structural_variation proposed an elegant method to detect copy_number using paired_end similar to the work in they first cluster discordant paired_end to identify cnv boundaries next they build a donor graph in which the genome is represented as a setpage
