phylogenetics spacodir structuring of phylogenetic diversity in ecological_communities motivation spacodir is a cross_platform package written for the r environment for studying partitioning of diversity among natural communities in space and time complementing and extending existing software spacodir allows for hypothesis_testing and parameter_estimation in studying spatial structuring of species phylogenetic and trait diversities availability integrated with other software in the r environment and with well documented and demonstrated functions spacodir is an open_source package and available at http cran runtil recently the formalized importance of historical processes in the development of communities had been largely neglected see with ongoing_development in the field of community phylogenetics time dependent_processes can now be directly integrated into the study of community diversity and assembly yet available software for such analyses is often idiosyncratic requiring unique data_formats or a particular platform but see our aim here is to provide a cross_platform package spacodir that can inform the processes contributing to sorting of phylogenetic species and trait diversities among communities to this end we use the highly_flexible and actively developed r environment r development core providing spacodir as an adaptation and extension of the c coded software spacodi spatial and phylogenetic_analysis of community diversity developed by hardy here we describe the central functionality of the spacodir package spacodir is poised to study scale dependencies of diversity partitioning in space and time fast computation for the most demanding tasks is facilitated by compiled c coded functions
