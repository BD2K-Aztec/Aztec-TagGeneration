graphlet based edge clustering reveals pathogen interacting_proteins motivation prediction of protein_function from protein_interaction has received_attention in the post genomic era a popular strategy has been to cluster the network into functionally coherent groups of proteins and assign the entire cluster with a function based on functions of its annotated members traditionally network research has focused on clustering of nodes however clustering of edges may be preferred nodes belong to multiple functional_groups but clustering of nodes typically cannot capture the group overlap while clustering of edges can clustering of adjacent edges that share many neighbors was proposed recently outperforming different node clustering_methods however since some biological_processes can have characteristic signatures throughout the network not just locally it may be of interest to consider edges that are not necessarily adjacent results we design a sensitive measure of the topological_similarity of edges that can deal with edges that are not necessarily adjacent we cluster edges that are similar according to our measure in different bakers yeast protein_interaction outperforming existing node and edge clustering_approaches we apply our approach to the human network to predict new pathogen interacting_proteins this is important since these proteins represent drug_target candidates availability software executables are freely_available upon request network research spans many domains we focus on protein_protein ppi_networks with the goal of identifying new pathogen interacting_proteins in ppi_networks nodes are proteins and undirected edges correspond to physical binding between the proteins we focus on ppi_networks since it is the proteins gene_products that carry out most biological_processes and they do so by interacting with other proteins high_throughput for interaction detection such as yeast_two y h assays or affinity_purification coupled to mass_spectrometry ap ms have yielded partial ppi_networks for many model_organisms and human as well as for bacterial and viral_pathogens many biological_network datasets are now publicly_available analogous to genomic_sequence research biological_network research will impact our biological understanding however it is in its infancy owing to computational hardness of many graphhence why favor nodes over edges especially when clustering of edges may be preferred since nodes typically belong to multiple functional_groups and since clusters are expected to correspond to the groups it may be desirable to allow for a node to belong to multiple clusters clustering of nodes typically cannot capture the group overlap especially if the network is partitioned into disjoint node sets as is the case with many although not all node clustering_approaches however clustering of edges can easily capture the group overlap edge clustering was proposed only recently adjacent connected edges that share many neighbors were defined as similar and were thus clustered together outperforming different node clustering_methods including a method that allows for the group overlap however it may be of interest to consider edges that are not necessarily adjacent for example of pairs of human proteins that both interact with the same pathogen are actually not adjacent in the ppi_network in fact they are at the shortest_path distance of up to five so they may be missed by approaches that focus on adjacent edges only since the end nodes of adjacent edges are at most at the distance of two hence we introduce a new measure of edge similarity that is not only capable of dealing with edges that are not necessarily adjacent but is also a more sensitive measure of topology than the above shared neighborhood measure we show that grouping of edges that are similar according to our measure results in clusters of comparable or better quality than the above clustering approach by we apply our clustering strategy to the human ppi_network to identify from the clusters new pathogen interacting_proteins and hence drug_target candidates we introduce edge gdv similarity a sensitive topological measure of edge similarity when we hierarchically cluster edge gdvsimilar edges in yeast networks we outperform existing node and edge clustering_methods when we cluster the human network edge hie is better than node hie while edge km and node km are comparable thus we gain by clustering edges compared to clustering nodes with hierarchical but not k medoids clustering we apply our approach to prediction of new pi proteins in human this is important since it could suggest candidates for therapeutic_intervention we validate many of our predictions through literature_search which confirms the correctness of our approach
