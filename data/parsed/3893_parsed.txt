genome_analysis rbamtools an r interface to samtools enabling fast accumulative tabulation of splicing_events over multiple rna_seq samples the open_source environment r isf the most widely used software to statistically explore biological_data including sequence_alignments bam is the de facto standard file_format for sequence_alignment with rbamtools we provide now a full spectrum of accessibility to bam for r users such as reading writing extraction of subsets and plotting of alignment depth where the script syntax closely follows the sam bam format additionally rbamtools enables fast accumulative tabulation of splicing_events over multiple bam_files availability_and rbamtools is available on cran and on r forge the samtools format specifies various data slots for sequence_alignments many of which are difficult to understand when sequencing_experiments are to be analyzed for analysis of sequencing_data detailed access to contents of bam_files is needed especially when technical_problems arise rbamtools allows r users to investigate alignment results by reading the header section or retrieve and view alignments from regions of interest using basic r structures rbamtools provides functions for creation and modification of bam_file header or alignment section contents rbamtools also facilitates writing of bam_files which is not possible in bioconductor additionally rbamtools contains a framework for sequential and fast extraction of alignment gap positions see on rna_seq which are candidate sites for true splicing_events rbamtools is part of an analysis_pipeline for analysis of splicing_events in rnaseq_data which consists of three r packages rbamtools and refgenome and splicesites kaisers b the identification of splicing inaccuracies is a non trivial task on bam_files since the positions of alignment gaps must be accounted on billions of reads with rbamtools processing data from e g rna_seq samples containing alignments can be done in h on a standard workstation with minimal working_memory demand current versions of the samtools c library contain misalignment bus errors http en wikipedia org wiki bus error which may cause program crashes on some architectures e g sparc in rbamtools these misalignment errors are corrected see_supplementary
