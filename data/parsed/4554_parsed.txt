bioimage_informatics testing for presence of known and unknown molecules in imaging mass_spectrometry motivation imaging mass_spectrometry has emerged in the past_decade as a label_free spatially_resolved and multipurpose bioana lytical technique for direct analysis of biological_samples however solving two everyday data analysis problems still requires expert judgment i the detection of unknown molecules and ii the testing for presence of known molecules results we developed a measure of spatial chaos of a molecular image corresponding to a mass to charge value which is a proxy for the molecular presence and developed methods solving considered problems the statistical_evaluation was performed on a data_set from a rat_brain section with test_sets of molecular images selected by an expert the measure of spatial chaos has shown high agreement with expert judges the method for detection of unknown molecules allowed us to find structured molecular images corresponding to spectral peaks of any low_intensity the test for presence applied to a list of endogenous peptides ranked them according to the proposed measure of their presence in the sample availability the source_code and test_sets of mass to charge images are available atimaging mass_spectrometry ims is a label_free technique for spatially_resolved chemical analysis by acquiring mass_spectra across the sample_surface a tremendous development of ims and considerable increase of applications in biology and medicine have been observed over the past_decade various types of ims were developed for diverse sample_types ranging from biological and plant_tissues to bio and polymer thin_films in this article we consider the matrixassisted laser desorption ionization ims maldi_ims which plays the leading role in the rapidly_developing of ims based_metabolomics lipidomics and proteomics maldiims is used for imaging of drugs and their metabolites histopathological_analysis of biopsy sections and discovery of new biomarkers and drugs given a sample usually a tissue_section maldi_ims acquires mass_spectra at discrete spatial points across the sample_surface providing a so_called datacube or hyperspectral image with a mass_spectrum measured at each pixel a mass_spectrum represents the relative_abundances of ionizable molecules with various mass tocharge ratios m z ranging for maldi_ims from several hundred up to a few tens_of m z a channel of a maldi datacube corresponding to an m z value is called an m z or molecular image and expresses the relative spatial abundances of a molecular_ion with this m z value maldi_ims data are large with a typical dataset comprising spectra where each spectrum has a length of m z bins in current_practice such datasets are analyzed either manually or using data_mining methods manual_analysis requires an expert to go over all m z values plot their m z images and examine them visually if there is any prior_knowledge about the sample a histological annotation or pre specified regions of interest then the visual_analysis aims to correlate the intensity patterns visible in m z images with the region of interest usually one is interested in m zimages showing high_intensities in the region of interest and low_intensities in the rest of the sample however often there is no prior_knowledge given or it does not describe the spatial localization of molecules of interest completely for example detection of drug_metabolites cannot be done by specifying the region as these metabolites will not necessarily all localize in the drug_target area in the case of no prior_knowledge on localization of molecules of interest the visual_analysis aims at finding m z images which exhibit spatially structured intensity patterns so_called spatially structured m zimages as opposed to those which exhibit just noise so_called spatially unstructured m z images we refer to this problem as to the detection of unknown molecules in maldi_ims data in this article we propose an automatic method that solves this to whom correspondence should be addressed problem without specifying a region of interest a priori and without visual_examination another unsolved_problem of maldi_ims data analysis is the test for presence of known molecules when their localization is unknown for example given a list of possible drug_metabolites or proteins one needs to test for their presence in the tissue_section with only few molecules to be tested one can visually examine m z images of these molecules and judge whether they are spatially structured however the visual_analysis in not feasible for a large number of molecules and cannot be exploited in automatic pipelines we propose an automatic method solving this problem in this article we present a new approach to analysis of maldi_ims data which resembles the visual_analysis described earlier in the text but selects spatially structured m z images automatically the core of this approach is the ranking of m z images by their level of spatial_structure similarly to how it can be done by the naked_eye the ranking is based on the original measure of spatial chaos does not have parameters and can be used in a completely unsupervised manner the spatial chaos is defined as a lack of spatial_pattern in the pixels intensities the proposed measure of spatial chaos is low for an image exhibiting spatially structured intensity pattern and is high for an image with spatially chaotic pixels intensities the problem of estimating a measure of spatial chaos of an image is almost not addressed in the literature most publications on structure detection deal with finding structured patterns either of a given shape or based on edge detection but not with estimating the level of structure to the best of our knowledge there is only one publication considering a similar problem which presents a statistical_method for testing_the that an image is devoid of structure thus defining a measure of chaos of an m z image is new challenging and certainly requires an evaluation we propose and apply a statistical_evaluation approach by using a well studied maldi_ims dataset from a rat_brain section based on the ranking of m z images by their measure of spatial chaos we propose solutions to the two described problems first we will show how to detect unknown molecules by calculating the measure of chaos of all m z images and selecting least chaotic m z images this can be used in particular for highly_sensitive peak_picking by selecting a peak of any intensity if its m z image exhibits any spatial_structure whereas all established peak_picking methods at least partially rely on intensity and suffer from low sensitivity second we will show how to test for the presence of known molecules by calculating the measure of chaos for their m z images and taking least chaotic m z images this can be used for searching for drug_metabolites of unknown localization we propose how the test for presence can improve current maldiims based protein identification approaches our motivation to exploit a measure of spatial chaos to detect unknown molecules and to test for presence of known molecules is as follows selecting structured m z images after visual_examination of m z images is the well accepted approach of manual_analysis maldi_ims data and is a part of everyday work of an imaging mass spectrometrist assuming any spatial differentiation of the sample one is normally interested in molecules whose spatial distribution across the sample is not homogeneous normally only molecules corresponding to baseline signals e g matrix have homogeneous distribution in maldi_ims the baseline signals can have non zero intensities owing to the strong pixel to pixel variation which is inherent to maldiims their m z images exhibit noise and look unstructured
