simulating systems_genetics data with sysgensim sysgensim is a software_package to simulate systems_genetics sg experiments in model_organisms for the purpose of evaluating and comparing statistical and computational_methods and their implementations for analyses of sg data e g methods for expression_quantitative eqtl_mapping and network_inference sysgensim allows the user to select a variety of network_topologies genetic and kinetic_parameters to simulate sg data genotyping gene_expression and phenotyping with large gene_networks with thousands of nodes the software is encoded in matlab and a user_friendly graphical_user is provided availability the open_source code and user_manual can be downloaded at http sysgensim sourceforge net the central_goal of systems_biology is to gain a predictive systemlevel understanding of biological_networks this entails inferring causal networks from observations on a perturbed biological system an ideal experimental_design for causal_inference is randomized multifactorial perturbation the recognition that the genetic_variation in a segregating population represents randomized multifactorial perturbation gave rise to genetical genomics and systems_genetics sg where a segregating or genetically randomized population is genotyped at many dna_variants and is profiled for disease_phenotypes of interest genome_wide gene_expression and potentially other omics variables epigenomics microrna expression proteomics metabolomics etc sg experiments and studies enable us to elucidate the genetic control of gene_expression and other omics variables to annotate dna_polymorphisms implicated in previous genome_wide gwas for particular diseases and to infer key control genes and pathways causally underlying a disease or biomedical trait of interest many statistical and computational_methods are being developed for the analysis of sg data an important component of any sg analysis is the quantitative_trait qtl_mapping of all expression traits etraits and other omics traits if available it is well to whom correspondence should be addressed known that the etraits of groups of genes share_common regulators dna_variants which are more easily_identified when associated with a group of etraits rather than with individual etraits several approaches to associating dna_variants with groups of etraits have recently been proposed e g a major_goal of sg studies is to reconstruct a causal network whose nodes are the phenotypes the etraits and potentially other omics variables and the dna_variants methods proposed to achieve_this include bayesian_networks differential_equation models structural_equation sem and undirected dependency graph or co expression network with edge orientation using dna_variants as causal anchors while multiple methods for qtl_mapping of etraits omics variables and for causal network_inference are available at the present time not much is known about the strengths_and of all of these proposed methods and whether or when some methods perform better than others however researchers increasingly realize that thorough verification of algorithms in bioinformatics and genetical systems_biology is required in fact several international competitions are organized on an annual basis to compare computational_methods for systems_biology and genetic_analysis these include the dialogue for reverse_engineering assessments and methods dream project with its reverse_engineering challenges http www the dreamproject org for which sysgensim has been used to produce the sg challenges in and the genetic_analysis workshops http www gaworkshop org which compare analysis tools relevant for current analytical problems in genetic_epidemiology statistical genetics and genetical systems_biology the availability of realistically simulated artificial datasets which are generated under a set of assumptions most relevant to real sg data is of utmost_importance for the verification of algorithms for sg data analysis several sg papers use simulations which are typically simplistic and not general e g other more general software_packages have been developed for simulating gene_expression data with network models for gene network_inference algorithm evaluation e g abiochem genenetweaver and ingeneue but experimental_designs are restricted to time series and steady_state measurement after environmental or kinetic parameter perturbations and single gene perturbation experiments these andpage
