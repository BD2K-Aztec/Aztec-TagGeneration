databases_and a sample_storage management system for biobanks establishment of large_scale biobanks of human specimens is essential to conduct molecular pathological or epidemiological_studies this requires automation of procedures for specimen cataloguing and tracking through complex analytical processes the international agency for research on cancer iarc develops a large portfolio of studies broadly aimed at cancer_prevention and including cohort casecontrol and case only studies in various parts of the world this diversity of study_designs structure annotations and specimen collections is extremely_difficult to accommodate into a single sample management system sms current_commercial or academic sms are often restricted to a few sample_types and tailored to a limited number of analytic workflows voegele et_al a laboratory_information lims for a high_throughput genetic platform aimed at candidate_gene mutation_screening bioinformatics thus we developed a system based on a three tier architecture and relying on an oracle database and an oracle forms web_application data are imported through forms or csv files and information_retrieval is enabled via multi criteria queries that can generate different types of reports including tables excel files trees pictures and graphs the system is easy to install flexible expandable and implemented with a high degree of data security and confidentiality both the database and the interface have been modeled to be compatible with and adaptable to almost all types of biobanks the first requirement of single sample management system sms is to harness the inherent variability and heterogeneity in the types of storage units and in the storage levels at the inception of the project a review of collections and facilities was conducted providing a basis for defining extensive specifications incorporating the whole range of iarc sample diversity the storage infrastructure is made up of three main categories of containers liquid_nitrogen tanks freezers and fridges and dedicated humidity controlled rooms at various temperatures and each including several subtypes of containers a comprehensive and strict hierarchy from single_tube up to room defines the precise position of each sample location within the system the exact capacity of each storage level is determined in order to monitor unused storage capacity these hierarchies are relatively stable but the system has the capacity to evolve by incorporating new hierarchical_levels new storage devices within each level as well as movements and transfer of samples within each hierarchical level see_supplementary sd the second requirement for sms is to keep track of all samples or containers movements and status changes including the management of dynamic_processes from specimen retrieval to extraction and aliquoting of by products and transfer to in house analytical platforms as well as shipment to other research_centers the third requirement for sms is to allow for simple and rapid import of existing information from various databases documents and sheets and to accommodate the full range of information available for each particular specimen_collection in this way sms does not replace the study specific databases developed by clinicians and epidemiologists but interfaces with them to provide a dynamic sample and data management system finally the sms needs to comply with levels of data safety and confidentiality compatible with the high ethical_standards of research_conducted on human biospecimens in this article we describe how our sms addresses all these requirements and how it operates to handle large_datasets through a simple and user_friendly interface we have developed a freely_available and platform independent sample management system sms tailored to handle a wide_variety of biospecimens and of storage_conditions within an integrated
