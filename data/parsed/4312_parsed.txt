snplice variants that modulate intron_retention from rna sequencing_data rationale the growing recognition of the importance of splicing together with rapidly_accumulating rna sequencing_data demand robust high_throughput which efficiently analyze experimentally_derived whole transcriptome splice profiles results we have developed a computational_approach called snplice for identifying cis_acting splice modulating variants from rna_seq snplice mines rna_seq to find reads that span single_nucleotide snv loci and nearby splice_junctions assessing the co occurrence of variants and molecules that remain unspliced at nearby exonintron boundaries hence snplice highlights variants preferentially occurring on intron containing molecules possibly resulting from altered splicing to illustrate co occurrence of variant nucleotide and exonintron boundary allele specific sequencing was used snplice results are generally consistent with splice prediction_tools but also indicate splice modulating elements missed by other algorithms snplice can be applied to identify variants that correlate with unexpected splicing_events and to measure the splice modulating potential of canonical splice_site snvs availability_and snplice is freely_available for download from https code goo gle com p snplice as a self contained binary package for bit linux computers and as python source_code alternative_splicing is well known as an essential mechanism of gene_regulation which may affect protein_function to date of the mammalian genes are estimated to be subjected to alternative_splicing current knowledge explains only a portion of the underlying molecular_events most of the knowledge on the splicing was obtained through alignment of dna and rna_sequences and systematic_search for functional_elements facilitated by the recent_advances of the sequencing_technologies among the major mechanisms_affecting the splicing process are nucleotide changes that disrupt or createbinding sites for splicing transcriptional and other regulatory_factors in addition to the four consensus_sequences critical for the spliceosome assembly splice_site ss ss the branch sequence and the polypyrimidine_tract ppt changes in the exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers ese ise ess and iss and other less patterned sequences are increasingly acknowledged as splicing modulators the emerging recognition of the importance of splicing has stimulated efforts for modeling the splice modulating potential of genetic_variants through probabilistic predictions based on junction nucleotide_composition dependencies among neighboring bases local optimality in the context of the gene structure homology alignments interaction with splicing_factors and comparison with experimentally_verified splice modulating motifs these approaches helped annotate numerous previously_unknown splice modulating variants however being mostly based on pre_existing knowledge they may miss variants acting through unknown_mechanisms several recent analyses have highlighted the importance of systematic genome_wide evaluation of sequence specific splicing_events a survey of the splicing patterns on relatively small genome portion exons in hapmap genotyped individualshas suggested that common splice modulating snvs can be frequent in the genome an analysis of splice sensitive microarrays demonstrated high_frequency of alternative_splicing within the usually unexplored areas of the genome and at significance_levels much below standard multipletesting thresholds implying that the extent of cis regulated differential splicing between individuals may be far greater than estimated concurrent with the above are findings from another study which employs softwaresnpsplicerto compare matching genomic_dna and complementary_dna cdna from individuals with different genotypes we developed a computational_approach snplice which identifies potential splice modulating variants from rna_seq generated through massively_parallel snplice assesses sequencing_reads for co occurrence of variant base and a nearby exon_intron boundary given that canonical splicing is expected to retain predominantly exonexon junctions in the transcriptome we based our strategy on the assumption that transcriptome sequencing_reads harboring an exonintron boundary indicate a biological_process of junction alteration and possibly altered splicing
