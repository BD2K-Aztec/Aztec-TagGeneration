sequence_analysis a more precise characterization of chaperonin substrates motivation molecular_chaperones prevent the aggregation of their substrate proteins and thereby ensure that they reach their functional native_state the bacterial groel es chaperonin system is understood in great detail on a structural mechanistic and functional level its interactors in escherichia_coli have been identified and characterized however a long_standing question in the field is what makes a protein a chaperone substrate results here we identify using a bioinformatics based_approach a simple set of quantities which characterize the groel substrate proteome we define three novel parameters differentiating groel interactors from other cellular_proteins lower rate of evolution hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity combining them with other known features to a simple bayesian predictor allows us to identify known homologous and heterologous groel substrateproteins we discuss our findings in relation to established mechanisms of protein_folding and evolutionary buffering by chaperones molecular_chaperone systems and their interaction with substrate proteins are a fascinating paradigm in molecular_biology chaperones assist newly_synthesized polypeptide_chains to fold and mature to functional proteins they are able to rescue substrates trapped in energetically unfavorable states and are markedly over expressed under cellular_stress to prevent the aggregation of unfolded_proteins in fact one could say chaperone substrates are proteins on the edge often carrying out important_cellular but relying on helper proteins to reach their native_state arguably the best studied chaperone system are the bacterial hsp hsp groel es heat_shock groes functions as a lid like structure allowing for the full encapsulation of substrate proteins inside the groel cavity thereby providing a secluded folding environment productive folding can involve various rounds of binding to and release from the chaperonin the in vivo substrate proteins of escherichia_coli groel have recently been identified and characterized experimentally between and proteins interact with the chaperone in the cell under regular growth conditions with different interaction propensities in spite of these sophisticated experimental_studies a few specific features of chaperonin substrates have been described so_far due to the limited size of the groel cavity their molecular_weights range predominantly between and kda they show a specific enrichment in certain fold types such as the tim barrel they show lower average folding propensities and higher translation efficiencies in addition an attempt has been made to identify specific chaperone binding motives in the substrate proteins after the idea that they would resemble the groes binding_loop however the picture is still far from being complete in this article we establish novel parameters differentiating them from other cellular_proteins such as lower rate of evolution lower hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity furthermore we reanalyze some known factors and examine their relation to our newly determined ones as a final consistency test we show that the quantities delineated by this study can be combined into prediction_algorithms allowing at least some degree of quantitative discrimination of groel substrates from chaperonin independent folders
