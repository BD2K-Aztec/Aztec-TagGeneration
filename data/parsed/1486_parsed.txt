drug_repositioning based on comprehensive similarity_measures and bi random_walk algorithm downloaded from motivation drug_repositioning which aims to identify new indications for existing_drugs offers a promising alternative to reduce the total time and cost of traditional drug_development many computational strategies for drug_repositioning have been proposed which are based on similarities among drugs and diseases current studies typically use either only drug related properties e g chemical_structures or only disease related properties e g phenotypes to calculate drug or disease similarity respectively while not taking_into the influence of known drugdisease association information on the similarity_measures results in this article based on the assumption that similar drugs are normally associated with similar diseases and vice_versa we propose a novel computational method_named mbirw which utilizes some comprehensive similarity_measures and bi random_walk birw algorithm to identify potential novel indications for a given drug by integrating drug or disease features information with known drugdisease associations the comprehensive similarity_measures are firstly developed to calculate similarity for drugs and diseases then drug similarity network and disease similarity network are constructed and they are incorporated into a heterogeneous network with known drugdisease interactions based on the drugdisease heterogeneous network birw algorithm is adopted to predict novel potential drugdisease associations computational experiment results from various datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach has reliable prediction_performance and outperforms several recent computational drug_repositioning approaches moreover case studies of five selected drugs further confirm the superior_performance of our method to discover potential indications for drugs practically availability_and http github com bioinfomaticscsu mbirw contact the last decades have witnessed impressive advances in genomics life_sciences and technology however drug_discovery is still time consuming risky and tremendously expensive even with the continuously increasing investments of research and development r d the number of new drugs approved by the u s food_and fda has been declining since the late s in light of the challenge in traditional drug_discovery identifying new indications for existing_drugs also known as drug_repositioning or drug_repurposing has attracted increasing interests from both the pharmaceutical_industry and research_community drug_repositioning can speed up the process of drug_development and reduce risk as repositioning candidates have already passed all necessary tests common to de_novo drug_discovery therefore drug_repositioning has consequently become a major strategy and played_a in drug_discovery in addition several successful repositioned drugs e g sildenafil thalidomide raloxifene have generated historically high revenues for their patent holders or companies the goal of drug_repositioning is to find potential new uses for existing_drugs and apply the newly_identified drugs to the treatment of diseases other than the drugs originally intended disease recently some computational_methods have been proposed to predict direct drugdisease associations for drug_repositioning for example chiang and butte developed a network based guilt by association method to predict potential drugdisease associations this methodology recommended the novel use of a drug based on the assumption that if two diseases share some similar treatment profiles then the drugs used for only one of the two diseases could also be used for the other however the method is biased toward both older drugs with diverse uses and diseases with diverse treatments conducted multiple drugdrug and diseasedisease similarity_measures to construct discriminate features and implemented a classification algorithm named predict to predict novel drug indications constructed a weighted disease and drug heterogeneous network based on known diseasegene and drugtarget relationships and applied network clustering to identify drug_candidates proposed a novel heterogeneous network model which integrated drug_repositioning and target prediction into one unified computational framework based on the framework an iterative algorithm was developed to rank candidate_drugs for each disease developed a network based prioritization method_named drugnet which simultaneously integrated information about diseases drugs and targets to perform drugdisease and diseasedrug prioritization formulated drug disease association prediction_problem as recommending preferable diseases for drugs and adopted two existing recommendation methods probs and heats to infer drugdisease associations directly most of these approaches usually perform drugdisease prediction by exploiting drug similarity and disease similarity while similarity_measures are often based on some important drug or disease related properties however previous_studies seldom utilized the known drugdisease interaction information of dataset for defining similarity_measures and yet can be exploited to improve similarity_measures in this study we present a novel prediction method mbirw which adopts effective mechanism to measure similarity for drugs and diseases respectively and applies bi random_walk birw algorithm to predict potential indications for existing_drugs in the new similarity_measures similarity calculated based on drug or disease related properties is improved in two aspects first as previous_studies have found that weak similarity provides little information for interaction inference we adjust those weak similarities which are not informative for drugdisease prediction by correlation_analysis second two drugs are considered to be more similar if they have common indications or there exist other drugs which have common indications with them simultaneously drugs and diseases are clustered based on their shared commons and similarity for drugs or diseases which belong to the same cluster is adjusted whats more as it has been demonstrated better performance than other random_walk methods on disease_gene birw algorithm is adopted to predict potential associations between drugs and diseases in this study furthermore we compare and evaluate the performance of mbirw on various datasets by adopting common metrics experimental_results demonstrate that mbirw has the superior capability to discover potential disease indications for drugs
