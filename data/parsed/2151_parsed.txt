h vc scalable nucleotide tallies with hdf as applications of genome_sequencing including exomes and whole genomes are expanding there is a need for analysis tools that are scalable to large sets of samples and or ultra deep coverage many current tool chains are based on the widely used file_formats bam and vcf or vcf derivatives however for some desirable analyses data management with these formats creates substantial implementation overhead and much time is spent parsing files and collating data we observe that a tally data_structure i e the table of counts of nucleotides samples strands genomic positions provides a reasonable intermediate level of abstraction for many genomics analyses including single_nucleotide snv and indel calling copy_number estimation and mutation spectrum_analysis here we present h vc a data_structure and associated software for managing tallies the software contains functionality for creating tallies from bam_files flexible and scalable data visualization data quality_assessment computing statistics relevant to variant_calling and other applications through the simplicity of its api we envision making low_level analysis of large sets of genome sequencing_data accessible to a wider_range of researchers availability_and the package h vc for the statistical environment r is available through the bioconductor_project the hdf system is used as the core of our implementation there is interest in analyses of cancer genome data across large cohorts kandoth et_al but the standard file_formats are not well suited to the task the bam format li et_al provides low_level information alignments but is resource hungry especially for data from many samples at high depth on the other hand the vcf format danecek et_al provides high_level information and focuses on reporting positive variant_calls while reporting of negative calls is usually not attempted and can be expected to encounter scalability limitations however absence of evidence is not evidence of absence just considering every position that is not mentioned in a vcf file a no variant would imply a high false_negative especially in the face of subclonality and uneven coverage there is a need for an auxiliary format that is scalable compact and accessible from multiple_platforms hdf we use hdf the hdf group as the core of our implementation hdf is designed to store large arrays of numerical_data efficiently scales well with the size of the datasets supports compression and is available on many platforms in the form of libraries for different programming_languages including c c java python matlab and r our implementation relies on the rhdf bioconductor_package fischer and pau for low_level access functions to hdf files we store the mismatch tally in a dataset called counts and further quantities in the datasets coverages deletions and reference the four datasets which can be thought of as large arrays of integers are defined as follows there is interest in analyses of cancer genome data across large cohorts but the standard file_formats are not well suited to the task the bam format provides low_level information alignments but is resourcehungry especially for data from many samples at high depth on the other hand the vcf format provides high_level information and focuses on reporting positive variant_calls while reporting of negative calls is usually not attempted and can be expected to encounter scalability limitations however absence of evidence is not evidence of absence just considering every position that is not mentioned in a vcf file a no variant would imply a high false_negative especially in the face of subclonality and uneven coverage there is a need for an auxiliary format that is scalable compact and accessible from multiple_platforms tallies stored in hdf files are a feasible and useful extension of the tool set of genome analysts a concrete implementation of the tools necessary to make use of this data format is provided by the package h vc the associated documentation enables users to start using hdf based tallies immediately given the amount of genomics data that will have to be handled in the near future this technology has the potential to become a valuable_tool for genomic_research is shown in a separate panel with the genomic_position as a common x axis centered around the position of the variant along the y axis alignment statistics of the forward and reverse strand are shown as positive_and values respectively gray areas represent coverage by sequences matching the reference and colored areas represent mismatches deletions and insertions a variant is present in the tumor sample but not in the control b variant of comparable position specific statistics as a note the noisiness of the region which is not immediately obvious from the position specific values alone
