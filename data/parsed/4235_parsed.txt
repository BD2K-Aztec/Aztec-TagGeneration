gene_expression sicop identifying significant co interaction_patterns interactions between various types of molecules that regulate crucial cellular_processes are extensively investigated by high_throughput experiments and require dedicated computational_methods for the analysis of the resulting data in many cases these data can be represented as a bipartite_graph because it describes interactions between elements of two different types such as the influence of different experimental_conditions on cellular variables or the direct interaction between receptors and their activators inhibitors one of the major challenges in the analysis of such noisy datasets is the statistical_evaluation of the relationship between any two elements of the same type here we present sicop significant co interaction_patterns an implementation of a method that provides such an evaluation based on the number of their common interaction_partners their so_called co interaction this general network analytic_method proved successful in diverse fields provides a framework for assessing the significance of this relationship by comparison with the expected co interaction in a suitable null_model of the same bipartite_graph sicop takes into consideration up to two distinct types of interactions such as up or downregulation the tool is written in java and accepts several common input_formats and supports different output_formats facilitating further analysis and visualization its key features include a user_friendly interface easy installation and platform independence availability the software is open_source and available at cna cs uni kl de sicop under the terms of the gnu general public licencehigh throughput experiments resulting in interaction data require computational_methods that enable the identification of their key interaction_patterns if the interaction is observed between elements of two different types the data can be modelled as a bipartite_graph in which the elements are represented by nodes and their interaction by edges more than one type of interaction e g up and downregulation can be represented this way by the edges of the graph existing_tools for the analysis of bipartite graphs like the r packages bipartite or networksis are mainly tailored to the purpose of understanding principles in community_ecology systems_biology applications pose three important challenges that these tools cannot cope with i large_scale experiments that are often prone to noise ii mild interaction effects that are difficult to detect and iii simultaneously observed distinct types of interactions a recently suggested method deals with these problems by using a network analytic approach in this procedure the number of common interaction_partners of two elements is compared with its expected value in a randomized null_model that maintains the number of interaction_partners of all elements the approach adopts and extends the general procedure for assessing_the of the so_called network_motifs the underlying assumption is that two elements with a statistically_significant number of common interaction_partners share the same functional role according to the so_called guilt byassociation principle the method sketched inis based on the theoretical insights formulated in zweig and kaufmann and uses a more realistic null_model than other existing_approaches the open_source sicop significant co interaction_patterns implements the algorithm as an easy to use client side tool it is able to detect significant mild co interaction effects by taking_into up to two different types of interactions the algorithm was applied to the data from high_throughput experiments that show the effect of various micrornas on a set of proteins that are highly_relevant in breast_cancer micrornas have recently been recognized to act as tumour suppressors and have an oncogene role uncovering their targeting patterns is difficult because they are known to only have a moderate effect on the protein expression_level the extensive null_model approach behind sicop enabled the identification of key micrornas that were shown in subsequent_experiments to inhibit cell_cycle and proliferation this specific result confirms that the algorithm behind sicop is a powerful_tool for the detection of statistically_significant protein co regulations however as described earlier sicop can be applied to a wide_range of datasets for instance transcription_factors binding to dnas gene coding rnas interacting with co transcriptional non_coding genes in relation with diseases or diseases and their symptoms our flexible tool offers an effortless way to explore such data to its full potential considerably reducing the required amount of further experiments illustration of the method behind sicop a heatmap showing the results of a hypothetical high_throughput experiment two types of interactions are distinguished based on

often as in the original graph
