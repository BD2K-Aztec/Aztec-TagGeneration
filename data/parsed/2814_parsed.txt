mathematical_modeling of s ribosomal dna_amplification reveals optimal conditions for the interrogation of complex microbial_communities with phylogenetic microarrays motivation many current studies of complex microbial_communities rely on the isolation of community genomic_dna amplification of s ribosomal_rna rdna and subsequent examination of community_structure through interrogation of the amplified s rdna pool by high_throughput phylogenetic microarrays or quantitative_pcr results here we describe the development of a mathematical_model aimed to simulate multitemplate amplification of s ribosomal dna_sample and subsequent detection of these amplified s rdna species by phylogenetic microarray using parameters estimated from the experimental_results obtained in the analysis of intestinal microbial_communities with microbiota array we show that both species detection and the accuracy of species abundance estimates depended heavily on the number of pcr cycles used to amplify s rdna both parameters initially improved with each additional pcr cycle and reached optimum between and cycles of amplification the use of more than cycles of pcr_amplification and or more than ng of starting genomic dna_template was however detrimental to both the fraction of detected community_members and the accuracy of abundance estimates overall the outcomes of the model_simulations matched well available experimental_data our simulations also showed that species detection and the accuracy of abundance measurements correlated_positively with the higher sample wide pcr_amplification rate lower template to template pcr bias and lower number of species in the interrogated community the developed model can be easily modified to simulate other multitemplate dna mixtures as well as other microarray designs and pcr_amplification protocols owing to the development and refinement of novel dna and rna interrogation technologies there is a surge of studies in the current_literature exploring the populational structure and function to whom correspondence should be addressed of various complex microbial_communities the ability to isolate and subsequently examine total community dna and rna without any need to culture individual microbial_species and cells allows analysis of systems that would otherwise be difficult to profile and examine including microbiota of human_intestine and other epithelial surfaces and the microbes of soils and ocean waters gene coding for the small_ribosomal rna_molecule s rrna in prokaryotes and s rrna in eukaryotes has been used in the vast_majority of such studies due to its ubiquitous_presence in all organisms and because of the conservation of its nucleotide_sequence in a typical experimental_design to profile microbial_community total_genomic gdna isolated from a sample of interest is subjected to rounds of s rrna gene rdna specific amplification in polymerase_chain pcr using two universal_primers complementary to the beginning and the end of prokaryotic s rrna molecule the amplified dna is then interrogated by a detection method of choice such as dna_sequencing or microarray_analysis because on average s rrna gene constitutes only of the total_genomic see below selective s rdna amplification is crucial to increase the sensitivity of detection and to obtain good measures of bacterial presence and relative_abundance in the community samples however the optimal use of such pcr_amplification in relation to microarray and dna_sequencing detection have not been yet fully explored a number of studies have been published though examining the thermodynamic behavior of dna_molecules during dna_amplification and the biases that can be observed during many rounds of pcr_amplification because most microbial_communities consist of a large number of different microbial_species with varied s_rrna any pcr_amplification of community dna is multitemplate pcr_amplification of such gdna has been shown to introduce a deviation of the post amplification fractions from the initial ratios of dna_molecules termed pcr bias due to unequal amplification of different dna_molecules during pcr several mechanisms of this effect have been described that include i unequal denaturation of templates based on gc_content of dna_sequences ii higher binding efficiency of gc_rich variants of degenerate amplification primers to the template at the same annealing_temperature and iii competitive re annealing
