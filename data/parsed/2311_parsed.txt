databases_and identifying aberrant pathways through integrated analysis of knowledge in pharmacogenomics motivation many complex_diseases are the result of abnormal pathway functions instead of single abnormalities disease diagnosis and intervention_strategies must target these pathways while minimizing the interference with normal physiological_processes large_scale identification of disease pathways and chemicals that may be used to perturb them requires the integration of information about drugs genes diseases and pathways this information is currently distributed over several pharmacogenomics databases an integrated analysis of the information in these databases can reveal disease pathways and facilitate novel biomedical analyses results we demonstrate how to integrate pharmacogenomics databases through integration of the biomedical_ontologies that are used as meta_data in these databases the additional background_knowledge in these ontologies can then be used to enable novel analyses we identify disease pathways using a novel multi ontology enrichment_analysis over the human disease ontology and we identify significant associations between chemicals and pathways using an enrichment_analysis over a chemical ontology the drug pathway and diseasepathway associations are a valuable resource for research in disease and drug mechanisms and can be used to improve computational drug_repurposing pharmacogenomics aims to increase our understanding of the effect of genetic_variation on the response to drugs thereby leading to better health_care through a more personalized and precise approach to medical_treatment of disease to achieve_this pharmacogenomics must combine and integrate data from multiple domains including information about drug_actions gene_functions gene and protein interactions pathways gene_expression phenotypes disease and genetic_variation when this information is combined novel integrative analyses become possible that can improve our understanding of drug_actions and disease mechanisms in complex_diseases it is often not possible to identify single aberrations underlying the disease in order to provide possible to whom correspondence should be addressed diagnosis and treatments of such diseases it is important that we are able to identify aberrations in the biological_pathways related to such diseases in order to gain a better understanding of the synergistic molecular_functions of the involved gene_networks and their role in the disease network based_approaches can reveal specific aberrations in the processes that make up such biological_systems in particular aberrant pathways can provide insights into the systemic imbalance underlying a disease and can further provide targets for disease intervention to identify aberrant pathways access to information about pathway participants as well as their potential interactions with chemicals and diseases becomes important one obstacle towards such an approach lies with the distribution of information across multiple heterogeneous resources the rapid increase of data generated from genetic_analyses and functional_genomics has necessitated the development of a number of pharmacogenomics related databases that provide invaluable resources for discovering information related to the impact of gene variations to drug_responses and toxicity one prime example of such a resource is the pharmacogenomics knowledge_base pharmgkb a database in which associations between drugs genes and their variants and diseases is curated against primary scientific_literature for which there is indication of their pharmacokinetic_and pharmgkbs data have been used among many things to extract biomedical relations from text and to make pharmacogenomic predictions such as warfarin dosing international warfarin further databases that incorporate relevant pharmacogenomic knowledge include drugbank a richly annotated database of drugs and drug_targets and the comparative_toxicogenomics ctd which contains manually_curated relations between chemicals genes and diseases and integrates them in a chemicalgenedisease network to predict novel relations with the advent of the gene_ontology go ontologies are now being widely used for the annotation of data in biomedical databases including pharmacogenomics drug and disease databases such as the pharmagkb drugbank and ctd ontologies aid knowledge integration by providing a rich taxonomic structure and axioms which makes some aspects of background domain_knowledge explicit based on the generalization hierarchy available in ontologies different resources can be integrated even when exact_matches between entities in different databases cannot berelavant knowledge about pharmacogenomics is distributed across several databases each of which focuses on different aspects of this complex domain for example in the pharmgkb no extensive information about drugdisease or genedisease_associations is provided but this information is contained in other databases such as drugbank and ctd herein we used the pharmgkb ctd and drugbank to demonstrate how the combination of semantic_web technologies and formal ontological analysis can be used to integrate different resources relevant for pharmacogenomics research this integration does not only lead to significantly_improved capabilities for knowledge retrieval but also enables statistical_analyses of the data in these databases that reveal associations between pathways and diseases as well as associations between pathways and chemicals although our approach is currently limited by the depth and reliability of the data contained in the integrated databases both as a consequence of a lack of complete knowledge on biological_pathways and a lack of complete curation of literature methods of knowledge integration can provide the means to generate insights that lead to more direct biological investigation biomedical_ontologies and semantic_web technology play_a in such integration methods ontologies provide a rich taxonomic structure and axioms that can provide background_knowledge based on which knowledge from different domains can be integrated in particular ontologies allow for a generalization of concepts that is useful when exact_matches between entities in different resources are not possible and when a grouping of classes based on various features is required for example through the link to do and the classification it provides we are able to identify specific neoplasms using the additional information provided by dos classification of diseases in additional relations in ontologies can be combined with information from the pharmacogenomics databases in order to compose complex associations that cannot be found within either database alone for example the background_knowledge in do allows us to group drugs based on the anatomical_site at which they are active this information may lead to additional insights into the drugs mechanisms of action in order to use this background_knowledge it is necessary to automatically process biomedical_ontologies and extract relevant knowledge semantic_web technology in particular automated reasoning software is now capable of processing large biomedical_ontologies to process verify and query owl knowledge bases recent_progress in efficient automated reasoning in particular related to reasoning over large life_science ontologies in the owl el profile has enabled the potential to use automated reasoning in software application and scientific data analyses and our performance results of automated reasoning over the integrated pharmacogenomics databases demonstrate that it is even feasible to implement real_time query and analysis applications based on automated reasoning our approach is not limited to the domain of pharmacogenomics alone but can serve as a model for integrative analyses in other areas including model_organism databases databases of protein functions disease phenotype databases or databases of computational_models in each case it is crucial to identify relevant biomedical_ontologies based on which the content of the databases can be aligned formalize the content of the databases in such a way that it becomes possible to answer the relevant
