structural_bioinformatics cloud psi cloud_computing for d protein_structure similarity searching popular_methods for d protein_structure similarity searching especially those that generate high_quality alignments such as combinatorial extension ce and flexible structure alignment by chaining aligned fragment pairs allowing twists fatcat are still time consuming as a consequence performing similarity searching against large repositories of structural data requires increased computational_resources that are not always available cloud_computing provides huge_amounts of computational power that can be provi sioned on a pay as you go basis we have developed the cloud_based system that allows scaling of the similarity searching process vertically and horizontally cloud psi cloud for protein similarity was tested in the microsoft azure cloud environment and provided good almost linearly_proportional acceleration when scaled out onto many computational units availability_and cloud psi is available as software as a service for testing purposes at http cloud psi cloudapp net for source_code and software availability please visit the cloud psi project home page atcloud computing has emerged as a result of increased requirements for the public availability of computing_power and new technologies for data_processing it has become a mechanism that allows for the control of the development of hardware and software resources by introducing the idea of virtualization in practice cloud_computing allows the public to run applications and services on a distributed network using a virtualized system and its resources and at the same time allows to abstract away from the implementation details of the system itself apart from the natural applications of cloud_computing architecture in business the concept is also becoming increasingly popular in scientific_research including life_sciences because the theoretically infinite resources of the cloud allow computationally_intensive problems to be solved cloud based_solutions were proposed for various areas of bioinformatics including automated sequence_analysis identification of peptide_sequences from spectra in mass_spectrometry mapping next generation sequence_data to the human_genome and other reference_genomes for single_nucleotide discovery genotyping and personal_genomics d ligand_binding comparison and similarity searching of a structural proteome sequence_alignment clustering assembly display editing and phylogeny the d protein_structure similarity searching is a computationally complex and time consuming process that requires enhanced computational_resources this is the motivation behind efforts to develop new methods in the area and build scalable platforms such as the presented cloud for protein similarity cloud psi platform that allow for the completion of the task much faster by distributing computation on many machines scalability of the cloud psi was tested in the microsoft azure cloud by increasing the number of searcher roles from to horizontal scaling and by increasing the size i e computational capabilities of the searcher roles from a to a vertical scaling horizontal scaling was performed with the use of a sized searcher roles a size formerly small_size represents the cheapest computational unit providing one unshared core and is the smallest sized unit recommended for production workloads during the vertical scaling we gradually enlarged the sizes of the searcher roles from a formerly extra small with one shared central_processing cpu core to a formerly extra large eight cpu cores tests were performed on a repository containing protein_structures from the pdb package size was set to protein_structures a single comparison of a pair of protein_structures takes on average s for jce and s for jfatcat both variants the time required for computation depends on the size of the given we have shown the n fold speedup for jce and jfatcat algorithms when scaling the cloud psi system horizontally we noticed that using two instances of the searcher role increased the speed of the similarity searching by almost fold adding more searcher roles proportionally accelerated the process however when using searcher roles the dynamics of the acceleration slowed down finally the acceleration ratio n fold speedup reached the level of for jce and for jfatcat when the number of instances of the searcher roles was increased from up to in we have shown the n fold speedup when scaling the system vertically good results were obtained for searcher roles of sizes a and a a is not recommended for production environments above size a i e two computing units we noticed that the dynamics of the acceleration significantly_slowed down acceleration for eight cpu cores a size reached only for jfatcat and for jce when analyzing the results of the scalability tests we observed that both types of scaling used experienced a slowdown in the acceleration dynamics for the horizontal scaling this was caused by several factors including concurrent accesses to the vhd while retrieving protein_structures processed by particular searchers and concurrent accesses to the storage table while storing partial results of similarity_searches for the vertical scaling additional slowdown was brought about by sharing the same cpu and additional coordination of computations carried_out in parallel on the same computing unit results of the performed tests showed that horizontal scaling with the use of a roles provided better n fold speedup than vertical scaling moreover horizontal scaling was easier for deployment and more elastic the working system could be scaled automatically according to the current needs for this reason the available version of the cloud psi runs on a roles and is scaled horizontally
