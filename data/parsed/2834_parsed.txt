means python_package for moment expansion approximation inference and simulation motivation many biochemical_systems require stochastic descriptions unfortunately these can only be solved for the simplest cases and their direct simulation can become prohibitively_expensive precluding thorough analysis as an alternative moment closure approximation methods generate equations for the time evolution of the systems moments and apply a closure ansatz to obtain a closed set of differential_equations that can become the basis for the deterministic analysis of the moments of the outputs of stochastic systems results we present a free user_friendly implementing an efficient moment expansion approximation with parametric closures that integrates well with the ipython interactive environment our package enables the analysis of complex stochastic systems without any constraints on the number of species and moments studied and the type of rate laws in the system in addition to the approximation_method our package provides numerous tools to help non expert users in stochas tic analysis availability_and https github com theosysbio means contactsinherent stochasticity of elementary reactions affects many biochemical_processes analytic solutions of stochastic systems are rarely available and simulations can come with high computational costs making the study of such systems implausible numerous approximation methods have been developed recently to lighten the burden a popular_approach is to approximate the whole system by following the moments of the temporally evolving probability_distribution such as in the moment expansiongamma not available in other packages furthermore the package is complemented with an implementation of exact stochastic_simulation as well as support for different ode solvers and sensitivity analysis a parameter_estimation tool and specific functions for the visualization of results
