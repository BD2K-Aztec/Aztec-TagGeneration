structural_bioinformatics prodigy a web_server for predicting the binding_affinity of protein protein_complexes gaining insights into the structural determinants of proteinprotein_interactions holds the key for a deeper_understanding of biological_functions diseases and development of thera peutics an important aspect of this is the ability to accurately_predict the binding_strength for a given proteinprotein_complex here we present protein binding_energy prediction prodigy a web_server to predict the binding_affinity of proteinprotein_complexes from their d structure the prodigy server implements our simple but highly_effective predictive_model based on inter molecular contacts and properties derived from non interface surface biomolecular_interactions between proteins are involved in regulation and control of almost every biological_process in the cell alterations in such interactions are responsible for many diseases making proteinprotein_complexes crucial targets for therapeutics development in this scenario identifying the structural determinants of these interactions and their binding energetics is an important step for a better understanding and controlling of such systems in particular the binding_affinity or binding_free which defines whether complex formation occurs or not in specific conditions holds the key to control interactions e g engineering high_affinity interactions design new therapeutics e g guiding rational_drug or predict the impact of mutations at protein interfaces the prediction of binding_affinity has been investigated for decades yielding approaches ranging from exact methods e g free_energy which are accurate but computationally_costly to empirical approaches e g scoring_functions in docking various regression_models which are fast but less accurate several valuable web_servers have been made available to the scientific_community providing a series of different descriptors energetics structural_features etc of proteinprotein_interfaces some of these have also been tested as binding_affinity predictors there is however a lack of specific online tools for the prediction of binding_affinity recently we introduced a simple and robust descriptor of binding_affinity based only on structural_properties of a proteinprotein_complex using the proteinprotein binding_affinity benchmark in we demonstrated that the number of interfacial contacts at the interface of a proteinprotein_complex correlates with its experimental binding_affinity this information combined with properties of the non interacting surface has led to one of the best performing predictors v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com reported so_far in terms of accuracy our method showed a pearsons_correlation of between the predicted and measured binding_affinity on the benchmark p value and root_mean rmse of kcal_mol while our method_performs on average errors in particular cases may be expected for instance some natural ultrahigh affinity complexes have average or below average buried surface_area and our method may underestimate their affinity alternative physical_models of entropy solvent effects and electrostatics could be taken into consideration to address such cases although to date no such model performs better on average than our simple contact based_approach seein we have implemented our contact based method as a web_server prodigy protein binding_energy prediction a userfriendly online tool for the prediction of binding_affinity in protein protein_complexes
