bioinformatics_discovery systems_biology novel function discovery with genemania a new integrated resource for gene_function in escherichia_coli motivation the model bacterium escherichia_coli is among the best studied prokaryotes yet nearly half of its proteins are still of unknown biological_function this is despite a wealth of available large_scale physical and genetic_interaction data to address this we extended the genemania function prediction web_application developed for model eukaryotes to support e coli results we integrated distinct e coli functional interaction data_sets and used the genemania algorithm to produce thousands of novel functional_predictions and prioritize genes for further functional_assays our analysis achieved cross_validation performance comparable to that reported for eukaryotic model_organisms and revealed new functions for previously_uncharacterized genes in specific biopro cesses including components required for cell_adhesion ironsulphur complex_assembly and ribosome_biogenesis the genemania approach for network based function prediction provides an innovative new tool for probing mechanisms_underlying bacterial bioprocesses contact as the primary model_organism for microbial biology escherichia_coli has been studied for decades using countless large and smallscale biochemical assays of gene function more recently the physical proteinprotein and functional genegene or epistatic relationships between e coli genes have been extensively_studied by our group and others in the hopes of understanding the entire complement of biological_pathways in a prokaryotic organism these studies have revealed much of the physical and functional_organization of the e coli bacterial proteome however as many of the low_throughput studies were particularly concerned with specific smaller groups of genes and the larger_scale were conducted using methodologies that inherently enrich for certain physical i e transient versus more stable protein interactions or genetic_interactions defining a single pathway level map of e coli function can be problematic complicating matters further is the inherent difficulty in querying navigating and visualizing such complex biological_networks in a meaningful way as each study only identifies part of the map and is idiosyncratically biased thus despite rapid progress we are far from understanding the biological_roles and functional_relationships of the e coli genes from an integrated_systems perspective as of of this organisms genome i e k w still remains functionally unannotated methods more sensitive at interpreting existing data appear warranted underlying this disconnect between the volume of data available and the lack of annotation is a paucity of user_friendly tools for the accurate and automatic inference of a genes function while many gene_function systems based on functional interaction networks exist few are readily available for prokaryotes e g enet ecid string and none consider the breadth of evidence_supporting functional interactions available today such as phenomics and epistatic_interactions which have only recently become available here we extend the genemania resource to support e coli for gene_function we validate novel predictions supporting a role in iron fe sulphur s cluster binding cell_adhesion and ribosomal protein_degradation and biogenesis for more than half a dozen uncharacterized orphaned e coli genes an online implementation of genemania including all e coli biological to whom correspondence should be addressed networks used to generate our predictions has been made publically available www genemania org and we have also created a stand alone program and plugin for the cytoscape network_visualization environment we find that integration of these e coli datasets into a single unified network using genemania furthers our understanding of how bacterial components are connected in complexes and pathways and enables functional prediction of previously_uncharacterized or under characterized bacterial gene_products
