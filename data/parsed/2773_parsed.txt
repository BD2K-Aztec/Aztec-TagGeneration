madgic a model based_approach for identifying driver_genes in cancer motivation identifying and prioritizing somatic_mutations is an important and challenging area of cancer research that can provide new insights into gene function as well as new targets for drug_development most methods for prioritizing mutations rely primarily on frequency based criteria where a gene is identified as having a driver_mutation if it is altered in significantly more samples than expected according to a background model although useful frequency based_methods are limited in that all mutations are treated equally it is well known however that some mutations have no functional_consequence while others may have a major deleterious impact the spatial_pattern of mutations within a gene provides further insight into their functional_consequence properly accounting for these factors improves both the power and accuracy of inference also important is an accurate background model results here we develop a model based_approach for identifying driver_genes in cancer termed madgic that incorporates both frequency and functional impact criteria and accommodates a number of factors to improve the background model simulation_studies demonstrate advantages of the approach including a substantial increase in power over competing_methods further advantages are illustrated in an analysis of ovarian and lung_cancer datacancer is thought to result from the accumulation of causal somatic_mutations throughout the lifetime of an individual these cancerdriving mutations function by altering one of three broad classes of genes oncogenes which activate neoplastic activity tumor_suppressor which decrease a cells ability to inhibit abnormal cell_proliferation and stability genes which affect a cells damage repair_mechanisms a first causal mutation in one of these classes of genes or a rate_limiting combination thereof leads to tumorigenesis and subsequent causal mutational_events drive tumor_progression by providing a selective_advantage to the cancer_cells through positive_selection a major area of cancer research revolves around identifying these causal_mutations as doing so may provide new insights into gene function as well as potential targets for drug_development methods for distinguishing genes with causal_mutations driver_genes from those containing only background mutations passenger genes which are irrelevant to cancer growth are also vital in making sense of the vast_amounts of information being gathered from tumor sequencing studies such as the cancer_genome http cancergenome nih gov and the cancer genome_project http www sanger ac uk research_projects cancergenome a common approach to this problem is to identify genes that harbor significantly more somatic_mutations than expected by chance methods using this approach termed frequency based_methods rely on an estimate of a background_mutation which represents the rate of random passenger_mutations early frequencybased methods assumed a single background rate constant across the genome and common to all samples however a number of features are known to affect mutation_rate mutation_type transition versus transversion nucleotide context which base is at the mutation site dinucleotide context which bases are located at neighboring sites to the mutation replication_timing of the region and expression_level of the gene further details are provided in section in an effort to get a more accurate estimate of the background_mutation subsequent frequency based_methods have been developed that adjust for one or more of these factors account for nucleotide and dinucleotide context in searching for drivers of breast and colorectal_cancer music accounts for mutation_type and allows for sample specific mutation_rates and in addition to these factors lawrence et_al mutsigcv also allow for the inclusion of gene specific factors such as expression_level and replication_timing although useful a main limitation of methods based solely on mutation_frequency is the inherent assumption that driver_genes have relatively high_mutation this is often not the case indeed with a few notable exceptions such as tp and kras which show consistently_high mutation_rates in many cancers most driver_genes harbor surprisingly few mutations consequently additional_criteria need to be incorporated into the search beyond frequency if reliable driver gene identifications are to be made recent_developments provide at least two new sources for such information the first are methods such as sorting intolerant from tolerant sift first reported by later updated by polyphen and mutationassessor that incorporate information from sequence_context position and protein characteristics to assess a mutations functional impact recognizing the advantage of prioritizing genes by functional impact information gonzalez perez and lopez bigas exploited bias in these scores as evidence of driver activity in their method oncodrivefm to account for both frequency and function youn and simon referred to hereinafter as ys model mutation_type account for sample specific mutation_rates and incorporate blosum blocks substitution matrix alignment scores into their approach blosum alignment scores reflect empirical probabilities associated with amino_acid and ys use these scores as a measure of functional impact the idea is that if an amino_acid is rarely seen it is likely detrimental although useful power and specificity is gained by using methods such as those mentioned above that directly_assess functional impact specific to the gene and mutation of interest in addition to advances regarding our ability to assess functional impact at the single nucleotide level major advances have also been made with respect to our understanding of the spatial_pattern of mutations within driver_genes indeed recently noted that the best way to identify driver_genes is not through their mutation_frequency as has often been done in the past but rather through their spatial_patterns of mutation vogelsteins claim is based on the recognition that oncogenes are often mutated recurrently at the same amino_acid while tumor_suppressor tend to have an over abundance of truncating_mutations frameshift indels non sense mutations or mutations at the normal stop_codon these characteristic_patterns were not known just a few years_ago since they only become apparent with very large_sample for example even when looking at a dataset with close to samples such as the tcga ovarian spatial patterning of mutations is not obvious see left panel recognition of such spatial_patterns has been facilitated largely by a project to catalogue somatic_mutations in cancer the so_called cosmic catalogue of somatic_mutations in cancer project was initiated by the nih in and is ongoing with new datasets being added several times per year the database currently contains mutation information for close to one million samples in over tissue_types including data from several thousand whole exomes recent results from an integrative_analysis across multiple_cancers in cosmic identified highly characteristic and non random_patterns of mutation that were not apparent when studying cancers by type in isolation in particular results demonstrated that many known oncogenes consistently harbor mutations at relatively few specific amino_acid suggesting that oncogenic_activity does not result from random mutation s in an oncogene but rather requires a mutation in one of a few locations oncodriveclust was designed to exploit such evidence of positional clustering to identify oncogenes but like oncodrivefm does not utilize other sources of information such as frequency of mutation and functional impact non random mutational patterns are also observed in known tumor_suppressor which tend to exhibit an over abundance of protein truncating alterations the right panel ofprovides a few examples as we demonstrate accounting for these non random spatial_patterns and abundance of truncating_mutations improves both the sensitivity_and with which driver_genes may be identified in addition to these recently_characterized patterns of mutation it is well known that alteration of dna_repair such as brca or brca leads to an increased accumulation of mutations for those samples with mutations in known dna_repair any global increase in mutation_rate will be accommodated by our models sample specific background rate estimation see section in summary the most important sources of information to consider when identifying driver_genes include mutation_frequency mutation_type gene specific features such as replication_timing and expression_level that are known to affect background rates of mutation mutationspecific scores that assess functional impact and the spatial patterning of mutations that only becomes apparent when thousands of samples are considered previously_developed methods incorporate many of these features seefor an overview but not all at once in this paper we provide a unified empirical bayesian_model based_approach for identifying driver_genes in cancer madgic that utilizes each of these features the bayesian_framework provides a natural way to leverage the mutational patterns observed in cosmic as prior information and provides gene specific posterior_probabilities of driver gene activity the posterior_probabilities are informed by mutation_frequency relative to a background model that incorporates mutation_type and the gene specific features mentioned above as well as position specific functional impact scores results from a simulation_study in section suggest improved_performance over currently available methods further advantages are demonstrated in an analysis of data from the cancer_genome tcga project section madgic is an integrative model that provides posterior_probabilities for improved inference for driver gene identification the empirical bayesian_framework provides a natural way to incorporate several critical features together that were previously only considered in isolation in addition to modeling key features of the observed mutation data madgic also leverages the non random mutational patterns observed across many cancer_types in the cosmic database to inform the prior probability of driver activity until recently these spatial_patterns were only evident in well studied cancer_genes that were the focus of targeted_sequencing studies over the past_few however the cosmic database has accumulated data from thousands of whole genomes and whole exomes enabling a systematic_search over all genes the use of a database that collects mutation position data from multiple studies for each cancer type is vital as the characteristic spatial_patterns observed across thousands of cancers are not discernible when analyzing data from a single cancer in isolation the performance of madgic shows_promise both in simulations and case studies the simulation_studies suggest that madgic has favorable operating characteristics relative to existing_methods and further highlights specifically the amount of advantage gained by incorporating functional impact scores as the quality of these scores improves so too should the power of madgic in addition the simulation_study demonstrates that the operating characteristics of all approaches can vary_widely with sample_size mutation_frequency and heterogeneity in sample specific mutation_rates it also demonstrates that madgics integration of data across multiple sources facilitates the identification of putative driver_genes showing relatively few mutations a result also observed in the case studies specifically as seen in supplementary tables s and s there are several genes with only three to five samples mutated that are identified as drivers by madgic but not other approaches the fact that many of these are also on the putative driver list ofsuggests that they are not false_positives a limitation of all methods investigated stems from our assumption that the somatic_mutation calls are complete and accurate while it has been observed that properties of tumor_samples e g low allelic fraction are responsible for introducing systematic sequencing bias methods for improving the sensitivity of mutation callers have been developed as these methods continue to improve so too will results from madgic a further limitation of frequency based_methods that was noted inis the bias toward longer genes although madgic ys and mutsigcv each account for gene length the driver_genes are still enriched for longer genes in all three methods in both case studies except for mutsigcv in the lung_cancer study see supplementary section s for details however mutsigcv is more conservative than the other two methods and the bias reappears as the gene_list size increases the bias is likely a result of additional perhaps unknown_factors that affect the rate of mutation of these longer genes the fact that none of the methods are able to completely overcome this bias demonstrates that this is an ongoing challenge for frequency based_methods so_far we have only considered modeling one gene at a time thus when computing the posterior_probability that a given gene is a driver no information pertaining to any other genes is considered beyond that used to estimate the parameters in the background mutation model however a non silent mutation in any one of a group of coordinately regulated_genes e g a b and c could cause the same selective_advantage to a cancer cell in this situation evidence of driver activity of gene a would increase given non silent mutations in genes b and c in other samples a number of methods are available for identifying pathways containing driver_genes extensions of madgic to accommodate pathway structure should further improve our ability to identify drivers of cancer
