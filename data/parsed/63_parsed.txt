systems_biology a cell based simulation software for multi cellular_systems cellsys is a modular software_tool for efficient off lattice simulation of growth and organization processes in multi cellular_systems in d and d it implements an agent_based that approximates cells as isotropic elastic and adhesive objects cell_migration is modeled by an equation of motion for each cell the software includes many modules specifically tailored to support the simulation and analysis of virtual tissues including real_time d visualization and vrml support all cell and environment parameters can be independently varied which facilitates species specific simulations and allows for detailed_analyses of growth_dynamics and links between cellular and multi cellular_phenotypes availability cellsys is freely_available use at http msysbio com software cellsys the current version of cellsys permits the simulation of growing monolayer_cultures and avascular tumor_spheroids in liquid environment further functionality will be made available ongoing with published_papers based on the insight that multi cellular_systems are inherently of multi_scale nature the focus of research in systems_biology is currently shifting towards studies of whole cells or populations of cells to complement sequence_analysis gene_expression research on signal_transduction and the analysis of biochemical_systems realistic multi_cellular approaches should permit both to include models of sub cellular_processes and to simulate up to biologically or clinically_relevant population_sizes for many years this was hampered by the inherent computational_complexity however depending on the level of represented detail the steadily_increasing computational power of modern processors cpus and gpus today permits the simulation of up to several millions of cells by agent_based and refs therein provided an efficient implementation especially in three dimensions here we present an adaptable software_tool named cellsys that implements a class of lattice free agent_based permitting realistic simulations of tissue growth and organization processes of common experimental_settings in vitro as the growth_dynamics in monolayer_cultures and multi_cellular spheroids drasdo and to whom correspondence should be addressed it has further recently been used to model liver_regeneration therein the simulation_results from cellsys have been directly and quantitatively_compared to experimental_data using the same analysis methods for both cellsys can be used to predict the experiments that are most informative to identify possible mechanisms on the cell and subcell scale to explain a certain multi_cellular phenomenon it also has proved useful to guide the development of continuous models where cells are not resolved individually but are represented by locally averaged quantities comparing both model types permits identification of terms and parameters
