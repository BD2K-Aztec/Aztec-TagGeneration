gene_expression an empirical_bayes approach for analysis of diverse periodic trends in time course gene_expression data motivation there is a substantial body of works in the biology literature that seeks to characterize the cyclic behavior of genes during cell_division gene_expression made it possible to measure the expression_profiles of thousands of genes simultaneously in time course experiments to assess changes in the expression levels of genes over time in this context the commonly used procedures for testing include the permutation_test by de lichtenberg et_al and the fishers g test both of which are designed to evaluate periodicity against noise however it is possible that a gene of interest may have expression that is neither cyclic nor just noise thus there is a need for a new test for periodicity that can identify cyclic patterns against not only noise but also other non cyclic patterns such as linear quadratic or higher_order polynomial patterns results to address this weakness we have introduced an empirical_bayes approach to test for periodicity and compare its performance in terms of sensitivity_and with that of the permutation_test and fishers g test through extensive simulations and by application to a set of time course experiments on the schizosaccharomyces_pombe cell_cycle gene_expression we use conserved and cycling genes by lu et_al to assess the sensitivity and cesr genes by chen et_al to assess the specificity of our new empirical_bayes method availability_and the sas macro for our empirical_bayes test for periodicity is included in the supplementary_materials along with a sample run of the macro program there is a substantial body of works in the biology literature that seeks to characterize the cyclic behavior of genes during cell_division in cancer_cells genomic_instability can arise when cell_division becomes irregular and identifying genes that have cyclic behavior during cell_division may add to the understanding of the biological_process of these cells and open doors to targeted_therapies gene_expression microarray_technology made it possible to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and open ways to conducting time course experiments which aim at describing the change in the expression levels of genes during successive phases of cell_division of the several methods proposed for testing periodicity in time course gene_expression the two most commonly used methods are fishers g test byand the permutation_test described by both of which we briefly describe in sections and provide comparative_analysis of methods for assessing periodicity on time course gene_expression data on yeast_cells they argue that analyses based on commonly used methods might have resulted in an overestimation of the number of cyclic genes as quite a large_number were identified as periodic by these methods and the overlap among the resulting list of genes is poor this finding motivates our investigation to construct a new periodicity test that can more accurately distinguish periodicity from not only noise but also from other non periodic patterns toward this we present a new test for periodicity that uses a polynomial mode as the null_hypothesis against a pattern of expression modeled by a flexible family of periodic functions we use an empirical_bayes approach to estimate the parameters of the periodic mode we then compare the performance of our approach with that of the fishers g test and the permutation_test through extensive simulations we apply our method to publicly_available gene_expression time course experiments supplementary conducted by rustici olivia and peng on the fission_yeast schizosaccharomyces_pombe in section we describe the fishers g and the permutation_tests followed in section by an introduction to our empirical_bayes procedure for testing for periodicity and its algorithm in section we describe simulation setups to compare the three methods and present the results of these simulations in section in section we apply our method to the s pombe time course gene_expression we end in section with a conclusion and some discussions in section to whom correspondence should be addressed we have demonstrated through simulations that a goodnessof fit comparison of the bayesian periodic model and the polynomial regression_model has better sensitivity to distinguish periodic patterns from non periodic patterns when compared with the permutation_test and fishers g test this property extends to the case where there are data missing at random the property is also observed when there are deviations of the interdivision time from the true interdivision time the bayesian_approach seems to be able to distinguish periodic patterns from pure noise as well as from any linear quadratic cubic andbayesian approach while ranked within the top by the permutation_test and fishers g test shows that most of these genes are not reported being involved in the cell_division process therefore it is highly critical to have a testing procedure that has high_sensitivity in recognizing any periodic pattern as well as high_specificity in eliminating patterns or no patterns that are not periodic including noise from the final list of genes using extensive_simulation and application to cell_cycle gene_expression experiments as well as evaluating the ranks of cesr genes by each periodicity test we have shown that the bayesian test of periodicity has such desirable sensitivity_and characteristics however we feel that computational_efficiency of the empirical_bayes approach can be improved in its current form a high_level of computations is required to obtain the posterior realizations of the model_parameters and perform further calculations for example obtaining the bayesian probabilities for each gene in each cell_cycle experiment by rustici may take about hours in sas version on a ghz pc with intel core tm duo cpu and gm of ram pc however first considering the limited resources both in terms of financial and human resources a more sensitive and specific gene_list for further small_scale studies should not be sacrificed for obtaining such a list rapidly second we believe that the implementation of the bayesian test of periodicity on a different platform such as openbugs can definitely help reduce the computation time which makes such an issue less and less relevant although the main application area for the empirical_bayes periodicity test is the time course gene_expression data it can also be used for the inventory management of consumer goods describes the need of using cyclical demand signals to maximize the profit thus our testing approach for periodicity can be applied to time series demand data on a given product over a time period and identify the products among tens_of of products which have periodic consumer demand the empirical_bayes periodicity test can also be used to identify cyclical stocks which may potentially provide_valuable for investors as an example akar and baskaya use univariate spectral_analysis to identify cyclic behavior of the turkish stock market our method can also be used to test for cyclic behavior of stock markets at given inter cycle times conflict of interest none declared
