genome_analysis chromatra a galaxy tool for visualizing genome_wide chromatin signatures chromatra chromatin mapping across transcripts is a visualization_tool available as plug in for the galaxy platform it allows detailed yet concise presentations of data derived from chip_chip or chip_seq by visualizing enrichment_scores across genes or other genomic_features while accounting for their length and additional characteristics such as gene_expression it integrates into typical analysis workflows and enables rapid graphical assessment and comparison of genome_wide data at a glance availability https the pace of advancements in dna_microarray and sequencing_technology continues to transform biological_research both techniques complement each other and provide powerful platforms to interrogate entire genomes at high_resolution ranging from sequence decoding to gene_expression to chromatin_modification mapping it is in large part due to these technologies that data are becoming available to scientists and allow questions to be asked of unprecedented depth at the same time however the increasingly large_volume and complexity of datasets demands adequate computational_methods to analyze and present the data effectively while raw numbers may contain all relevant_information of an analysis they are not always necessarily suitable to convey biological meaning efficiently especially when presenting data in scientific_publications graphic visualizations of data can aid in representing complex content and reveal salient information at a glance yet satisfying this claim is particularly challenging for genome_wide data for instance when mapping chromatin_modifications or transcription_factors using chip_chip or chip_seq it is a major_goal to assess their localization and distribution across all genes of an organism while preserving structural and functional features of their respective genome current approaches for visualizing binding or modification profiles can be broadly distinguished into two categories first tools to whom correspondence should be addressed of single gene resolution like the genome_browser offer the most detailed level of data presentation but make it difficult to evaluate profiles across genes and derive broader principles as they disperse the information over multiple plots to cover the genome second averaging approaches try to circumvent this problem by grouping genes into classes e g based on length gene_ontology or transcription_rate and calculating average profiles for each class while they succeed in condensing the mosaic representation of single gene visualizations they inevitably sacrifice detail dependent on the applied grouping given the heterogeneity of genes with respect to their length and other features here we present chromatra chromatin mapping across transcripts a visualization_tool for genome_wide dna protein binding and chromatin_modification maps that balances detail and compactness of the existing visualization approaches developed as a plug in for the galaxy analysis environment chromatra portrays enrichment profiles in a comprehensive yet condensed form by accounting for feature length and additional characteristics such as gene_expression chromatra plots reveal the spatial distribution of chromatin_marks or binding_events across all genomic_features of interest and may aid in discovering unexpected correlations and patterns in enrichment profiles
