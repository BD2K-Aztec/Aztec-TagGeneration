memcover integrated analysis of mutual_exclusivity and functional network reveals dysregulated pathways across multiple_cancer motivation the data gathered by the pan cancer initiative has created an unprecedented opportunity for illuminating common features across different cancer_types however separating tissue_specific features from across cancer signatures has proven to be challenging one of the often observed properties of the mutational_landscape of cancer is the mutual_exclusivity of cancer driving mutations even though studies based on individual cancer_types suggested that mutually_exclusive pairs often share the same functional pathway the relationship between across cancer mutual_exclusivity and functional_connectivity has not been previously investigated results we introduce a classification of mutual_exclusivity into three basic classes within tissue type exclusivity across tissue type exclusivity and between tissue type exclusivity we then combined across cancer mutual_exclusivity with interactions data to uncover pan cancer dysregulated pathways our new method mutual_exclusivity module cover memcover not only identified previously known pan cancer dysregulated subnetworks but also novel subnetworks whose across cancer role has not been appreciated well before in addition we demonstrate the existence of mutual_exclusivity hubs putatively corresponding to cancer drivers with strong growth advantages finally we show that while mutually_exclusive pairs within or across cancer_types are predominantly functionally interacting the pairs in between cancer mutual_exclusivity class are more often disconnected in functional_networks the pan cancer initiative surveyed genetic and epigenetic aberrations in cancer samples from thousands of cancer patients over cancer_types this data opened the door to a systematic_examination of the similarities and differences among multiple_cancer however integrative_analysis for subtype classifications from five omics platforms revealed that cell oforigin features dominate the molecular taxonomy of diverse tumor_types rather than discovering common features across tissue_types although such an outcome may be partly due to the tissue_specificity of some cancer_driver and pathways it can also be attributed to the lack of power to untangle mixed signals of cell_type and cancer specific features despite these strong tissue_specific signals it has also become evident that many mutated genes and even whole dysregulated subnetworks are shared by multiple_cancer pathway centric methods have emerged as a key approach to empower studies of complex_diseases with heterogeneous signals by focusing on the genetic activities on the level of biological_pathways subnetworks rather than individual genes several computational_methods have been developed to utilize genotypic data for the identification of mutated subnetworks b and stratification of cancer_subtypes one of the often observed properties of the mutational_landscape of cancer is the mutual_exclusivity of cancer driving mutations mutually_exclusive mutations observed among genes in the same functional pathway prompted the development of computational_methods that utilize mutual_exclusivity in the context of identifying pathways dysregulated in cancer as well as for the pathway independent identification of mutually_exclusive cancer drivers however the sets of mutually_exclusive drivers previously_obtained in pan cancer analysis predominantly contain tissue type specific genes and do not necessarily share_common pathways indicating that the previous definition of mutual_exclusivity is not sufficient in pan cancer analysis and it is necessary to recognize different mutual_exclusivity classes to this end we started by classifying mutual_exclusivity patterns into three basic classes within tissue type exclusivity mutual_exclusivity observed only in one cancer type across tissue type exclusivity mutual_exclusivity common to several tissue_types and between tissue type exclusivity mutual_exclusivity between putative tissue_specific drivers we developed statistical_tests that allow us to identify the membership of gene_sets to these mutual_exclusivity classes we then aimed to use the principle of mutual_exclusivity for identification of subnetworks dysregulated across multiple_cancer to identify pan cancer dysregulated modules we utilized the across cancer mutual_exclusivity measure jointly with the interaction data from a network interestingly we found that functionally interacting gene_pairs are more likely to be involved in across tissue type mutual_exclusivity while between type exclusivity is more often observed in gene_pairs that are not functionally_related adapting the module cover approach we uncovered subnetworks that are dysregualted in multiple_cancer module cover is an extension of the classical multi set cover approach utilized before to find disease marker_genes for highly_heterogeneous genomic_data to a network setting this is an optimization_technique that is particularly suitable in the context of heterogonous data the approach essentially aims to identify a set of dysregulated subnetworks so that a desired subnetwork score is optimized while at the same time ensuring that altered genes from different cancer samples are present in the union of the selected subnetworks our proposed algorithm mutual_exclusivity module cover memcover uses the module cover strategy to combine mutual_exclusivity feature with functional interactions and genomic aberration data from individual pan cancer cases to uncover pan cancer dysregulated subnetworks unlike previous_approaches for finding a set of genetic_aberrations exclusive between all pairs memcover does not necessarily seek to identify subnetworks with complete exclusivity among the genes b but utilizes pairwise mutual_exclusivity to complement interaction data for a better identification of subnetworks dysregulated in pan cancer samples when applied to pan cancer data memcover identified a large number of subnetworks dysregulated across many cancer_types we found that many of the identified subnetworks are linked to cancerrelated pathways overlapping with all but one subnetwork with at least coverage recently identified by hotnet in pan caner analyses despite the fact that memcover is based on completely different principle from hotnet we also identified subnetworks whose role across cancer_types has not been appreciated previously finally our analysis also suggests the existence of mutual_exclusivity hubsgenes whose genetic_aberrations are mutually_exclusive with aberrations in a large number of other genes both connected and not connected in the network indicating that these mutual_exclusivity hubs may correspond to cancer_driver that have particularly strong growth advantages
