genome_analysis meme chip motif analysis of large dna datasets motivation advances in high_throughput have resulted in rapid_growth in large high_quality datasets including those arising from transcription_factor tf chip_seq while there are many existing_tools for discovering tf_binding motifs in such datasets most web_based tools cannot directly process such large_datasets results the meme chip web_service is designed to analyze chip_seq peak regionsshort genomic regions_surrounding declared chip_seq given a set of genomic_regions it performs i ab_initio motif_discovery ii motif enrichment_analysis iii motif visualization iv binding_affinity analysis and v motif identification it runs two complementary motif_discovery on the input datameme and dremeand uses the motifs they discover in subsequent visualization binding_affinity and identification steps meme chip also performs motif enrichment_analysis using the ame algorithm which can detect very low levels of enrichment of binding_sites for tfs with known dna_binding importantly unlike with the meme web_service there is no restriction on the size or number of uploaded sequences allowing very large chip_seq to be analyzed the analyses performed by meme chip provide the user with a varied view of the binding and regulatory activity of the chip ed tf as well as the possible involvement of other dna_binding tfs the genomic_regions identified as bound by a transcription_factor tf in a chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip_seq experiment are a rich source of information about transcriptional_regulation these regions are defined by mapping the sequence_tags to the genome which identifies peaks of direct_or binding by the chip ed factor typically to a resolution of about bp this high_resolution is of obvious utility for identifying which genes a tf regulates but the genomic regions_surrounding the peaks are typically highly_enriched for binding_sites of the chip ed tf and other tfs hence these regions can be mined to whom correspondence should be addressed computationally to understand the roles interactions and functions of the chip ed tf and its regulatory partners we describe here a web_service called meme chip that automatically performs five types of analysis on chip_seq regions i ab_initio motif_discovery identifies novel sequence_patterns motifs in the chip_seq regions that may be due to tf_binding ii motif enrichment_analysis looks for enrichment of known tf dna_binding in the data iii motif visualization displays the relative locations and binding strengths of tf_binding in the input regions iv motif binding_strength analysis computes an estimate of the total dna binding_affinity of each input region for the tf corresponding to each discovered motif v motif identification compares the ab_initio motifs to known tf dnabinding motifs the output of meme chip is thus a multifaceted view of the identities prevalence dna binding_patterns and potential interactions of the chip ed tf and its regulatory partners ab_initio motifs discovered in chip_seq give an unbiased view of the in vivo dna_binding propensities of tfs binding alone or in protein_complexes meme chip employs two motif_discovery with complementary characteristics the meme algorithm uses expectation_maximization em to discover probabilistic_models of dna_binding by single tfs or tf complexes meme motifs can provide accurate thermodynamic models of tf_binding meme is complemented by dreme which uses a simpler non probabilistic_model regular expressions to describe the short binding_motifs characteristic of single eukaryotic tfs dreme is often able to detect very short motifs that are not found by meme meme chip also attempts to identify the motifs found by meme and dreme by comparing them to a database of known tf motifs using the tomtom algorithm motif_discovery thus identifies novel binding_motifs and tfs that are regulatory partners of the chip ed tf motif enrichment_analysis can identify additional regulatory_motifs whose enrichment in the chip_seq regions is too slight to be detected by ab_initio motif_discovery it achieves higher sensitivity by limiting the search for motifs to a set of previously known tf dna_binding meme chip uses the ame algorithm for motif enrichment_analysis for motif visualization and binding_strength analysis memechip utilizes the mast and ama algorithms respectively mast uses a threshold based_approach to identify a putative set of nonoverlapping binding_sites in the chip_seq regions for all the motifs discovered by meme or dreme this allows associations among the locations of the different motifs tf_binding to be seen by eye the ama algorithm computes a thermodynamic estimate of the average binding_affinity of the tf as described by the motif for the each chip_seq sequence region
