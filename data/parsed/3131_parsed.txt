mt hess an efficient bayesian_approach for simultaneous association detection in omics_datasets with application to eqtl_mapping in multiple tissues downloaded from motivation analysing the joint association between a large set of responses and predictors is a fundamental statistical task in integrative genomics exemplified by numerous expression_quantitative eqtl studies of particular interest are the so_called hotspots important genetic_variants that regulate the expression of many genes recently attention has focussed on whether eqtls are common to several tissues cell_types or more generally conditions or whether they are specific to a particular condition results we have implemented mt hess a bayesian_hierarchical that analyses the association between a large set of predictors e g snps and many responses e g gene_expression in multiple tissues cells or conditions our bayesian sparse regression algorithm goes beyond one at a time association tests between snps and responses and uses a fully multivariate_model search across all linear_combinations of snps coupled with a model of the correlation between condition tissue_specific responses in addition we use a hierarchical_structure to leverage shared_information across different genes thus improving the detection of hotspots we show the increase of power resulting from our new approach in an extensive simulation_study our analysis of two case studies highlights new hotspots that would remain_undetected by standard_approaches and shows how greater prediction power can be achieved when several tissues are jointly considered availability_and c source_code including compilation instructions are available under gnu licence atintegrating different layers of genomic_information is essential to improve our understanding of the genetic_basis of complex_diseases the development of integrative_analysis strategies has become an important part of experimental_design in the era of next generation genomics a fundamental task faced by many integrative strategies in genomics is to study the associations between two high_dimensional the study of such associations and the related biological_questions can be naturally built within a regression_framework which exploits prior_biological on the direction of the relationships between the different layers of genomics data one prime example is expression_quantitative eqtl_analysis which links dna_polymorphisms to gene_expression levels on a genome_wide basis typically such analyses would involve testing for association of all transcript snp_pairs when eqtl studies involve large_numbers of variants and genes performing millions of such tests can become slow and it has been necessary to develop fast implementations to go beyond such one at atime strategies eqtl_mapping can be performed using high_dimensional regression_models with expression measurements modelled as responses and genetic_variants as predictors the high_dimensional regression_framework leverages information across the set of responses that are related to the same predictor increasing the probability of detecting hotspots i e genomic_loci that regulate several genes at once there is currently much interest in dissecting tissue cell_type or condition specificity of eqtls the multiple tissues or cell_types add an extra dimension to the data for instance analysis of eqtls across multiple tissues or cell_types can inform to which extent eqtls are shared or conserved between different systems therefore elucidating fundamental genetic regulatory_mechanisms so_far these questions have been addressed using one of two alternative_approaches the first uses separate analysis for each tissue and intersects the resulting lists of genetic_variants the second approach_combines tissues but performs a separate analysis for each predictor genetic_variant and response gene expression_level neither approach fully exploits the data available nor both can result in a loss of power to detect small effect eqtls that are shared across conditions to the best of our knowledge there is currently no alternative method that goes beyond one at a time association tests and models simultaneously the expression of multiple genes under multiple conditions in a multivariate way in this article we propose a generic bayesian_variable approach and an associated evolutionary stochastic_search algorithm to tackle the challenging integrative task of linking parallel high_dimensional multivariate regressions in a computationally_efficient way the specificity of our approach is i to move away from single_feature at a time analysis and account for the correlated nature of the predictors by implementing a fully multivariate_model search over the space of predictors ii to allow the analysis of multidimensional responses and iii to exploit the relatedness of multiple responses through a bayesian_hierarchical hierarchical modelling of expression responses allows us to exploit the potential functional_relationships e g co regulation relationship mrnamrna interactions proteinprotein_interactions etc between multiple genes thus increasing the power to detect hotspots we build on our previous work demonstrate the power of our new efficient hierarchical implementation in an extensive simulation_study when compared with manova or the intersection of condition tissue_specific results we also illustrate the benefits of our approach in two case studies related to eqtls in multiple conditions tissues or cell_types where we recapitulate previously validated hotspots and uncover new hotspots in one case study we also show that when several tissues are jointly considered the prediction_error is substantially_reduced compared with separate single tissue analysis even though our case studies relate to eqtl analyses the model and algorithm that we present are generic and can be used for a large range of integrative genomics analyses that can be formulated within a parallel regression_framework such as finding targets for mirnas by regressing gene_expression levels on mirna_levels linking dna variation and metabolites levels the so_called mqtl analyses or linking copy_number and tumour gene_expression the availability of data collected over multiple tissues or conditions is becoming increasingly common given the decreasing cost of generating transcriptomic metabolic and epigenetic phenotypes over large cohorts of individuals in this article we present a new model that exploits the multidimensional nature of these data and extends st hess presented in our new hierarchical_model and c algorithm mt hess is able to analyse a large number of responses collected over dependent multiple tissues or conditions and regress them on a large set of correlated predictors similar to its parent version mt hess retains the ability to perform hotspot discovery inomics experiments to the best of our knowledge mt hess is the first tool able to unravel whether a genetic_marker has a systemic role and influences several omics traits in multiple related conditions at the same time this is demonstrated in the complex multiple tissue scenario of our real rat data analysis the increased power of mt hess allowed the detection of both experimentally_validated and previously undiscovered putative hotspots for the idin network across left_ventricle aorta and liver_tissues prediction_error analysis_confirms the importance of the new detected hotspots modeladequacy measure shows the superiority of mt hess model over st hess and the benefit of the integrated analysis while in the rats dataset it is possible to perform a leave_one crossvalidation approach in larger datasets out of sample prediction_error can be performed by taking a random split of the data for instance and reserving the remaining data for calculating the average prediction_error due to a lack of competing algorithms that can analyse multiple_layers of correlated responses in a fully multivariate fashion we have compared mt hess with a manova test which is extensively used when multiple outcomes are present recall that such manova test is performed for each pair of snp response vector at a time where the vector of responses correspond to the expression in multiple tissues or conditions we see that mt hess outperforms manova demonstrating that our hierarchical modelling approach is more powerful than pairwise methods when faced with an eqtl_analysis task which involves multiple tissues a natural alternative to manova test is to compare results from the intersection of single tissue model ist hess with those from the multiple tissue one mt hsss our extensive simulation_study show that when there is a similar pattern of association but varying levels of signal_to across tissues mt hess clearly outperforms ist hess this is well in keeping with the construction of the model underlying mt hess which performs a statistically sound evidence synthesis for detecting hotspots between the set of conditions or tissues when signal_to is constant across conditions tissues mt hess results become closer to those of ist hess pointing to the benefit of adjusting for external sources of correlated noise prior to mt hess analysis for example by using a latent_factor approach as in in our simulation_study we show a substantial gain of power of mt hess when the association in each tissue were too weak to be detected by st hess a situation also illustrated in our first case study where two new hotspots were highlighted by mt hess whereas they were not detected in the single tissue analyses here the st hess signal is relatively noisy and the ability of mt hess to borrow and synthesize information between different layers of the responses results in higher power for mt hess our new c implementation of the complex hierarchical_structure in mt hess comprising st hess as a special_case permits efficient analysis of very large_datasets it made feasible an mt hess analysis of our human dataset where a multivariate_analysis and variable_selection between responses in three cell_types and nearly snps was carried_out the putative novel trans master_regulator situated near a long intergenic non coding linc rna ensembl transcript enst see section is a good example of the power of our approach for generating hypotheses which can be validated by follow_up experiments the clear separation between noise and signal offered by our sparse regression_approach is paramount for successfully prioritizing such further validation in conclusion our new algorithm mt hess with its efficient c architecture is tailored to jointly analyse realistic case studies that comprise a large number of responses collected over dependent multiple tissues or conditions and a large set of potentially collinear predictors
