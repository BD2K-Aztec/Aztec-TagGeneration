structural_bioinformatics allosite a method for predicting allosteric_sites motivation the use of allosteric modulators as preferred therapeutic_agents against classic orthosteric ligands has colossal advantages including higher specificity fewer side_effects and lower toxicity therefore the computational_prediction of allosteric_sites in proteins is receiving increased attention in the field of drug_discovery allosite is a newly_developed automatic tool for the prediction of allosteric_sites in proteins of interest and is now available through a web_server availability the allosite server and tutorials are freely_available atallostery is a fundamental_process that regulates a proteins functional activity by means of changes in the conformation and dynamics induced by the action of an effector at a site distinct from the active_site also termed as the allosteric site from the perspective of drug_discovery because allosteric_sites evolved under lower sequence_conservation pressure compared with the evolutionarily_conserved active_sites targeting allosteric_sites can provide unprecedented advantages in terms of higher specificity fewer side_effects and lower toxicity therefore identification of allosteric_sites in proteins of interest is a prerequisite for the development of allosteric drugs with a wide_range of chemotypes thus far several methods have been tried to detect allosteric_sites in proteins including the geometry based generic predictor binding leverage and normal_mode owing to the limited size of the datasets in these studies as well as the lack of knowledge about common characteristics of allosteric_sites such methods often suffer from an overly specialized range of applications and therefore it is imperative to develop novel and general methods to precisely locate allosteric_sites in proteins currently a vast_array of known allosteric_sites has been discovered by high_throughput followed by x_ray phage_display and tethering yet most of these discoveries are serendipitous this reliance on serendipity can be ascribed to the pronounced deficiency of understanding of the structural_characteristics of allosteric_sites with our continuous endeavors invested in recruiting the allosteric proteins and allosteric_sites deposited in the allosteric database asd together with recent preliminary understanding of the characteristics of allosteric proteins and modulators we hope to lay the foundation for exploiting a high_efficiency model to detect allosteric_sites in this study we present for the first time a web_service allosite which uses elegant algorithms such as pocket based analysis and support_vector svm classifier to predict the location of allosteric_sites in proteins allosites model uses a rigorous selection of high_quality datasets for training and exhibits a high_accuracy of on the test_set more importantly the prediction of novel allosteric_sites for several proteins using allosite was experimentally supported by mutagenesis thus the prediction capability and the user_friendly interface of this web_server can be of great benefit to biologists and medicinal chemists by serving as a starting_point for identifying the location of allosteric_sites and following allosteric drug_design we have extensively tested our algorithm and the results are summarized in the supplementary the accuracies of the fold_cross for the three training_sets are all using the models derived from training data the prediction_accuracies on test_sets are all and both the sensitivities_and are indicating the satisfactory prediction capability of our model in the finding of allosteric_sites to further validate the reliability of the allosite server in practice additional allosteric proteins with unknown allosteric_sites were collected from asd supplementary to whom correspondence should be addressed the allosite web_server conveniently provides a user_friendly interface to predict the allosteric_sites of a protein_structure of interest furthermore critical properties that are pertinent to characterize the allosteric site are offered to the best of our knowledge this web_server is the first of its kind and will be of considerable value to scientists interested in allosteric drug_design
