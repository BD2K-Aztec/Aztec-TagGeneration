gene_expression medip_hmm genome_wide identification of distinct dna_methylation states from high_density tiling arrays motivation methylation of cytosines in dna is an important epigen etic mechanism involved in transcriptional_regulation and preservation of genome_integrity in a wide_range of eukaryotes immunoprecipita tion of methylated_dna followed by hybridization to genomic tiling arrays medip chip is a cost_effective and sensitive method for methylome analyses however existing bioinformatics_methods only enable a binary_classification into unmethylated and methylated gen_omic regions which limit biological interpretations indeed dna methylation_levels can vary substantially within a given dna_fragment depending on the number and degree of methylated_cytosines therefore a method for the identification of more than two methylation states is highly_desirable results here we present a three state hidden_markov medip_hmm for analyzing medip chip data medip_hmm uses a higher_order state_transition process improving modeling of spatial dependencies between chromosomal_regions allows a simultaneous analysis of replicates and enables a differentiation between unmethy lated methylated and highly methylated genomic_regions we train medip_hmm using a bayesian baumwelch algorithm integrating prior_knowledge on methylation_levels we apply medip_hmm to the analysis of the arabidopsis root methylome and systematically investigate the benefit of using higher_order hmms moreover we also perform an in depth comparison study with existing_methods and demonstrate the value of using medip_hmm by comparisons to current knowledge on the arabidopsis methylome we find that medip_hmm is a fast and precise method for the analysis of methylome data enabling the identification of distinct dna methylation_levels finally we provide evidence for the general applicability of medip_hmm by analyzing promoter dna_methylation data obtained for chicken methylation of genomic_dna is one of the best characterized epigenetic_modifications catalyzed by dna_methyltransferases that methylate cytosines at their carbon position in mammals dna_methylation is found exclusively in the cpg_dinucleotide context except in embryonic_stem where a small proportion of cytosines in other contexts cpa cpt and cpc are also methylated in plants dna_methylation is found in symmetric cpg and cphpg and in asymmetric cphph contexts h a t or c generally dna_methylation plays_important regulation of gene_expression and silencing of transposons despite recent_developments of next_generation approaches for determining methylomes at single_base e g methylomes of different organisms or cell tissues are also frequently analyzed using whole_genome tiling arrays e g which provide cost effective_alternatives most array based studies are done based on methylated_dna immunoprecipitation coupled with hybridization to a tiling_array medip chip medip chip enables to analyze the methylome of a genome at a resolution of few hundred base_pairs which in most applications is sufficient to draw biologically_meaningful conclusions the analysis of medip chip data puts similar challenges on bioinformatics_methods as identified for the analysis of closely_related array based chromatin_immunoprecipitation data chip_chip different methods for the analysis of chip_chip data were proposed over the last years especially methods based on hidden_markov hmms e g and on mixture_models e g were shown to enable reliable predictions of chromosomal target_regions of transcription_factors or histone_modifications a common characteristic of all these methods is the modeling of two different populations of measurements to differentiate non enriched genomic_regions from enriched ones main conceptual differences exist in the to whom correspondence should be addressed way of modeling dependencies between adjacent measurements on a chromosome in handling of replicates and in training algorithms from these methods only approaches based on hmms integrate dependencies between directly adjacent measurements on a chromosome some methods only enable a separate analysis of replicates e g whereas others try to improve the analysis by simultaneous modeling of replicates e g mixture_models are typically trained by specifically_designed expectation_maximization em algorithms hmm based_methods except tilemaphmm and hmms byuse a baumwelch training representing a special_case of an em_algorithm tilemaphmm is based on data dependent ad_hoc settings and hmms byenable the integration of prior_knowledge on measurements using a bayesian baumwelch algorithm all these methods are useful tools for the analysis of chip_chip data additionally some methods like chipmix and a mixture_model approach byhave already been applied to the analysis of medip chip data one general limitation of all these methods in the context of medip chip data analyses is that they only enable a binary_classification into unmethylated and methylated regions medip chip data is known to be more complex showing differences in methylation_levels of individual chromosomal_regions as for example revealed for arabidopsis_thaliana having moderately methylated genes and highly methylated transposons to address that a three state hmm specifically_designed for the analysis of arabidopsis medip chip data has been developed in a companion work by this approach uses arabidopsis specific ad_hoc settings and enabled a better interpretation of medip chip data using a classification of methylation states of genomic_regions according to the underlying three states generally organism specific ad_hoc settings can only be hardly transferred to medip chip data of other organisms thus there is still a great demand of having a general method that is able to differentiate between different methylation_levels without being dependent on a specific organism moreover a systematic performance evaluation of different methods for analyzing dna_methylation data has not been carried_out up to now and current hmm based_methods only focus on standard first order hmms here we present medip_hmm a method specifically_designed for the analysis of medip chip data medip_hmm utilizes three states to differentiate between unmethylated methylated and highly methylated regions overcoming limitations of typically used chip_chip methods only enabling a binary_classification into unmethylated and methylated regions additionally medip_hmm can perform a simultaneous analysis of replicates and integrates prior_knowledge on measurements to improve the identification of methylated genomic_regions moreover medip_hmm can also take advantage of higher_order hidden markov_chains to improve spatial modeling of dependencies between neighboring regions this has recently been found to improve the analysis of comparative_genomics data and provides a valuable option for improving the analysis of medip chip data we apply our medip_hmm to the analysis of the arabidopsis root methylome and systematically evaluate the influence of using higher_order markov_chains on the identification of methylated genomic_regions we further perform an in depth comparison study to widely used existing_methods and demonstrate advantages of using medip hmm_based on comparisons to current knowledge on the arabidopsis methylome we also show that medip_hmm can be applied to non arabidopsis data by performing an additional study on promoter dna_methylation data obtained for chicken
