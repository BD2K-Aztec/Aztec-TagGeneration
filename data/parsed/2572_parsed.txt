irspot el identify recombination spots with an ensemble learning approach_motivation coexisting in a dna system meiosis and recombination are two indispensible aspects for cell reproduction and growth with the avalanche of genome_sequences emerging in the post genomic age it is an urgent challenge to acquire the information of dna_recombination spots because it can timely provide very useful insights into the mechanism of meiotic_recombination and the process of genome_evolution results to address such a challenge we have developed a predictor called irspot el by fusing different modes of pseknc pseudo k tuple nucleotide_composition and mode of dacc dinucleo tide based auto cross covariance into an ensemble classifier of clustering approach fold cross tests on a widely used benchmark_dataset have indicated that the new predictor remarkably outper forms its existing counterparts particularly far beyond their reach the new predictor can be easily used to conduct the genome_wide analysis and the results obtained are quite consistent with the experimental map availability for the convenience of most experimental scientists a user_friendly web_server for ir spot el has been established at http bioinformatics hitsz edu cn irspot el by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved recombination plays an important role in genetic evolution which describes the exchange of genetic_information during the period of each generation in diploid organisms recombination provides many new combinations of genetic_variations and is an important source for biodiversity which can accelerate the procedure of biological evolution knowledge of recombination spots may also provide very useful information for in depth understanding the reproduction and growth of cells therefore it is highly demanded to develop computational_methods for predicting the recombination spots actually many efforts have been made in this regard for instance based on the gapped dinucleotide composition features developed a predictor called rf dymhc to do the job using the kmer approach and the increment of diversity combined with quadratic_discriminant developed the idqd predictor for the same purpose in the above two predictors however only the local dna sequence_information was utilized and hence their prediction quality may be limited to improve this situation recently two new predictors irspot psednc and irspot tncpseaac were developed the former was based on the dna local structural_properties and pseudo dinucleotide composition while the latter based on the dna trinucleotide composition as well as the corresponding pseudo amino_acid components each of the aforementioned methods has its own advantage and did play a role in stimulating the development of this important area meanwhile they also have some disadvantages as reflected by the following facts although powerful predictors have been proposed there is no efficient approach to combine them to further improve the predictive_performance none of these methods allows users to set the desired parameters for prediction and hence it is difficult for them to optimize the predictor system according to the need of their focus except the rf dymhc all the other predictors cannot be directly used for genome_wide analysis even for the rf dymhc predictor its approach is not accurate because the window_size therein is arbitrary the current study was initiated in an attempt to address these shortcomings by developing a more powerful predictor for identifying dna_recombination spots the proposed predictor is called irspot el where i stands for identify rspot for recombination spot and el for ensemble learning to develop a new predictor usually consists of two purposes one is to stimulate theoretical_studies in the relevant areas and the other is to make experimental scientists easier to get their desired information to realize these the rest of this article is presented according to the following five guidelines benchmark_dataset sample representation operation algorithm validation and web_server the irspot el predictor is a new bioinformatics tool for predicting dna_recombination spots compared with the existing state of the art predictors in this area the new predictor yielded remarkably better prediction quality as demonstrated by rigorous cross_validation and genome_wide analysis we anticipate that the web_server of irspot el will become a very useful high_throughput tool for conducting genome_analysis
