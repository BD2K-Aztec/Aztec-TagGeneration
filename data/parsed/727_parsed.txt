bidifuse a fiji plugin for fusing bi directionally recorded microscopic image vol umes deep tissue imaging is increasingly used for non destructive interrogation of intact organs and small model_organisms an intuitive approach to increase the imaging depth by almost a factor of is to record a sample from two sides and fuse both image_stacks however imperfect three_dimensional alignment of both stacks presents a computational challenge we have developed a fiji plugin called bidifuse which merges bi directionally recorded image_stacks via d rigid transformations the method is broadly_applicable considering its compatibility with all optical_sectioning microscopes and does not rely on fiducial_markers for image_registration increasing interest in microscopic visualization of intact biological_specimens has fueled a surge of methodological_developments in recent_years including tissue clearing and optical_sectioning microscopy parallel to the continuous improvements of tissue clearing methods aimed at increasing optical penetration_depth the evolution of optical_sectioning techniques such as confocal two photon and in particular light_sheet have enabled rapid non destructive imaging of thick tissue_specimen despite the tremendous impact these methods have had in extending imaging depth various constraints still exist including the limited working distance of microscope objectives the variable clearing performance between different tissue_types and the inevitable loss of signal_quality in deeper tissue_layers a simple method to increase the imaging depth is to record the sample from opposite sides as this action involves flipping and relocation of the sample a method is required to computationally fuse both image_stacks and generate a single stack with comparable image_quality at the top and bottom we present a method called bidifuse which is based on d rigid transformations to register corresponding landmark points in both image_stacks this is the first open_source implementation that is compatible with all fluorescent_labels and is independent of the optical_sectioning method used for image_acquisition
