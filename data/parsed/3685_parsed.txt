sequence_analysis prediction of transporter targets using efficient rbf networks with pssm profiles and biochemical_properties transporters are proteins that are involved in the movement of ions or molecules across biological_membranes currently our knowledge about the functions of transporters is limited due to the paucity of their d structures hence computational_techniques are necessary to annotate the functions of transporters in this work we focused on an important functional aspect of transporters namely annotation of targets for transport proteins we have systematically_analyzed four major classes of transporters with different transporter targets i electron ii protein mrna iii ion and iv others using amino_acid we have developed a radial_basis network based method for predicting transport targets with amino_acid and position_specific profiles our method showed a fold_cross accuracy of and for electron transporters protein mrna transporters ion transporters and others respectively in a dataset of transporters we have also evaluated the performance of the method with an independent dataset of proteins and we obtained similar accuracy we suggest that our method could be an effective tool for functional_annotation of transport proteins membrane_proteins play_a in living_organisms such as transport of ions and molecules across membranes binding to small_molecules within extracellular_space recognition processes in immune system energy transduction and so on transporters are one of the major classes of membrane_proteins spanning cell_membranes and forming an intricate system of pumps and channels they are different in their membrane topologies energy coupling mechanisms and the specifics of their substrates transporters are generally classified into channels pores electrochemical and active transporters group to whom correspondence should be addressed translocators electron carriers as well as factors involved in transport_systems the transport primarily involves ions proteins mrna and electrons the classification of transporters based on different families as well as their targets remains an important problem for the advancement of structural and functional_genomics recently few methods have been proposed for discriminating transport proteins based on their functions gromiha andanalyzed the amino_acid of transporters and developed a neural_network based method for classifying them into channels pores electrochemical and active transporters utilized nearest_neighbor and hidden_markov methods which integrate sequence similarity_search and topological_analysis into a machine_learning framework for categorizing transporters in our previous work we have systematically_analyzed the amino_acid residue pair preference and amino_acid in six different families of transporters utilizing the information we have developed a radial_basis rbf network method based on profiles_obtained with position_specific pssms for discriminating transporters belonging to three different classes and six families in this work we focused on another important aspect of functional_annotation of transporters i e the prediction of transporter targets first we constructed a transporter database with target information from the latest_version of uniprot database the database was then divided_into four major classes of transporters based on their transport targets the four classes are electron transporters protein mrna transporters ion transporters and other transporters we have systematically_analyzed the characteristic_features of amino_acid and developed a radial basis network for discriminating transporter targets using amino_acid and pssm profiles our method showed a fold_cross accuracy of and for electron transporters protein mrna transporters ion transporters and others we evaluated the performance of this method with an independent dataset of proteins and obtained an accuracy of and for electron transporters protein mrna transporters ion transporters and others respectively a web_server has been developed for discriminating transporters based on different targets and it is available online for the users finally we developed a protocol to analyze newly_discovered genomic_sequences to annotate putative transporters and their transport targets we propose that our method could be an effective tool in the annotation of transporters in genomic_sequences
