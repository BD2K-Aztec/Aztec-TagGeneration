gustaf detecting and correctly classifying svs in the ngs twilight zone motivation the landscape of structural_variation sv including complex duplication and translocation patterns is far from resolved sv detection_tools usually exhibit low agreement are often geared toward certain types or size ranges of variation and struggle to correctly_classify the type and exact size of svs results we present gustaf generic multi split alignment finder a sound generic multi split sv_detection tool that detects and classifies deletions inversions dispersed duplications and translocations of bp our approach is based on a generic multi split alignment strategy that can identify sv breakpoints with base_pair resolution we show that gustaf correctly identifies svs especially in the range from to bp which we call the next_generation ngs twilight zone of svs as well as larger svs bp gustaf performs better than similar tools in our benchmark and is furthermore able to correctly identify size and location of dispersed duplications and translocations which otherwise might be wrongly classified for example as large_deletions availability_and project information paper benchmark and source_code are available via http www seqan de projects gustaf variation in the human_genome remains only partially_characterized theoretically whole_genome wgs_data carry the potential to identify all genomic_variation including small variants such as single_nucleotide and small_indels as well as larger structural_variants svs typically defined as bp such as large_deletions inversions duplications and translocations however the difficulty lies in computationally analyzing the large_scale data obtained from wgs and reliably identifying the whole range of genomic_variation with current_algorithms and methods only small variants up to bp can be identified rather confidently while larger variation still poses a major_challenge large and complex rearrangements are often accompanied by micro homologies or microindels onishi around their breakpoints which makes them even harder to detect particularly with base_pair resolution many bioinformatics_tools have been developed in recent_years that address sv_detection through identification of certain signatures in the sequencing_data mainly they rely on one or multiple of the following four approaches i identifying discordant read_pairs that span sv breakpoints ii detecting regions of unexpectedly_low or high read_depth iii identifying split_reads that span sv breakpoints or iv local reassembly of sv candidate_regions typically overlap between different tools is low this is partially due to the fact that most tools are geared toward certain types of data e g for specific read_lengths or toward certain sv size ranges and types e g mid size indels also the different strategies suffer from various biases and sources of errors read_depth methods are vulnerable to read_depth fluctuations leading to non uniform coverage e g due to gc_content and mappability issues even after successfully normalizing for coverage biases the spectrum of svs that can be identified through read_depth signatures is limited to copy_number variable_regions i e deletion and amplification read_pair methods are vulnerable to mis mappings caused by repetitive_regions in the genome and are furthermore susceptible to chimeric read_pairs both read_depth and read_pair methods have problems identifying small svs i e less than a few hundred base_pairs which we here term the next_generation ngs twilight zone of svs for read_depth methods it is hard to discern coverage changes in small regions from natural read_depth fluctuations for read_pair methods such relatively small_deletions are difficult to identify because paired_read spacing may still lie within the variance of the insert size_distribution of the four strategies only split_reads and assembly based_methods yield single_nucleotide by identifying reads or reconstructing contigs that directly span sv breakpoints when correctly mapped onto the reference_genome the read or contig to reference alignment of an sv spanning read contig will be split into partial alignments at the breakpoint positions hence yielding base_pair resolution the split_read approach has been primarily used in conjunction with read_pair methods that identify potential sv spanning reads through abnormal paired_read distance or orientation this significantly_reduces the search_space for split mapping which is computationally_expensive to apply to the whole_genome to whom correspondence should be addressed however with increasing read_lengths and improved local reassembly approaches that generate contigs the split mapping_approach becomes more and more powerful as it yields highest confidence and base_pair resolution therefore we aimed to develop a method that can generically split map contigs or reads of arbitrary length our tool gustaf generic multi split alignment finder allows for multiple splits at arbitrary locations in the read is independent of read_length and sequencing_platform and supports both single_end and paired_end gustaf is based on finding local_alignments of a read and then essentially chaining local_alignments into a semi global read to reference alignment similar approaches are used in the context of whole_genome alignment where large rearrangements between locally collinear blocks are maintained in graph or graph like structures e g the alignment graph the a bruijn_graph or the enredo graph or in the shuffle lagan glocal alignment algorithm local_alignments are identified with stellar www seqan de projects stellar an edit_distance local aligner which guarantees to find all local_alignments of a given minimal length maximal error_rate and maximal x drop in theory however our approach can take local_alignments from any aligner as input making it versatile and adaptable because local_alignments are allowed to be anywhere in the reference_genome it allows for non collinearity of chained local_alignments and hence has the power to identify all types of sv in contrast to other sv callers gustaf furthermore attempts to correctly_classify sv events leading to multiple breakpoints such as translocations and dispersed duplications including the actual length of the duplication see also these complex sv patterns incorporate pseudodeletions that make them harder to classify and that are often wrongly reported by other methods in the following we introduce our method gustaf and compare it with two other popular_methods that are able to report svs with base_pair resolution pindel and delly
