gene_expression bias in microrna functional_enrichment motivation many studies have investigated the differential_expression of micrornas mirnas in disease_states and between different treatments tissues and developmental_stages given a list of perturbed mirnas it is common to predict the shared pathways on which they act the standard test for functional enrichment typically yields dozens of significantly_enriched functional_categories many of which appear frequently in the analysis of apparently unrelated diseases and conditions results we show that the most commonly used functional enrichment test is inappropriate for the analysis of sets of genes targeted by mirnas the hypergeometric_distribution used by the standard method consistently results in significant p values for functional enrichment for targets of randomly_selected mirnas reflecting an underlying bias in the predicted gene_targets of mirnas as a whole we developed an algorithm to measure enrichment using an empirical sampling_approach and applied this in a reanalysis of the gene_ontology classes of targets of mirna lists from published_studies the vast_majority of the mirna_target sets were not significantly_enriched in any functional category after correction for bias we therefore argue against continued use of the standard functional enrichment method for mirna_targets availability_and a python script implementing the empirical algorithm is freely_available sgjlab org empirical go micrornas mirnas down regulate abundance and translation of target_mrnas through complementary binding to target_sites mirnas play_important gene_expression in response to stimuli and during development and their expression_patterns can be predictive of disease_states for this reason a large number of studies have investigated the expression of mirnas in a wide_range of biological conditions microarray assays qrt_pcr and high_throughput have all been used to identify differentially_expressed in disease_states between different tissues and during development unfortunately the interpretation of mirna differential_expression is not straightforward the roles of individual mirnas in cellular_pathways are still poorly_understood each mirna has the potential to target hundreds of different genes meaning that perturbation of a single mirna may affect many biological_functions this motivates a broad view given a list of differentially_expressed we must look for the functions or pathways on which they converge here we examine the most common method of mirna functional_enrichment used in hundreds of published_studies this method consists of three steps finding which genes are targeted by selected mirnas annotating target_genes for their participation in pathways and processes and statistical_testing for over representation of a biological_process in the set of targeted genes our comparison of the hypergeometric and empirical distributions showed that certain functional_categories are preferentially targeted by mirnas regardless of whether those mirnas are differentially_expressed in a biological state or not it is not helpful to report a go term as enriched for targets of differentially_expressed if an equally strong enrichment would be obtained for randomly picked mirnas this justifies an empirical sampling_approach which measures enrichment relative to other mirnas in comparison to the standard method which does not take into account the background level of targeting of a go term there are several possible explanations for the phenomenon of preferential targeting by mirnas including bias in target prediction_algorithms similarities among seed sequences correlations between genes that are regulated together and genuine preference for control of certain biological_processes by different mechanisms one clear source of bias is average utr length of genes_annotated to specific go terms when we use the p value of the mean of the empirical distribution on the hypergeometric_distribution as a measure for bias of a go term we observe a strong negative correlation with average utr length of genes assigned to that go term pearsons r p we also note that many go terms were invariably returned together as enriched this may reflect underlying correlations between targeting of processes as well as the hierarchical_structure of the go the simplest use of functional enrichment tests examines a set of genes with a common characteristicfor example a set_of or a set of genes with particular genomic properties the test described here is subtly different a set of mirnas is defined by differential_expression and that set is one step removed by mirna_target from the set of genes whose functional enrichment is tested the bias in the underlying expected distribution of functional_categories comes from the process of linking mirnas with their target_genes while we have examined only a specific use of the functional enrichment test similar biases may affect other genomic enrichment tests for example chip_seq identification of transcription factorbinding sites followed by functional enrichment of the target gene_set is analogous to the analyses described here further investigation is therefore required to determine the appropriateness of the hypergeometric_distribution for other types of functional enrichment studies in our literature_survey we identified journal_articles that used the standard method however our list was not exhaustive and excluded studies with relatively minor deviations from the standard method such as those that implemented more complex filters for selection of target_genes and those that performed tests based on combined targeting by mirnas altogether we estimate that hundreds of published_articles are likely to be affected by the bias described here in the application of the empirical algorithm to mirna lists from these studies we do not attempt to directly replicate methods used and instead show a pattern in results that strongly suggests that most reported enrichments would not be found with correction for bias we also do not directly compare the significant enrichments output by our algorithm with those reported as the specific types of functional_categories assayed such as go term collections assembled by david vary_greatly and full lists of significant terms are rarely published our results do not imply that differentially_expressed do not converge on functions of interest it is notable that the number of significantly_enriched go terms increased with the number of mirnas input to our algorithm this may be because noise dominates for smaller lists whereas a larger number of input mirnas provides more signal of convergence on a process while modest enrichment of a function for a single mirna is undetectable the combination of many small enrichments for a larger collection of mirnas passes significance thresholds five of the largest input mirna lists had extremely convergent mirna_target sets for example had a predicted target set significantly_smaller than expected convergent target sets mean that any go term hit by chance will contain a higher proportion of the target set causing more significant go terms to be returned there have been other proposals to try to harness the convergence of mirnas and to improve enrichment_analysis the mirsystem tool gives a p value based on the tendency for the standard method to consistently find the same significant go terms by comparing the order of enrichment for a new sample with the order for random mirnas outstanding changes can be identified although use of a pre_computed distribution limits the flexibility of mirsystem the approach escapes the problem of bias reported here in general however there remains an unfulfilled need for more powerful and accurate bioinformatic_tools to link mirnas to functions we have highlighted critical problems with the most common general approach to functional_enrichment of mirna target_genes we have shown that testing with the hypergeometric_distribution sampling from all go annotated_genes in the genome is inappropriate our literature_survey showed that a large number of studies reported significant results that are unlikely to stand after correction for the bias in the distribution of targets of randomly_sampled mirnas we believe that our results provide a strong argument against continued use of the standard method
