biopartsdb a synthetic_biology workflow web_application for education and research synthetic_biology has become a widely used technology and expanding applications in research education and industry require progress tracking for team_based dna_synthesis projects although some vendors are beginning to supply multi kilobase sequence verified constructs synthesis workflows starting with short oligos remain_important for cost_savings and pedagogical benefit we developed biopartsdb as an open_source extendable workflow management system for synthetic_biology projects with entry points for oligos and larger dna constructs and ending with sequence verified clones synthetic_biology projects require software systems to organize track and verify the creation of parts encoded by dna_sequences with individual parts corresponding to genomic_elements such as promoters or coding domains part sizes can range from nucleotide regulatory_elements to megabase chromosomes tasks include organizing an experimental plan tracking protocols retaining quality_control assessments assessing performance and storing a verified part in a repository biological enthusiasts such as diy bio http diybio org educational_initiatives such as igem https www igem org and new synthetic_biology courses such as build a genome all require workflow systems to match to dna_synthesis protocols protocols depend on whether a dna_construct or part is obtained by pcr_amplification restriction digest or direct synthesis and direct synthesis can involve different hierarchical assembly strategies quality_control procedures and parts storage whether in a vector or as dna can also depend on the synthetic_route while laboratory information management systems lims are available for synthetic_biology they focus primarily on synthetic dna inventory management rather than on the synthesis process itself we therefore designed biopartsdb as an open_source modular tool for dna_synthesis workflow and parts registration providing a ready resource for research and education our permissive license makes the software fully available for industrial and commercial applications as well
