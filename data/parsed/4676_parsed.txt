structural_bioinformatics tips a database of therapeutic_targets in pathogens and associated tools motivation the need for new drugs and new targets is particularly compelling in an era that is witnessing an alarming increase of drug_resistance in human_pathogens the identification of new targets of known drugs is a promising approach which has proven successful in several cases here we describe a database that includes information on putative drugtarget_pairs for human_pathogens derived from available drugtarget crystallographic complexes novel mechanisms to escape therapy are constantly emerging among human pathogen populations and this clearly urges the development on one hand of new drugs for the treatment of the diseases and on the other hand of rapid and effective methods to help expand the landscape of available treatment_options in this context computational studies are called on to help identify_novel and characterize their interactions and indeed a number of such efforts are described in the literature however these are mostly devoted to the analysis of single targets or specific tropical_disease pathogens the tips database has been developed with the aim of facilitating the identification of new therapeutic_targets in organisms responsible for human_infections we performed a large_scale analysis to systematically identify candidate targets in the proteomes of such organisms the rationale of our approach is based on the intrinsic polypharmacological behaviour of compounds targeting homologous_proteins we considered all drugtarget_pairs for which the d structure of the complex is experimentally known and used the sequence of the target to identify its homologues in human_pathogens the evolutionary_conservation of such homologues and their d structures available or predicted were used to verify whether the original drug was in principle able to bind them as it does the original target to this aim stringent filters were applied to ensure that predicted binding_sites and their interactions with the drug are as accurate as possible pathogen proteins predicted with high_confidence to be therapeutic_targets and the putative drugs interacting with them were collected and annotated in tips tips currently contains candidate pathogen target structures involved in different drugtarget complexes in pathogens all entries are thoroughly annotated with both sequence and functional information the database can be queried by organism name genus or specie name protein_family or function ec_number go terms and pfam as well as uniprot id the query returns a sortable table providing information about both known and predicted drugtarget_pairs and links to visualize specific information on the drug s physicochemical_properties structure indication and side_effects the target s uniprot annotation and pdb structure s and to visually analyse or download their d complexes ligplot drawings of both the known and inferred binding_sites in complex with the drug are available as well
