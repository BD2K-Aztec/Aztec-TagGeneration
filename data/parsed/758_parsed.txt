biological dynamics markup_language bdml an open format for representing quantitative_biological motivation recent_progress in live_cell and modeling techniques has resulted in generation of a large amount of quantitative data from experimental_measurements and computer simulations on spatiotemporal_dynamics of biological objects such as molecules cells and organisms although many research groups have independently dedicated their efforts to developing software_tools for visualizing and analyzing these data these tools are often not compatible with each other because of different data_formats results we developed an open unified format biological dynamics markup_language bdml current version which provides a basic framework for representing quantitative_biological for objects ranging from molecules to cells to organisms bdml is based on extensible markup_language xml its advantages are machine and human readability and exten sibility bdml will improve the efficiency of development and evaluation of software_tools for data visualization and analysis availability_and a specification and a schema file for bdml are freely_available online atwith the rapid progress in live_cell and modeling techniques quantitative spatiotemporal_dynamics of biological objects such as molecules cells and organisms can be obtained from experimental_measurements and computer simulations such quantitative data can provide us with new opportunities to analyze biological dynamics through various types of computational_methods these data would also provide a rich resource for understanding the mechanisms of biological_systems a wide_variety of quantitative_biological can be directly obtained from experimental_measurements by using live_cell and digital_image for example cell_division dynamics in caenorhabditis_elegans can be extracted from four dimensional d microscopic images similarly quantitative data can be obtained for embryogenesis in drosophila_melanogaster and zebrafish and for behavioral dynamics in adult c elegans quantitative data can also be obtained from computer simulations e g single_molecule dynamics in escherichia_coli and microtubule_dependent nuclear dynamics in c elegans_embryos although most of these data are publicly_available it is often difficult to reuse them because of their intricate structure and the lack of detailed explanations of their formats v c the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work bdml is an open xml_based format for representing quantitative_biological although the five entity types used to describe dynamic spatial_information a set of points a set of lines a circle a sphere and a set of faces cover most of the publicly_available data other types of spatial entities such as a cube or cylinder can be potentially used bdml can easily support these types of spatial entities by extending its format using xml with reference to geometric primitives commonly used in computer graphics such as x d bdml provides a medium for representing a wide_variety of quantitative data nearly bdml datasets are currently available online at the systems science of biological dynamics ssbd database http ssbd qbic riken jp these datasets include dynamics of molecules cells nuclei and gene_expression and dynamics of whole organisms such as e coli c elegans d melanogaster and zebrafish some of these datasets were derived from experimental_measurements whereas others were produced by computer simulation bdml enables us to represent various types and scales of biological dynamics for different species taking_advantage of the bdml format we developed and released bdml dviewer for visualizing quantitative data from the open_source libraries and apis we are also developing software an example of cell_division dynamics in a c elegans embryo each nucleus is represented as a set of closed curves in this example the units are in micrometers and the scale factors for the x y and z dimensions are defined separately in the scaleunit as and respectively an example of dynamics of nuclear migration in a c elegans embryo the pronucleus and microtubules are represented as a sphere and a set of line segments respectively a these structures can be represented as either one component b or as separate components c in this example the units are in meters and the scale factors for the x y and z dimensions are set to tools for extracting phenotypic_characteristics from the data in the bdml format several of these tools are already available online at http ssbd qbic riken jp phenochar the development of these software_tools further demonstrates the flexibility of using bdml for visualization and analysis of different types of quantitative data in addition we believe that the bdml format would provide new opportunities for scientists in other fields such as statistics physics and information science and facilitate bringing new ideas and approaches to biological analysis besides its advantage as a human_readable structured data format bdml also inherits some of the weaknesses of xml http lw hdfgroup org projects nara xml and binary pdf the numerical_values of quantitative data are represented in bdml as decimal numbers in ascii format when numbers in double precision floating point format are written into a bdml file storing the entire values may become impractical in terms of file size and file operations therefore this representation method may result in truncation and loss of precision bdml is hierarchical in structure making_it to randomly access the data the repetitive use of markup tags also makes it less efficient in terms of disk storage space than other data_formats lawrence opening or reading a bdml file using a software_program can be a problem when the file size becomes too large as bdml is a text_based hierarchical data format large memory and computational_resources are needed to parse the data file to solve this problem we included the series element which can be used to divide a dataset into more than one bdml file using this element in the ssbd database enables practical use of the quantitative data for d melanogaster and zebrafish_embryos as series of bdml files a more general solution to the above problems would be to use another approach such as the extensible data model and format or fieldml in these formats the description of the data light data is separate from the numerical_values heavy data the light data and heavy data are often stored in xml and hdf formats respectively this approach ensures numerical precision and reduces the required disk storage space and computational_resources but lacks human readability we are planning to expand bdml to also handle binary formatted data in the near future although the ontology element is optional in the current version of bdml it can provide unambiguous definitions of the terms in the bdml file as most biologists are not familiar with ontological terms tools for helping them to annotate the data in ontological terms at the time of file creation would be needed to make the option compulsory moreover meta_information definition can be provided in the annotation element of the bdbase element by using the rdf these definitions enable computer programs to understand the meaning of the terms and meta_information in the bdml file the ontological references and annotations can be attached when the data are registered in some repository databases such as ssbd a limitation of the current version of bdml is the lack of hierarchical representation of meta_information about genetic_perturbations e g mutants gene_editing and rnai treatments and chemical perturbations e g drug_treatments such information would be useful for systematic_comparison and analysis of biologicaleach nucleus is represented as a sphere and total gfp signal is described in the property element in this example the units are in micrometers and the scale factors for the x y and z dimensions are defined separately in the scaleunit as and respectively an example of behavioral dynamics of an adult c elegans represented as a set of line segments in this example the units are in micrometers and the scale factors for the x y and z dimensions are defined separately in the scaleunit as and respectivelysnapshot of the bdml dviewer software_tool dynamics by using more than one bdml file therefore a future version of the bdml format will extend the bdml schema to support such information as meta_information about genetic and chemical perturbations can be useful for other xml_based data_formats such as miniml mzml ome cellml sbml and sbrml we aim to collaborate with these projects to incorporate this information in a future release integration and comparative_analysis of various types of quantitative data are straightforward when they are represented in the bdml format such integration has the potential to lead to new insights into biological_mechanisms for example an integrated study of the dynamics of cell_morphology and protein activity has explored the relationship between biophysical phenomena and biochemical signaling comparison of experimental_measurements and computer simulations has elucidated the mechanisms of various kinds of biological dynamics bdml will facilitate such comparative_analysis and comparison of the data from different laboratories we believe that the bdml format will widen the range of scientific approaches to understanding biological_systems
