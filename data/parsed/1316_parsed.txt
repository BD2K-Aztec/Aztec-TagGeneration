dendropy a python_library for phylogenetic computing dendropy is a cross_platform library for the python programming_language that provides for object oriented reading writing simulation and manipulation of phylogenetic data with an emphasis on phylogenetic_tree operations dendropy uses a splits hash mapping to perform rapid calculations of tree distances similarities and shape under various metrics it contains rich simulation routines to generate trees under a number of different phylogenetic and coalescent models dendropys data simulation and manipulation facilities in conjunction with its support of a broad range of phylogenetic data_formats nexus newick phylip fasta nexml etc allow it to serve a useful role in various phyloinformatics and phylogeographic pipelines availability the stable release of the library is available for download and automated installation through the python_package index site http pypi python org pypi dendropy while the active development source_code repository is available to the public from githubhere we describe dendropy a cross_platform library for the management manipulation and analysis of phylogenetic_tree and character data using the python programming_language dendropy addresses needs of researchers in phyloinformatics and population_genetics it supports reading and writing phylogenetic data in a wide_variety of file_formats nexus phylip fasta nexml etc to and from the same common object oriented data model its data model is rich and well suited for manipulating complex datasets objects represent both core phylogenetic entities such as taxa trees and character matrices as well both components and collections of these objects for example dendropys representation of phylogenetic_trees includes a class for the tree itself but also classes for nodes directed edges and support for the concept of splits also known as bipartitions as well as collections of these tree objects splits are crucial in many phylogenetic algorithms that operate on unrooted tree such as consensus tree generation and the calculation of tree to tree distances dendropys hashing of splits allows for constant time lookup of an edge in a tree in memory trees are represented as rooted but splits of either unrooted or rooted trees are efficiently stored by hashing thus dendropy handles both types of trees very naturally to whom correspondence should be addressed dendropy is designed to deal with diverse sources of datasets character data and trees refer to rich taxon objects and users of the library have fine_grained control of how these taxa are coordinated or kept separate across different sources of data thus importing information from a wide_variety of sources can be accomplished without unintentionally concatenating information this makes dendropy a convenient tool in the domains of bioinformatics e g phylogenetic supermatrix assembly and phylogeography in which the character data associated with trees is derived from multiple exemplars of the same biological taxon dendropy also provides a rich framework for the simulation of trees under a variety of branching models such as the birthdeath model uniform or variable the coalescent the censored coalescent etc below we describe the main features of dendropy in more detailed terms and discuss its relationship to the existing python libraries for bioinformatics
