path ppi an r package to predict protein_protein for a set of proteins we introduce path ppi a new r package to identify proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks for fully_sequenced organisms for which nearly none ppi are known path ppi predicts ppi_networks based on sets of proteins from well established model_organisms providing an intuitive visualization and usability it can be used to combine and transfer information of a certain pathway or biological_process from several reference organisms to one target_organism availability_and path ppi is an open_source tool implemented in r it can be obtained from the bioconductor_project http bioconductor org_packages path ppi plenty of databases exist which contain proteinprotein_interaction ppi data for various organisms e g for some well established model_organisms species specific data_repositories are available e g providing also ppi data in contrast for the majority of organisms such a comprehensive amount of ppi data is not available therefore different approaches have been developed to predict ppis some of these approaches aim to deduce new interactions from known ppis by means of homology_based mapping based on sequence_similarity other methods apply supervised_learning to filter and score the predicted interactions using additional biological data e g functional_annotation co expression and or text_mining data for a recent review see approaches that predict ppis based on sequence_data or network topology_information often provide only precomputed data or predict interactions only for a set of predefined organisms furthermore most of the methods do not supply information about the underlying reference interactions in the majority only the scores are provided to validate a predicted interaction often it is necessary to easily access the entire underlying information about the predicted interactions since the interpretation and experimental_validation is one of the most important_steps after the prediction as we were interested in aging processes and interaction networks of age_related pathways in the fungal model_organism podospora anserina we found only a few data_repositories for interaction data for example the kegg_database provides small subnetworks of some selected mainly metabolic pathways recently also the string database e g involves some predicted interactions for p anserina nevertheless there was no satisfactory solution and no easy and fast way to directly gain knowledge about proteins and their interactions of certain biological_processes which are well established in some model_organisms but nearly unknown in the target_organism homology_based tools which theoretically enable to predict or transfer interactions between species are mostly implemented for a set of predefined organisms or v c the author published_by we introduced a new r package to predict ppi_networks based on sets of proteins which may belong to a specific biological_pathway providing an intuitive visualization and usability we implemented path ppi to reveal putative proteins and interactions for a pathway or a biological_process in organisms for which nearly none ppi_information is available the results can serve as starting points for further network modeling studies and experimental validations
