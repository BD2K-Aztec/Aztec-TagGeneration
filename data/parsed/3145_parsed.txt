multilabel classification for exploiting cross_resistance information in hiv drug_resistance prediction motivation antiretroviral treatment_regimens can sufficiently suppress viral_replication in human_immunodeficiency hiv_infected and prevent the progression of the disease however one of the factors contributing to the progression of the disease despite ongoing antiretroviral_treatment is the emergence of drug_resistance the high mutation_rate of hiv can lead to a fast adaptation of the virus under drug pressure thus to failure of antiretroviral_treatment due to the evolution of drug resistant_variants moreover cross_resistance phenomena have been frequently found in hiv leading to resistance not only against a drug from the current treatment but also to other not yet applied drugs automatic classification and prediction of drug_resistance is increasingly important in hiv research as well as in clinical_settings and to this end machine_learning have been widely_applied nevertheless cross_resistance information was not taken explicitly into account yet results in our study we demonstrated the use of cross_resistance information to predict drug_resistance in hiv we tested a set of more than reverse_transcriptase sequences and corresponding resistance information for six nucleoside_analogues based on multi_label classification_models and cross_resistance information we were able to significantly improve overall prediction_accuracy for all drugs compared with single binary classifiers without any additional information moreover we identified drug specific patterns within the reverse_transcriptase sequences that can be used to determine an optimal order of the classifiers within the classifier chains these patterns are in good agreement with known resistance mutations and support the use of cross_resistance information in such prediction_models the human_immunodeficiency hiv is one of the major human_diseases leading to about million deaths yearly although antiretroviral_treatment is working well in principle the high mutation_rate of hiv frequently leads to a fast adaptation of the virus and thus to the development of drug_resistant viral_strains performed stochastic_simulations of the within host evolution of hiv by estimating the structure of the hiv quasispecies they were able to calculate an error threshold of hiv they discovered that hiv has a mutation_rate that is close to error catastrophe and that the error threshold depends heavily on the recombination_rate of hiv pennings analyzed the evolution of resistance in hiv due to standing genetic_variation she ascertained that depending on the treatment probabilities of evolution of drug_resistance due to standing genetic_variation vary between and the most important parameters for the evolution of drug_resistance are the effective_population of the virus before treatment and the fitness of the resistant_virus during treatment evolution of drug_resistance finally leads to a failure of antiretroviral_treatment and thus to the progression of disease experimental_testing of viral_resistance in patients has been widely used in research as well as in clinical_settings to gain information about the way drug_resistance evolves in contrast to these experimental phenotypic assays computational_approaches offer the possibility to predict drug_resistance in hiv in an easy and fast way based on short sequence_information of the viral genotype e g the sequence of the viral reverse_transcriptase rt such computational_models for predicting drug_resistance in hiv have been developed and widely_applied these computational_models are mainly based on statistical or machine_learning that try to find a mapping from the sequence_information to a resistance factor usually the ic ratios the concentration of a specific drug inhibiting of viral_replication compared with cell_culture without the drug is defined as ic inhibitor concentration are used in these models to define resistance in general drug_resistance means reduced inhibition of viral_replication by antiretroviral_drugs resulting in increased ic_values the ic_values of the drug resistant_isolates and hiv wild_type are used to calculate resistance factors ic drug_concentration for resistant_strain ic drug_concentration for wild_type as a standardized measure of hiv drug_resistance the data are separated into the classes susceptible and resistant based on a drug specific cutoff of the resistance factor a computational_model is then trained based on these data pairs sequence and corresponding class which can then be used to predict the resistance factor or the resistance class for new unseen sequences for instance sico chemical changes of mutated sequences compared with the wild_type to predict rt inhibitor resistance in hiv moreover the same group developed the first systems_biology approaches to hiv drug_resistance showing networks of interacting positions one important finding however has not been exploited in these models so_far namely the occurrence of cross_resistance in the context of hiv cross_resistance means that mutations leading to a resistance against a specific drug which is currently part of the antiretroviral_treatment of a specific patient also leads to resistance in some cases albeit less frequently it could also lead to a re sensitization for other drugs against other drugs that may or may not be part of the same treatment in the current study we analyzed cross_resistance in hiv for a dataset of more than rt sequences and six nucleoside_analogues nas namely lamivudine tc abacavir abc zidovudine azt stavudine d t didanosine ddi and tenofovir tdf moreover we developed a model that exploits knowledge about cross_resistance to improve the overall prediction_accuracy for the whole repertoire of drugs used in this study to this end we made use of novel methods for so_called multilabel classification mlc a generalization of conventional polychotomous classification that has recently gained_increasing in machine_learning to the best of our knowledge this is the first time information about rt inhibitors cross_resistance has been explicitly integrated in hiv drug_resistance prediction_models in contrast to protease_inhibitors pis as well as non_nucleoside nnrtis nas have less side_effects moreover the combination of different drug_classes during therapy may lead to unpredictable interactions of pis and nnrtis with the cytochrome_p system and thus may complicate the therapy therefore one option might be the use of quadruple nucleoside therapy sturmer we conclude with an affirmative answer to one of the main_questions of our study namely whether or not cross_resistance information can be used to improve overall accuracy in drug_resistance prediction by using mlc methods a relatively recent development in machine_learning we were able to exploit cross_resistance information for rt inhibitors more concretely our results are based on a specific mlc method called ccs we consider these results as promising and therefore intend to further explore this direction in future work on the methodological side we would like to try alternative mlc methods including the probabilistic variant of ccs proposed by dembczynskibut also approaches that are not based on the idea of chaining as an interesting property of the former let us mention that it does not only produce binary predictions but proper probability estimates of single labels or label combinations predictions of that kind are interesting not only for the minimization of various loss functions but also for the purpose of representing uncertainty moreover we want to include multiclass and regression_models to be able to predict more classes e g intermediate resistance and even the resistance factors on the application side our study has focused on nas so_far although a typical clinical treatment includes drugs from several classes it might of course be interesting to test our approach for other types of antiretroviral_drugs for example non nucleoside rt inhibitors and for other target_proteins such as hiv_protease and corresponding pis by now our approach is limited to specialized treatment cases and thus is currently not well applicable in clinical_settings however in the future we plan to adapt our approach for nnrtis as well as for pis moreover all sequences used in the current study originated from subtype b strains thus the results of our model might be misleading if it is applied to other subtypes
