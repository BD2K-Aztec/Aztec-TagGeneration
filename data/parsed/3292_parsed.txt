novel search method for the discovery of functional_relationships motivation numerous annotations are available that functionally characterize genes and proteins with regard to molecular process cellular_localization tissue expression protein domain_composition protein interaction disease association and other properties searching this steadily growing amount of information can lead to the discovery of new biological_relationships between genes and proteins to facilitate the searches methods are required that measure the annotation similarity of genes and proteins however most current similarity methods are focused only on annotations from the gene_ontology go and do not take other annotation sources into account results we introduce the new method biosim that incorporates multiple sources of annotations to quantify the functional_similarity of genes and proteins we compared the performance of our method with four other well known methods adapted to use multiple annotation sources we evaluated the methods by searching for known functional_relationships using annotations based only on go or on our large data_warehouse biomyn this warehouse integrates many diverse annotation sources of human genes and proteins we observed that the search performance improved_substantially for almost all methods when multiple annotation sources were included in particular our method outperformed the other methods in terms of recall and average precision similarity_search plays an important role in biological pharmaceutical and medical investigations for instance the introduction of the blast algorithm byto search for similar sequences has been considered a milestone in genomics other similarity search_methods to mine databases of d molecule conformations have been important for drug_discovery in addition the growing availability of annotations that characterize genes and proteins opens the new possibility to find biological_relationships by similarity_searches based on function domain_composition disease association tissue expression etc for example the identification of similarly annotated_genes and proteins can reveal new genedisease_associations to whom correspondence should be addressed
