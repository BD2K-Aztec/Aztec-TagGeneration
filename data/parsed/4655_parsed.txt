the victor c library for protein representation and advanced manipulation motivation protein_sequence and structure representation and manipulation require dedicated software libraries to support methods of increasing complexity here we describe the virtual constrution tool for proteins victor c library an open_source platform dedicated to enabling inexperienced users to develop advanced tools and gathering contributions from the community the provided application examples cover statistical energy potentials profileprofile sequence_alignments and ab_initio loop modeling victor was used over the last years in several publications and optimized for efficiency it is provided as a github repository with source files and unit tests plus extensive online documentation including a wiki with help files and tutorials examples and doxygen documentation availability_and the c library and online documentation distributed under a gpl license are available from url http protein bio unipd it victor structural bioinformatics_methods require valid software libraries to represent and manipulate proteins efficiently a number of widely used tools have been developed over the years to visualize proteins e g chimera swiss pdbviewer molide and vmd to name a few software libraries to manipulate proteins efficiently provide basic data representation and more advanced functionality with a different focus each esbtl is mainly a protein_data pdb_file parser biskit additionally provides functionality for analysis of molecular_dynamics simulations while ptools focuses on molecular_docking openstructure places more attention on structure visualization and energy calculation the latter is also supported by msl and tinker while ball in addition provides many advanced optimization algorithms extracts sequence_information from the protein_structure and can be used as an interface to several available third_party tools the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp series of experiments demonstrates that structure_prediction is increasingly becoming an engineering problem where sophisticated methods have to be combined into extensive pipelines to provide state of the art results this has raised the barrier for entry into the field to a point where little new developments are possible considering that most software libraries used in casp are proprietary and not available as open_source here we propose the open_source virtual constrution tool for proteins victor c library as a way to mitigate this problem victor is both an efficiently designed c library able to manipulate protein_structures with minimal computing time and a collection of advanced components for protein_sequence and structure manipulation in particular victorprovides three sample applications profileprofile sequence_alignments statistical_potentials and loop modelling each of these three applications has been extensively described in the literature and is beyond the scope of this article to the best of our knowledge neither is available as an open_source c library yet profileprofile sequence_alignments in particular have been widely used to improve target template alignment in casp victor is composed of lines of code and still expanding as it is used in the main authors teaching it was developed inhouse over the last years with the contribution of tens of developers and has reached a high_level of maturity victor is released to provide a platform for contributions from the interested community it provides extensive online material in the form of a wiki with help files tutorials doxygen documentation and a list of applications built using victor can be accessed from the url http protein bio unipd it victor the actual github repository with c source files a precompiled ubuntu bit version and unit tests are available from url https github com biocomputingup victor
