structural_bioinformatics extending p site of metabolism models with region resolution data motivation cytochrome_p s are a family of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of approximately of fda_approved medicinal chemists often want to know which atoms of a mol eculeits metabolized sitesare oxidized by cytochrome_p s in order to modify their metabolism consequently there are several methods that use literature derived atom resolution data to train models that can predict a molecules sites of metabolism there is however much more data available at a lower_resolution where the exact_site of metabolism is not known but the region of the molecule that is oxidized is known until now no site of metabolism models made use of region resolution data results here we describe xenosite region the first reported method for training site of metabolism models with region resolution data our approach uses the expectation_maximization to train a site of metabolism model region resolution metabolism data was simulated from a large site of metabolism dataset containing molecules with metabolized and un metabolized sites and covering nine cytochrome_p isozymes when training on the same molecules but with only region level information we find that this approach yields models almost as accurate as models trained with atom resolution data moreover we find that atom resolution trained models are more accurate when also trained with region resolution data from additional molecules our approach therefore opens up a way to extend the applicable domain of site of metabolism models into larger regions of chemical_space this meets a critical need in drug_development by tapping into underutilized data commonly available in most large drug companies availability_and the algorithm data and a web_server are available at http swami wustl edu xregion cytochrome_p abbreviated as cyp or p enzymes are a family of proteins responsible for the metabolism of of fda_approved the p mediated metabolism of a drug affects its clinical_efficacy and safety knowing which atoms of a moleculeits sites of metabolismare oxidized by p s enables medicinal chemists to rationally design new molecules with improved metabolic_profiles determining which exact atoms of an individual molecule are metabolized is often difficult and expensive the mass_spectrometry experiments typically used in drug_discovery most often can only identify regions of a molecule that are metabolized rather than identify the specific metabolized atoms that medicinal chemists need to know analyzing the mass_spectra of a p substrate reaction to determine metabolic_products is a complicated problem the the key point is that although there are many ways of interpreting mass_spectrometry data none can reliably identify atom resolution sites of metabolism for all molecules for these two reasonsthe value of knowing sites of metabolism and the difficulty of determining them at atom resolutionsubstantial effort has been invested in building computational_models that can predict a molecules sites of metabolism there are several methods but the best performing methods all use machine_learning to train models from literature curated databases of hundreds of molecules with known atom resolution sites of metabolism the reliance of these models on literature derived atom resolution data has two important consequences first the molecules used to train site of metabolism models are for the most part limited to only those available in the literature literature derived data are based primarily on molecules that are structurally different from proprietarylead molecules consequently models trained on literature data are often not as accurate on molecules in drug_development the exact molecules for which accurate_predictions are most important second these models do not make use of the large number of molecules with known region resolution sites of metabolism which can include data from thousands of molecules more similar to the molecules currently in development to overcome these shortfalls we introduce xenosite region the first reported method that uses region resolution data to train atomresolution site of metabolism prediction_models region resolution data are much easier to experimentally obtain than atom resolution data and it is already collected in drug_discovery on a regular basis for example pfizer collects adme data including region resolution sites of metabolism on molecules every week more than triple the total amount of atom resolution data in literaturederived datasets by including this region resolution data site of metabolism models could extend into areas of chemical_space that are poorly represented in the public_domain our strategy is to modify an existing site of metabolism prediction method xenosite to train from regionresolution data xenosite uses a neural_network to predict which atoms in the molecule are metabolized and is a suitable starting_point for our approach for two reasons first xenosite is accurate picking out a correct site of metabolism in the top two predictions for every molecule with an accuracy of on literature derived data this accuracy surpasses those of other site of metabolism models like rs predictor smartcyp stardrop and schrodinger schr dinger llc with performances of and respectivelyon the same dataset second xenosite can both train from probabilistically labeled training data and also outputs a score that is a well scaled probability in addition to using binary labels on each atom xenosite can also train from data where the probability is used as a training target similarly xenosites outputs range from to and correspond closely to the probability that an atom is a site of metabolism both these capabilities are necessary for the approach we will use to adapt xenosite to use region level data we hypothesize that a statistical_method called expectation_maximization em can train xenosite models with region resolution data xenosite like all reported machine_learning in the literature requires a training_set with every atom labeled as a site or not a site of metabolism for regionresolution data however these labels are hidden from us em is designed to work in just these situations enabling statistical_models to be trained with key_variables hidden from view the em_algorithm is iterative using the output of the model to successively improve an estimate of the true labels for the training data which is in turn used to improve the output of the model in this study we present the first site of metabolism model that uses region resolution data moreover it appears that extending atom resolution training data with region resolution data improves the accuracy of site of metabolism models this is an exciting result because there is often much more region resolution site of metabolism data available in pharmaceutical_companies much of which covers chemical_space currently underrepresented in public atomresolution literature derived data by using data already collected in drug_development but unused for modeling xenosite region may prove to be a powerful way of extending site of metabolism models making them more accurate furthermore the approach we describe here is general and could extend other som modeling_approaches to use region resolution data as well and we leave this for future work
