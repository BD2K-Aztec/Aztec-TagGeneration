memhdx an interactive tool to expedite the statistical validation and visualization of large hdx_ms datasets motivation with the continued improvement of requisite mass_spectrometers and uhplc systems hydrogen_deuterium mass_spectrometry hdx_ms workflows are rapidly_evolving towards the investigation of more challenging biological_systems including large_protein and membrane_proteins the analysis of such extensive systems results in very large hdx_ms datasets for which specific analysis tools are required to speed up data validation and interpretation results we introduce a web_application and a new r package named memhdx to help users analyze validate and visualize large hdx_ms datasets memhdx is composed of two elements a statistical tool aids in the validation of the results by applying a mixed_effects for each peptide in each experimental_condition and at each time point taking_into the time dependency of the hdx reaction and number of independent replicates two adjusted p values are generated per peptide one for the change in dynamics and one for the magnitude of d and are used to classify the data by means of a logit representation a user_friendly interface developed with shiny by rstudio facilitates the use of the package this interactive tool allows the user to easily and rapidly validate visualize and compare the relative deuterium incorporation on the amino_acid and d structure providing both spatial and temporal_information availability memhdx is freely_available as a web_tool at the project home page http memhdx hydrogen_deuterium followed by mass_spectrometry hdx_ms is a biophysical tool in structural_biology capable of probing protein_ligand conformational changes and protein_folding and dynamics despite an increased number of applications the expansion of the technology has been slowed by its intrinsic technical and analytical complexity i e digestion at ph and rapid hplc separation at c with recent advancements in sample_preparation robotics refrigerated ultra_high systems and high_resolution mass_spectrometers hdx_ms has surged in popularity and is now emerging from the academic benchtop to the expanse of the pharmaceutical sector the use of improved hdx_ms workflows enables the structural analysis of larger protein systems such as antigenantibody complexes kda or integral_membrane in a more routine way the characterization of such systems results in very complex hdx_ms datasets for which specific non commercial analytical software e g as well as commercial platforms e g dynamx and hdexaminer have been developed such software extract deuterium incorporation information from un processed raw m z data_files and produce deuterium uptake curves that can pinpoint regions of interest on protein d structures however many of these tools do not integrate statistical_approaches and use the absolute_difference of deuterium uptake to evaluate the significance between conditions hydra or mass spec studio was the first standalone application to introduce a students t test and p values to statistically evaluate the difference across hdx_ms experiments alternatively houde and co workers calculated confidence_limits based on the experimental uncertainty of measuring deuterium uptake across replicates in this context two distinct confidence_limits were calculated manually using either the differences of deuterium uptake or the summed value of hdx differences measured for each peptide in each condition and at each time point lastly hdx workbench includes a two tailed ttest and tukey multiple comparison procedure for the statistical cross comparison of two or more datasets despite significant efforts to design requisite statistical_tools the aforementioned software solutions are suitable to analyze hdx_ms data at one time point only failing to account for the time dependency of the hdx_ms reaction thus liu and coworkers proposed a multiple_regression or ancova model by deriving a statistical_test based on the model_parameters they evaluated the significant_difference between two groups under comparison for all peptides in the dataset and across all independent replicates expanding on this we introduce a web_application named memhdx mixed_effects for hdx experiments to aid in the rapid statistical validation and visualization of large hdx_ms datasets memhdx uses a linear mixed_effects where replicates are considered as random_effects this accounts for both the time dependency and the variability across replicates moreover instead of testing the variation in global deuterium exchange between two experimental_conditions we propose to calculate two individual p values for each peptide firstly the difference between conditions is measured p value for the magnitude of delta deuterium d followed by the evolution of the deuterium uptake behavior over the time course of the experiment p value for the change in dynamics memhdx therefore allows the clustering of each peptide in the dataset based on these two respective pvalues a user_friendly interface developed with shiny by rstudio facilitates the use of the application allowing the user to easily visualize and compare the relative deuterium incorporation across the entire protein_sequence and d structure as a test system we used the receptor_binding repeat in toxin rtx domain of cyaa produced by bordetella_pertussis the causative_agent of whooping_cough to pinpoint regions undergoing structural and conformational changes upon calcium_binding
