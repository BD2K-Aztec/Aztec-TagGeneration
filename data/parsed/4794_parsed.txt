unipept web_services for metaproteomics analysis unipept is an open_source web_application that is designed for metaproteomics analysis with a focus on interactive datavisualization it is underpinned by a fast index built from uniprotkb and the ncbi taxonomy that enables quick retrieval of all uniprot entries in which a given tryptic_peptide occurs unipept version introduced web_services that provide programmatic_access to the metaproteomics analysis features this enables integration of unipept functionality in custom applications and data_processing pipelines availability_and the web_services are freely_available api unipept ugent be and are open sourced under the mit_license unipept is a web_application for biodiversity analysis of complex metaproteomics samples the application is powered by a fast index built from uniprotkb and a cleaned up version of the ncbi taxonomy this index enables quick retrieval of all uniprot entries in which a given tryptic_peptide occurs using the taxonomic annotations of uniprot entries unipept also returns the complete set of organisms in which a given peptide occurs this set of organisms is then processed using a lowest_common lca algorithm to determine the taxonomic specificity of the peptide all results are presented in clear overview tables and in an interactive treeview fast computation of lcas for given lists of peptides also enables interactive biodiversity analysis of metaproteomics datasets the biodiversity in complex samples can then be inspected using multiple interactive_visualizations such as a treeview supplementary a sunburst view supplementary and a treemap supplementary all visualizations on the unipept website can be saved as publication grade graphics and all analysis results can be exported as microsoft_excel compatible csv files to guarantee optimal_performance and correctness the unipept project pursues excellence regarding best practices for modern web_application development one example of this is automatic correctness testing by over tests after each code change the entire application including the web_services is open_source and licensed under the terms of the mit_license the source_code can be found at http github com unipept unipept in this article we present the latest addition to the unipept toolbox a set of web_services that expose the unipept analysis functions for use in other applications and data_processing pipelines the unipept project consists of two main parts a collection of scripts to construct the database and the web_application the first part of the database construction the code to parse uniprot was recently updated to use berkeley db a high performance key value store to store intermediate results this resulted in an enormous boost in parsing speed where the old parser took over days to parse uniprot the new approach using berkeley db does the job in under hours the second part of the database construction is the pre calculation of the lcas of all the peptides in the database the old ruby code was rewritten in java and computation time was reduced from over four weeks to just min with the help of some new java features the combination of these advancements allows us to consistently offer analysis results based on the latest uniprot release the second part of unipept is a ruby on rails web_application that uses javascript for all client side interactions all data visualizations are made in house with the d js javascript_library the galaxyp project already takes_advantage of the new unipept web_services to integrate unipept functionality into the galaxy framework exact matching of peptides to uniprot entries is also implemented by the peptide match application of the protein information resource pir where unipept is restricted for use with tryptic_peptides peptide
