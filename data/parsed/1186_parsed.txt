genome_analysis cosmos python_library for massively_parallel workflows efficient workflows to shepherd clinically generated gen omic_data through the multiple_stages of a next generation sequen_cing pipeline are of critical importance in translational biomedical_science here we present cosmos a python_library for workflow management that allows formal description of pipelines and partitioning of jobs in addition it includes a user_interface for tracking the progress of jobs abstraction of the queuing system and fine_grained control over the workflow workflows can be created on traditional computing clusters as well as cloud_based services availability_and source_code is available for academic non commercial research_purposes links to code and documentation are provided at http lpm hms harvard edu and http wallthe growing deluge of data from next generation sequencers leads to analyses lasting hundreds_or of compute hours per specimen requiring massive computing clusters or cloud infrastructure existing computational_tools like pegasus and more recent efforts like galaxy and bpipe allow the creation and execution of complex workflows however few projects have succeeded in describing complicated workflows in a simple but powerful language that generalizes to thousands of input_files fewer still are able to deploy workflows onto distributed resource management systems drms such as platform load_sharing facility lsf or sun_grid that stitch together clusters of thousands of compute cores here we describe cosmos a python_library developed to address these and other needs
