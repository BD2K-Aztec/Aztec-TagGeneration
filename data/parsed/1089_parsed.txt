bioinformatics_discovery compound cis_regulatory with both boundary and enhancer sequences in the human_genome motivation it has been suggested that presumably distinct classes of genomic regulatory_elements may actually share_common sets of features and mechanisms however there has been no genome_wide assessment of the prevalence of this phenomenon results to evaluate this possibility we performed a bioinformatic screen for the existence of compound regulatory_elements in the human_genome we identified numerous such colocated boundary and enhancer_elements from human cd t cells we report evidence that such compound regulatory_elements possess unique chromatin features and facilitate cell_type functions related to inflammation and immune_response in cd several types of cis_regulatory have been identified and classified they include well defined elements such as transcriptional promoters enhancers boundary elements and enhancerblocking insulators they also include the less discernable elements like silencers promoter tethering elements and locus control regions among all cis_regulatory enhancers exhibit the highest flexibility and modularity mechanistically enhancers recruit transcription_factors which can loop over long genomic distances to reach promoters thereby giving enhancers the ability to influence the expression of distal genes this long_range capacity of enhancers can however be inhibited by boundary elements particularly enhancerblocking insulators this boundary element insulating activity protects genes in domains located on the active sides of boundaries against activating or repressive regulatory_effects of both flanking and distant domains in this way enhancer blocking insulators play_a in facilitating the specificity of interactions between enhancers and genes_located in the same chromosomal domains as such boundaries and enhancers have hitherto been considered to be functionally antagonistic and thus to occupy distinct and separate loci in the genome to date no genomic_loci have been reported to simultaneously encode the functional_capacities of both enhancers and boundaries on a genome_wide scale nevertheless it has previously been suggested that boundaries and enhancers might actually use a common set of regulatory_features and strategies and more generally that many of the accepted distinctions between classes of regulatory_elements may be overstated considering this possibility together with the coordinated regulatory_activities of boundaries and enhancers we sought to evaluate whether there actually exist colocated compound boundary enhancer loci in the human_genome we found that numerous compound boundary enhancer loci do in fact exist in the human_genome and have epigenetic and regulatory_features that are distinct from those seen for individual regulatory_elements of either class
