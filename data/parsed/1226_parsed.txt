systems_biology cyclus d a cytoscape_plugin for clustering network_motifs in integrated networks network_motifs in integrated molecular_networks represent functional_relationships between distinct data types they aggregate to form dense topological structures corresponding to functional_modules which cannot be detected by traditional graph clustering_algorithms we developed cyclus d a cytoscape_plugin for clustering composite three node network_motifs using a d spectral_clustering availability via the cytoscape_plugin manager orin systems_biology the cell is modeled as an integrated_network with multiple types of interactions e g proteinprotein protein dna proteinmetabolite or genetic_interactions cellular_functions are carried_out by independently functioning units called modules which in graph_theoretical terms correspond to clusters of densely_connected nodes and a multitude of algorithms have been developed to identify such clusters in undirected graphs a major_problem remains how to harness the multilayered information contained in different interaction networks in order to identify biologically more realistic topological modules in the naive_bayes approach multiple interaction types are overlayed to create a single integrated association_network which can be clustered by traditional means in the samba approach heterogeneous data types are merged in a single bipartite gene property graph in which modules are defined as dense subgraphs while samba has the advantage of preserving the identity of each interaction type information is inevitably lost by representing complex_networks as bipartite graphs we developed cyclus d a cytoscape_plugin for the identification of modules in integrated networks which uses network_motifs to query a d spectral_clustering network_motifs are frequently occuring subgraphs in regulatory or integrated networks which aggregate to form topological modules each network motif defines a relationship between heterogeneous data types with a distinct information_processing role or functional_interpretation hence cyclus d identifies modules composed of multiple interaction types which reflect regulatory signaling or compensatory pathway mechanisms in addition to the stable protein_complexes found by traditional clustering_algorithms to illustrate the workflow of cyclus d postfix for dimensional clustering in cytoscape we imported an integrated_network of physical genetic and signaling interactions between kinases and phosphatases in yeast data available as supplementary_material in the cyclus d control panel a query motif and one or more input networks are selected interaction types are assigned to each edge and a value for the resolution parameter r p cf section and the minimal number of motif instances in a cluster are set an edge type is inferred to be directed if the edge in the motif it is assigned to is directed the resolution parameter allows to vary the typical size and density of a cluster at low r the aggregation score is maximized by large sets of loosely connected motifs while at high values high_scoring motif clusters are small and dense in our experience the intermediate value r balances size and density and is recommended as a starting value see_supplementary after running the algorithm cyclus d opens a new network containing all clustered motifs for instance shows all clusters of genetically interacting copointing kinases with the settings of by right clicking on a node of interest we can create new networks for the clusters containing this node while through the cyclus d entry in the plugins menu new networks can be created for all clusters by default edges in multicluster networks are colored by their cluster membership cluster view while in single cluster networks they are colored by interaction type with the colors matching the edge assignments in the control panel interaction view via the vizmapper panel the user can easily switch between these two visual styles multiple motifs can be clustered sequentially and newly found clusters either are added to or replace the existing clustered network to add them all query motifs must be formed from subsets of the same three edge types and the interaction view will be updated to the latest edge assignment by integrating heterogeneous types of molecular_interaction data cyclus d identifies modules which reflect regulatory signaling or compensatory functions which are not found by clustering each network in isolation the underlying algorithms are highly_efficient and allow further extension in particular future versions will extend cyclus d toward higher dimensional motifs with applications in the domain of network_alignment and comparison
