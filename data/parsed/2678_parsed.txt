layercake a tool for the visual comparison of viral deep sequencing_data the advent_of ngs has created unprecedented_opportunities to examine viral_populations within individual hosts among infected_individuals and over time comparing sequence_variability across viral_genomes allows for the construction of complex population structures the analysis of which can yield powerful biological_insights however the simultaneous display of sequence_variation coverage depth and quality_scores across thousands of bases presents a unique visualization challenge that has not been fully met by current ngs_analysis tools results here we present layercake a self contained visualization_tool that allows for the rapid analysis of variation in viral ngs_data layercake enables the user to simultaneously visualize variations in multiple viral_populations across entire genomes within a highly customizable framework drawing attention to pertinent and interesting patterns of variation we have successfully deployed layercake to assist with a variety of different genomics datasets availability_and program downloads and detailed instructions are available atcomparative sequence_analysis can reveal evolutionary_relationships that could otherwise not be discerned sequence_comparisons can also identify signatures of natural_selection and when analyzed in conjunction with appropriate phenotypic_data can be used to infer the pressures driving selection_processes prior to the arrival of next_generation ngs comparative_sequence was largely restricted to the comparison of consensus_sequences i e sequences represented by the most abundant nucleotide at a given position in a particular sample the limitations of consensus level sequence analyses are particularly apparent when examining rna_viruses as samples often contain a highly_heterogeneous swarm of mutantsthe diversity of which cannot be represented by a consensus_sequence ngs yields thousands of short_reads that together represent the full diversity of virus sequences in a sample the assembly of these sequencing_reads using either a pre determined reference or a reference assembled de_novo from the reads themselves allows for the reconstruction of coding complete viral_genomes with the detection of nucleotide variants that exist in as little as of a viral_population with this paradigm it is now possible to overlay useful information such as nucleotide polymorphisms polymorphism frequencies and sequencing_coverage depth onto every position of a whole_genome consensus_sequence conveying the read_depth at each position in conjunction with the above information creates a large multi_dimensional matrix which can be difficult to display visually in a manner that is compared especially when the virus in question has a high degree of intra sample sequence_variability however it is in precisely these contexts that a visualization_tool can be most useful for evaluating variation across genomes relevant to the discussion of genomic sequence_variability is the notion of a sample rather than a sequence of nucleotides an individual sample contains the population of nucleotides observed at different locations along a genome derived from ngs_data these populations can be compared to a reference_sequence or reference_population see section to define a certain proportion of variability at each location by visualizing different samples simultaneously we can observe change in variability over time if we take multiple samples from the same infected organisms but at different time points or observe subgroups within a particular virus if we take samples from multiple_organisms and compare them in both cases the analyst compares multiple samples at once we have therefore developed the layercake visualization_tool to address the problem of visualizing sequence_variability in viral_populations in layercake samples are visualized as a colored row or layer in a single view with variability and confidence information_encoded as color layercake automatically aggregates regions of the genome into discrete bins the size of which can be controlled by the user this design allows viewers to immediately receive an overview of the entire dataset and quickly locate regions of interest within or among samples zooming and side displays allow the user to retrieve detailed nucleotide level statistics with a single click interaction allows the user to adjust the aggregation update the metrics used to define variation or update metrics related to data_quality or importance in this article we describe the layercake system in detail contextualizing its design with respect to other visual_analytics tools for genomics and presenting case studies of how layercake has been used in multiple genomic analysis settings we expand upon the initial layercake prototype detailed in supporting a more robust model of sequencing_data the capacity to deal with multiple_settings of references and pseudo references and adaptation to more general datasets the layercake system has been widely deployed across a number of viral datasets in this section we highlight three case studies that highlight the benefits of the layercake system the presentation of a genome_scale overview of data the ability to interactively alter notions of reference and variation and the alignment and aggregation of many samples in a single all encompassing display in addition to finding regions of high variation as described in layercake affords longitudinal comparison of variation as in and allows for the identification of subgroups with similar variation signatures as in section
