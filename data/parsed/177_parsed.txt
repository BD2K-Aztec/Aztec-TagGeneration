gene_expression a hidden_markov support_vector framework incorporating profile geometry learning for identifying microbial rna in tiling_array data motivation rna expression signals detected by high_density genomic tiling microarrays contain comprehensive transcriptomic information of the target_organism current methods for determining the rna transcription_units are still computation intense and lack the discriminative_power this article_describes an efficient and accurate methodology to reveal complicated transcriptional architecture including small_regulatory in microbial transcriptome profiles results normalized microarray_data were first subject to support_vector to estimate the profile tendency by reducing noise interruption a hybrid supervised machine_learning algorithm hidden_markov support_vector was then used to classify the underlying state of each probe to expression or silence with the assumption that the consecutive state sequence was a heterogeneous markov_chain for model construction we introduced a profile geometry learning method to construct the feature_vectors which considered both intensity profiles and changes of intensities over the probe spacing also a robust strategy was used to dynamically evaluate and select the training_set based only on prior computer gene_annotation the algorithm performed better than other methods in accuracy on simulated_data especially for small expressed regions with lower snr signal_to hence more sensitive for detecting small_rnas availability_and detail implementation steps of the algorithm and the complete result of the transcriptome_analysis for a microbial genome porphyromonas_gingivalis w can be viewed atcurrent microarray manufacturing technology can synthesize millions of oligonucleotide_probes in situ on a single microscopic glass_slide this great capacity of probes allows the design of genomic tiling microarrays containing probes covering both sense and antisense strands with a great frequency for most microbial_genomes to whom correspondence should be addressed as well as many eukaryotic_genomes these high_density genomic tiling arrays can be used to detect the expression for all rna species including protein_coding and non_coding ncrnas although becoming popular the data analysis for expression data obtained from the high_density tiling microarrays remains to be challenging a fundamental task is how to precisely identify expression from noisy background one common approach has been to segment the probe signals along the genomic_coordinates the assumption of this approach is that intensities within a transcript distribute as gaussian_noise thus the breakpoints detected by the abrupt changes between two adjacent segments may represent the boundaries of the rna_transcripts a segmentation_algorithm was developed to model the signal distribution that fitted gaussian_noise finding an optimal set of breakpoint locations that minimized the sum of squared residuals was accomplished by the dynamic_programming with a fixed number of segments however it is not robust to estimate the total number of segments also long computation time o n s was required where s is the number of segments and n is the genome_size for this attempted to simplify the complexity of the algorithm with fixed maximum_length l of segment and reduced the computation time to o nls the determination of expression status for each segment relied however on a fixed cutoff value which may overlook rna with low expression_level a supervised_learning algorithm using hidden_markov hmms has been introduced to directly distinguish transcribed and non transcribed regions this approach successfully incorporated validated biological_knowledge into the model instead of only considering the signal distribution that might be biased by noises or system errors by given a training_set hmms constructs a probabilistic_model that connects the hidden_states to the observables as well as to the adjacent states viterbi algorithm is then used to compute the most likely hidden state sequence however higher_order hmms are known to be a better model to describe the dependency between neighbors than typical first order hmms although it has not been applied widely due to the complexity and computational_demands in addition several limitations of the conventional hmms havepage
