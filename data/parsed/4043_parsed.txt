rnaseqmetadb a database and web_server for navigating metadata of publicly_available mouse rna_seq gene_targeting is a protocol for introducing a mutation to a specific gene in an organism because of the importance of in vivo assessment of gene function and modeling of human_diseases this technique has been widely_adopted to generate a large number of mutant mouse_models due to the recent breakthroughs in high_throughput rna_seq experiments have been performed on many of these mouse_models leading to hundreds of publicly_available datasets to facilitate the reuse of these datasets we collected the associated metadata and organized them in a database called rnaseqmetadb the metadata were manually_curated to ensure annotation consistency we developed a web_server to allow easy database navigation and data querying users can search the database using multiple parameters like genes diseases tissue_types keywords and associated publications in order to find datasets that match their interests summary_statistics of the metadata are also presented on the web_server showing interesting global patterns of rna_seq studies availability_and freely_available on the web at http rnaseqmetadb gene_targeting a powerful technique used to manipulate a specific locus in the genome of an organism is an indispensable tool for assessing in vivo functions of specific gene_products this technique provides great flexibility in manipulating the genome of an organism as it can be used to delete a gene or an exon to introduce an exogenous gene or to create point_mutations moreover gene_targeting not only can introduce permanent mutations but can also conditionally change targeted genes thousands of genetically_engineered have been generated using this technique they provide valuble models for studying mechanisms of human_diseases rna_seq a high_throughput hts method for transcriptome_analysis has been successfully used on many of these mouse_models enabling global analyses of specific genomic_alterations at a high sequencing_depth with a resonable accuracy as rna_seq becomes increasingly popular hundreds of rna_seq have been generated and have been released to the public these data are currently available from online repositories such asgene expression omnibus geo arrayexpress sequence_read and european nucleotide archive ena whose primary purposes are to store raw and processed hts_data from a wide_variety however a data submitter typically provides only limited metadata for each dataset sufficient to get the dataset accepted into the public repository there is currently no stringent and uniform quality check of submitted metadata this results in inconsistency and ambiguity in dataset annotation for example non official gene symbols are used in some of the datasets other public_databases such as insilico db also suffer from the same problems making searching for datasets in these databases inefficient the recent hts_data explosion has motivated researchers to create several metadata databases however these databases e g cistromemap focus primarily on chip_seq to fill the gap for rna_seq we collected rna_seq metadata from all the publicly_available datasets that were generated using mouse_models mostly with targeted mutations and curated a database called rnaseqmetadb recently suggested that measuring transcription_factor binding might not be the best way to decipher transcriptional_regulatory instead their work showed that gene_expression data could be of greater value in revealing functional gene regulatory relations therefore rnaseqmetadb may be a helpful resource for researchers trying to build gene_regulatory we developed a web_server to provide a user_friendly query interface for locating relevant rna_seq based on targeted gene names disease names tissue_types keywords publications and accession ids etc an ontological search function is also offered that allows users to find the datasets related to but not necessarily annotated to the exact search_term this helps ensure search sensitivity e g see the help page on the website this database can help biomedical_scientists navigate the complex landscape of mouse genetic experiments and can provide rich contexts for these datasets using this database users will be able to find related datasets for further analyses easily for example rna_seq can be used to infer splicing isoform functions and information extracted from existing rna_seq can be used as prior_knowledge for causal reasoning on biological_networks moreover rna_seq can be integrated with sequence and structure binding_preferences of rnabinding proteins learned with computational_methods such as graphprot which can increase our understanding of the mechanisms of post_transcriptional rnaseqmetadb permits efficient searching of its database containing comprehensive_information for all public rna_seq on mice with genotype as a factor it contains metadata for a total of experiments targeting different genes these experiments are from different research groups among which are from the usa and are from europe for journals publishing the studies using these datasets nature ranks at the top with the greatest number of studies followed by proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united_states and genes and development one interesting observation is that the number of publications on rna_seq studies has been increasing exponentially since this indicates that rna_seq experiments on gene targeted mouse_models have become more popular in recent_years summary_statistics of the datasets are available at the database website rnaseqmetadb broadens the use of these datasets by providing well curated metadata and efficient query functionalities scientists can easily find the datasets that they are interested in and retrieve detailed information to enable more comprehensive understanding of the experiments in the future we will develop additional functionalities and import more datasets into the database we believe that rnaseqmetadb will be a valuable_tool for the biomedical research_community
