gene_expression rbsdesigner software for designing synthetic ribosome binding_sites that yields a desired_level of protein expression motivation rbsdesigner predicts the translation efficiency of existing mrna_sequences and designs synthetic ribosome binding_sites rbss for a given coding_sequence cds to yield a desired_level of protein expression the program implements the mathematical_model for translation_initiation described in na et_al mathematical_modeling of translation_initiation for the estimation of its efficiency to computationally design mrna_sequences with a desired expression_level in prokaryotes bmc syst biol the program additionally incorporates the effect on translation efficiency of the spacer length between a shinedalgarno sd sequence and an aug codon which is crucial for the incorporation of fmet trna into the ribosome rbsdesigner provides a graphical_user gui for the convenient design of synthetic rbss availability rbsdesigner is written in python and microsoft visual basic and is publicly_available as precompiled stand alone software on the web http rbs
