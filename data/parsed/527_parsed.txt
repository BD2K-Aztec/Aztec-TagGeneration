sequence_analysis assessing the relationship between conservation of function and conservation of sequence using photosynthetic proteins motivation assessing the false_positive of function prediction_methods is difficult as it is hard to establish that a protein does not have a certain function to determine to what extent proteins with similar sequences have a common function we focused on photosynthesis related proteins a protein that comes from a non photosynthetic organism is undoubtedly not involved in photosynthesis results we show that function diverges very rapidly of the close homologs of photosynthetic proteins come from non photosynthetic_organisms therefore high_sequence in most cases is not tantamount to similar function however we found that many functionally_similar proteins often share short sequence_elements which may correspond to a functional site and could reveal functional_similarities more accurately than sequence_similarity conclusions these results shed light on the way biological_function is conserved in evolution and may help improve large_scale analysis of protein_function homology is believed to allow large_scale functional_annotation since the th century similarity between biological_entities is defined as homology in case that they evolved from a common_ancestor and as analogy in case that they share a common function later definitions made these terms mutually_exclusive by defining analogy as convergence from two different ancestors historically these terms were introduced by naturalists and were based on anatomy and morphology on the molecular level however they are used more loosely and homology is often used interchangeably with sequence_similarity and is commonly believed to reflect similar function thus although the vast_majority of known proteins were never experimentally_characterized or even observed as rna_transcripts many of them have functional_annotations that are based on sequence_similarity to experimentally annotated proteins these predicted functions are often used to perform functional comparisons between genomes and to analyse metagenomic_data one such analysis reported that by using blast they were able to assign a function reliably to of the gene_products in new genomes despite the wide use of this approach the performance of homologybased methods for function prediction was rarely assessed systematically assessment of function prediction is sometimes considered not possible assumptions regarding the relationship between sequence_homology and functional analogy are difficult to assess many if not most of the proteins are multi_functional making existing annotations partial therefore when a predicted function does not correspond to an experimentally_verified function of a protein it is hard to determine_whether it is a false prediction or a true prediction of a yet unobserved function of that protein several collaborations and community_wide efforts have attempted to establish standards for assessment of computational annotation of protein_function the genome_annotation assessment project an early attempt at quality_assessment of genome_wide annotation concluded that function predictions are the most difficult annotations to produce and to evaluate and that owing to the incompleteness of existing annotation a consistent and correct assessment of function predictions was not possible casp which was originally designed to assess structure_prediction has widened its scope to assess also the function predictions the assessors concluded however that except for the identification of ligand_binding residues which is in essence structural they could not find a procedure that allows quantitative assessment of performance afp cafa another community_wide effort to establish a framework for assessing function prediction was held five times since the organizers based their experiments on proteins whose functions were experimentally_determined but not yet published assessment is based on measuring the distance between predicted and experimental annotations on the gene_ontology go graph the benchmark sets that were established using this approach are small and do not allow for statistically_significant assessment the lack of clear definition of function is also a major_drawback in assessing function prediction studies that have assessed sequence_similarity as a means for determining functional_similarity gave contradicting results some concluded that sequence_identity to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com or by other accounts do not allow for reliable functional inference similarly several studies have warned against blindly trusting homology as a proxy for functional identity studies that explored the potential for errors in genomic_scale computational annotations reported error_rates of between and motifs and patterns identify similarity that is not based on homology another widely used tool for function assignment is sequence_motifs domains and patterns using tools such as prosite interpro pfam mex or meme these tools typically provide a statistical measure for the significance of the specific motif similar to blasts e value for instance memes e value which is based on log likelihood_ratio width sites the background letter frequencies and the size of the training_set is an estimate of the expected number of motifs with the given log likelihood_ratio or higher and with the same width and site count that one would find in a similarly sized set of random_sequences typically these tools do not search for homology rather they assume that common sequence_motifs which may reveal very distant homology or may be convergent analogy constitute functional determinants biologically_important residues binding_sites or active_sites in the protein the precision and recall of pfam as a means for function prediction was assessed in one study together with that of psi_blast as a benchmark for a go based function prediction method several other studies analysed the relationship between sequence_similarity domain conservation and function prediction some of them concluded that tools such as prodom could reach accuracy of in their functional assignments function prediction of orfans is particularly difficult many possibly most known protein_sequences come from metagenomic_projects that produce sequences of unidentified species and include substantial numbers of orfans novel protein_families and remote_homologs to known proteins it has been suggested that metagenomic_data can shed new light on many biological_processes including photosynthesis ps as many marine_organisms are believed to be photosynthetic and their divergence from known terrestrial photosynthetic_organisms may be large indeed metagenomic_data have led to the identification of novel proteins that provide insights into ps identifying novel families of photosynthetic proteins that are not obvious homologs of known ps proteins is a non trivial task however when it comes to orfans the lack of homologs precludes the use of homology based_methods altogether ps provides a way to assess function prediction we focus our analysis on ps related functions not only for the importance of identifying novel photosynthetic proteins but also because they provide a way to assess functional assignments an assignment of photosynthetic annotation to a protein that comes from an organism that is not photosynthetic is without doubt an error thus it is possible to unequivocally identify false assignments and assess the possibility of finding novel photosynthetic families and remote_homologs to known ps related proteins we used go to compile a list of functions that are unique to ps i e go terms that describe functions which are essential to ps but are also part of other biological_processes were not included in the analysis see section we also created a non redundant set of proteins that were experimentally_verified to be involved in ps finally we identified all pfam domains that are related to ps these lists of proteins go terms and pfam domains allowed us to assess function assignments by pfam blast and psi_blast in addition using meme we generated a list of short motifs characters for the experimentally_verified ps proteins and used these motifs to predict the functions of new proteins we thus explore conservation of function by assessing the performance of widely used methods that rely on completely different biological rationales
