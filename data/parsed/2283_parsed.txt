identification of chemogenomic features from drug_target interaction networks using interpretable classifiers motivation drug effects are mainly caused by the interactions between drug molecules and their target_proteins including primary targets and off targets identification of the molecular_mechanisms behind overall drugtarget_interactions is crucial in the drug_design process results we develop a classifier based_approach to identify chemogenomic features the underlying associations between drug_chemical and protein_domains that are involved in drugtarget_interaction we propose a novel algorithm for extracting informative chemogenomic features by using l regularized classifiers over the tensor product space of possible drugtarget_pairs it is shown that the proposed method can extract a very limited number of chemogenomic features without loosing the performance of predicting drugtarget_interactions and the extracted_features are biologically_meaningful the extracted substructuredomain association_network enables us to suggest ligand chemical fragments specific for each protein domain and ligand core substructures important for a wide_range of protein_families

yyamanishi l binary drug phenotypic_effects are caused by the interactions between drug molecules and their target_proteins including their primary targets and off targets polypharmacology the idea that drug phenotypic_effects are not due only to its primary target but rather to its whole spectrum of interactions tends to become a new paradigm in drug_design it is important to identify the molecular_mechanisms behind overall drugtarget_interactions or more generally compound protein interactions leading to many applications at different levels of the drug_design process there is a hypothesis that polypharmacology is strongly involved in both drug_chemical and protein functional sites so there is a strong to whom correspondence should be addressed incentive to develop new methods to explore the association between drug_chemical and protein functional sites in terms of drugtarget_interactions docking or ligandbased approach e g qsar have been proposed to analyze and predict interactions with respect to a single protein so these methods cannot be applied to mine ligandprotein pairs across many different proteins chemogenomics is an emerging_research area that attempts to associate the chemical_space of possible ligands with the genomic space of possible proteins following this principle several statistical_methods have been proposed to predict drugtarget or ligand protein interactions on a large_scale these methods are purely predictive and do not provide any further understanding of molecular_mechanisms behind ligandprotein interactions drugtarget_interactions are due to drug_chemical and protein functional sites beyond the ligandprotein interaction prediction_problem a variety of methods have been proposed to investigate the correlation between chemical substructures biological_activities and phenotypic_effects several methods based on binding_pockets comparison have been proposed but they require the knowledge of protein d structures which is not genome_wide available however most previous_works have been performed from the viewpoint of either chemical substructures or protein functional sites one of the most challenging issues in recent chemogenomic research is to identify the underlying associations between drug_chemical and protein functional sites which are involved in drugtarget_interaction recently a variant of sparse canonical correspondence_analysis scca has been proposed to extract sets of chemical substructures and protein_domains governing drugtarget_interactions but the variation of detectable protein_domains is very limited the use of both graph mining and sequence mining has been proposed to extract drug substructures and protein subsequences which tend to appear in known drugtarget_interactions however the size of extracted subsequences is very small e g two or three amino_acids which makes biological_interpretation difficult and any prediction framework for new interactions based on the extracted_features was not provided in this article we develop a classifier based_approach to identify chemogenomic features the underlying associations between drug_chemical and protein_domains which are strongly involved in drugtarget_interaction we propose a novel algorithm for extracting informative chemogenomic features by using l regularized classifiers over the tensor product space of possible drugtarget_pairs in the results we show that the proposed method can extract a very limited number of chemogenomic features without loosing the performance of predicting drugtarget_interactions we underline that the extracted chemogenomic features are biologically_meaningful and discuss how the method can help the drug_development process the extracted substructuredomain association_network enables us to suggest ligand chemical fragments specific for each protein domain and ligand core substructures important for a wide_range of protein_families
