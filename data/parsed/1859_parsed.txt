gene_expression flyexpress visual mining of spatiotemporal_patterns for genes and publications in drosophila embryogenesis images containing spatial expression_patterns illuminate the roles of different genes during embryogenesis in order to generate initial clues to regulatory_interactions biologists frequently need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at specific locations in a developing embryo as well as related research publications however text_based mining of image annotations and research_articles cannot produce all relevant results because the primary data are images that exist as graphical objects we have developed a unique knowledge_base flyexpress to facilitate visual mining of images from drosophila_melanogaster embryogenesis by clicking on specific locations in pictures of fly embryos from different stages of development and different visual projections users can produce a list of genes and publications instantly in flyexpress each queryable embryo picture is a heat map that captures the expression_patterns of more than genes and more than published_articles in addition one can view spatial_patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes with similar expression_patterns at a given developmental_stage therefore flyexpress is a unique tool for mining spatiotemporal expression_patterns in a format readily_accessible to the scientific_community
