genome_analysis gpviz dynamic visualization of genomic_regions and variants affecting protein_domains gpviz is a versatile java_based software for dynamic gene centered visualization of genomic_regions and or variants user_defined data can be loaded in common formats as resulting from analysis workflows used in sequencing_applications and studied in the context of the gene the corresponding transcript_isoforms proteins and their domains or other protein features both the genomic_regions and variants can be also defined interactively various gene filter options are provided to enable an intersection of variants gen_omic regions and affected protein features finally by using gpviz we identified differentially_expressed exons which could indicate alternative_splicing and found somatic variants in different cancer_types affecting metabolic proteins gpviz is freely_available icbi at gpviz released under gnu_general is based on java and can be used as a stand alone or web start application recently emerging high_throughput enable the detection of mutations and genomic_variants single_nucleotide from exome or whole_genome sequencing_data and the identification of differentially_expressed exons or transcripts from rnaseq_data several tools are available for mapping features to the genome including subsequent visualization e g integrative_genomics to functionally interpret the data it is necessary to analyze and visualize variants or other genomic_features also in the context of proteins and protein_domains algorithms like sorting intolerant from tolerant sift or polyphen and other functional impact metrics allow prediction of the effect of variants i e nssnps and amino_acid on protein functions see recent review music can be applied to perform a proximity analysis of mutations another application allows domain mapping of disease mutations and within the ensembl protein summary view reported mutations can be visualized in the context of protein_domains alternative_splicing and exons can be analyzed and visualized using altanalyze and domain graph the web_application that covers a number of intended issues to visualize genes transcripts and protein_domains or other features is fancygene finally there are a number of further possibilities for visualization of multidimensional genomic and sequencing_data to the best of our knowledge an interactive tool for visualization of differentially_expressed exons or defined genomic_regions and nucleotide variants in the context of gene structure transcript variants and encoded_proteins is still missing to close this gap we developed gpviz a versatile java_based software which enables this visualization based on the gene and transcript structure genomic_coordinates of exons gene protein and domain annotations all data can be customized by the user because gpviz is developed as a visualization_tool to be used for any application and organism we additionally provide test datasets considering the latest genome_assembly of human and mouse and annotation from refseq and ensembl to demonstrate how gpviz can be used two case studies were analyzed step_by see_supplementary briefly rnaseq analyses using applications like dexseq or exon array analyses result in a list of differentially_expressed exons gpviz analysis enabled the selection of candidate exons to distinguish between transcript_isoforms indicating alternative_splicing as well as filtering and visualization of exons affecting protein_domains in the second case study we could show that somatic_mutations in different cancer_types might affect metabolic_enzymes and therefore alter cancer metabolism a representative example of a somatic_mutation in the gene isocitrate_dehydrogenase idh amino_acid position occurring in acute_myeloid is shown in using an additional sample showed that this mutation_occurs also in other cancer_types i e rectal_adenocarcinoma
