genome_analysis genplay multi genome a tool to compare and analyze_multiple human_genomes in a graphical_interface parallel visualization of multiple individual human_genomes is a complex endeavor that is rapidly gaining importance with the increasing number of personal phased and cancer_genomes that are being generated it requires the display of variants such as snps indels and structural_variants that are unique to specific genomes and the introduction of multiple_overlapping gaps in the reference_sequence here we describe genplay multi genome an application specifically written to visualize and analyze_multiple human_genomes in parallel genplay multi genome is ideally_suited for the comparison of allele_specific and functional gen omic_data obtained from multiple phased genomes in a graphical_interface with access to multiple track operation it also allows the analysis of data that have been aligned to custom genomes rather than to a standard reference and can be used as a variant_calling format file browser and as a tool to compare different genome_assembly such as hg and hg allele specific analyses which are much more powerful when they are performed on phased genomes can shed light onto myriad questions related to genotype_phenotype parental imprinting x_chromosome dna_methylation dna_replication and chromatin_structure most genomes produced to date are unphased but technology is now available to reliably generate phased genomes one current difficulty in performing allele specific analysis is the lack of software to visualize and compare expression epigenetic and other functional_genomics data obtained from multiple phased genomes visualization of such data is difficult because of the presence of large number of indels and structural_variants in humans genplay multi genome a major update to genplay was developed to help resolve some of these problems genplay is a multi_platform active genome_browser and analyzer written in java as other browsers genplay can display rna_seq chip_seq methyl seq or timex seq and a variety of dna_sequence and annotation tracks in addition genplay is unique because it can rapidly transform any loaded data using pre programmed operations once the meta reference_genome is computed genplay can display the genetic_variants present in all of the loaded genomes insertions that are present in only some of the genomes are replaced by synchronization blocks and supplementary inversions are displayed as the sum of a deletion plus an insertion filters are available to select variants according to any of the fields present in the vcf file genotype phasing allele depth quality value genotype probability etc filters can be combined to create complex filters in multi genome mode genplay becomes a powerful vcf file browser that can be used to visualize the structure of multiple_genomes in a graphical_interface genplay also allows users to visualize analyze and to whom correspondence should be addressed
