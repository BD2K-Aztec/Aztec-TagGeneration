systems_biology inca a computational platform for isotopically non stationary metabolic_flux c flux analysis studies have become an essential component of metabolic_engineering research the scope of these studies has gradually expanded to include both isotopically steady_state and transient labeling experiments the latter of which are uniquely applicable to photosynthetic_organisms and slow to label mammalian_cell isotopomer network compartmental analysis inca is the first publicly_available software_package that can perform both steady_state metabolic_flux and isotopically non stationary metabolic_flux the software provides a framework for comprehensive analysis of metabolic_networks using mass_balances and elementary metabolite unit balances the generation of balance equations and their computational solution is completely automated and can be performed on networks of arbitrary complexity availability_and matlab p code files are freely_available use and can be downloaded at http mfa vueinnovations com
