data_and a hybrid_approach to extract protein_protein motivation proteinprotein_interactions ppis play_an in understanding biological_processes although recent research in text_mining has achieved a significant progress in automatic ppi extraction from literature performance of existing_systems still needs to be improved results in this study we propose a novel algorithm for extracting ppis from literature which consists of two phases first we automatically categorize the data into subsets based on its semantic properties and extract candidate ppi pairs from these subsets second we apply support_vector svms to classify candidate ppi pairs using features specific for each subset we obtain promising results on five benchmark_datasets aimed bioinfer hprd iepa and lll with f scores ranging from to which are comparable with the state of the art ppi extraction systems furthermore our system achieves the best performance on cross corpora evaluation and comparative performance in terms_of availability the source_code and scripts used in this article are available for academic use atextraction of proteinprotein_interactions ppis from literature is an important research_topic in the field of biomedical natural_language nlp numerous ppis have been manually_curated and stored into databases such as bind hdpr and intact however this task has been proven time and resource consuming as a consequence most data on ppis can only be found in literature several approaches for extracting ppis from biomedical_text have been reported these methods range from co occurrence to more sophisticated machine_learning ml systems augmented by nlp techniques co occurrence is the simplest approach which results in high recall but low precision rule or pattern based_approaches can increase precision but significantly_lower recall in addition these rule sets are derived from training data and are therefore not always applicable to other data they are not developed for to whom correspondence should be addressed recently many ml based_methods have employed nlp techniques such as shallow parsing or full parsing since full parsing produces more elaborate syntactic information than shallow parsing ppi extraction systems based on full parsing can potentially yield better results the output of the parser can be represented either as constituent trees or dependency trees in this case the ppi extraction task is treated as a binary classification_problem which requires a formal protein pair representation and a suitable ml method a protein pair an instance can be represented by a set of features which are derived from the sentence or its syntactic structure a ml method is then used to distinguish between positive_and instances many linguistic features and ml methods have been proposed for the ppi extraction task based on feature_types these approaches can be divided_into three groups the first group focuses on lexical and word context features designed a subsequence kernel which uses the following information in a sentence before the first protein between two proteins and after the second protein and combined these features to obtain patterns extended this approach by using a bag ofwords bows and adding a local_context kernel the second group exploits syntactic features of a sentence used various syntactic path features and context features related to words before between and after two interacting entities proposed a method based on information found in the predefined levels of the dependency trees such as local dependency contexts of the protein_names and trees roots enhanced previous work by proposing a walk kernel which explores the shortest dependency path between two proteins and a modified dependency tree with the parts of speech pos features as an alternative to previous_approaches introduced an all paths graph_kernel they represented a sentence with a dependency graph and considered dependencies connecting two entities outside the shortest_path as well as on the shortest_path along with the proposed methods also studied individual impact of a variety of feature_types on the ppi extraction task in addition a study ofhas shown that the accuracy of syntactic parsers also contributes to the overall performance of the ppi systems to compensate for the limitations of each individual feature_set and parser errors proposed a method that combines all the lexical and parsing features using multiple kernels and parsers their system achieved the state_ofthe performance on a number of benchmark_datasets however
