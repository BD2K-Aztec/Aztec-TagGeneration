genome_analysis scaffolding pre assembled_contigs using sspace de_novo tools play a main role in reconstructing genomes from next_generation ngs_data and usually yield a number of contigs using paired_read sequencing_data it is possible to assess the order distance and orientation of contigs and combine them into so_called scaffolds although the latter process is a crucial step in finishing genomes scaffolding algorithms are often built in functions in de_novo tools and cannot be independently controlled we here present a new tool called sspace which is a stand alone scaffolder of pre assembled_contigs using paired_read data main features are a short runtime multiple library input of paired_end and or mate_pair datasets and possible contig extension with unmapped sequence_reads sspace shows promising results on both prokaryote and eukaryote genomic testsets where the amount of initial contigs was reduced by at least availability www baseclear com bioinformatics_tools the determination of the complete_genomic of a new species also called de_novo sequencing is an important nextgeneration_sequencing ngs application the task is to puzzle back millions of short_sequence into a limited set of contiguous sequences contigs although in practice the total number can be rather high this can partly be attributed to the presence of repetitive_elements on the genome paired_read sequencing_technology may help to reduce the amount of contigs as the known intermediate distance between read_pairs can be used to place contigs in their likely order and orientation the length of the resulting scaffolds or supercontigs also reflects the estimated distance between the initial contigs illumina for instance supports two types of pairedread libraries short insert paired_end and long insert mate_pairs the combination of these two types of data provides an ideal input for the scaffolding process as it can potentially resolve repetitive structures of various sizes nonetheless the majority of assembly tools provide a scaffolding option only as a built in function which cannot be independently controlled among which ssake abyss and soap to whom correspondence should be addressed to date only a few programs are able to scaffold pre assembled contig sequences a commonly used tool is bambus although it was not designed for the current_generation of sequencing_technologies we developed the sspace ssake based scaffolding of pre assembled_contigs after extension program to scaffold pre assemblies produced by any desired assembly tool the input is given by a set of contig sequences and illumina paired_read files the user can specify whether the paired_reads are used only for scaffolding or also for contig extension we compared our method to the abyss scaffolder on a bacterial escherichia_coli and fungal grosmannia clavigera both methods significantly reduce the number of contigs in a comparable manner although sspace achieves overall better results to prove the suitability of sspace also on large eukaryotic_genomes we tested its performance against soap on the giant panda genome_assembly we show that sspace is a valuable_tool for scaffolding pre assembled_contigs the performance of sspace was compared with the built in scaffolder of abyss on both the e coli and g clavigera dataset the contigs produced by abyss after its single_end assembly stage served as input for sspace for sspace we used two protocols one including and one excluding contig extension the outcomes are displayed in tables and notably the sspace protocols yield a lower amount of scaffolds and a significantly_higher n value it can also be observed that the inclusion of contigextension prior to scaffolding yields slightly less scaffolds we also assessed that the consistency between abyss and sspace results by evaluating the co occurrence of contig pairs in the two scaffold sets the results indicate that abyss and sspace produce comparable scaffolds additional results on the e coli dataset are displayed in supplementary table s analyses on the giant panda dataset were performed_similarly to the previous two sets here we used the scaffolds produced by soap to construct a set of unlinked contigs these were re scaffolded with sspace the results show that soap and sspace can concatenate a major fraction of the contigs intowe have shown that sspace is a powerful and effective standalone scaffolder sspace is able to scaffold large_genomes in a reasonable amount of time even when using huge datasets our method is suited both for prokaryotic and eukaryotic_genomes and in comparison with two built in scaffolders sspace achieves competitive results we demonstrate that applying contig extension prior to scaffolding can further enhance the outcomes importantly sspace is designed in a user_friendly manner and requires limited computation resources supplementary we think our method is a useful addition to present ngs de_novo tools in the automated reconstruction of genomic_sequences
