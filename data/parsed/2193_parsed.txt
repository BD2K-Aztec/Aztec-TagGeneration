sequence_analysis high_quality annotation of promoter_regions for bacterial_genomes motivation the number of bacterial_genomes being sequenced is increasing very rapidly and hence it is crucial to have procedures for rapid and reliable annotation of their functional_elements such as promoter_regions which control the expression of each gene or each transcription_unit of the genome the present work addresses this requirement and presents a generic method applicable across organisms results relative_stability of the dna double_helical sequences has been used to discriminate promoter_regions from non promoter_regions based on the difference in stability between neighboring regions an algorithm has been implemented to predict promoter_regions on a large_scale over microbial genome_sequences the average free_energy values for the promoter_regions as well as their downstream regions are found to differ depending on their gc_content threshold_values to identify promoter_regions have been derived using sequences flanking a subset of translation start sites from all microbial_genomes and then used to predict promoters over the complete_genome an average recall value of which indicates the percentage of protein and rna coding_genes with predicted promoter_regions assigned to them and precision of is achieved over the microbial genome dataset availability the binary executable for prompredict algorithm implemented in perl and supported on linux and ms windows and the predicted promoter data for all microbial_genomes are available at http nucleix mbu iisc ernet in prombase understanding the mechanism that regulates gene_expression and identifying the key regulatory_elements that aid gene_expression is a major_challenge in molecular_biology recent_advances in the highthroughput genome_sequencing has led to an exponential_growth in the number of completely_sequenced microbial_genomes and hence it is essential to have fast efficient and reliable computational_methods to identify annotate and tabulate the coding_regions and non coding functional_elements such as transcription_factor tfbss promoter and enhancer regions in these microbial_genomes the identification of the location and function of to whom correspondence should be addressed promoter_regions is very challenging because the promoter_regions in genomic_sequences very often do not adhere to specific sequence_patterns or motifs and are difficult to determine experimentally several motif_finding algorithms have been developed based on various motif models and their performance has been assessed whole_genome expression_profiles have also led to characterization of bacterial and archaeal transcriptomes these data can be used to validate the various promoter and dna binding_site prediction_algorithms developed based on sequence_motifs as well as those using structure based properties of dna most of the methods for the identification of promoter_regions are either specific to a particular genome or only aim to compare the properties of promoter_sequences with other regions in a general manner these protocols have not been applied over the entire set of microbial_genomes nor have the predictions been validated on a genomic_scale in particular most methods are unable to identify promoters for rna genes in our algorithm we have made use of the earlier_reported observation that promoter_regions in genome_sequences have several sequence_dependent structural_properties such as low stability high curvature and less bendability as compared with the flanking genomic_sequence among these lower stability which is calculated as the sum of the free_energy of constituent dinucleotide steps is found to be the most ubiquitous physicochemical property of promoter_regions a scoring_function was defined and an algorithm prompredict was developed to predict promoter_regions which used threshold_values specific to some select organisms namely escherichia_coli bacillus_subtilis and mycobacterium_tuberculosis here we briefly_summarize the modifications and improvements made on prediction methodology of prompredict in order to generalize it for predicting promoter_regions in all microbial_genomes and possibly even eukaryotic_genomes afe of dna_sequence is a well defined property that can be used to distinguish promoter_regions in a dna_sequence the afe profiles for promoter_sequences show a less stable region upstream of the tlss which are generally in close_proximity of the tsss when compared with the flanking genomic_sequences the afe values in the near vicinity of tss tls as well as in the flanking_regions vary depending on the gc composition of the whole region but the relative_stability is maintained these features have been used to derive threshold_values for identifying promoter_regions over whole genome_sequences promoter prediction using tss tlsbased cutoff_values yields high recall an average of without significantly affecting the precision average of when applied to annotation of microbial_genomes the comparison of recall and precision parameters obtained when prompredict is applied to e coli b subtilis and m tuberculosis with those obtained using other sequence_based nnpp and ppp indicate that overall our method performs better the algorithm thus appears to be robust and applicable to all prokaryotic_genomes regardless of their base_composition the prompredict algorithm and tss tlsbased cutoff_values can also be applied to other organisms and preliminary_studies to predict promoter_regions in plants as well as other eukaryotes show very promising results further this method can be combined with sequence_motif based_methods and used along with structural_properties such as curvature and bendability to improve the identification of promoter_regions in genomes
