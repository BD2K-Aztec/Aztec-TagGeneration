parsimony and likelihood reconstruction of human segmental_duplications motivation segmental_duplications kb in length with sequence_identity between copies comprise nearly of the human_genome they are frequently found in large contiguous regions known as duplication blocks that can contain mosaic patterns of thousands of segmental_duplications reconstructing the evolutionary_history of these complex genomic_regions is a non trivial but important task results we introduce parsimony and likelihood techniques to analyze the evolutionary_relationships between duplication blocks both techniques rely on a generic model of duplication in which long contiguous substrings are copied and reinserted over large physical distances allowing for a duplication block to be constructed by aggregating substrings of other blocks for the likelihood method we give an efficient dynamic_programming to compute the weighted ensemble of all duplication scenarios that account for the construction of a duplication block using this ensemble we derive the probabilities of various duplication scenarios we formalize the task of reconstructing the evolutionary_history of segmental_duplications as an optimization_problem on the space of directed_acyclic we use a simulated_annealing heuristic to solve the problem for a set of segmental_duplications in the human_genome in both parsimony and likelihood settings availability supplementary_information is available ata striking feature of mammalian_genomes is the prevalence of segmental_duplications or low_copy repeats approximately of the human genome_consists of segmental_duplications kb in length with sequence_identity between copies segmental_duplications account for a significant fraction of the differences between humans and other primate genomes and are enriched for genes that are differentially_expressed between the species segmental_duplications remain an extreme challenge for evolutionary reconstruction as they are the most structurally complex and dynamic regions of the human_genome human segmental_duplications are frequently found within complicated mosaics of duplicated fragments produced a comprehensive annotation of this mosaic organization they derived an alphabet of approximately duplicated segments or duplicons and delimited duplication blocks or strings of at least and to whom correspondence should be addressed typically dozens different duplicons found contiguously on a chromosome however the relationships between these annotated duplication blocks are complex and straightforward analysis does not immediately reveal the evolutionary_relationships between blocks numerous authors have considered the problem of analyzing relationships between genome_sequences that contain duplicated segments this work falls into roughly two categories the first focus is the problem of computing genome rearrangement distances like reversal distance in the presence of duplicated_genes or synteny_blocks for example however such rearrangement distances do not model the creation of new duplicates and thus are not well suited to describe the evolutionary_history of segmental_duplications in the genome the second focus is to analyze regions with duplications under local operations like tandem_duplications for example while tandem_duplication is undoubtedly important in the generation of duplication blocks there is strong evidence that an important characteristic of the history of segmental_duplications is the frequent duplication and transposition of long segments over large physical distances as many as of segmental_duplications were transposed interchromosomally several general models of rearrangement that allowed for both local operations and duplicationtranspositionlike operations between different strings were studied by but the generality of those models meant that the distances were np_hard to compute and only approximation algorithms were given here we present a novel formulation of the problem of computing an evolutionary_history for a set of segmental_duplications that are organized in duplication blocks we represent evolutionary_relationships between a set of duplication blocks as a directed_acyclic dag and we formalize the evolutionary reconstruction problem as an optimization over the space of dags we present two different methods for scoring a dag one based on parsimony and one based on likelihood the parsimony score for a dag is a straightforward extension of duplication distance a measure introduced by some of us that describes the most parsimonious sequence of duplicate operations needed to construct a given target string the likelihood_score for a dag is the product of the likelihood scores for each of the duplication blocks where a duplication blocks likelihood is derived by computing the weighted ensemble of all possible duplication scenarios that could have generated it we describe how to compute the partition_function of the ensemble efficiently using a dynamic program that generalizes the duplication distance i e parsimony score recurrence deriving a probabilistic_model from a dynamic program this way is analogous to theour maximum_parsimony and maximum_likelihood reconstructions show some differences both from each other and from the analysis of in particular we identify non core duplicons and subsequences that are arguably as promiscuous within a clade as core duplicons there are several directions for future work from a theoretical perspective one can incorporate other types of operations into the probabilistic_model such as deletions and inversions which we have described in the parsimony setting as well as single_nucleotide also our method could be used to sample over the space of dags using a markov_chain strategy from the perspective of applications a more comprehensive analysis of genes or other elements in the newly_identified core duplicons and core subsequences from our reconstruction is warranted as is a further refinement of the clade annotation by analyzing the clade induced subgraphs of the dags funding career award at the scientific
