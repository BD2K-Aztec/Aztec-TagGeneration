systems_biology robust design of microbial_strains motivation metabolic_engineering algorithms provide means to optimize a biological_process leading to the improvement of a biotechnological interesting molecule therefore it is important to understand how to act in a metabolic_pathway in order to have the best results in terms of productions in this work we present a computational framework that searches for optimal and robust microbial_strains that are able to produce target_molecules our framework performs three tasks it evaluates the parameter sensitivity of the microbial model searches for the optimal genetic or fluxes design and finally calculates the robustness of the microbial_strains we are capable to combine the exploration of species reactions pathways and knockout parameter spaces with the pareto optimality principle results our framework provides also theoretical and practical guidelines for design automation the statistical cross comparison of our new optimization procedures performed with respect to currently widely used algorithms for bacteria e g escherichia_coli over different multiple functions reveals good performances over a variety of biotechnological products metabolic_engineering is becoming central in basic and applied biological fields and requires mathematical_models for accurate design purposes the aim is overproducing desired metabolites by operating on genetic_manipulations as well as identifying novel and non native synthesis pathways many organisms are used to analyze the metabolite_production potential and identify the metabolic interventions needed to produce the metabolite of interest thus strains have been systematically designed through in silico analysis to overproduce target metabolites such as lycopene ethanol and isobutanol the efforts are particularly focused on predicting flux_distributions and network capabilities most notably flux_balance fba recent fba models incorporate also information on enzymes and genome and integrate the relationships among genes enzymes and reactions this makes it well suited to studies that characterize many different perturbations such as different substrates or genetic_manipulations knockouts in the past_years a variety of methods has been implemented to search for the genetic_manipulations that optimize a cellular function of interest these methods such as optknock optflux optgene and gdls have been tested in fba organism models however all these methods require high computational efforts the execution times grow_exponentially or linearly as the number of manipulations allowed in the final designs increases because of the large number of reactions occurring in the cellular_metabolism the dimension of the solution_space is very large and finding genetic_manipulations is quite expensive in this work we use a multi_objective algorithm to seek the genetic_manipulations that optimize multiple_cellular the algorithm implements a global search with a heuristic and combinatorial method called genetic design through multi_objective gdmo the idea is to use and improve the pareto_optimal pareto optimality is important to obtain not only a wide_range of pareto_optimal but also the best trade_off design as reported byfor the protein_structure prediction_problem moreover the multi_objective turns out to aid in the automatic design in several biological_problems the area underlying the pareto curve and the first derivative and in particular the presence of jumps i e quick variations in the objective_functions during the optimization procedure carry valuable biotechnological information for the first time we use the dominance analysis so as to consider all the solutions obtained by gdmo that are dominated with a tolerance by the pareto_optimal we report that multi_objective provides more insights than single objective optimization on the capability of these organisms to adapt to the simultaneous presence of different conditions and constraints we combine multiple target optimization with knockout parameter_space to investigate the most complete available metabolic data and search for the optimal nutrients in strains that allow the maximization or minimization of metabolic targets namely escherichia_coli geobacter sulfurreducens additionally we relate pathways to sensitivity analysis sa in modeling sa is a method used to discover the main inputs that is the inputs that have a substantial influence on the outputs of the model in the last years sa indices have been adopted in systems_biology interrogating the reactions space rosareactions oriented sa and species space sosaspecies oriented sa to find their influence on the outputs of the system in this work we perform sa to find the most sensitive pathways in the fba model of e coli in particular we present the novel pathway oriented sa posa to find the genetic_manipulations that have the largest influence on the output of the model unlike other sa methods applied in biological modeling whose inputs reactions or species are valued in a real region of interest posa is applied when inputs are valued in a binary region of interest posa investigates the knockout solution_space and determines the influence of the pathways on the outputs of an fba model since our search and optimize algorithm provides a set of feasible solutions with different genetic_manipulations it is worth seeking a relationship between the sensitivity indices and the proposed manipulations in this way we are able to select only the best manipulations in particular thanks to the information provided by posa we can choose the gdmo knockout strategies that affect genes belonging to insensitive pathways each point of the pareto front represents a strain i e an e coli with specific genetic_manipulations and it is also associated with three robustness analysis ra indices that we compute the robustness estimates how robust is a strain obtained by gdmo when it undergoes small_perturbations which can be external changes in the nutrients or internal changes in the metabolism among the strains proposed by gdmo we are able to choose the most robust one in particular we use three robustness methods to evaluate different components of the model
