automated gene model curation using global discriminative learning motivation gene model curation creates consensus gene models by combining multiple sources of protein_coding evidence that may be incomplete or inconsistent to date manual_curation still produces the highest quality models however manual_curation is too slow and costly to be completed even for the most important organisms in recent_years machine learned ensemble gene predictors have become a viable alternative to manual_curation current approaches make use of signal and genomic_region consistency among sources and some voting scheme to resolve conflicts in the evidence as a further step in that direction we have developed ecraig ensemble craig an automated curation tool that combines multiple sources of evidence using global discriminative training this allows efficient integration of different types of genomic evidence with complex statistical_dependencies to maximize directly annotation accuracy our method goes beyond previous work in integrating novel non linear annotation agreement features as well as combinations of intrinsic_features of the target_sequence and extrinsic annotation_features results we achieved significant improvements over the best ensemble predictors available for homo_sapiens caenorhabditis_elegans and arabidopsis_thaliana in particular ecraig achieved a relative mean improvement of over jigsaw the best published ensemble predictor in all our experiments availability the source_code and datasets are both available atensemble predictors are automated gene model curation tools that build gene models by combining conflicting and incomplete_information provided by multiple sources of coding evidence to date manual_curation still produces the highest quality annotations as it benefits from problem domain_knowledge of expert human curators that is difficult to build into gene predictors however manual_curation is slow and costly and has been unable to complete to whom correspondence should be addressed the annotation even for the most important organisms several methods of semi_automatic curation try to speed up manual_methods by automating the selection of good combinations of manually tuned evidence integration rules such methods include exonhunter eugene gaze and more recently augustus hints semi_automated gene annotation_pipelines also belong in this category ensembl and pairagon nscan est for example use expressed_sequence ests complementary dnas cdnas and automated predictions to find a consensus gene model in recent_years ensemble predictors based on machine_learning have become a viable alternative to manual or semi_automated methods these methods measure signal and genomic_region consistency among sources encoded as feature_vectors and use voting schemes to resolve evidence conflicts fully_automated learningbased ensemble predictors include the work of and jigsaw in particular jigsaw has performed favorably in multiple benchmark_datasets in comparison with the best semi_automated annotation_pipelines some learning based ensemble predictors require annotated sequences for training supervised methods others learn combination parameters to maximize agreement without needing annotated training data beyond what was used for individual sources of evidence unsupervised methods unsupervised methods such as glean and evigan are advantageous in cases where no manually_curated gene_annotations are available however they tend to perform less well than supervised ensemble predictors among supervised ensemble predictors the work of uses maximum_likelihood to learn the parameters of an inputoutput hidden_markov hmm that combines multiple gene predictions jigsaw is an improved version of combiner that uses a semi_markov structure model and a learning procedure that implicitly models dependencies of evidence sources given the input_sequence the main idea in combiner and jigsaw is to classify feature_vectors of the input sources as either accurate or inaccurate using decision_trees an accurate inaccurate vector is one that led to predictions that match the annotation in at least most half of the training_set the learned decision_trees partition the feature_space into accurate and inaccurate regions allowing the combiner to decide
