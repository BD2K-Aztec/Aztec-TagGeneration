sequence_analysis fusionmap detecting fusion_genes from next_generation data at base_pair resolution motivation next_generation generates high_throughput data which allows us to detect fusion_genes at both transcript and genomic levels to detect fusion_genes the current bioinformatics_tools heavily rely on paired_end approaches and overlook the importance of reads that span fusion junctions thus there is a need to develop an efficient aligner to detect fusion_events by accurate mapping of these junction spanning single reads particularly when the read gets longer with the improvement in sequencing_technology results we present a novel method fusionmap which aligns fusion reads directly to the genome without prior_knowledge of potential fusion regions fusionmap can detect fusion_events in both single and paired_end datasets from either rna_seq or gdna seq studies and characterize fusion junctions at base_pair resolution we showed that fusionmap achieved high_sensitivity in fusion_detection on two simulated rna_seq which contained nt paired_end fusionmap achieved substantially_higher sensitivity_and than the paired_end approach when the inner distance between read_pairs was small using fusionmap to characterize fusion_genes in k chronic_myeloid cell_line we further demonstrated its accuracy in fusion_detection in both single_end rna_seq and gdna seq datasets these combined results show that fusionmap provides an accurate and systematic solution to detecting fusion_events through junction spanning reads availability fusionmap includes reference indexing read filtering fusion alignment and reporting in one package the software is free for noncommercial use ata fusion_gene is a hybrid_gene by joining parts from two previously separate genes at transcript or genomic_level the importance of fusion_genes in cancer development has been well recognized to whom correspondence should be addressed since the discovery of the recurrent bcr_abl in chronic_myelogenous cml and tmprss_erg fusion_gene in solid_tumor fusion_genes are caused by chromosomal_aberrations e g inversion translocation large_deletion or insertion for example bcr_abl is formed by a translocation event involving chromosome and its fusion_transcript is translated into an abnormal tyrosine_kinase which plays_a in the development of cml these chromosomal_aberrations were traditionally detected through fluorescence_in fish or comparative_genomic cgh techniques arraycgh and snp_array were later developed to detect genomic copy_number at kb resolution in a high_throughput fashion compared to these techniques next_generation ngs generates base_pair resolution data which allows the detection and characterization of genomic_aberrations at more levels of details with ngs fusion_genes were detected using either genomic_dna gdnaseq or transcriptome_sequencing rna_seq in ngs_datasets fusion_genes can be detected based on both paired and single_end on the one hand paired_end bp generated from long fragments bp are shown to be useful in increasing the ability to detect fusion_events in a paired_end ngs dataset a discordant read_pair is one that is not aligned to the reference_genome with the expected distance or orientation if a set of discordant read_pairs are mapped to two different genes a fusion_gene is suggested computational_tools like fusionseq have been developed to detect fusion candidates by analyzing paired_end and removing spurious candidates using varied filters on the other hand single_end that span the fusion junctions provide basepair evidence for the fusion_events since sequencing_technology is improving rapidly the current usable read_length from the illumina_genome is typically in the range of nt and reaches nt using illuminas truseq sbs v ga kit long read_lengths not only increase the number of fusion junctionspanning reads but also allow us to align them unambiguously to the fusion junction moreover junction spanning reads can also be present in paired_end datasets they provide_additional identification of fusion_events in ngs dataset through junctionspanning reads fusion source and are from two different genes or genomic_regions for fusion_genes suggested by discordant read_pairs when the read_length is long or the inner distance the gap size between read_pairs is short the number of junction spanning reads would be larger than that of discordant read_pairs then fusion_detection based on junction spanning reads is more powerful than the paired_end approach one approach to detect fusion junction spanning reads is mapping the reads to a set of artificially constructed exonexon segments from potential fusion gene_pairs however such an approach relies on prior_knowledge of potential fusion regions and only identifies fusion junctions between known exons another approach is using splice aligners such as tophat splicemap and mapsplice to detect splice_junctions these alignment tools can split and map a read to different locations in a genome but only within local_regions usually kb they are not able to identify distant or inter chromosome fusion_genes therefore the development of a dedicated fusion aligner to align junction spanning reads is necessary for fusion_detection in this article we describe a new method fusionmap which detects and aligns fusion junction spanning reads to the reference_genome systematically fusionmap can be applied to both singleand paired_end datasets from either rna_seq or gdna seq studies during the fusion alignment fusionmap dynamically creates a pseudo fusion transcript_sequence library based on consensus junction sequences suggested by seed reads and then aligns the remaining full_length reads to this pseudo reference and supplementary the program reports a list of detected fusion junctions statistics of supporting reads fusion gene_pairs as well as genomic_locations of breakpoints and junction sequences which characterize fusion_genes comprehensively at base_pair resolution the fusionmap method described in this article allows us to align fusion junction spanning reads to references and can therefore fully utilize ngs_data to characterize fusion_genes at base_pair resolution the method achieves the following three goals in computational detection of fusion_genes using ngs_data first fusionmap performs a sensitive and complete search of fusion junction spanning reads without relying on any additional information it has the same detection_power in both singleand paired_end ngs_datasets in paired_end datasets the fusion report from junction spanning reads is complementary to that from discordant read_pairs moreover as shown by dataset p fusion_detection based on junction spanning reads is more powerful than the paired_end approach when the inner distance between read_pairs is short in theory for a set of nt paired_end generated from a bp_fragment library the ratio between the number of junction spanning reads and discordant read_pairs is close to the ratio will increase when the usable read_lengths increase with new sequencing_techniques or reagents making fusionmap more useful and effective second fusionmap can be applied to both gdna seq and rnaseq datasets compared to gdna seq datasets rna_seq is more complicated to detect fusion_genes due to the implication of exon exon_junctions in gdna seq fusion junctions detected are the actual fusion positions in the genome while junctions detected in rna_seq are more likely to be splice_junctions rather than genomic
