a bayesian_framework for de_novo mutation calling in parents offspring trios motivation spontaneous de_novo mutations play_an in the disease_etiology of a range of complex_diseases identifying de_novo mutations dnms in sporadic_cases provides an effective strategy to find genes or genomic_regions implicated in the genetics of disease high_throughput next_generation enables genome or exome wide detection of dnms by sequencing parents proband trios it is challenging to sift true mutations through massive amount of noise due to sequencing_error and alignment artifacts one of the critical limitations of existing_methods is that for all genomic_regions the same pre specified mutation_rate is assumed which has a significant impact on the dnm calling accuracy results in this study we developed and implemented a novel bayesian_framework for dnm calling in trios triodenovo which overcomes these limitations by disentangling prior mutation_rates from evaluation of the likelihood of the data so that flexible priors can be adjusted post_hoc at different genomic_sites through extensively simulations and application to real_data we showed that this new method has improved sensitivity_and over existing_methods and provides a flexible framework to further improve the efficiency by incorporating proper priors the accuracy is further improved using effective filtering based on sequence_alignment characteristics availability_and the c source_code implementing triodenovo is freely_available at https medschool vanderbilt edu cgg traditional research in the field of genetics for human complex disease has focused largely on inherited variation for sporadic_cases without family_history it is well known that de_novo copy_number are implicated in autism and other psychiatric_disease cost_effective next_generation ngs_technologies enable the identification of mutations at base_pair resolution and a flurry of recent_studies revealed important roles of de_novo point_mutations in the genetic_etiology of complex disease including autism_spectrum intellectual_disability schizophrenia these findings showed_promise of sequencing sporadic parents proband trios for genetics studies of human disease since de_novo mutations dnms have not been subject to strong purifying_selection causal_mutations are expected to have large effects enabling effective identification of causal_genes or pathways from a drastically_reduced number of candidates we envision that this strategy will continuously be used as an effective alternative to classical genetic_studies to identify genetic_factors through both exome and whole_genome a critical step in such studies is to accurately call dnms from sequencing this is challenging due to sequencing_error and alignment artifacts which predominately outnumber true mutations it is therefore important to develop methods that can effectively sift real mutations through massive amount of noise standard_approaches infer genotypes for each individual separately in a trio usually using gatk or samtools and identify putative dnms by comparing probands and parental genotypes more efficient joint calling methods have been developed including polymutt denovogear and were shown to outperform standard_approaches dramatically a major_limitation of these jointcalling methods is the entanglement of dnms with mendelian_inheritance in the same model such that the joint likelihood of the data depends on the pre specified mutation_rate resulting in several unappealing consequences first it requires specifying a prior mutation_rate which has strong influence on the mutation calling and therefore can result in loss of accuracy when inappropriate mutation_rates are used second it is well known that mutation_rates vary_widely across the genome and therefore any single pre specified mutation_rate is not optimal third the estimates for complex mutations such as short insertion and deletion indel and structural_variations are largely_unknown and an inappropriate rate may result in dramatically_reduced mutation calling efficiency lastly the evidence of mutations reported by these callers has a less intuitive interpretation because of the entanglement of the pre specified mutation_rate in the data likelihood calculation to overcome_these we developed a new de_novo calling algorithm triodenovo which is a bayesian_framework that evaluates evidence of dnm mainly based on the data and adjusts post_hoc the effect of mutation_rates on the calling through prior odds this is achieved through a bayesian model_selection approach in which it calculates the bayes_factor bf of two models namely m that the offspring harbors at least one mutation in the two alleles and m that the offsprings genotype follows mendelian transmission this approach of calculating de_novo evidence i e bf avoids the need for accurate specification of prior mutation_rates and has a natural interpretation as the relative likelihood of data under two competing and mutually_exclusive models after evaluating bf flexible prior mutation_rates can be adjusted post_hoc to get posterior odds of dnms for different sites and different mutation types according to prior_knowledge through extensively simulations and real_datasets we showed that the new framework improves sensitivity_and over existing_methods in detection of dnms especially for moderate depth of coverage e g coupled with our recently_developed method for effective filtering of alignment artifacts we hope that this new framework is useful to the research_community for accurate dnm calling to facilitate the identification of genetic_factors for human disease sequencing trios with sporadic affected offspring has enabled the demystification of certain rare_diseases and identification of genes implicated in complex_disorders such a strategy will continue to be employed to decipher the genetic_basis of disease in this study we developed an efficient and flexible framework to facilitate the dnm calling in parents proband trios the key_advantage of our new method is the decoupling of mutation_rates from evaluation of the data and the flexibility of adjusting the prior mutation odds posthoc irrelevant of the data this feature is important since dnm rates vary_widely across the genome and different classes of mutations exhibit varying mutation_patterns for example the mutation_rate for cpg_dinucleotides is fold that of non cpg bases it is evident that mutation_rates depend on multiple factors in a complex fashion and it is not clear how contributing_factors act together to influence the underlying mutations rate with more families being sequenced knowledge of dnms is being accumulated quickly so that genome_wide mutation_patterns can be soon accurately_assessed with such knowledge of prior mutation_rates triodenovo is expected to further facilitate the dnm calling for the research_community users have flexibility of adjusting the ranking of candidate_mutations based on their knowledge without re calling the mutations even in its simplest form with flat prior odds triodenovo outperformed existing stateof the art methods although tested on whole_genome triodenovo can be equally applicable to exome_sequencing the information used in triodenovo is the pileup of bases aligned to each of the positions in the genome and the alignment of reads from whole_genome and exome data has similar accuracy in that regard the quality_scores from triodenovo have a natural interpretability as a bf for example a dq value of indicates that the likelihood of mutation is times of that without mutation if a prior mutation_rate of is assumed the candidate shows reasonable evidence of being a true mutation and for a mutation_rate of a fold increase of likelihood is given to this candidate such an interpretation is intuitive and the adjustment does not require re calling on the other hand the posteriors from other methods e g denovogear and polymutt do not have such a natural interpretation these algorithms calculate the likelihood of data by a mixture of distributions of both mendelian transmissions m and dnms m in the same model the relative_contribution of m and m in the model is determined by the mutation_rate making the model sensitive to the pre specified prior moreover the relative ranking of candidates of denovogear calls could change for the same data when different priors were used which is rather undesirable tools specialized for variant_calling continue to improve the gl calculation and it is standard that these tools output gls in the vcf file by taking vcf files as input triodenovo can continuously benefit from these improvements without changing the interface furthermore triodenovo can be applied to vcf files generated by different tools e g gatk samtools freebayes and others so that a consensus call set can be generated the consensus approach has been shown to generate high_quality calls and triodenovo enables the consensus calling by integrating gls calculated from various tools through the standard vcf input in addition triodenovo runs very fast due to its efficient implementation so that consensus calling can be carried_out efficiently triodenovo calculates the mutation evidence_based on the gls at individual positions alignment artifacts are usually not well captured in the gls and therefore can introduce false_positive calls although vcf files contain some information about alignments the information is insufficient to effectively distinguish real and artifactual mutations we previously_developed a machine_learning approach dnmfilter for filtering by incorporating rich features in bam_files dnmfilter was initially trained using exome_sequencing and showed improved accuracy on the gp whole_genome we will further exploiting a training_set of whole_genome dnms when more data are available we hope that triodenovo equipped with dnmfilter provides a powerful_tool for mutation detection in trios for both targeted and whole_genome the c source_code implementing triodenovo and
