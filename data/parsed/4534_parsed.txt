databases_and tasirnadb a database of ta sirna regulatory_pathways in plants many transacting small_interfering ta sirna regulatory_pathways have been identified as significant components of the gene_networks involved in development metabolism responses to biotic_and and dna_methylation at the tas locus to obtain a more comprehensive understanding on the nature of ta sirna regulatory_pathways we developed a freely_accessible resource tasirnadb to serve as a repository for the sequences of ta sirna regulatory_pathway related micrornas tass ta_sirnas and ta sirna targets and for the cascading relations among them with pathways from species tasirnadb is the largest resource for known ta sirna regulatory_pathways currently available tasirnadb also provides a tool named tasexpanalysis that was developed to map user submitted small_rna and degra dome libraries to a stored input tas and to perform srna phasing analysis and tas cleavage analysis availability the database of plant ta sirna regulatory_pathways is available atin plants a classical phase initiator tas transcript ta sirna target_gene cascade model for the ta sirna regulatory_function has been well determined briefly a phase initiator usually a mirna but sometimes a sirna cleaves the transcript of ta_sirnas producing locus tas by binding argonaute ago proteins then rdr rna_dependent dependent conversion of the resulting cleaved fragments into dsrna and subsequent cleavage by dicer like dcl at every nucleotides nt relative to the phase initiator cleavage_site generates a tasirna the ta sirna further cleaves its target_rna to regulate_gene by binding ago proteins the ta sirna regulatory_pathways have been identified as important elements in the gene_networks involved in development metabolism response to biotic_and and dna_methylation at the tas locus recently the cascade system has also been used as a valuable_tool in functional_genomics studies until recently only a few ta sirna regulatory_pathways were characterized but now with the development and application of integrative genome_wide approaches including the genome_wide computational_identification of tass and the cleaved validation of mirna ta sirna targeting site based on degradome analysis or race about ta sirna regulatory_pathways have been reported in different plants however no comprehensive and integrated ta sirna related database is currently available here we present a database called tasirnadb of known plant ta sirna regulatory_pathways which can serve as a repository for the sequences of ta sirna pathway related_mirnas tass ta_sirnas and ta sirna targets and for the cascading relation among them tasirnadb also offers a tool named tasexpanalysis which has been developed to map user submitted rna and degradome libraries to a tas and to allow users to perform tas cleavage analysis and srna phasing analysis within tasirnadb
