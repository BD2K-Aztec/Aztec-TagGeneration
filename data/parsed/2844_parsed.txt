mechanotransduction map simulation_model molecular_pathway gene_set motivation mechanotransductionthe ability to output a biochemical signal from a mechanical inputis related to the initiation and progression of a broad_spectrum of molecular_events yet the characterization of mechanotransduction lacks some of the most basic tools as for instance it can hardly be recognized by enrichment_analysis tools nor could we find any pathway representation this greatly limits computational testing and hypothesis_generation on mechanotransduction biological_relevance and involvement in disease or physiological_mechanisms results we here present a molecular map of mechanotransduction built in celldesigner to warrant that maximum information is embedded in a compact network format to validate the maps necessity we tested its redundancy in comparison with existing pathways and to estimate its suffi ciency we quantified its ability to reproduce biological_events with dynamic simulations using signaling petri networks availability_and smbl language map is available in the supplementary data mechanotransduction is a ubiquitous phenomenon the importance and complexity of which has not yet been fully captured yet mechanical_stresses are triggers for wound_healing and can initiate epithelial_mesenchymal emt in the presence of inflammation both these phenomena are tightly related and important in the understanding of broader events like development emt type tissue_regeneration healing emt type and tumorigenesis emt type therefore the understanding of these events for applications in regenerative and cancer medicine as well as in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune_diseases is of crucial importance in addition given the possibility to induce mechanical_stimuli in a relatively ample number of accidental ways understanding the extent of the phenomenon acquires practical relevance in numerous clinical areas we observed however that despite its importance mechanotransduction is poorly represented in terms of pathways and molecular maps which are nevertheless crucial tools when medical_research is performed in the frame of omic studies as it is the case for a growing number of maladies trying to unravel the complexity of chronic_inflammatory autoimmune_diseases and cancers for this reason we reconstructed the molecular map of mechanotransduction using approved standard which allows a detailed and yet compact description of the relations ongoing among molecules easy sharing and editing of the map as well as topological_analysis and dynamic simulations having built this map we were able to better quantify its overlap with known pathways in reactome and panther the non statistically_significant overlaps with the pathways in these two databases imply minimum redundancy confirming the need for a mechanotransduction pathway representation we then validated the maps ability to reproduce known information by dynamic simulations mimicking published experimental_settings given the successful tests run on the maps ability to mimic the effects of mechanical_stress in relation to inflammation relevant for example in rheumatic_diseases this network becomes an appropriate and flexible tool for the preliminary investigation in silico of therapeutic alternatives and side_effects of mechanical_stresses in inflammation related contexts
