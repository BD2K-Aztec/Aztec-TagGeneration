systems_biology allergenfp allergenicity prediction by descriptor fingerprints motivation allergenicity like antigenicity and immunogenicity is a property encoded linearly and non linearly and therefore the alignment based_approaches are not able to identify this property unam biguously a novel alignment_free descriptor based fingerprint approach is presented here and applied to identify allergens and non allergens the approach was implemented into a four step algorithm initially the protein_sequences are described by amino_acid principal properties as hydrophobicity size relative_abundance helix and strand forming propensities then the generated strings of different length are converted into vectors with equal length by auto and cross covariance acc the vectors were transformed into binary fingerprints and compared in terms of tanimoto coefficient results the approach was applied to a set of known allergens and non allergens and identified_correctly of them with matthews correlation_coefficient of the descriptor fingerprint approach presented here is universal it could be applied for any classification_problem in computational_biology the set of e descriptors is able to capture the main structural and physicochemical_properties of amino_acids building the proteins the acc transformation overcomes the main_problem in the alignment based comparative_studies arising from the different length of the aligned protein_sequences the conversion of protein acc values into binary descriptor fingerprints allows similarity_search and classification availability_and the algorithm described in the present study was implemented in a specially_designed web_site named allergenfp fp stands for fingerprint allergenfp is written in python with giu in html it is freely_accessible at http ddg pharmfac net allergen fp allergy is a growing health problem of modern life the prevalence of allergic_diseases worldwide is rising dramatically in both developed and developing_countries allergy involves a complex series of reactions to external and internal factors called allergens which contribute to the development of diseases like rhinitis asthma atopic_dermatitis and skin sensitization severe_reactions as acute and fatal anaphylactic_shock also may occur an allergic reaction_occurs when a susceptible organism is re exposed to a specific allergen the allergen specific th cells the surface this finding is consistent with the fact that the innate_immune system is able to detect hydrophobic parts of immunogenic proteins containing aliphatic or aromatic_amino obviously allergenicity like antigenicity and immunogenicity is a property encoded linearly and non linearly and therefore the alignment based_approaches are not able to identify this property unambiguously in the present study we describe an alignmentfree method for allergenicity prediction based on amino_acid e descriptors and auto and cross covariance acc transformation of protein_sequences into uniform equal length vectors acc was used for quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar studies of peptides protein classification and immunogenicity prediction recently we applied this method in combination with k nearest_neighbors method to predict allergenicity here we improve the method by using a new set of amino_acid descriptors and a novel descriptor fingerprint approach based on tanimoto coefficient similarity_search the e descriptors for the naturally_occurring amino_acids defined by were derived by principal_component of a data matrix consisting of physicochemical_properties the first principal component e reflects the hydrophobicity of amino_acids the second e their size the third e their helix forming propensity the forth e correlates with the relative_abundance of amino_acids and the fifth e is dominated by the strand forming propensity in the present study the five e descriptors were used to describe the protein_sequences the fingerprints in chemoinformatics are developed to describe the d chemical_structures they are generated in two ways in the most popular way the structure of a compound is divided_into substructural fragments and assembled into a binary stringif the fragment exists in the structure the corresponding string element takes otherwise it takes binary structural fingerprints are especially useful as there are highly_efficient in computer algorithms working with binary strings daylight has developed another approach http www daylight com dayhtml doc theory theory finger html the daylight fingerprints are generated as patterns from the environment of each atom up to seven atoms away each pattern serves as a seed to a pseudo random_number generator it is hashed the output of which is a set of bits typically or bits per pattern the set of bits is added with a logical or to the fingerprint here we present a novel descriptor based fingerprint approach the fingerprint consists of descriptors instead of structural_fragments this enlarges the area of fingerprint application outside the chemical_structure description even outside chemistry moreover it allows physical and or biological_information to be included in the similarity search_process obviously the basic problem here is as in other quantitative structureactivity relationship methods the selection of proper descriptors they could be discrete i e boolean values e g the presence_or of given physical chemical and or biological_features the fingerprint is binary codedwhen the given feature presents the fingerprint takes at the proper position otherwise it equals many descriptors have continuous values e g a nuclear_magnetic or infrared_spectra logp quantum_chemistry based descriptors and so forth these descriptors also could be converted into discrete values by scaling and dividing into intervals with regular size if a descriptor value falls within an interval the corresponding fingerprint element takes otherwise it takes obviously the length of the fingerprint depends on the number of intervals as many they are as longer is the fingerprint the longer fingerprints are able to capture more molecular_features than the shorter ones but in the same time are redundant in information a balance between fingerprint length and information content should be found in any particular study allergome database http www allergome org the allergen proteins were searched in swiss_prot database http www uniprot org and only sequences with evidence for the existence of protein evidence at protein level were selected duplicates were removed the final_set of allergens contained proteins non allergens a set of proteins from species solanum lycopersicum tomato capsicum_annuum pepper solanum tuberosum potato triticum_aestivum bread_wheat and oryza_sativa asian rice and oryza glaberrima african rice was collected after search in swiss_prot for proteins with evidence for the existence of protein evidence at protein level and exclusion of proteins containing the key word allergen in their description the resulting set consisted of non allergens additionally a set of non allergens was collected from swissprot to include proteins from homo_sapiens species with evidence for the existence of protein evidence at protein level the proteins with key_words allergen and cancer in their description as well as proteins with unidentified amino_acids in their sequences were excluded the final_set of non allergens contained proteins the set of allergens and non allergens used in the present study is freely_accessible from allergenfp web_site this set could be used as a uniform reference_set in future_studies on allergenicity prediction as it is manually_curated and contains known allergens with evidence at protein level allergenicity of food proteins is a crucial problem associated with the widespread usage of new foods supplements and herbs many of them having known or unknown genetically_modified origin allergenicity is a subtle nonlinearly coded property most of the existing_methods for allergenicity prediction are based on structural_similarity of novel proteins to known allergens thus the identification of a novel structurally_diverse allergen could not be predicted by these methods in the present study we propose an alignment_free method for allergenicity prediction based on amino_acid principal properties as hydrophobicity size relative_abundance helix and strand forming propensities proteins are transformed into descriptorbased fingerprints and compared by tanimoto coefficient the algorithm was optimized in terms of lag length and resolution step and cross_validated by a set of known allergens and non allergens it recognized of the allergens and of the non allergens the algorithm and the set of proteins used in the study were implemented in a specially_designed web_site named allergenfp and freely_accessible at http ddg pharmfac net allergenfp allergenfp was compared with five freely_available web_servers for allergenicity prediction and showed the highest predictive_ability for example recently liao et_al identified a novel allergenic protein tyr p from tyrophagus putrescentiae that cross reacts with der p from dermatophagoides_pteronyssinus both proteins are not available in our database allergenfp identifies them as allergens with t the descriptor fingerprint approach based on tanimoto coefficient similarity_search used in the present study to discriminate between allergens and non allergens is universal it could be applied for any classification_problem in computational_biology the set of e descriptors is able to capture the main structural and physicochemical_properties of amino_acids the acc transformation overcomes the main_problem in the alignment based comparative_studies arising from the different length of the aligned protein_sequences the conversion of protein acc values into a binary descriptor fingerprint is a computational novelty described here for the first time
