gene_expression the sva package for removing batch_effects and other unwanted variation in high_throughput experiments heterogeneity and latent_variables are now widely_recognized as major sources of bias and variability in high_throughput experiments the most well known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effectswhen samples are processed on different days in different groups or by different people however there are also a large number of other variables that may have a major impact on high_throughput measurements here we describe the sva package for identifying estimating and removing unwanted sources of variation in high_throughput experiments the sva package supports surrogate variable estimation with the sva function direct adjustment for known batch_effects with the combat function and adjustment for batch and latent_variables in prediction_problems with the fsva function availability the r package sva is freely_available from http www bioconductor org high_throughput data are now commonly used in molecular_biology to i identify genomic_features associated with outcomes and ii build signatures for prediction these goals are complicated by the presence of latent_variables or unwanted heterogeneity in the high_throughput data batch_effects are the most widely_recognized potential latent_variable in genomic experiments the impact of batch_effects can be severe potentially completely compromising biological results furthermore batch_effects are not the only potential source of latent variation that may compromise the statistical or biological validity of a study here we introduce the sva package for identifying and removing batch_effects and other unwanted sources of variation the sva package contains methods for removing artifacts both by i identifying and estimating surrogate variables for unknown to whom correspondence should be addressed sources of variation in high_throughput experiments and ii directly removing known batch_effects using combat removing batch_effects and using surrogate variables have been shown to reduce dependence stabilize error_rate estimates and improve reproducibility finally the sva package includes the only publicly_available function fsva for identifying and removing latent_variables in genomic epigenomic prediction_problems we have introduced the sva package including the popular combat function for removing batch and other unmeasured or unmodeled sources of variation we have also introduced the first function for removing batch_effects in genomic prediction_problems the sva package is freely_available from the bioconductor website and is compatible with widely used differential_expression software such as limma
