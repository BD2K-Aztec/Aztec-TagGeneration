data_and cell_line name recognition in support of the identification of synthetic_lethality in cancer from text motivation the recognition and normalization of cell_line names in text is an important task in bio medical text_mining research facilitating for instance the identification of synthetically lethal genes from the literature while several tools have previously been developed to address cell_line recognition it is unclear whether available systems can perform sufficiently well in realistic and broad coverage applications such as extracting synthetically lethal genes from the cancer literature in this study we revisit the cell_line name recognition task evaluating both available systems and newly_introduced methods on various resources to obtain a reliable tagger not tied to any specific subdomain in support of this task we introduce two text collections manually_annotated for cell_line names the broad coverage corpus gellus and cll a focused target_domain corpus results we find that the best performance is achieved using nersuite a machine_learning system based on conditional_random trained on the gellus corpus and supported with a dictionary of cell_line names the system achieves an f score of on the test_set of gellus and on the independently annotated cll corpus it was further applied at large_scale to unan notated articles resulting in the identification of cell_line mentions normalized to unique cell_line database_identifiers availability_and the manually_annotated datasets the cell_line dictionary derived corpora nersuite models and the results of the large_scale run on unannotated texts are available under open licenses at http turkunlp github io cell_line recognition biomedical text_mining are increasingly capable of accounting for the diversity of information found in this domain while proteins and their interactions received much attention in bionlp research in the last decade recent efforts have increasingly focused on complex structured extraction with targets such as general regulatory associations and gene v c the author published_by
