using collective expert judgements to evaluate quality_measures of mass_spectrometry images motivation imaging mass_spectrometry ims is a maturating technique of molecular_imaging confidence in the reproducible quality of ims data is essential for its integration into routine use however the predominant method for assessing quality is visual_examination a time consuming unstandardized and non scalable approach so_far the problem of assessing the quality has only been marginally addressed and existing_measures do not account for the spatial_information of ims data importantly no approach exists for unbiased evaluation of potential quality_measures results we propose a novel approach for evaluating potential measures by creating a gold_standard set using collective expert judgements upon which we evaluated image_based measures to produce a gold_standard we engaged ims experts each to rate the relative quality between pairs of ion images from maldi_tof ims datasets of rat_brain coronal_sections experts optional feedback on their expertise the task and the survey showed that i they had diverse_backgrounds and sufficient expertise ii the task was properly understood and iii the survey was comprehensible a moderate inter_rater was achieved with krippendorffs alpha of a gold_standard set of pairs of images with accompanying ratings was constructed and showed a high agreement of eight families of potential measures with a range of parameters and statistical descriptors giving in total were evaluated both signal to noise and spatial chaos based measures performed highly with a correlation of to with the gold_standard ratings moreover we showed that a composite measure with the linear coefficients trained on the gold_standard with regularized least_squares optimization and lasso showed a strong linear correlation of and an accuracy of in predicting which image in a pair was of higher quality availability_and the anonymized data collected from the survey and the matlab_source for data_processing can be found at https github com alexandrovteam ims quality
