a fast algorithm for exact sequence_search in biological_sequences using polyphase decomposition motivation exact sequence_search allows a user to search for a specific dna subsequence in a larger dna_sequence or database it serves as a vital block in many areas such as pharmacogenetics phylogenetics and personal_genomics as sequencing of genomic_data becomes increasingly affordable the amount of sequence_data that must be processed will also increase exponentially in this context fast sequence_search algorithms will play_an in exploiting the information contained in the newly_sequenced data many existing algorithms do not scale up well for large sequences or databases because of their high computational costs this article_describes an efficient algorithm for performing fast searches on large dna_sequences it makes use of hash tables of q grams that are constructed after downsampling the database to enable efficient_search and memory use time complexity for pattern search is reduced using beam pruning techniques theoretical complexity calculations and performance figures are presented to indicate the potential of the proposed algorithm decreasing costs of sequencing personal genome have opened up many avenues of research several efforts related to personal healthcare and pharmacogenetics are attempting to use the information in an individuals genomic_data towards personalization of healthcare an important component of these solutions is the search for specific subsequences in a given genome for example cetuximab an epidermal_growth efgr inhibitor used to treat various types of cancer is ineffective if certain mutations in the kras gene which lies in exon of chromosome exist thus a search for appropriate mutations conducted on genetic data would be vital in prescribing the most effective treatment exact sequence_search also finds application in fields such as evolutionary_biology and phylogenetics where certain subsequences of dna are mined from genomic_data of various species of organisms to understand their origin relatedness and descent in the above context the challenge is to be able to perform fast pattern searches in whole genomes a complete human_genome contains billion base_pairs and databases spanning giga to tera bytes or more prevalent search_methods use techniques that have proven to be efficient for to whom correspondence should be addressed existing genomic_sequences and databases but do not scale up well for large_datasets such as those of whole human_genomes fast and efficient search_methods that scale up well for large_databases are therefore of great value in this article we address the problem of searching for all occurrences of pattern p in a text t where t is the reference_sequence whose length can vary from several million in case of individual chromosomes to several billion in case of complete_genomes bases p is the pattern which is a few tens to a few hundred bases in length in this article we presented a method for fast exact sequence_search that relies on downsampling and polyphase representations to expedite the search_process we also computed the complexity of the algorithm and showed it to be better than existing_methods because the proposed method uses polyphase representations and because searching for exact_matches in multiple polyphases does not have any data or functional inter dependency the algorithm can be parallelized this would further reduce time complexity implementation of a parallel version of the algorithm will be a topic of further work the proposed algorithm addresses the problem of finding exact_matches to a substring our future_research will extend the utility of this algorithm to finding approximate matches
