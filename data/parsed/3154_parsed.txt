sequence_analysis multi objective pairwise rna sequence_alignment motivation with an increase in the number of known biological_functions of non_coding the importance of rna sequence_alignment has risen rna sequence_alignment problem has been investigated by many researchers as a mono objective optimization_problem where contributions from sequence_similarity and secondary_structure are taken into account through a single objective_function since there is a trade_off between these two objective_functions usually we cannot obtain a single solution that has both the best sequence similarity_score and the best structure score simultaneously multi_objective is a widely used framework for the optimization_problems with conflicting objective_functions so_far no one has examined how good alignments we can obtain by applying multi_objective to structural_rna problem results we developed a pairwise rna sequence_alignment program cofolga mo based on multi objective genetic_algorithm moga we tested cofolga mo with a benchmark_dataset which includes sequence pairs with a wide_range of sequence_identity and we obtained at most alignments for each inputted rna_sequence pair as an approximate set of weak pareto_optimal we found that the alignments in the approximate set give benchmark results comparable to those obtained by the state of the art mono objective rna alignment_algorithms moreover we found that our algorithm is efficient in both time and memory_usage compared to the other methods availability our moga programs for structural_rna can be downloaded atsince sequence_alignment is a fundamental technology for various biological analyses such as gene prediction and phylogenetic_inference a number of sequence_alignment has been proposed for protein dna and rna compared to the cases of protein and dna sequence_alignment rna_sequence alignment_algorithms are usually computationally more demanding in both time and space because consensus secondary_structure information has to be taken into account in addition to sequence_similarity this is true even when we align two rna_sequences e g the pioneering dynamic_programming for structural_rna has computational complexities of o n in time and o n in space where n indicates sequence_length for pairwise_alignment in contrast to the lower complexities of nonstructural pure sequence pairwise sequence_alignment such as needlemanwunsch algorithm to emphasize on the inclusion of secondary_structure score we refer to rna sequence_alignment as structural_rna in the present article to overcome the high computational complexities of structural_rna problem various algorithms have been proposed and used so_far dynamic_programming formal grammar graph_representation linear integer_programming markov_chain stochastic sampling simulated_annealing max margin model maximum expected_accuracy and genetic_algorithm constraints and suboptimal solutions are also used combined with the approaches mentioned above in the previous structural rna_sequence alignment_methods structural_rna problem is formulated as a mono objective optimization where a sequence_similarity contribution and a structural contribution are taken into account through a mono objective_function however structural_rna is essentially multi_objective problem since competing two objective_functions sequence similarity_score and secondary_structure score are simultaneously taken into account and there is a trade_off between the two scoring_schemes e g at a low_sequence it is difficult to discriminate an accidental sequence_similarity and evolutionary_conserved nucleotides hence non structural alignment_methods can give an inaccurate alignment due to accidental matches of nucleotides on the other hand if we construct an rna alignment by maximizing a secondary_structure score alone the alignment can have a reduced sequence similarity_score compared to the alignment obtained by a non structural alignment_method the previous structural rna_sequence alignment_methods explicitly or implicitly assign relative_weights to a sequence similarity_score and structural score to scalarize the multiple objective_functions and the weights were usually determined based on a training data in this sense such a scalarized objective_function of structural rna_sequence alignment_methods can have a bias due to the training data multi_objective is a useful framework for exploring a system with conflicting objective a schematic illustration of the dominance in a bi objective optimization where a higher value is better in each objective_function of and of each circle indicates one solution in this example solution b strongly dominates solution a since the of and of of solution b are strictly better than the of and of of solution a respectively solution c strongly dominates solution a and b solution b and b are dominated weakly dominated by solution b where the value of at least one of the objective_functions of the dominated solution is equal to the corresponding value of solution b functions without introducing such a bias to the optimization procedure in multi_objective solutions are evaluated based on their dominance according to solution a dominates solution b if all objective_function values of solution a are better than or equal to the corresponding values of solution b and at least one objective_function of solution a is strictly better than that of solution b this type of dominance is sometimes called weak dominance the solution which is not dominated by any other solution is referred to as a pareto optimal_solution if all objective_function values of solution a are strictly better than the corresponding values of solution b solution a strongly dominates solution b the solution which is not strongly dominated by any other solution is referred to as a weak pareto optimal_solution the concept of dominance is illustrated in the definitions of dominance weak dominance pareto optimal_solution strong dominance and weak pareto optimal_solution are taken from deb the two solutions share strictly the same objective_function values which are neither dominated nor strongly dominated on each other in cofolga mo we explore not pareto_optimal but weak pareto_optimal this is because we have an interest in all solutions with the highest p or highest s for example when multiple solutions have the highest p in a solution set and they have values of s different from each other only one solution with the highest s of the solutions with the highest p is included in pareto_optimal whereas weak pareto_optimal contain all solutions with the highest p in the solution set when we align rna_sequences with a very low sequence_identity the solutions with a low s and the highest p also can contain a good alignment since the sequence_identity becomes less reliable in such a case in addition if we use an iterative refinement approach to solve a multi_objective problem weak pareto_optimal in a solution set can give a good guess for the better approximate set at the later steps e g a weak pareto optimal_solution may evolve to a pareto optimal_solution by a slight_increase in s for this reason we assign a dominance rank of one to the weak pareto_optimal in a solution set for the dominance rank see the section the goal of multi_objective is to find all pareto or weak pareto_optimal in the set of all possible solutions by using a multi_objective method we can obtain lessbiased solutions for a system with conflicting multiple objective_functions compared to when using its mono objective counterparts since previous structural rna_sequence alignment_methods utilize a biased single objective_function how good alignments can we obtain by using a multi_objective is a natural question for structural_rna problem to explore weak pareto_optimal rna sequence_alignments we propose a multi objective genetic_algorithm moga for pairwise structural_rna moga is a powerful approach for solving multi_objective problems where pareto or weak pareto_optimal are explored with a dominance based selection and genetic operators so_far multi_objective has been applied to various problems in bioinformatics such as sequence_alignment to our knowledge the present article is the first report on the application of multi objective evolutionary algorithm to the structural_rna in the present article we have proposed mogas cofolga mo and cofolga ns which compute the approximate set of weak pareto_optimal for structural pairwise rna sequence_alignment by performing a bralibase benchmark test we found that the approximate set for rna sequence_alignments contain highquality alignments comparable to the alignments obtained by the other recent mono objective structural rna alignment programs moreover we found that cofolga mo can give accurate trna and s rrna alignments comparable to the suboptimal alignments by dynalign with much smaller computational_resources although the algorithm proposed in the present study is designed for pairwise_alignment construction its extension to multiple_alignment will be possible in various ways e g we can generate approximate pareto_optimal multiple_alignments by straightforwardly extending the present moga i e by using crossovers and mutation operators for modifying a multiple_alignment like saga constructing a multiple_alignment based on the approximate set of the pairwise_alignments obtained for all pairwise combinations of inputted rna_sequences is also an interesting approach since moga usually outputs multiple solutions development of a methodology for selecting the solution which is favorable for the decision_maker is also an important direction of the future_research a graphical_user might be helpful for the purpose
