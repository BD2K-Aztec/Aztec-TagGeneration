ssummo rapid analysis comparison and visualization of microbial_communities motivation next_generation methods are generating increasingly massive datasets yet still do not fully capture genetic_diversity in the richest environments to understand such complicated and elusive systems effective tools are needed to assist with delineating the differences found in and between community datasets results the small_subunit markov modeler ssummo was developed to probabilistically assign ssu_rrna gene_fragments from any sequence_dataset to recognized taxonomic clades producing consistent comparable cladograms accuracy tests predicted of genera correctly for sequences downloaded from public reference_databases sequences from a next generation sequence_dataset sampled from lean overweight and obese_individuals were analysed to demonstrate parallel visualization of comparable datasets ssummo shows potential as a valuable curatorial tool as numerous incorrect and outdated taxonomic entries and annotations were identified in public_databases availability_and ssummo is gplv open_source python software available ata number of current research foci look to create a better understanding of the complexity of microbial_communities and interactions within diverse environments the analysis of complex microbial_communities with high_throughput hts technologies can generate hundreds of thousands of ssu_rrna reads ssu_rrna sequences are commonly used to assess community complexity and have been used in such disparate sample regimes as soils the human gastrointestinal_tract and potential biofuel sources as an alternative to primer targeted studies whole_genome shotgun wgs metagenomics has become increasingly popular over the past_decade as it provides additional insight into community to whom correspondence should be addressed function and is purported to reduce sampling bias both whole_genome and primer targeted_sequencing methods use the same sequencing_platforms technologies producing everenlarging datasets and suffering similar sequence artefacts including shorter sequence_lengths and greater uncertainty in the prediction of nucleotide_bases when compared with older methods regardless of method it is always desirable to identify those species that most significantly contribute to their environment powerful_tools to visualize and identify differences or commonalities between datasets at a number of hierarchical_levels are needed to help understand and model ecosystems and their dynamics in systems_biology approaches we have developed the small_subunit markov modeler ssummo in response to the growing computational_demands of such large_datasets ssummo is based upon a database of profile_hidden hmms trained with the arb silva reference_database of ssu_rrna sequences the hierarchy of hmms is arranged by embl taxonomy and acts as a decision_tree to catalogue conserved gene_fragments into known species names one taxonomic rank at a time this design minimizes the number of pairwise_comparisons and bypasses the need to create operational_taxonomic otus species proxies based on percentage sequence_similarity ssummo only groups sequences into acknowledged species names defined after pureculture phenotypic characterizations ssummo has been built and optimized for unix multicore workstations running python v and is interfaced through a set of command_line programs which can read sequences in over different file_formats as supported by biopython ssu_rrna sequences_contained within any sequence_dataset genome hts gene_fragment etc are identified in the first pass of domainlevel classifications and retained for further taxonomic_classification taxonomic_assignments can be visualized in real_time and results automatically saved into a python object file which is optimized for fast conversion into a number of formats including phyloxml html svg jpeg etc scripts are provided to calculate abundance and biodiversity information and fast_track visualization of results using embls itol web_application which can paint quantitative and comparative information onto inferred population structures ssummo can also save annotated sequences separately for further downstream_analyses or plot any numeric tabular data onto the arb taxonomy see supplementary method supplementaryis created a plain_text tree showing quantitative information is printed to screen verbose mode also prints hmmsearch tabular results the main output is a pickled file saved with pythons built in cpickle module but annotated sequences can be extracted in their original format for further downstream_analyses b postanalyses scripts pickled result files can be used by post analysis programs to produce various figures and tabular data asterisksequences are scored against multiple hmms simultaneously provided there are spare processor cores daggersimpson and shannon h hmax indices are available to choose from double daggerrarefaction curves are plotted using pythons matplotlib plotting library and can be saved in raster or vector based formats ftp ftp ncbi nlm nih gov genomes target and the human oral microbiome database against ssummo assignments supplementary initial tests showed genus prediction_accuracy to be prompting development of tools to assist with visualization and comparison of multiple datasets functionality was demonstrated with ssu_rrna sequence_datasets sampled from lean overweight and obese_individuals supplementary table s and high_level analyses of pooled_results show similar trends to those obtained by thorough analyses performed by demonstrating ssummos ability to identify trends in dynamic complex populations further detailed_analyses exploring the relative accuracy of assignment in each of nine hypervariable_regions in s rrna v excised from full and near full_length archaeal test sequences showed targeted sequences as short as nt could identify of genera correctly supplementary figs s and simulations were designed to identify ubiquitously conserved sequence_regions suitable for broad_spectrum primers as hts methods produce relatively short_reads compared with the length of the ssu_rrna gene we looked to identify those regions in archaea that coincide with the highest percentage of correct genus predictions we note that no single region in ssu_rrna is conserved to an extent as to enable a single primer to cover the entire archaea domain simulated studies could be used to predict those taxa that would be identified with a designed s rrna primer by using the ssummo hmm database to assist with modelling changes in population_structure and diversity within and between datasets programs were developed to perform rarefaction analyses calculate biodiversity indices and export stochastic matrices representing taxon probability_distributions each program can prune resultant taxonomies at any specified rank prior to performing analyses an alternative to varying cluster sizes by sequence_similarity results can be exported in tabular form or visualized using pythons matplotlib plotting library see supplementary method the provided scripts can apply resampling methods to ssummo results enabling visual comparisons of estimated sampling depth taxonomic diversity species evenness and sampling bias within and between datasets this is performed by rarefying or randomly sampling an equal number of sequences from result datasets and calculating shannon and simpson indices from the observed taxa supplementaryshows how these methods and metrics can be combined and compared within and between sequence_datasets to distinguish high_level features of diversity and community_structure the ability to combine and visualize species distributions across multiple datasets is a unique feature of ssummo and provides a far speedier alternative to predicting phylogenies which is prone to human_error and can be difficult to reproduce ssummo was shown to provide a robust framework for characterization and comparison of population structures enabling fast access to an array of data dependent metrics for annotation and inspection the object based model provides extensible tools to help compare and edit taxa and sequence annotations between databases
