gene_expression splicetrap a method to quantify alternative_splicing under single cellular conditions motivation alternative_splicing as is a pre_mrna maturation process leading to the expression of multiple mrna variants from the same primary transcript more than of human genes are expressed via as therefore quantifying the inclusion level of every exon is crucial for generating accurate transcriptomic maps and studying the regulation of as results here we introduce splicetrap a method to quantify exon_inclusion levels using paired_end rna_seq unlike other tools which focus on full_length transcript_isoforms splicetrap approaches the expression_level estimation of each exon as an independent bayesian_inference problem in addition splicetrap can identify major classes of alternative_splicing under a single cellular condition without requiring a background set of reads to estimate relative splicing changes we tested splicetrap both by simulation and real_data analysis and compared it to state of the art tools for transcript quantification splicetrap demonstrated improved accuracy robustness and reliability in quantifying exon_inclusion ratios conclusions splicetrap is a useful tool to study alternative_splicing regulation especially for accurate quantification of local exon_inclusion ratios from rna_seq availability_and splicetrap can be implemented online through the csh galaxy server http cancan cshl edu splicetrap and is also available for download and installation at http rulai cshl edu splicetrap in higher_eukaryotes a given transcribed locus can generate several mature mrna isoforms via the process of alternative_splicing as as is frequently a regulated mechanism which coordinates the removal of the internal non coding portions of the transcripts introns with the differential joining of the coding and untranslated portions exons as a result proteins with similar different or antagonistic activities can be generated from a single genomic locus in addition as can lead to downregulation of gene_expression by diverting some of the mrna isoforms to the nonsense_mediated pathway more than of human genes express primary_transcripts that undergo as owing to the regulatory power of this process an increasing number of studies are being directed at understanding as regulation at the single_exon level in general researchers in the splicing regulation field have utilized comparative_approaches to reveal tissue_specific or disease related as events however such methodologies have not been used to generate maps of as activity within one cellular condition the completion of such maps would add a higher_level of resolution to transcriptome_analysis allowing precise quantification of exon_inclusion levels within a population of related isoforms until recently systematic analysis of as was done using expressed_sequence est or specialized microarrays these techniques facilitated the discovery of a large number of alternative transcripts and the extraction of distinctive_features of alternatively_spliced exons nevertheless these techniques suffer from several limitations ests are subject to cloning biases especially towards the end of transcriptslow coverage and insufficient robustness to allow reliable quantification likewise the specificity of splicing microarrays is negatively_affected by cross_hybridization with related mrna_molecules the development of deep sequencing_technologies provided an alternative to ests and microarrays for transcriptomic quantification two recent_studies utilized single_end rna_seq to analyze a series of human tissues in the inclusion level of alternative exons was quantified as the percentage of the number of reads that match the two splice_junctions formed by exon_inclusion over the splice_junction formed by exon_skipping also utilized splice_junction reads for quantification of minor isoforms with different frequencies as a function of the readpage splicetrap is a tool specifically_designed to detect local alternative_splicing activity and quantify exon_inclusion ratios below we present both simulations and data analysis demonstrating that splicetrap is highly_accurate reliable and robust and we also compare it to state of the art rnaseq analysis tools splicetrap is a computational_tool fully dedicated to quantify major classes of as activity based on paired_end rna_seq unlike other available tools splicetrap focuses on quantifying local exon_inclusion ratios instead of full transcript_expression rather than reporting background based read densities splicetrap utilizes bayesian statistics to summarize exon_inclusion probabilities derived from every single read_pair for this reason splicetrap is also insensitive to transcript_expression splicetrap was specifically_designed to accurately quantify alternative_splicing at the single_exon level to achieve_this we started by describing the problem with a statistical_model based on exon trios duos instead of full transcripts to reduce the number_of and yet minimize the loss of information we applied dynamic cutoffs derived from simulation rather than using fixed cutoffs finally we adjusted the results using specific inclusionratio models for different as patterns in theory full transcript quantification tools like cufflinks and scripture can also be used to calculate inclusion ratios with txdb annotations supplementary method however these tools were originally designed and optimized for transcript_level estimation and our analysis indicates that they are less accurate than splicetrap for the specific problem of calculating exon_inclusion ratios
