prophossi automating expert validation of phosphopeptide spectrum matches from tandem_mass motivation complex patterns of protein_phosphorylation mediate many cellular_processes tandem_mass ms_ms is a powerful_tool for identifying these post_translational in high_throughput experiments mass_spectrometry database search_engines such as mascot provide a ranked_list of peptide_identifications based on hundreds of thousands of ms_ms obtained in a mass_spectrometry experiment these search results are not in themselves sufficient for confident assignment of phosphorylation_sites as identification of characteristic mass differences requires time consuming manual assessment of the spectra by an experienced analyst the time required for manual assessment has previously rendered high_throughput confident assignment of phosphorylation_sites challenging results we have developed a knowledge_base of criteria which replicate expert assessment allowing more than half of cases to be automatically validated and site assignments verified with a high degree of confidence this was assessed by comparing automated spectral interpretation with careful manual examination of the assignments for peptides above the false_discovery fdr threshold corresponding to putative phosphorylation_sites in proteins of the trypanosoma_brucei proteome despite this stringent approach we are able to validate of the phosphorylation_sites positively_identified by manual examination of the spectra used for the mascot searches with a fdr conclusions high_throughput computational_analysis can provide a viable second stage validation of primary mass_spectrometry database_search results such validation gives rapid access to a systems level overview of protein_phosphorylation in the experiment under investigation availability a gpl licensed software implementation in perl for analysis and spectrum annotation is available in the supplementary_material and a web_server can be assessed online atprotein phosphorylation is regarded as a key mechanism for the regulation of many cellular_processes including metabolism cell_division and apoptosis it has been estimated that of expressed proteins are phosphorylated at some point in their life_cycle though only a small fraction of the potential phosphorylation_sites have been identified in recent_years the examination of complex_protein by tandem_mass ms_ms has become feasible through advances in instrumentation and computational methodologies peptide and protein analysis at the cell_extract level has become an almost routine procedure as algorithms such as mascot or sequest among others allow rapid identification of proteins through matching tandem_mass to sequence_databases statistical_methods have been developed to enable the validity of peptide observations to be assessed search_strategies such as the inclusion of reversed or scrambled sequences in the database can give an estimate of the likely accuracy or false_discovery fdr for peptide_identifications with respect to the database search_engine score for a particular experiment this allows a reasonably robust description of the protein species in a particular sample further work has been performed to match peptide fragmentation_patterns to peptide_sequences through machine_learning such as hybrid support_vector bayesian_networks and decision_trees but these are not yet readily_applicable to peptides containing post_translational ptms although protein and peptide analysis is now a mainstream highthroughput technique reliable identification of ptms remains a specialist area algorithms designed for peptide database matching can take ptms into account but are not designed to provide robust identifications ptms are often present only in low stoichiometry and ion signals corresponding to phosphopeptides tend to be suppressed in the presence of non phosphorylated peptides mascot identifies the phosphorylation_site as ps peptide score though the expected y ion is much weaker than the weak y ion blue the second ranked hit py score is preferred by the experienced analyst with a strong y ion match red giving a continuous y ion ladder the spectrum was annotated with prophossi and modified the threshold for ion inclusion is indicated by a blue bar on the y axis the low stoichiometry of ptms requires the use of peptide enrichment approaches such as affinity pull_down immobilized_metal or titanium_dioxide columns to enrich the phosphopeptide complement of a complex_mixture the peptide enrichment strategies required for ptm identification in complex_mixtures compromise the scoring assumptions upon which generic database search_strategies are based rendering it unreliable to take the database_search scores as a surrogate for ptm identification_accuracy consequently confident identification of ptms requires the manual_inspection of the raw ms_ms by a competent mass spectrometrist a time consuming step that acts as a major_bottleneck in global ptm analyses where many thousands of spectra may require analysis this examination requires interpretation of the fragmentation pattern in line with the experience of the scientist and comparison of multiple interpretations of the data each of which could be correct if the sample contains multiple isobaric isoforms of the phosphopeptide an example is shown inwhere an experienced mass spectrometrist identifies the phosphotyrosine rank hit as a better interpretation than the phosphoserine top_ranked hit full prophossi reports for these two peptidespectrum matches psms are available in the supplementary_material this issue has been approached by two other groups both of whom apply a post_processing step to standard peptide ms_ms search_engine results report a probabilistic_method that calculates an ascore based on the appearance of phosphorylation_sites in multiple candidate solutions to the spectrum database mapping conundrum they calculate a probability score based on the appearance of site determining ions i e those fragment_ions that would be specific for a particular phosphopeptide isoform the method is dependent on the sequest search_engine to identify the two top phospho isoform hits and it reports quality data only for the best phospho isoform hit it does not consider the possibility of isobaric phospho isoform mixtures the closed source implementation of the software prevents user optimization of the search parameters have taken a different approach which is in some respects similar to ours they examine the daughter ion spectrum and assign scores based on a limited range of spectral_features peptide matches failing to reach a defined score threshold are rejected both of the aforementioned methods have some limitations the beausoleil method ignores spectral_features beyond the sitedetermining ions and does not consider neutral loss of phosphate from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine resulting in a smaller number of phosphopeptide spectrum matches the smith method assigns scores from a limited range of features which alone may not be sufficient to specifically locate a phosphorylation_site and has not been tested empirically our methodology described in this article incorporates a broader range of spectral_features and seeks to identify evidence for the specific localization of the putative phosphorylation_sites thus every psm i e every hit from a mascot or other search_engine search is assessed on its own merit the method is therefore able to interpret complex spectra derived from multiple isobaric phosphopeptide species opinions from three experienced mass spectrometrists were used to derive a set of chemistry based criteria that could be applied to tandem_mass for selection between and validation of the database psm search hits this method does not perform database_searches itself but provides a report on how well the observed spectrum fits to the predicted matches and whether the predicted match passes these analytical criteria as such it can be applied to the results of any such database_search typically relatively few phosphopeptide spectra are observed in proteomics experiments in the absence of specific phosphopeptide_enrichment protocols and this low coverage can be treated by hand by an experienced analyst however when such enrichment_methods are applied such as in the experiments described here the proportion of spectra arising from phosphopeptides rapidly expands to a level where automated processing_tools are a practical necessity our aim was to develop tools that automate rapid processing of large_numbers of spectra with few falsely identified phosphorylation_sites high_selectivity and a sufficiently good sensitivity to provide significant coverage as we are examining proteomes where little is known about the existing phosphorylation_state of the organism a tool that rapidly and confidently assigns the majority of easy cases is a considerable boost to productivity all database hits can be assessed and positive results reported as all the criteria can be explicitly described in english marginal hits can be also examined rapidly by an experienced analyst with an appropriate visualization_tool additionally a full text report that highlights salient_features and annotates the spectrum can be generated this approach has been validated through assessment of the automated annotation of the trypanosoma_brucei phosphoproteome we manually examined all identified hits for a specific family of proteins the protein_kinases and examined the error_rate and bias in our automated processing our method runs rapidly allows the assessment of more than just the top hit and gives excellent selectivity with good sensitivity output can be via an annotated spectrum and report produced in html or pdf or via a software application_programming allowing integration of the analysis in a high_throughput analysis_pipeline several of our predictions of occupied t brucei phosphotyrosine sites have been validated experimentally by both western_blot and immunofluorescence_microscopy experiments using two wellcharacterized anti phosphotyrosine antibodies
