systems_biology efficient sampling for bayesian_inference of conjunctive bayesian_networks motivation cancer development is driven by the accumulation of advantageous mutations and subsequent clonal_expansion of cells harbouring these mutations but the order in which mutations occur remains_poorly advances in genome_sequencing and the soon arriving flood of cancer genome data produced by large cancer sequencing consortia hold the promise to elucidate cancer_progression however new computational_methods are needed to analyse these large_datasets results we present a bayesian_inference scheme for conjunctive bayesian_networks a probabilistic_graphical in which mutations accumulate according to partial order constraints and cancer genotypes are observed subject to measurement noise we develop an efficient mcmc sampling scheme specifically_designed to overcome local_optima induced by dependency structures we demonstrate the performance advantage of our sampler over traditional approaches on simulated_data and show the advantages of adopting a bayesian perspective when reanalyzing cancer datasets and comparing our results to previous maximum_likelihood based_approaches availability an r package including the sampler and examples is available atcancer progression is an evolutionary_process characterized by the accumulation of somatic_mutations including singlenucleotide variants copy_number and changes of dna_methylation cells with advantageous mutations that confer a proliferative fitness advantage will eventually dominate the cancerous_tissue due to clonal_expansion mutations in a number of genes are recurrent and it is therefore believed that they are essential for the development of specific cancer_types mutations of those genes and the functional changes they induce are often referred to as the hallmarks of cancer the development and fixation of certain mutations in the tumour cell_population seem to depend on the presence of other mutations but in general the order of occurrence of mutations is poorly_understood recent_advances in genome_sequencing enable large_scale consortia such as the cancer_genome tcga or the international cancer genome consortium icgc to produce genomic and epigenomic profiles of cancer samples for a medium number of patients on the order of hundreds for example the cancer_genome research network recently_published exome_sequencing copy_number gene_expression and dna_methylation data for over ovarian_cancer patients over the course of the last decade researchers have applied probabilistic modelling in order to identify the dependency_structure of driver_mutations for various cancer_types the models_include oncogenetic trees mixtures of oncogenetic trees probabilistic network models and conjunctive bayesian_networks cbn all these models are based on cross_sectional data where genotyping has been performed once on a cancer tissue_sample per patient after diagnosis cbns jointly_model a partial temporal_order for the mutation_accumulation process and the probabilities of acquiring these mutations based on this cross_sectional data in contrast to ordinary bayesian_networks cbns assign probabilities of zero to genotypes that are not compatible with the partial temporal_order modelled by the cbn inference of cbns is usually done by maximum_likelihood ml estimation learning the structure of a cbn from observed data is difficult in the presence of observation error and simulated_annealing has been used for this task but assessing the confidence of the estimates is problematic it has been proposed to derive confidence values from the change in likelihood when removing edges or from bootstrapping the data and refitting the model however these approaches have several caveats i there is no a priori optimal strategy for parametrization of the simulated_annealing scheme ii proper convergence analysis i e stopping of the simulated_annealing algorithm is difficult and iii confidence assessment of discrete structure estimates based on bootstrapping is difficult_to assessing the confidence of the graph component of probabilistic cancer_progression is particularly important because the structure of the graph is interpreted as the set of possible mutational pathways the concern about stability has been reinforced by ml based simulation_studies of mixture_models of oncogeentic trees that have shown that the structure of these models can be to whom correspondence should be addressed estimated reliably only for fairly simple structures adopting a bayesian perspective one can get access to the full posterior_distribution over all cbn models and hence the uncertainty of their inference and their intrinsic variability however application of standard structure sampling schemes is impractical for bayesian_networks as they suffer from very slow mixing and convergence introduction of more sophisticated versions of the basic_structure space move types including a reverse edge move has been demonstrated to improve mixing and convergence however the reverse edge move cannot be expected to result in the same improvements for cbns because cbns are specialized bayesian_networks with the property that each directed_acyclic dag defines a unique set of distributions i e a unique equivalence class for example unlike for general bayesian_networks the graphs a b and b a do not define equivalent cbns reversing an edge is therefore a much more severe alteration in a cbn in section we derive the model and describe an mcmc_algorithm designed to overcome local_optima induced by dependency structures we validate the sampler on simulated_data compare our proposed algorithm to a more basic standard structure move based sampler and finally reanalyze real_world cancer datasets in section first we demonstrate the behaviour of our sampling scheme on simulated_data we then show the performance increase of our sampler over a standard structure move sampler finally we reanalyze real_world cancer datasets in order to demonstrate the increase of interpretability in this work we have presented a novel bayesian_inference scheme for cbns a probabilistic_graphical of cancer_progression that can be estimated from cross_sectional noisy genotype observations we have developed an efficient mcmc sampling algorithm using a set of moves specifically_designed to overcome local_optima of dependency structures the priors we used in our bayesian_approach are either non informative or flat alternative priors can be used if one wants to introduce more prior_biological for example about mutation probabilities genotype_calling errorsfor specific experimental_setups or certain order relations that have been found independently for practical purposes our method is currently capable of handling up to loci on a standard pc where the actual run time depends critically on the number of compatible genotypes which are marginalized out equation thus the more closely the partial order dependency_structure resembles a linear order the smaller is the set of compatible genotypes and the faster can the marginal probability of the observed data be computed in order to reduce the potentially large number of cancer driver_mutations one may apply filtering techniques based for example on marginal frequencies on pairwise_correlations or on more sophisticated methods for separating driver from passenger_mutations there is increasing evidence that rather than genewise cancer_progression may be more appropriately described on the level of functional pathways the exact definition of these pathways is ongoing_research but initial studies suggest a small number of cancer specific pathways on the order of a dozen the new move types introduced here can be applied to variations of the cbn model including the continuous time cbn which models waiting_times of mutations and the isotonic cbn i cbn which models monotonic progression along a continuous phenotype we expect that the new move types we added for dealing with local_optima of cbns especially the moves operating on the transitive closure may also be useful for other types of bayesian_networks where the directions of all edges can be unambiguously assigned bayesian cbns are more appropriate for predictive usage than their ml counterparts since one can reliably assess the confidence of the inferred dependencies as well as the associated mutation probabilities drug_development and treatment_strategies that aim at blocking or hindering cancer_progression by targeting certain mutation dependencies may benefit from increased interpretability of confidence assessments for example cancer genotypes are used for survival_prediction and cbns have been shown to significantly boost the performance of these predictions the reasonfor this improvement is that in predictions for individual patients strength is borrowed from common features of cancer_progression such as order constraints that can be learned by cbns using the bayesian cbn approach introduced here one can account for model uncertainty in such predictions for example using bayesian_estimation of the cox_model with international consortia such as tcga or icgc producing more and more whole cancer genome screens as well as next_generation moving into clinical_diagnostics the need for reliable and predictive modelling of genetic progression is growing we anticipate that our sampling scheme will help to further advance the understanding of cancer_progression
