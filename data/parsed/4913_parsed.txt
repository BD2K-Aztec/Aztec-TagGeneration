wge a crispr database for genome_engineering the rapid development of crispr_cas mediated genome_editing techniques has given rise to a number of online and stand alone tools to find and score crispr sites for whole genomes here we describe the wellcome_trust sanger institute genome_editing database wge which uses novel methods to compute visualize and select optimal crispr sites in a genome_browser environment the wge database currently stores single and paired crispr sites and pre_calculated off target information for crisprs located in the mouse and human exomes scoring and display of off target_sites is simple and intuitive and filters can be applied to identify high_quality crispr sites rapidly wge also provides a tool for the design and display of gene_targeting vectors in the same genome_browser along with gene models protein_translation and variation tracks wge is open extensible and can be set up to compute and present crispr sites for any genome availability_and the wge database is freely_available at www sanger ac uk htgt crispr_cas technology is a powerful_tool for genome_editing that can be applied to virtually any species from viruses to plants to mammals the crispr_cas system exemplified by cas from streptococcus_pyogenes is an rna_guided endonuclease that can be targeted to specific sequences by watson_crick base_pairing between a guide rna grna molecule and a bp target_sequence adjacent to an obligate ngg protospacer adjacent motif pam by replacing the first bp of the grna with the desired target_sequence cas can be re programmed to induce a double_stranded break at any n ngg site in the genome the cas endonuclease will tolerate some mismatches in the alignment between the grna and target dna_sequence and offtarget damage can occur at other sites in the genome with high_sequence to the crispr site therefore when designing grnas for genome_editing it is important to consider potential_off as well as the position of the grna site within a gene many web delivered software solutions are available for choosing highly_specific crispr sites in vertebrate_genomes supplementary some require the input of target or grna sequences http www benchling com others provide a basic genome_browser http hori zon deskgen com one can be run locally and a few have more involved scoring_schemes both for grnas and off targets e g http www benchling com some use a heuristic short read_aligner such as bowtie to compute grna specificity here we describe wge http www sanger ac uk htgt wge in contrast to existing websites wge guides the genome_editing
