cdsfold an algorithm for designing a protein coding_sequence with the most stable secondary_structure motivation an important problem in synthetic_biology is to design a nucleotide_sequence of an mrna that confers a desirable expression_level of a target protein the secondary_structure of protein_coding cdss is one potential factor that could have both positive_and effects on protein production to elucidate the role of secondary_structure in cdss algorithms for manipulating secondary_structure should be developed results we developed an algorithm for designing a cds with the most stable secondary_structure among all possible ones translated into the same protein and implemented it as the program cdsfold the algorithm runs the zuker algorithm under the constraint of a given amino_acid the time and space complexity is o l and o l respectively where l is the length of the cds to be designed although our algorithm is slower than the original zuker algorithm it could design a relatively long kb cds in approximately h availability_and the cdsfold program is freely_available users as stand alone and web_based software fromprotein expression levels are reportedly affected by various types of mrna features such as codon_usage rare_codon secondary_structures in untranslated_regions and protein_coding cdss see below kozak motif and shine_dalgarno sequence among them secondary_structure is difficult to handle because of the need to consider base_pair interactions between distant nucleotides and complex energy parameters assigned to each part of the secondary_structure this may be one of the reasons that some recent methods for designing cdss do not consider secondary structural_features the secondary_structure of cdss however can have substantial effects on protein production as described below although the mechanisms by which secondary_structure affects protein production are not understood fully especially in eukaryotes previous_studies have found that secondary_structures near the start_codon tend to be unstable in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggesting that secondary_structures have negative effects on protein expression levels indeed in prokaryotes it was shown that a stable secondary_structure around the start_codon reduced protein expression levels possibly by blocking the access of the ribosome to the ribosome_binding also in eukaryotes a previous study demonstrated that the secondarystructure around the start_codon strongly_reduced protein expression levels this was confirmed by a recent study based on the large_scale measurements of protein_abundance for over sequence_variants in yeast therefore it may be possible to decrease protein expression levels by artificially inserting a stable secondary_structure near the start_codon in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes secondary_structures far downstream of the start_codon may also have effects on protein production it is commonly believed that the secondary_structures in cdss impede translation_elongation resulting in a reduction of protein production it has however been pointed_out that slow elongation may not result in decreased protein production as long as there is sufficient space between elongating ribosomes moreover it has been suggested that slow elongation can assist in proper co translational protein_folding therefore slow elongation does not necessarily decrease protein expression levels moreover it cannot be ruled_out that the secondary_structures in cdss have positive rather than negative effects on protein production by protecting mrnas from various types of negative factors such as rnase digestion down_regulation by micrornas and unintended interactions with other mrna_molecules interestingly recent_studies based on genome_wide measurements of rna_secondary in yeast found a high correlation between secondary_structure and protein expression levels mrnas of strongly expressed genes tend to form a more stable secondary_structure although still arguable these studies suggest a causal_relationship between protein expression levels and the stability of the secondary_structures of cdss therefore it is worth investigating whether and to what degree artificially stabilized secondary_structures in cdss decrease or enhance protein expression levels to elucidate the effect of secondary_structures in cdss as well as utilize the features of secondary_structures to control protein expression levels algorithms for handling the secondary_structures of cdss should be developed currently however there are very few tools for stabilizing the secondary_structures of cdss gaspar et_al recently_developed the mrna optimiser which is based on a simulated_annealing algorithm although the method was intended to remove secondary_structures from cdss it can also be used to stabilize the secondary_structures here we developed a different approach that was based on a dynamic_programming it designs the cds with the most stable secondary_structure among all possible ones translated into the same protein in our algorithm the zuker algorithm is executed under the constraint of a given amino_acid although our algorithm uses larger dp matrices than the original zuker algorithm the fundamental procedure of both algorithms is the same therefore as with the zuker algorithm the time and space complexity of our algorithm is o l and o l respectively where l is the length of the cds to be designed we developed an algorithm for designing a cds with the most stable secondary_structure in terms of the turner energy_model it was shown that cdsfold can design cdss of most genes within h it was also shown that our algorithm can design cdss with a more stable secondary_structure than the method based on simulated_annealing especially when a cds is long the algorithm is useful for investigating the effect of the secondary_structure of a cds as well as utilizing features of the secondary_structure to control protein expression levels note that by changing the secondary_structure of a cds potential_binding for other regulatory_proteins or factors might be also changed which might be responsible for the change in expression_level therefore the effect of the secondary_structure should be investigated using at least several different proteins
