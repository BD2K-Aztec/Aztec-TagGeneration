genetic and population analysis reveel large_scale population genotyping using low coverage sequencing_data population low coverage whole_genome is rapidly emerging as a prominent approach for discovering genomic_variation and genotyping a cohort this approach_combines substantially lower cost than full coverage sequencing with whole_genome discovery of low allele_frequency variants to an extent that is not possible with array genotyping or exome_sequencing however a challenging computational_problem arises of jointly discovering variants and genotyp ing the entire cohort variant discovery and genotyping are relatively straightforward tasks on a single individual that has been sequenced at high coverage because the inference decomposes into the independent genotyping of each genomic_position for which a sufficient number of confidently mapped_reads are available however in low coverage population sequencing the joint inference requires leveraging the complex linkage_disequilibrium ld patterns in the cohort to compensate for sparse and missing_data in each individual the potentially massive computation time for such inference as well as the missing_data that confound low_frequency allele discovery need to be overcome for this approach to become practical results here we present reveel a novel method for single_nucleotide calling and genotyp ing of large cohorts that have been sequenced at low coverage reveel introduces a novel technique for leveraging ld that deviates from previous markov based models and which is aimed at computational_efficiency as well as accuracy in capturing ld patterns present in rare haplotypes we evaluate reveels performance through extensive simulations as well as real_data from the genomes_project and show that it achieves_higher in low_frequency allele discovery and substantially lower computation cost than previous state of the art methods availability_and http reveel stanford edu identification of genomic_variation in human dna_sequences is a key first step in associating alleles with human traits and diseases genome_wide gwas have successfully linked genetic_variation across thousands of genotyped individuals and hundreds of traits beyond human association of genomic_variations with traits has many applications such as in the quality breeding of plants and livestock despite their success in linking variation with traits gwas performed on genotypes have so_far failed to explain a large portion of the heritability of common traits and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com diseases such as diabetes schizophrenia and heart_disease genotype based gwas have only examined common single_nucleotide snps and one promising_avenue for finding the missing_heritability is the association of rare_variants with common traits also known as the common disease rare_variant hypothesis many recent efforts have focused on discovering such rare_variants in large cohorts through sequencing rather than genotyping algorithms that call snps on a single target_genome require the sample to be sequenced at a high coverage to confidently differentiate alternate alleles from sequencing_errors high_coverage however is expensive when applied to large cohorts recently low_coverage of large cohorts has been proposed as more cost efficient and informative than sequencing fewer individuals at high coverage many on going projects have adopted this low coverage strategy including the uk k project http www uk k org the genomes_project the cohorts for heart and aging_research in genomic epidemiology charge project and multiple participating cohorts in the haplotype reference consortium http www haplotype reference consortium org each project sequences thousands of individuals at a relatively low coverage for example the genomes_project sequenced whole genomes at depth the charge project sequenced whole genomes at depth to leverage the wealth of genomic_data that such large_scale population sequencing_projects are providing computational_methods that perform accurate and efficient detection and genotyping of rare snps in a population are urgently_needed the corresponding computational_problem is considerably more challenging than single sample genotyping from deep sequencing_data to overcome the noise and missing_data inherent in low_coverage variant detection and genotyping require the joint estimation of all genotypes of all individuals simultaneously and need to infer and leverage the linkage_disequilibrium ld present in the sequenced cohort as a result computation time can become prohibitive and accuracy is harder to achieve for rare alleles a number of existing computational_methods can be applied to population genotyping although not designed for analyzing lowcoverage sequencing_data samtools gatk unified genotyper and beagle can perform population genotyping in particular applying gatk unified genotyper to ceu samples from the genomes_project pilot_phase collectively followed by beagle leads to reasonably accurate genotyping for common_polymorphisms qcall employs a dynamic_programming to estimate for every position of the genome the posterior_probability of presence of an alternate allele in the cohort the qcall algorithm then constructs a set of possible ancestral recombination graphs from samples to estimate the snp posterior_probability for each site in each sample from these graphs the glfmultiples thunder pipeline employs a hidden_markov hmm that leverages ld_information across a population to genotype likely polymorphic_sites and is currently considered the state of the art for accurate genotyping of populations using sequencing_data in the underlying hmm each hidden state is a pair of reference haplotypes which are most closely_related to the sample being considered and observations are genotype likelihoods to apply this hmm on a sequenced cohort the sequenced individuals are used as references snptools estimates genotyping likelihoods at putative polymorphic_sites using a bam specific binomial mixture_model in which the parameters are empirically estimated using an expectationmaximization em_algorithm with the resulting genotyping likelihoods snptools utilizes a hmm approach based on the statistical ld pattern model proposed in to infer genotypes and haplotypes this method restricts the number of parental haplotypes to reduce the computation overhead despite their considerable success existing genotyping_methods are not ideally_suited for application to large cohorts individuals because of their prohibitive computation time as well as their reduced accuracy when calling low_frequency genomic_variants which are hard to differentiate from sequencing_errors in particular the hmm_model underlying thunder links polymorphic_sites to surrounding mosaics modeling these links using a first order markovian model however the presence of low_frequency and rare frequency variants hierarchically breaks the common_haplotypes into many uncommon or rare haplotypes reducing the fit to a model with an underlying markovian assumption additionally given a cohort of size n the hmm requires on hidden_states which results in prohibitively high computational_overhead as n increases the snp_detection dynamic_programming of qcall on the other hand is more computationally_efficient because it does not account for the non random associations between loci but its accuracy is reduced for the same reason here we present reveel a novel method for large_scale snp discovery and genotype_imputation using low_coverage data_sets reveel leverages the underlying complex ld_structure by employing a simplified model that scales linearly with the number of individuals in a cohort for a given number of imputed snps while producing highly_accurate genotype_calls for both high and lowfrequency snps we evaluate the performance of reveel on simulated_data as well as real_data and demonstrate that reveel achieves significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy over previous state of the art population scale genotyping_methods making reveel a practical approach for large_scale population genotyping a rare genetic_variant that originated from a recent mutation event tags many of the other genetic_variants surrounding it as these were present at that time including variants at long genetic_distance from it rare_variants present an extremely high_ld yielding long rare haplotypes the nearest_neighbor concept in reveel uniquely leverages this observation common_snps tend to have nearest_neighbors that are proximal in genetic_distance while rare snps tend to have nearest_neighbors that are much more distant supplementary supplementary moreover the allele_frequencies of target snps and their nearest_neighbors are in almost perfect linear correlation supplementary hmm based_methods face a tradeoff between either explicitly modeling each rare haplotype which leads to computational_overhead due to the large number of parameters or compressing the state_space which leads to the loss of long_distance rare haplotype ld_information in particular previous state of the art methods such as mach and thunder apply a first order markovian model between two subsequent haplotypic positions while such models have been demonstrated to work well for genotyping common_variants they face a challenge in modeling rare_variants on the lower side of the rare snps spectrum the incorporation of ld_information in previous methods did not improve the genotyping accuracy in the genomes_project phase rather the resulting genotyping accuracy evaluated using hapmap benchmark genotyping accuracy was evaluated using the genotypes of asw ceu chb gih jpt lwk mxl tsi and yri samples reported by hapmap as the benchmark the blue bars represent the genotyping accuracy of reveel beagle for the other three methods the bars show the difference from reveel beagle orange indicates lower accuracy than reveel beagle green indicates higher accuracy than reveel beagle genotyping accuracy was modestly lower than when not using ld_information the explanation underlying this phenomenon may be as follows although rare haplotypes share common_variants they usually contain distinct rare_variants that can serve as a signature leveraging those correlations within a simple markovian model is impractical every rare haplotype needs to be encoded in the model captured as a distinct sequence of states in the hmm the hmms underlying currently available methods tend to eliminate rare alleles as noise which contributes to biases towards homozygous reference conversely to infer genotypes our approach aims to identify the most informative sites in a way that is less sensitive to their genetic_distance the strategy is different from previous_models that implicitly weaken the association between remote sites by focusing on the most informative markers based on their ld our method provides considerable improvement in the genotype_calling of rare_variants high af snps are caused by one or more mutation_events that occurred in the distant past after many generations of recombination the ld between high af sites could become very complex therefore perfect ld between a high af site and a set of surrounding sites may not exist in this particular case genotype phasing on common_variants is a useful complementary method to our genotype_calling algorithm we incorporate a post_processing step into reveel in the reveel beagle pipeline after imputing the genotypes and genotype probabilities at likely polymorphic_sites we pick snps with af and feed their genotype probabilities into beagle for phasing finally the output dosages of beagle are merged with the genotypes at rare snps an important feature of our algorithm at high af sites is providing high_quality genotype probabilities to demonstrate this point we conducted an experiment for comparison labeled as reveelgatk beagle in this experiment we forced gatk to make calls across the sites identified by our algorithm with af then beagle was trained on the outputs of gatk producing dosages at these sites finally we merged the outputs of beagle and the genotypes called by our algorithm at rare snps for evaluation the only difference between this approach and our reveel beagle pipeline is which tool was used to created genotype probabilities the comparison shown in supplementaryclearly illustrates that reveel beagle outperforming reveel gatk beagle the running time of reveel scales linearly with the number of individuals n and linearly with the number of polymorphic_sites m in our algorithms expect that the process of estimating ld between every pair of polymorphic_sites requires m computations as we restrict the ld estimation within windows of size kb mb see section m is usually within the range of a few thousands depending on the size of the studied cohort which results in practical running_times in our experiments reveel has been demonstrated to be robust to high variability of sequencing_depth across loci and individuals the genomes_project phase data_set used in our experiments has non uniform sequencing_coverage the mapped coverage of samples in the studied region ranges from to with mean value and standard_deviation the average coverage of these loci across the cohort ranges from to with standard_deviation in summary reveel is a highly_accurate and efficient tool for single nucleotide variation calling and genotyping of large cohorts of low coverage sequenced individuals in future work similar techniques may be applied to leverage a populations ld to provide rapid and accurate genotyping of other types of variation such as insertions deletions and structural_variants
