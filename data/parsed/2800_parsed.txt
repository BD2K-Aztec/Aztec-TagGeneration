markov dynamic_models for long timescale protein motion molecular_dynamics md_simulation is a well established method for studying protein motion at the atomic_scale however it is computationally_intensive and generates massive_amounts of data one way of addressing the dual challenges of computation efficiency and data analysis is to construct simplified models of long timescale protein motion from md simulation_data in this direction we propose to use markov_models with hidden_states in which the markovian states represent potentially overlapping probabilistic distributions over protein conformations we also propose a principled criterion for evaluating the quality of a model by its ability to predict long timescale protein_motions our method was tested on d synthetic energy_landscapes and two extensively_studied peptides alanine dipeptide and the villin headpiece subdomain hp nlenle one interesting finding is that although a widely_accepted model of alanine dipeptide contains six states a simpler model with only three states is equally good for predicting long timescale motions we also used the constructed markov_models to estimate important kinetic and dynamic quantities for protein_folding in particular mean first passage time the results are consistent with available experimental_measurements protein motion is the aggregate result of complex interactions among individual atoms of a protein at timescales ranging over several orders of magnitudes thermal_fluctuations which occur in picoseconds s are small_amplitude uncorrelated harmonic motions of atoms but they eventually provide the protein enough momentum to overcome energy_barriers between metastable_states in contrast biologically_significant conformational motions which occur in microseconds to milliseconds are often large_scale correlated anharmonic motions between meta stable_states for example in a folded protein they may occur between binding and non binding states the wide_range of timescales and complex relationships among the motions at different timescales make it difficult to capture the biologically_significant long timescale dynamics of protein motion in a compact model molecular_dynamics md_simulation is a well established method for studying macromolecular motion at the atomic_scale however it requires a detailed energy function and the equations of motion must be integrated with a time step much shorter than the timescale of atomic thermal_fluctuations for many proteins todays computers can generate roughly a few nanoseconds of simulation trajectories in a day which is insufficient for capturing events of biological_significance distributed computing and to whom correspondence should be addressed specialized computer architectures speed up md_simulation significantly but the sheer size of data generated is a major_hurdle that prevents biological_insights one way of addressing both the issues of computational_efficiency and data analysis is to construct simplified models that capture the essential features of protein_motions at long timescales markov dynamic_models mdms provide a promising direction towards this goal an mdm of a systemhere a proteincan be represented as a directed graph each node of the graph represents a state s of the system and each edge represents a transition from state s to s an edge s s is also assigned the probability that the system transitions from s to s in one time step mdms have several advantages for modeling protein motion first they are probabilistic and thus naturally capture the stochasticity of protein motion second mdms represent states explicitly this makes them potentially easier to understand and faster to simulate finally there are standard algorithmic tools e g first step analysis for exploiting mdms without expensive explicit simulation a key_question in mdm construction is the choice of states what are the markovian states of a protein if we want to model its longtimescale dynamics accurately one contribution of this work is to have states represent not individual protein conformations not even disjoint regions of the conformation space but overlapping probabilistic distributions over the conformation space this choice reflects the view that a conformation does not contain enough information to be assigned to a single state although this may seem odd at first it is in fact quite natural in modeling many physical systems for example suppose that we want to classify some physical objects into two states table or chair for a cubic object one meter in size if we see a meal on top of it we may consider it a table if we see someone seated on it we consider it a chair so a cube in itself cannot be assigned a single state because of insufficient_information often acquiring and representing missing_information if at all possible is more difficult than capturing it in a probabilistic distribution hence our choice of markovian states that represent probabilistic distributions over the protein conformation space this choice leads to mdms with hidden_states formally hidden_markov hmms in this article we present a method to automatically construct an hmm of the long timescale dynamics of a protein from a dataset of md_simulation trajectories another key_question is how to measure the quality of a model a good model enables us to predict biologically_relevant quantities of protein motion accurately and efficiently however a particular model may do well for one quantity but poorly for another also we may not know in advance the quantities to be predicted when constructing a model another contribution of this work is to propose a principled criterion for evaluating the quality of a model by its ability to predict long timescale protein_motions as many interestingpage i i i
