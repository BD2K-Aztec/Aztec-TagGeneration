genetics_and enlight web_based integration of gwas results with biological annotations identifying causal_variants remains a key challenge in post gwas genome_wide era as many gwas single_nucleotide snps including imputed ones fall into non coding_regions making_it to associate statistical_significance with predicted functionality therefore we created a web_based enlight which overlays functional annotation_information such as histone_modification states methylation patterns transcription_factor eqtl and higher_order chromosomal_structure to gwas results availability_and accessible by a web_browser atgenome wide association studies gwas enabled the identification of genetic_variants associated with complex_diseases to date there are genome_wide significant variants in the gwas catalog however most of the top hits are believed to be proxy markers for the underlying causal_variants and the majority of those variants lie within noncoding sequences despite substantial efforts in the post gwas era to identify causal_variants lack of knowledge on biological_functions has become a major_hurdle for differentiating causal_variants from highly_correlated tag_single snps a large amount of biological annotation is now available for non coding_sequences given the community efforts devoted to elucidating functional significance of non coding_sequences in the past_few for example the encode_project has systematically mapped regions of active_transcription transcription_factor tf association chromatin_structure and histone_modification and assigned at least one biochemical function to of the genome recent_studies showed that disease related variants detected by gwas are significantly_enriched in regions where regulatory_elements are inferred such as dnase_i sites and tf_binding tfbs proper integration of this biological_information with gwas results will likely shed light on prioritization and identification of candidate causal_variants to that end tools such as haploreg regulomedb gwas d and funcisnp were developed to leverage functional_annotations to interrogate gwas variants however users cannot visually recognize the annotation patterns the popularity of regional plots highlights the importance of visual_inspection of the gwas results although locuszoom generates high_quality images showing local linkage_disequilibrium ld and association significance it provides little information for interpreting non coding variants therefore we developed a web_based enlight combining biological annotation and gwas related information into one single plot it takes gwas results including imputed ones as input and returns a regional plot with a variety of epigenetic_information such as histone_modification methylation patterns tfbs eqtl and higher_order chromosomal_structure
