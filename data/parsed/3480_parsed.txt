structural_bioinformatics pdbpaint a visualization webservice to tag protein_structures with sequence annotations protein features are often displayed along the linear sequence of amino_acids that make up that protein but in reality these features occupy a position in the folded_proteins d space mapping sequence_features to known or predicted protein_structures is useful when trying to deduce the function of those features and when evaluating sequence or structural predictions to facilitate this goal we developed pdbpaint a simple tool that displays protein sequence_features gathered from bioinformatics resources on top of protein_structures which are displayed in an interactive window using the jmol java viewer pdbpaint can be used either with existing protein_structures or with novel structures provided by the user the current version of pdbpaint allows the visualization of annotations from pfam ard detection of heat repeats uniprot tmhmm and signalp users can also add other annotations manually availability_and pdbpaint is accessible ata proteins function is tightly dependant on its d structure in particular protein features such as catalytic centers domains and post_translational have a shape in d space that is crucial to understand the function of the protein however in protein databases these features are usually defined by their locations in linear protein_sequences only it is actually easier to define and handle protein annotations in a d sequence second protein sequence_data is much more abundant than protein_structure data which require complex techniques to determine atomic_coordinates as a result most protein annotations are mapped to protein_sequences but not to protein_structures nevertheless tagging available d structures with annotations can be extremely informative this is used in some web_tools and databases dealing with protein_structures scop dali or with domain predictions pfam typically users have to obtain a file with the atomic_coordinates of a protein_structure e g in pdb format andpdbpaint has been specifically_designed as an easy to use tool for the tagging of pdb files with a comprehensive collection of features display of protein features such as pfam or uniprot directly on the d structure help to better understand protein_function these also allow the user to test the accuracy of predictive methods and see directly their results on modeled or known structures researchers who have solved or predicted a novel protein_structure can upload their structure and immediately view sequence_features predicted for their protein in the context of the novel structure in particular we believe that pdbpaint will facilitate the use of predicted protein_structures when designing experiments
