genome_analysis learning protein_dna landscapes by integrating experimental_data through computational models_motivation transcriptional_regulation is directly enacted by the interactions between dna and many proteins including transcription_factors tfs nucleosomes and polymerases a critical step in deciphering transcriptional_regulation is to infer and eventually predict the precise locations of these interactions along with their strength and frequency while recent datasets yield great insight into these interactions individual data_sources often provide only partial information regarding one aspect of the complete interaction landscape for example chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip reveals the binding positions of a protein but only for one protein at a time in contrast nucleases like mnase and dnase can be used to reveal binding positions for many different proteins at once but cannot easily determine the identities of those proteins currently few statistical frameworks jointly_model these different data_sources to reveal an accurate hol istic view of the in vivo proteindna_interaction landscape results here we develop a novel statistical_framework that integrates different sources of experimental information within a thermo dynamic_model of competitive_binding to jointly learn a holistic_view of the in vivo proteindna_interaction landscape we show that our framework learns an interaction landscape with increased accuracy explaining multiple sets of data in accordance with thermodynamic principles of competitive dna_binding the resulting model of genomic occupancy provides a precise mechanistic vantage_point from which to explore the role of proteindna_interactions in transcriptional_regulation availability_and the c source_code for compete and python source_code for mcmc based_inference are available atas an essential component of transcriptional_regulation the interaction between dna_binding factors dbfs and dna has been studied extensively to map genome_wide protein_dna experimentally two basic categories of techniques have been developed chip based_methods numerous studies in many organisms but a few examples for yeast are and nuclease_digestion based_methods that profile chromatin with either dnase or mnase chip methods can be used to reveal high_resolution dna interaction sites for a single antibody targeted factor especially the recently_developed chip exo methods that use lambda exonuclease to obtain precise positions of protein binding nuclease_digestion methods can be used to efficiently assay genome_wide dna occupancy of all proteins at once but without explicit_information about protein identities these and other experimental efforts over the past_decade have generated a large amount of data regarding the chromatin landscape and its role in transcriptional_regulation we now need computational_models that can effectively integrate these data to generate deeper insights into transcriptional_regulation a popular set of computational_models use these data to search for overrepresented dna_sequences bound by certain dbfs these are often applied in the setting of motif_discovery more recently models have been applied to dnase_seq data to identify digital footprints of dbfs however many of these approaches share certain drawbacks first protein binding is typically treated as a binary event amenable to classification either a protein binds at a particular site on the dna_sequence or it does not however both empirical and theoretical work has demonstrated that proteins bind_dna with continuous occupancy levels as reviewed by second most computational_methods model the binding_events for one kind of protein at a time instead of taking_into the interactions among different kinds of dbfs especially nucleosomes although the work ofand teif and rippe are notable exceptions these all consider small genomic_regions and include only a few tfs did not consider the role of nucleosomes third and most importantly almost all current methods_fail to integrate different kinds of datasets this is suboptimal because data from one kind of experiment only reveal partial information about the in vivo proteindna_interaction landscape for example chip datasets only contain binding information for one specific protein under one specific condition nuclease_digestion datasets provide binding information for all proteins but do not reveal the to whom correspondence should be addressed identities of the proteins and protein binding microarray pbm experiments only look at sequence_specificity of one isolated protein in an in vitro environment we previously_developed a computational_model of protein_dna termed compete that overcomes the first two drawbacks above by representing the competitive_binding of proteins to dna within a thermodynamic ensemble interactions between proteins and dna are treated as probabilistic events whose continuous probabilities are calculated from a boltzmann_distribution compete can easily include a large number of dbfs including nucleosomes and can efficiently profile entire genomes with single_base however a limitation of compete is that it is a purely theoretical_model of binding based on thermodynamic first principles but not guided by data regarding in vivo binding_events indeed it is possible for compete to predict superfluous binding_events that are inconsistent with observed data supplementary it is therefore necessary to develop a new computational framework for jointly interpreting experimentally_derived data regarding genomic occupancy within a model built on the thermodynamic foundation of compete here we develop just such a method a general framework that combines a thermodynamic_model for proteindna_interactions and a new statistical_model for learning from experimental_observations regarding those interactions information from different experimental_observations can be integrated to infer the thermodynamic interactions between dbfs and a genome in this particular study we demonstrate the use of this framework by integrating paired_end mnase seq data which reveal information about the binding occupancy of both nucleosomes and smaller subnucleosomal factors our framework also integrates protein binding_specificity information from pbm data and produces a more accurate and realistic proteindna_interaction landscape than compete alone along with a mechanistic explanation of mnase digested fragments of different sizes the crossvalidated performance of our framework is significantly_higher than several baselines with which we compared it our framework is flexible and can easily incorporate other data_sources as well and thus represents a general modeling framework for integrating_multiple sources of information to produce a more precise view of the interaction landscape undergirding transcriptional_regulation we show that integrating information from experimental_data within a general framework built on a thermodynamic ensemble model of competitive factor binding can improve the accuracy of inferred proteindna_interactions providing a more biologically_plausible view of the proteindna_interaction landscape such a landscape gives a mechanistic explanation for observed paired_end mnase seq fragments through various protein binding_events each with its own probability of occurrence many of those binding_events are weak binding_events that are typically missed in other modeling_methods but are captured in our framework these weaker binding_events are also supported by higher_resolution experimental_data where available these weak binding_events are important it has been reported that low_affinity proteindna_interactions may be involved in fine_tuning transcriptional_regulation and are common along the genome our frameworks predictions agree with this viewpoint of the binding_events in our predicted profiles have a binding probability less than our framework could thus form an important basis for future computational work that connects transcriptional_activity with the proteindna_interaction landscape our framework does not successfully predict a few tf binding_events reported by high_resolution chip exo experiments most notably some of the binding_sites for phd and reb we believe the primary reason is occasional mismatches between our input tf pwms and these proteins actual in vivo dna binding_specificities for phd rhee and pugh reported several distinct in vivo motifs however the phd pwm we used in our framework comes from in vitro data and does not match the in vivo dnabinding specificity of phd reported by rhee and pugh similarly for reb rhee and pugh reported that of reb binding_sites are so_called secondary binding_sites with motifs that deviate from the ttaggc consensus of the in vitro pwm we used this mismatch in dna binding_specificity may account for much of the discrepancy between our predicted profiles and reported binding_sites however some caution should be taken when interpreting in vivo chip data as the assay cannot distinguish between direct proteindna_interaction and indirect interaction we also note that our current framework only includes a subset of all yeast tfs some unexplained short fragment coverage peaks such as those in the ybl c promoter_region could indicate the binding of dbfs that are not in our set these and other discrepancies may have an impact on our overall inference resulting in missing binding_events or possibly even superfluous binding_events because of the competition that is inherent in our model in the promoters of ynl w and ydl c our predictions do not include rap binding_events even though they are reported in chip exo experiments however we believe this results from the nature of rap binding report that rap binding on non ribosomal_protein promoters like the two mentioned above is highly_dynamic and involves fast turnover such binding_events are possibly captured in chip experiments because of cross_linking but may be difficult to observe in an mnase based digestion experiment if the latter does not involve a cross_linking step incidentally the two chip determined rap binding_events are not close to mnase seq small_fragment coverage peaks one possible use of our framework for extending the results shown here would be to incorporate data from chip based experiments and use the framework to estimate_parameters that reflect information from both kinds of data we demonstrate the use of prior information in our framework through incorporating measured bulk cellular protein concentration the model performance improved marginally which can be interpreted two ways on the one hand it is reassuring that one need not have measured cellular protein concentrations to perform effective inference the fact that our uniform priors work as well as having priors informed by measured concentrations means that the measured concentrations available currentlyare not critical for good performance however that said it is also reassuring that our framework has the ability to incorporate this sort of prior information when available because we anticipate such data will only improve as measurement technologies enable us to move from bulk cellular concentrations toward nuclear concentrations of active tfs we anticipate that the ability to incorporate prior information will become more useful if not for achieving better results then perhaps at least for more rapid convergence toward optima when we move to higher dimensional inference e g more tfs with adequately fitted parameters our framework has the potential to perform in silico simulation for various environmental_conditions by changing the protein concentrations for example we could simulate in silico heat_shock by increasing the concentration of heat_shock factors in our model we could also investigate how certain single_nucleotide snp affect the overall proteindna_interaction landscape not just at the site of the snp but propagating to the surrounding region because of altered competition this work represents a first step toward a more general framework by specifying probabilistic distributions appropriate for other kinds of experimentslike chip_seq faire seq or dnase seqthe framework can integrate other sources of data through a joint likelihood as more and larger scale sequencing_projects are carried_out such a framework will prove valuable for integrating different pieces of information to infer a more precise view of the proteindna_interactions that govern transcriptional_regulation
