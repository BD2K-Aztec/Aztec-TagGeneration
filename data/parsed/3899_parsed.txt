structural_bioinformatics rchange algorithms for computing energy changes of rna_secondary in response to base mutations motivation measuring the effects of base mutations is a powerful_tool for functional and evolutionary_analyses of rna_structures to date only a few methods have been developed for systematically computing the thermodynamic changes of rna_secondary in response to base mutations results we have developed algorithms for computing the changes of the ensemble free_energy mean energy and the thermodynamic entropy of rna_secondary for exhaustive patterns of single and double_mutations the computational complexities are o nw where n is sequence_length and w is maximal base_pair span for single_mutations and o n w for double_mutations with large constant factors we show that the changes are relatively insensitive to gc composition and the maximal span constraint the mean free_energy changes are bounded kcal_mol and depend only weakly on position if sequence_lengths are sufficiently_large for trna sequences the most stabilizing mutations come from the change of the most base of the anticodon loop we also show that most of the base changes in the acceptor stem destabilize the structures indicating that the nucleotide_sequence in the acceptor stem is highly optimized for secondary_structure stability we investigate the trna_genes in the human mitochondrial_genome and show that non pathogenic polymorphisms tend to cause smaller changes in thermodynamic variables than generic mutations suggesting that a mutation which largely increases thermodynamic variables has higher possibility to be a pathogenic or lethal mutation availability_and the c source_code of the rchange software is available at http www ncrna org software rchange measuring the effects of base mutations has long been a standard method for studying relationships between structural rnas and their biological_functions molecular_biologists mutate some nucleotides of the rnas of interest in order to alter the structures and draw various conclusions by observing whether the mutations to whom correspondence should be addressed disrupt biological_functions see for example observing mutation_patterns in genome_evolution has also been important for detecting evolutionarily_conserved functional rnas and evolutionarily_conserved structural rnas show special types of mutation_patterns that preserve their secondary_structures several studies have used such patterns as a major_feature for finding novel structural rnas from multiply aligned genomic_sequences investigating the structural changes due to base mutations has potentially important_applications in genome_wide where many disease associated single_nucleotide snps are located outside the protein_coding in the human_genome it is possible that part of the disease associations of these snps can be explained by altered structures of the non_coding that are transcribed around those regions despite the widespread use of mutational_analyses and the potential_relevance to human_diseases very few studies have developed methods for systematically computing the changes in rna_secondary in response to base mutations in our previous_paper we have developed algorithms for computing the thermodynamic variables for a given sequence kiryu and asai submitted for publication see also the earlier works which developed algorithms for the mean free_energy computation in this article we present algorithms for computing the changes in the ensemble free_energy mean free_energy and the thermodynamic entropy of secondary_structures for all the possible single and double_mutations assuming that the rna_secondary follow the boltzmann_distribution p x of the turner energy_model tem in this article we have developed algorithms for computing changes in the ensemble free_energy mean free_energy and the thermodynamic entropy of rna_secondary for all possible patterns of single and double_mutations the computational complexities are o nw where n is sequence_length and w is maximal base_pair span for single_mutations and o n w for double_mutations with relatively large constant factors we have shown that the changes in the mean free_energy and entropy are relatively insensitive to gc composition and the maximal span constraint the mean energy changes are bounded at
