genome_analysis jepeg a summary_statistics based tool for gene level joint testing of functional_variants motivation gene_expression is influenced by variants commonly known as expression_quantitative eqtl on the basis of this fact researchers proposed to use eqtl functional information univariately for prioritizing single_nucleotide snps signals from genome_wide gwas however most genes are influenced by multiple eqtls which thus jointly affect any downstream phenotype therefore when compared with the univariate prioritization approach a joint modeling of eqtl action on phenotypes has the potential to substantially_increase signal detection_power nonetheless a joint eqtl_analysis is impeded by i not measuring all eqtls in a gene and or ii lack of access to individual genotypes results we propose joint_effect on phenotype of eqtl functional snps associated with a gene jepeg a novel software_tool which uses only gwas summary_statistics to i impute the summary_statistics at unmeasured eqtls and ii test for the joint_effect of all measured and imputed eqtls in a gene we illustrate the behavior performance of the developed tool by analysing the gwas meta_analysis summary_statistics from the psychiatric genomics consortium stage and the genetic consortium for anorexia_nervosa conclusions applied analyses results suggest that jepeg complements commonly used univari ate gwas tools by i increasing signal detection_power via uncovering a novel genes or b known associated genes in smaller cohorts and ii assisting in fine_mapping of challenging regions e g major_histocompatibility for schizophrenia availability_and jepeg its associated database of eqtl snps and usage examples are publicly_available atunivariate analysis of genome_wide gwas has emerged as the main tool for identifying trait disease associated genetic_variants however against initial expectations most variants reported by complex_trait gwas are common single_nucleotide snps with weak or moderate effect_sizes which account for only a small fraction of the overall phenotypic_variation presumably most common causal_variants are not detected in gwas due to their small effect_sizes therefore to identify a greater v c the author published_by while h summary datasets were simulated based on the fairly homogenous samples from uk k and analysed using the multiethnic kg europeans reference_panel jepeg still controls the type_i at or below the nominal level the results suggest that jepeg with the ridge correction is reasonably robust to non african intracontinental ld variations in pgc bd cohort out of genes with reliable functional information we detected significant and suggestive signals the most significant gene q value was rasgef a q which was never reported to be associated with bd for this gene jepeg database contained functional annotation_information for only six trans eqtl snps on chromosome with the most significant residing near syne a gene already detected univariately in pgc bd meta_analysis the second most significant gene was the syne gene q value itself for which the statistic was obtained based on nearby eqtl snps five of the significant genes belong to itih cluster on chromosome which also encompasses two other suggestive genes it is notable that itih cluster did not yield any significant snp signal in pgc bd or scz but was detected univariately only in the much larger combined analysis of pgc bd and scz for the same cohort vegas detected significant and suggestive gene signals out of genes supplementary significant signals were obtained from six gene regions where except the marginally_significant chr lman l and chr nfix albeit vegas standard_errors are orders_of larger than the small estimated p values also detected by jepeg vegas did not detect rasgef a we note that while most regions were detected by both multivariate_methods jepeg appears to fine map these regions by returning smaller gene_lists for the scz cohort out of genes with functional information and genes harbored significant and suggestive signals respectively however only six significant genes were outside the major_histocompatibility mhc region chr mb which has been associated with scz in many caucasian gwas we underscore the detection of a significant signal for mad l q value this gene was not identified in univariately in pgc scz but was detected in a larger pgc follow_up study which included additional swedish cohorts we also detected significant and suggestive gene signals from itih cluster we also note the strong significant scz signals in nkapl and zkscan which were the only mhc genes harboring significant signals in a han_chinese scz gwas meanwhile for the same data vegas detected only significant abcc srcap and znf and suggestive phkg and znf gene signals out of genes supplementary we mention that none of the genes with significant vegas signal are located within ld independent scz association regions from the latest pgc scz stage study for pgc mdd and gcan studies neither multivariate method yields any significant findings while disappointing our findings closely mirror the univariate results an
