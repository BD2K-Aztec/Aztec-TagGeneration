gene_expression a procedure to statistically evaluate agreement of differential_expression for cross_species genomics motivation animal_models play_a in translation biomedical_research the scientific value of an animal_model depends on how accurately it mimics the human disease in principle microarrays collect the necessary data to evaluate the transcriptomic fidelity of an animal_model in terms of the similarity of expression with the human disease however statistical_methods for this purpose are lacking results we develop the agreement of differential_expression agdex procedure to measure and determine the statistical_significance of the similarity of the results of two experiments that measure differential_expression across two groups agdex defines a metric of agreement and determines statistical_significance by permutation of each experiments group labels additionally agdex performs a comprehensive permutation_based analysis of differential_expression for each experiment including gene_set analyses and meta_analytic integration of results across studies as an example we show how agdex was recently used to evaluate the similarity of the transcriptome of a novel model of the brain_tumor ependymoma in mice to that of a subtype of the human disease this result combined with other observations helped us to infer the cell of origin of this devastating human cancer microarray_technology has enabled researchers to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes in a biological tissue_specimen these data are commonly used to compare gene_expression among biological conditions within the same species to whom correspondence should be addressed for example the experiments may compare the transcriptomes of tumors and host normal_tissue or between tumors arising in the same tissue however translating this wealth of data into other experimental_systems has proven difficult because of limitations in comparing transcriptome_data generated with different microarray_platforms or from different species here we present a statistically_rigorous procedure called agdex for agreement of differential_expression to combine transcriptome information across two experiments that compare expression across two biological conditions each experiment may utilize different microarray_platforms or even study different species the agdex procedure determines whether the differential expression_profile of one experiment has statistically_significant similarity to that of the other experiment in our studies we used agdex analysis results and other experimental_data to validate a novel mouse_model of a human brain_tumor we have successfully used agdex for this purpose in published_studies of ependymoma and medulloblastoma to identify the cell of origin for each of these two brain cancers we describe the method in detail and illustrate it with our analysis of the data from our ependymoma study we have developed the agreement of differential_expression agdex procedure to integrate differential_expression results across two experiments that may utilize different platforms or even different species the agdex procedure can be used to examine the transcriptional fidelity of animal_models of human disease by evaluating the similarities of transcriptome_wide differential expression_profiles across species agdex may also be used to integrate differential_expression results that use different platforms for the same species in our studies the agdex procedure enabled us to confirm the transcriptomic fidelity of newly_generated mouse_models and thereby infer the cell of origin of two distinct human_brain cancers the agdex procedure also performs a comprehensive and statistically_rigorous permutation_based analysis to address other biologically_important questions for each experiment the agdex procedure performs differential_expression at the probe set and gene_set levels additionally the agdex procedure metaanalytically integrates differential_expression results at the probeset and gene_set levels to improve statistical_power to identify genes or pathways that are important in one or both experiments finally the agdex procedure also evaluates similarity of differential_expression across the two experiments for predefined gene_sets the agdex procedure computes p values by permuting assignments of group labels within each experiment permutation is computationally_demanding but yet is critical to obtain an accurate measure of statistical_significance especially for identifying differentially_expressed gene_sets and evaluating the agreement of differential_expression some computationally simple approaches for gene_set analyses utilize statistical_models of chance that inappropriately use final results for genes as the unit of analysis for example in our setting one might use the binomial_distribution to model the number of ortholog pairs that have the same sign for differential_expression in both experiments such an approach grossly exaggerates statistical significant by inappropriately using the number of ortholog pairs as the sample_size and ignoring the correlation among genes permutation of group labels preserves correlation among genes by keeping gene_expression values for each subject together during the random reassignment is explicitly linked to the experimental_design and uses the correct sample_size by retaining the correct number of group labels and expression data vectors nevertheless the agdex procedure is computationally_feasible our example analysis was completed on a desktop computer in h the sample_size and number of genes and gene_sets are similar to those of other contemporary applications additionally utilization of adaptive permutation will help reduce computational_burden by performing fewer permutations for gene_sets with insignificant results this may be especially useful if the more statistically_robust and computationally_demanding distancebased statistic offor differential_expression of gene_sets is incorporated into later versions of agdex the example analysis also shows that the agdex procedure and our previously_published are robust against the strategy used to select the ortholog pairs that are included in the analysis in our previously_published study the expression data were used to select which ortholog pairs from the affymetrix best match definitions were retained for the agdex analysis in this work no such filtering was applied the results of the analyses based on the cosine statistic are qualitatively_similar to the previously published_findings the robustness of agdex results against filtering of ortholog pairs is page
