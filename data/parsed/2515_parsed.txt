gene_expression integration of pathway_knowledge into a reweighted recursive_feature approach for risk_stratification of cancer patients motivation one of the main goals of high_throughput gene_expression studies in cancer research is to identify prognostic gene_signatures which have the potential to predict the clinical_outcome it is common practice to investigate these questions using classification methods however standard methods merely rely on gene_expression data and assume the genes to be independent including pathway_knowledge a priori into the classification process has recently been indicated as a promising way to increase classification_accuracy as well as the interpretability and reproducibility of prognostic gene_signatures results we propose a new method called reweighted recursive_feature it is based on the hypothesis that a gene with a low fold_change should have an increased influence on the classifier if it is connected to differentially_expressed we used a modified_version of googles pagerank algorithm to alter the ranking criterion of the svm rfe algorithm evaluations of our method on an integrated breast_cancer dataset comprising samples showed an improvement of the area under the receiver_operator as well as in the reproducibility and interpretability of selected genes availability the r code of the proposed algorithm is given in supplementary_material contactclinical cancer research is driven by two basic tasks one is to elucidate the functions of genes and pathways to get mechanistic_insights in tumor_development and to identify novel drug_targets another task is the identification of prognostic and to whom correspondence should be addressed predictive gene_signatures that allow the prediction of the clinical_outcome and response to treatment in breast_cancer clinical predictors for relapse events e g lymphnode status and histological_grade often fail to classify tumors according to their clinical behavior the molecular_heterogeneity of the tumors leads to differing outcomes in patients with the same disease stage therefore several studies have been performed to identify prognostic gene_signatures based on high_throughput geneexpression profiling various gene_signatures have been identified which have the potential to improve the current risk_stratification of breast_cancer patients classification methods are used in this context to identify genes which are able to discriminate between clinical relevant endpoints one example is the support_vector svm which is a supervised_learning algorithm that covers a broad range of applications due to its ability to handle high_dimensional the svm is a good tool for analyzing gene_expression data and its superior_performance over other methods has been shown however genes identified by standard methods which exclusively rely on gene_expression data often lack stability i e applying the same method to different datasets results in gene_lists that have only a small number of genes in common recent_studies that standard methods can be improved in terms of classification_accuracy as well as stability of gene_lists by including a priori_knowledge of pathways into the classification process these methods benefit from pathway_knowledge since genes are not treated as independent most of the methods mentioned above are based on the hypothesis that genes in close_proximity which are connected to each other should have similar expression_profiles therefore these algorithms look for predictive subnetworks instead of single genes however this hypothesis might not always be valid since pathways can be completely shut down by only one regulating gene and one would not observe a systematic effect in the whole pathway hence the accuracy of predictions might be furtherpage many high_throughput gene_expression studies have been performed with the aim to identify putative new biomarkers for risk_stratification of breast_cancer patients however a major_drawback of the gene_lists identified in these studies is that the overlap is poor classification methods are often used to computationally find survival related gene_signatures however genes which are known to be involved in breast_cancer are not necessarily identified by current methods because they only detect genes that exhibit a large change in expression which might be only downstream_effectors of the key_players for example minute changes in transcription_factor expression may lead to considerable expression changes of many genes regulated by the transcription_factor the key_players which are correlated to cancer development and not exhibit high fold changes are known to be highly_connected to those genes that significantly change their expression_level hence the performance of classification algorithms might be improved if they are adapted to use the geneexpression data coming from microarray_experiments and exploit the information that is stored in biological_networks that is the connectivity of the genes in this article we introduced rrfe which includes pathway_knowledge into the classification process by modifying the featureranking criterion of rfe motivated by the findings mentioned above we used generank a modified_version of the pagerank algorithm to alter the ranking criterion of rfe and thus incorporate the prior_knowledge the pagerank algorithm used by google is based on the hypothesis that a web_page should be highly ranked in a search result if other highly ranked pages contain links to it this hypothesis is similar to what is observed in gene_networks the assumption of our approach is that a gene with a low fold_change should have an increased influence on the classifier if it is connected to differentially_expressed we presented a new classification_method called rrfe that a priori takes pathway_knowledge into account this is achieved by using a modified_version of the pagerank algorithm in combination with rfe in our experiments we used ppi data as prior_knowledge
