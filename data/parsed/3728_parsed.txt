promiscuous mrna_splicing under the control of aire in medullary thymic_epithelial motivation the expression of tissue_restricted antigens tras in the thymus is required to ensure efficient negative_selection of potentially auto reactive t lymphocytes and avoid autoimmune_disease this promiscuous expression is under the control of the autoimmune regulator aire a transcription_factor expressed in medullary thymic_epithelial mtecs tissue_specific alternative_splicing may also produce tras but the extent to which splice_isoforms that are restricted to specific tissues are expressed in mtecs is yet to be investigated results we reanalyzed microarray_and datasets from mouse mtecs and other epithelial and non epithelial_cell and found that the diversity of splice_isoforms in mtecs was greater than in any of the other cell_types or tissues studied we identified tissue_specific isoforms from a panel of mouse_tissues and found several examples of such isoforms that are expressed in mtecs the number of isoforms with restricted_expression found in mtecs was significantly_higher than for comparable cell_types furthermore we found evidence that aire influences the increased splicing diversity observed in mtecs as the genes for which tissue_restricted isoforms are produced in mtecs were significantly more likely than other genes to be differentially spliced between aire knockout and wild_type samples our results suggest that developing t lymphocytes are exposed to diverse tissue_restricted splice_isoforms in the thymus and that aire has a direct_or role in this process representing a novel aspect of its role in the maintenance of immune self tolerance t lymphocytes are cells of the adaptive_immune that are capable of recognizing and binding foreign peptides presented on the surface of other cells by major_histocompatibility mhc class molecules recognition is mediated by the t cell receptor tcr a surface bound receptor generated by a stochastic_process of generearrangement during t cell development in the thymus this somatic rearrangement results in a diverse repertoire of t cells each expressing a single tcr that is capable of recognizing a limited set of peptide_mhc however given the stochastic_process by which these tcrs are generated the possibility arises that a tcr may show an affinity for self peptide_mhc leading to an autoimmune_response to avoid this t cells undergo a process of selection in the thymus whereby the developing t cell is exposed to a range of self peptide_mhc this process referred to as negative_selection results in the deletion from the t cell repertoire of cells with high_affinity for self peptide_mhc the range of self peptides to which the developing t cells are exposed includes a number of peptides that are normally only expressed in specific tissues outside the thymus this ectopic expression of tissue_restricted antigens tras which helps to preventathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy apeced an autoimmune_disease which affects multiple endocrine organs although aire has been shown to increase the level of spliced versus un spliced mrnas little is known about the impact of aire on alternative_splicing and the extent to which it can cause expression of alternative splice_isoforms resulting in isoform specific tra expression in the thymus previous work has shown that aire interacts with a number of proteins involved in pre mrna_processing and spliceosome binding including splicing_factors such as sc an sr protein involved in transcriptional elongation through the recruitment of the positive transcription_elongation b p_tefb and in the commitment of pre mrnas to the splicing pathway aire can also interact directly with p_tefb a mutation in the transcription activation_domain tad of aire found in apeced patients can prevent this interaction leading to a decrease in the level of spliced versus un spliced mrnas in order to ensure efficient negative_selection a diverse range of peptides needs to be presented in the thymus to developing t cells this includes peptides that are introduced by alternative_splicing specifically tras resulting from tissuespecific alternative_splicing to investigate the diversity of alternative_splicing in the thymus we calculated splicing entropy using existing rna_seq from mtecs and compared it with the splicing entropy of other tissues entropy can be considered as a measure of uncertainty and splicing entropy reflects the diversity of observed splice_isoforms in a given sample we also compared mrna_splicing between wild_type and knock_out mtecs finally we investigated the ectopic expression of tissue_specific splice_isoforms in mtecs we suggest that aire plays a role in promiscuous splicing in mtecs resulting in the expression of tras in the thymus for the purpose of negative_selection of t cells this is likely to contribute to the role of aire in inducing tolerance to self antigens it is well established that aire induces the expression of tissue_restricted genes in the thymus here we show that aire also influences alternative_splicing in mtecs increasing the number of exons detectable per gene and allowing antigens on these exons to be produced mtecs express a range of tissue_specific splice_isoforms and knock_out of aire affects splicing of the genes for which tissuerestricted splice_isoforms are found in mtecs we suggest that promiscuous splicing in mtecs is under the control of aire and that aby tissue_specific splice_isoforms found in mtecs only i e found in mtecs but not in ctecs or secs the second column includes all tissue_specific isoforms found in secs whether or not they are expressed in mtecs or ctecs breakdown in this mechanism would result in the absence of isoform specific tras in the thymus allowing t cells capable of directing autoimmunity towards tissue_specific isoforms to escape the thymus and contribute to autoimmine disease
