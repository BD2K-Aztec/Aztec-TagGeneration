outlier_detection at the transcriptome proteome interface background in high_throughput experimental biology it is widely_acknowledged that while expression levels measured at the levels of transcriptome and the corresponding proteome do not in general correlate well messenger_rna levels are used as convenient proxies for protein levels our interest is in developing data_driven computational_models that can bridge the gap between these two levels of measurement at which different mechanisms of regulation may act on different molecular_species causing any observed lack of correlations to this end we build data_driven pre dictors of protein levels using mrna_levels and known proxies of translation efficiencies as covari ates previous work showed that in such a setting outliers with respect to the model are reliable candidates for post_translational results here we present and compare two novel formulations of deriving a protein concentration predictor from which outliers may be extracted in a systematic manner the first approach outlier rejecting regression allows explicit specification of a certain fraction of the data as outliers in a regression setting this is a non convex_optimization which we solve by deriving a difference of convex functions algorithm dca with post_translationally regulated proteins one expects their concentrations to be affected primarily by disruption of protein_stability our second algorithm exploits this observation by minimizing an asymmetric loss using quantile_regression and extracts outlier proteins whose measured concentrations are lower than what a genome_wide regression would predict we validate the two approaches on a dataset of yeast transcriptome and proteome functional_annotation check on detected outliers demonstrate that the methods are able to identify post_translationally regulated_genes with high statistical confidence the mapping between high_throughput measurements at the level of transcriptome and at the corresponding proteome is a complex one although a large body of computational_biology literature using advanced machine_learning to transcriptomic_data exist it is acknowledged that the underlying biological_function of interest happens more at the protein level and mrna concentrations are seen as proxies for the corresponding protein concentrations several authors have measured mrna and protein concentrations in the same biological_samples and have attempted to showcorrelations between these two except under specific functional_categories correlation between the two is difficult to demonstrate the reason for this is that different species of mrna proteins are regulated by different mechanisms at the post_transcriptional and posttranslational levels the approach pursued in this work starting from tuller et_al and gunawardana and niranjan is to formulate a regression_problem in which the response variable is the protein concentration and the covariates are the mrna_levels and other proxies for the stability and translation efficiency of the transcripts used a linear_regression with a sparsity inducing regularizer lasso and showed that of about features taken as inputs a combination of five features including mrna_levels and translation efficiencies yield good prediction of protein levels in fact these best five features are mrna_abundance trna adaption index tai codon_bias ribosome density and occupancy the outliers with respect to this linear_regression were shown to carry significant over representation of post_translationally regulated proteins which is to be expected since the input covariates do not have any information about post_translational ptms in this article we introduce two novel computational_methods that detect outliers in a regression setting and demonstrate their usefulness in the analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic_datasets our focus is specific in that we attempt to detect from the data those proteins that are likely candidates for post_translational the relevant biological_insight introduced in gunawardana and niranjan is that if the concentration of a protein is regulated post_translationally the measured abundance p of it is likely to be lower than what a global data_driven model trained on a genomic wide scale might predict p this is because the primary mechanism by which post_translational might be implemented is the disruption of protein_stability however other modifications which occur post_translationally such as hydrophobicity localization and enzymatic_activities will not be detected by this approach the first novel model we introduce in this article is outlier rejecting regression orr model which formulates a regression_problem that requires a user specified fraction of the data to be returned as outliers with respect to the regression_model this is achieved via specifying a particular loss function the clipped truncated loss which is shown to be equivalent to defining a certain fraction of the data as outliers we show how this objective_function may be optimized via a difference of convex functions algorithm dca for this formulation we also present an alternative ad_hoc variant of optimization strategy methods our second method is the use of quantile_regression qr with omic measurements a technique which is effectively used in a range of areas including economics medicine and survival analysis qr enables the specification of an asymmetric loss function where the user can define the outliers to be selected either with positive_or losses thus this approach is more suitable with our initial_hypothesis because our main focus lies on the negative losses of a global predictor measured abundance lower than the predictedp p to detect post_translationally regulated proteins we believe that these are much neater ways of approaching the problem than to simply implement a regression and hope the outliers to contain those posttranslationally regulated_genes tests against functional_annotation of yeast gene_products show that all three methods can detect outlier proteins that are likely candidates for post_translational with high statistical confidence however main biological_insight that we start from is that post_translational should primarily act by disrupting the stability of proteins whereby the measured concentrations should be lower than what might be predicted from a genome_wide regression with mrna_level properties of individual species as input variables two of the models we considered simple_linear and orr do not model this asymmetric explicitly and hence find outliers on either side i e p p and p p in linear_regression the vast_majority of outliers found had p p in line with our insight and only two proteins were found as outliers on the p p side this has to be regulated as a prediction result obtained by fitting a datadriven model through noisy_data when we force the model to label a fraction of the data as outliers in orr model the minimization of the loss function picks up outliers on either side i e p p and p p however majority of the outliers and the post translatonally regulated proteins were detected from the upper region p p of the regression when we compared the outliers detected on either side of orr model we found of the outliers detected at the lower region p p did not have post_translational and correspondingly the confidence_levels with which orr model identify post_translationally regulated proteins was lower the qr model which allows as to explicitly impose our asymmetric loss function turns out to be the best match to exploit the biological_insight we purse here and the proteins picked up by this model yield the highest statistical confidence in annotation checks pathway analysis further supports the hypothesis due to the over representation observation of p related pathways in this work we presented two novel approaches to detect posttranslationally regulated proteins as outliers in a regression_problem the novelty of the computational formulations we explore in this work lies in i the explicit formulation that a certain fraction of data should be detected as outliers and ii the error to be minimized being one sided because the measured concentration of post_translationally regulated proteins are expected to be lower than what a global regression would predict both these are ways of capturing our prior_knowledge of the problem domain in the computational formulation the methods we propose are shown to have the power to identify proteins whose stability is disturbed by post_translationally acting processes to a statistical_significance thus these data_driven techniques help to uncover functional_aspects of molecular_biology conflict of interest none declared
