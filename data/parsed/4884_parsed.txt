w cseq software and web_application to analyze c seq data circularized chromosome_conformation followed by deep_sequencing c seq is a powerful technique to identify genome_wide partners interacting with a pre specified genomic locus here we present a computational and statistical_approach to analyze c seq data generated from both enzyme digestion and sonication fragmentation based_methods we implemented a command_line software_tool and a web_interface called w cseq which takes in the raw c sequencing_data fastq_files as input performs automated statistical_analysis and presents results in a user_friendly manner besides providing users with the list of candidate interacting sites regions w cseq generates figures showing genome wide_distribution of interacting regions and sketches the enrichment of key features such as tsss ttss cpg_sites and dna replication_timing around c sites availability_and users can establish their own web_server by downloading source codes at https github com wglab w cseq additionally a demo web_server is available at http with the development of microscopy and genomic technologies it has been shown that three_dimensional genome_architecture within nucleus tremendously affects gene function and cell property the underlying component of genome_architecture is chromatin_interactions that occur at the genomewide scale the specific long_range genomic_segments contacts are achieved by chromatin looping and usually mediated by transcription_factors most of the interactions are between enhancer and promoter leading to well regulated gene_expression originated from c chromosome_conformation c seq van_de is specifically developed to assess the long_range dna dna interactions where one of the dna_segments is the locus of present a web_application named w cseq and show the results generated with w cseq by analyzing real_biological we describe w cseq a web_application for analyzing c seq data in an automated manner with rich visualization functionalities w cseq will be a valuable_tool to unveil the functional genome_organization
