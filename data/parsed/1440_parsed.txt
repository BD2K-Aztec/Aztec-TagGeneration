genetics_and divas a centralized genetic_variant repository representing individuals from multiple disease cohorts motivation a plethora of sequenced and genotyped disease cohorts is available to the biomedical research_community spread across many portals and represented in various formats results we have gathered several large studies including gera and gru and computed population and disease specific genetic_variant frequencies in total our portal provides fast access to genetic_variants observed in individuals from disease populations we also include controls such as the genomes and scripps wellderly conclusion combining multiple studies helps validate disease associated variants in each underlying data_set detect potential false_positives using frequencies of control populations and identify novel candidate disease_causing alterations in known or suspected genes availability_and dna_sequencing and genotyping_data from populations of various demographic backgrounds are becoming available to the biomedical research_community at an ever increasing pace individually targeted studies have provided insights into the genetic_underpinnings of diseases or confirm previously_identified causal alterations for congenital_heart coloboma schizophrenia and numerous others the power to discover novel disease_causing or protective alleles potentially becomes even larger when combining data from different studies thereby increasing the number of controls and cases for related_phenotypes and helping adjust for the mutational_spectrum for individuals of diverse ethnic_backgrounds
