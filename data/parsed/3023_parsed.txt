structural_bioinformatics mobidb a comprehensive database of intrinsic protein disorder annotations motivation disordered protein regions are key to the function of numerous processes within an organism and to the determination of a proteins biological role the most common source for protein disorder annotations disprot covers only a fraction of the available sequences alternatively the protein_data pdb has been mined for missing residues in x_ray herein we provide a centralized source for data on different flavours of disorder in protein_structures mobidb building on and expanding the content provided by already existing sources in addition to the disprot and pdb x_ray structures we have added experimental information from nmr structures and five different flavours of two disorder predictors espritz and iupred these are combined into a weighted consensus disorder used to classify disordered_regions into flexible and constrained disorder users are encouraged to submit manual annotations through a submission form mobidb features experimental annotations for proteins covering the entire pdb and predictions for the swissprot database with annotated sequences depending on the disorder flavour of the residues are predicted as disordered availability the database is freely_available mobidb bio during the last decade strong evidence has surfaced indicating that many proteins function in a natively unfolded or intrinsically_disordered state these regions have been shown to play_important in various biological_processes the amount of disorder within a proteome seems to correlate with the complexity of the organism especially in eukaryotes the existence of different flavours of disorder has been proposed and disordered_regions have been categorized according to their function with a suggested coupling between disorder conservation and protein_function the main repository for experimentally_determined disorder is the disprot database containing manually_curated information on currently ca proteins from the literature although invaluable as a gold_standard disprot represents only a to whom correspondence should be addressed fraction of the known protein_sequences posing a bottleneck for large_scale analysis of intrinsic protein disorder many prediction_methods have long resorted to considering the lack of coordinates in x_ray protein_structures as a proxy for intrinsic_disorder this increases the number of available sequences by an order of magnitude for mostly short disordered segments recently our group has also developed a method to define intrinsic_disorder by looking at mobile regions in nmr structures herein we describe mobidb a centralized resource for disorder annotation in protein_sequences
