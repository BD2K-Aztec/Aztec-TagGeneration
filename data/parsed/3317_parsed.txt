oefinder a user_interface to identify and visualize ordering effects in single_cell a recent article identified an artifact in multiple single_cell scrna_seq data_sets generated by the fluidigm c platform specifically leng et_al showed significantly_increased gene_expression in cells captured from sites with small or large plate output ids we refer to this artifact as an ordering effect oe including oe genes in downstream_analyses could lead to biased results to address this problem we developed a statistical_method and software called oefinder to identify a sorted list of oe genes oefinder is available as an r package along with user_friendly graphical_interface implementations which allows users to check for potential artifacts in scrna_seq data generated by the fluidigm c platform availability_and oefinder is freely_available at https github com lengning oefindersingle cell rna_seq scrna_seq has led to important findings in many fields and is becoming increasingly popular in studies of transcriptome_wide expression to facilitate scrna_seq the majority of studies utilize the fluidigm c platform for cell capture reverse transcription and cdna amplification as this platform allows for rapid and reliable isolation and processing of individual cells in spite of the advantages identified an artifact in multiple datasets generated by c and confirmed that the artifact was present in the cdna processed by the c machine in particular in these datasets there are genes showing higher expression in cells captured in specific capture sites these capture sites are the ones with small or large plate output ids we refer to this artifact as an ordering effect oe which has been shown to be independent of organism and laboratory as detailed in accurate identification of oe genes is important to ensure unbiased downstream_analyses used an anova based_approach to detect oe genes the anova based_approach performs well in many cases but has reduced power when few cells are available note that in empirical data the cells can be missed owing to the random_effects of capture failurean empty capture site or doubletscapturing more than one cells in one capture site to improve power for identifying oe genes we developed an approach oefinder based on orthogonal polynomial_regression results show that oefinder is less sensitive to sample_size and outperforms the anova based_approach when few cells are available oefinder is implemented in r a free_and language with a vignette that provides working examples the graphical_user gui implementations of oefinder allow users with little v c the author published_by we developed an r package oefinder which can robustly detect oe genes in scrna data generated by the fluidigm c platform oefinder provides user_friendly graphical_interface implementations that facilitate use by investigators
