data_and on safari to random jungle a fast implementation of random_forests for high_dimensional motivation genome_wide association gwa studies have proven to be a successful approach for helping unravel the genetic_basis of complex genetic_diseases however the identified associations are not well suited for disease prediction and only a modest portion of the heritability can be explained for most diseases such as type_diabetes or crohns_disease this may partly be due to the low power of standard statistical_approaches to detect genegene and gene_environment when small marginal_effects are present a promising alternative is random_forests which have already been successfully_applied in candidate_gene analyses important single_nucleotide are detected by permutation importance measures to this day the application to gwa data was highly cumbersome with existing implementations because of the high computational_burden results here we present the new freely_available software_package random jungle rj which facilitates the rapid analysis of gwa data the program yields valid results and computes up to times_faster than the fastest alternative implementation while still maintaining all options of other programs specifically it offers the different permutation importance measures available it includes new options such as the backward elimination method we illustrate the application of rj to a gwa of crohns_disease the most important single_nucleotide snps validate recent_findings in the literature and reveal potential interactions availability the rj software_package is freely_available atgenome wide association gwa studies have become a standard approach for helping unravel the genetic_basis of complex genetic_diseases the recent successes are tremendous and a series of new loci have been identified using single marker analyses unfortunately only a small portion of the to whom correspondence should be addressed heritability was explained by corresponding single_nucleotide snps for most diseases such as type_diabetes or crohns_disease furthermore snps identified by gwa studies for various diseases make poor classifiers for overcoming such drawbacks and recognizing the complexity of the underlying biology further mechanisms such as genegene_interaction need to be taken into account however the discovery of genegene_interactions using gwa studies remains_challenging with traditional statistical_approaches given genotype data at different loci an exhaustive_search of interactions between all loci is the obvious way of testing interactions testing all two locus interactions is computationally_feasible although time demanding however an exhaustive_search of higher_order interactions is computationally impractical because the number of tests increases exponentially with the order of interaction one approach to deal with such large_numbers of snps is to first perform univariate tests on each snp discard snps with high p values and apply interaction methods e g within logistic_regressions to snp subsets afterwards unfortunately such approaches may result in low power for snpsnp interactions with very small marginal_effects another concern is genetic_heterogeneity i e different subsets of genes affect the same disease and traditional statistical_methods show limitations when genetic_heterogeneity is present a promising alternative is random_forests rf was applied successfully to genetic data in various studies and it is anticipated that rf will help to detect genegene_interactions in genome_wide data it has been shown that rf can substantially be more efficient than standard statistical_methods in ranking the true disease associated snps in order to detect snpsnp interaction the method is able to detect snps with small effects and to deal with genetic_heterogeneity because separate_models are automatically fit to subsets of data defined by early splits in the tree in addition rf is able to handle snps that are associated in a non linear fashion the rf method is a specific data_mining method in data_mining in general algorithms attempt to identify an unknown concept based on randomly_chosen examples of the collected data the aim is to find a prediction rule that correctly classifies new instances of thethe rf method was applied to genome_wide data using rj and assigned a score of importance to each snp the resulting list of snps was investigated for potential interactions the results of the real_data analysis validate the findings of gwa studies such as nod and il r results give also evidence of new potential interactions between genes that are associated with crohns_disease specifically the tnfsf was not found to be strongly associated with crohns_disease by traditional statistical_tests in contrast rj analysis detected that tnfsf potentially interacts with nod prgk and il r stat is considered to be a link between tnfsf and il r which was shown to be moderately associated with crohns_disease the tnfsf is involved in apoptosis of human_colon tnfsf might possibly explain a part of the high_risk of colorectal_cancers in crohns_disease patients however interpreting_results and assessing biological_plausibility is challenging results may show false_positives thus further investigation is needed to validate this specific causal_relationship furthermore although rf has the ability to detect very small main effects its power to identify interactions depends on the presence of main effects thus genegene_interaction with no marginal_effects might be left unrevealed when rf is applied nevertheless an impressive computational_efficiency and memory management of rj allow for analyzing high_dimensional in an acceptable amount of time analyzing gwa data comprising thousands of observations and a million snps seem to be feasible with respect to time and memory_consumption the software computes up to times_faster than the fastest alternative implementation and the program shows the same importance ranking with respect to the reference program rj presents various features such as rf growing prediction parameter_tuning or imputation in summary rj is a promising software_package for applying rf method to high_dimensional such as gwa data the application of rf to gwa data may help to identify potential interacting snps that were not found by traditional statistical_approaches
