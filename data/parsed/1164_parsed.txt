genome_analysis cope an accurate k_mer based pair_end connection tool to facilitate genome_assembly motivation the boost of next_generation provides us with an unprecedented opportunity for elucidating genetic mysteries yet the short read_length hinders us from better assembling the genome from scratch new protocols now exist that can generate overlapping pair_end by joining the ends of each read_pair one is able to construct longer_reads for assembling however effectively joining two overlapped pair_end remains_a result in this article we present an efficient tool called connecting overlapped pair end cope reads to connect overlapping pair_end using k_mer frequencies we evaluated our tool on simulated pair_end from arabidopsis_thaliana with base error cope connected over of reads with accuracy which is respectively and higher than the recently_published tool flash when cope is applied to real reads for genome_assembly the resulting contigs are found to have fewer errors and give a fold_improvement in the n measurement when compared with the contigs produced using unconnected reads with the rapid development of high_throughput short_read sequencing_technologies a laboratory can now assemble a genome within a few weeks using only a few thousand us dollars despite the fact that existing genome_assembly algorithms already designed to fully utilize the advantages of short_reads the short_length of reads still deter us from a more comprehensive genome using longer_reads will significantly improve the quality of not only genome_assembly but also transcriptome and meta genome_assembly to overcome this problem new protocols for library_preparation now exist that can generate pair_end with an insert distance shorter than the total length of both reads i e with the ends of both reads overlapped this enables us to extend the read_length by authentically overlapping the ends of both reads to generate a longer overlapped read these longer_reads were shown to dramatically_increase the quality of the assembled genome however the insert distance cannot be controlled to be the same for all read_pairs instead it follows a distribution together with the sequencing_errors it becomes difficult to determine the correct position that the two reads overlap and what bases are in the overlapping region in case the two reads do not agree the correctness of the connected reads is extremely_important as existing assembly algorithms are sensitive to errors many assemblers are based on the approach of de_bruijn in which a read is sheared into k bp_long substrings called k_mers one single base error will introduce k spurious k_mer the situation could be worse if a larger k is used for illumina sequencing_technology specifically the sequencing_errors tend to intensify toward the end of the reads which makes the connection task more challenging to deal with sequencing_errors a straightforward approach is to perform error_correction before joining the reads many existing error_correction algorithms may require to trim the end of a read if the correction fails this will significantly reduce the number of reads that can be successfully connected one of the most recently_published read connection tools flash follows the idea of performing error_correction before joining the reads and it is found that quite a few read_pairs cannot be connected as they are trimmed other existing_tools such as pandaseq and shera also fail to provide a method to overcome the problem either in this article we present connecting overlapped pair end cope reads a novel approach to connect pair_end by utilizing k_mer frequency information directly to authenticate possible overlaps of reads we remark that k_mer frequency information was also used in error_correction in reads to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as we evaluated the correctness of our tool on fold simulated bp paired_end with error and found it surmounted flash on both accuracy and the number of reads connected we also applied cope to real reads for genome_assembly and showed that the n of the resulting contigs is times longer than the contigs produced using unconnected reads and even with fewer errors we tested the efficacy of cope using both simulated_and and illustrated our advantages by comparing to flash one of the most recently_published utility to join pair_end for correctness and sensitivity we also demonstrated that cope outperforms flash in terms of both length and base accuracy using the dataset published with flash
