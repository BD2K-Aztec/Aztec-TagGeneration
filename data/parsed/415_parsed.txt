bioimage_informatics a pattern matching approach to the automatic selection of particles from low contrast electron_micrographs motivation structural_information of macromolecular_complexes provides key insights into the way they carry out their biological_functions achieving high_resolution structural details with electron_microscopy requires the identification of a large number up to hundreds of thousands of single particles from electron_micrographs which is a laborious task if it has to be manually done and constitutes a hurdle towards high_throughput automatic particle selection in micrographs is far from being settled and new and more robust algorithms are required to reduce the number_of and false_negatives results in this article we introduce an automatic particle picker that learns from the user the kind of particles he is interested in particle candidates are quickly and robustly classified as particles or non particles a number of new discriminative shape related features as well as some statistical description of the image grey intensities are used to train two support_vector classifiers experimental_results demonstrate that the proposed method i has a considerably low computational_complexity and ii provides results better or comparable with previously_reported methods at a fraction of their computing time availability the algorithm is fully implemented in the open_source xmipp package and downloadable from http electron_microscopy em is a key tool to study the structure and function of biological_macromolecules at a mediumhigh resolution single_particle analysis is an em modality in which multiple copies of the same macromolecule are simultaneously imaged into a single micrograph particles from several hundreds or even thousands of micrographs are commonly_employed in a structural study the standard data_processing workflow of single_particle reconstruction includes particle selection particle alignment particle classification three_dimensional d reconstruction and model refinement different views of a specimen are required for the d reconstruction of a complex but these views suffer from low_signal snr due to low_dose imaging low contrast due to close to focus conditions and image deformations due to the microscope aberrations it is generally_accepted that high_resolution can only be achieved with thousands of projection images so that the d reconstruction algorithm can compensate for these challenging imaging conditions in particular there is generally a direct relationship between the number of selected particles and the maximum achievable resolution manually identifying that number of particles is not just time consuming and laborious but also an error_prone process a robust automatic particle picker app algorithm is therefore indispensable to enhance the techniques throughput as the selection of several thousands of particles from low_dose micrographs is the first and one of the crucial steps towards a highresolution reconstruction a large amount of effort has been made by researchers to develop accurate methods for app these methods have been classified into groups by different authors among them the classification by suggests a general categorization into template_matching based and feature based_approaches template_matching based_methods calculate the cross_correlation or any other measure of similarity between a set of templates and a micrograph image to seek for particle candidates templates are obtained either from different projections of an initial d volume or from a number of manually picked particles instead of using all templates either from different projections of an initial d volume or from a number of manually picked particles which severely increases the processing time other alternatives can be employed such as eigenimages of templates or some form of an average of each template cluster in feature based_approaches particles are sought through the calculation of some prominent geometric and or statistical_features of the particle images feature based_methods can be reference free or learning based in the former features corresponding to particles are known to fall within a certain region of the feature_space and therefore no training is necessary and the algorithm can start picking particles straightaway in the latter however a set of particles and nonparticles are required to train a classifier which is then able to distinguish between particles and non particles based on the training features although reference free methods require less effort from the user they are of limited applicability because the space region corresponding to particle features has to be known a priori we previously_introduced a feature_based app method that learns features from the user selected particles via a continuous learning_phase the algorithm is available in the open_source package xmipp in a manual picking step a small dataset of particle and non particle images is formed to train an ensemble naive bayesian_classifier once the classifier is trained it suggests new particles in a new micrograph the user supervises this result by discarding the wrongly picked particles and identifying the disregarded ones this feedback information is then submitted to the classifier which is updated to accommodate this new information this semi_automatic picking is continued on several micrographs until the user is satisfied by the results at this point the trained classifier carries out the selection of the particles in the remaining micrographs in a fully_automatic way in this article we introduce an app method that follows the general learning structure of but major_improvements are made to increase speed and accuracy our new feature_vector is completely different from the previous method and consists of a number of geometrical and statistical_features it is robust to noise very fast to compute and most of its features are rotationally invariant instead of naive_bayesian nb we now use a support_vector svm as the base classifier due to its interesting_properties like high generalization capabilities and small training classification time in order to reduce the number_of two svm classifiers are used one for discriminating between particle candidates and non particle objects and the other for checking if a particle candidate recognized by the first classifier is a real particle or not in contrast to which explores a big search_space for particles the proposed method limits the search_space to the peaks obtained from the cross_correlation of the micrograph with some pre_computed templates templates are generated during the manual picking step by clustering the clustering_algorithm is described in the hand picked particles and selecting the average of each cluster as the correlation with all orientations of the template noticeably increases the computation time a rotationally averaged template can be used instead the algorithm has been successfully tested on three experimental_datasets and compared with our previous algorithm which had in turn been compared with other approaches resulting in a more than an order of magnitude decrease in computing time while achieving even better performance we applied our app method on three datasets to assess the speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithm for micrographs with different contrast density and particle shape and size these corresponding to a given template a given particle template b first eigenvectors of the template that generate a rotational invariant subspace datasets are klh keyhole limpet haemocyanin adenovirus and helicase all the experiments were done with the same fixed parameters n b n h n rb and n i on a single core of a cpu intel core i bits ghz of a standard laptop with gigabytes of ram to show the results in a quantitative way we have used the performance_metrics introduced by langlois and frank if tp is the number of true_positives fp the number_of and fn the number of false_negatives then these metrics are defined asshows the fraction of picked particles by the algorithm that is real particles and recall indicates the fraction of true particles that are picked by the algorithm f measure is a harmonic mean to summarize both recall and precision
