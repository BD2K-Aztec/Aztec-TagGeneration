xdia improving on the label_free data independent analysis xdia is a computational strategy for analyzing multiplexed spectra acquired using electron_transfer and collision activated dissociation it significantly increases identified spectra and unique peptides when compared with the data dependent etcad analysis on middle down single phase shotgun proteomic_analysis increasing identified spectra and peptides improves quantitation statistics confidence and protein coverage respectively label_free approaches e g spectral_counting for the relative quantitation of complex_peptide have gained popularity because of their low_cost reasonable accuracy and simplicity however in accuracy they still fall behind the approaches that measure abundance by comparing peptides to an internal chemically identical standard enriched with a heavy stable_isotope the latter in turn are expensive and laborious but regardless of the strategy quantitation and identification efficiency and accuracy are constrained by limitations from the data_acquisition method the widely_adopted data dependent acquisition dda relies on a full range survey scan ms to select peptide ions for fragmentation peptides are then identified by submitting their tandem_mass ms to a protein database search_engine such as sequest or mascot in general dda selects the most abundant peaks in the ms for individual fragmentation and the peaks for which ms is acquired are excluded for a short period of time from further ms acquisition if there are many co eluting ions however there may be insufficient time to acquire ms data for all ion species and thus some low_abundance ions may never be identified poor sampling of low_abundance ions affects overall sampling statistics thereby impacting the accuracy of quantitation especially for the lowest abundance peptides this process is repeated until a desired m z range is covered then the xdia processor is used to enable for protein identification page
