structural_bioinformatics yasara view molecular_graphics for all devices from smartphones to workstations todays graphics_processing gpus compose the scene from individual triangles as about triangles are needed to approximate a single spherean atomin a convincing way visualizing larger proteins with atomic details requires tens of millions of triangles far too many for smooth interactive frame_rates we describe a new approach to solve this molecular_graphics problem which shares the work between gpu and multiple cpu cores generates high_quality results with perfectly round spheres shadows and ambient lighting and requires only opengl functionality without any pixel shader z buffer access a feature which is missing in most mobile_devices availability_and yasara view a molecular model ing program built around the visualization algorithm described here is freely_available including commercial use for linux macos windows and android intel from www yasara org in cyrus levinthal pioneered molecular_graphics at the massachusetts institute of technology when he set up the first interactive wire frame display of a protein on a monochrome oscilloscope since then molecular_graphics has made tremendous_progress mostly thanks to the video_game industry which induced the rise of graphics_processing gpus today many different molecular visualizers are available e g vmd chimera pymol or qutemol each using different tricks to boost rendering performance and quality we describe an algorithm that can cope with two specific difficulties first it does not depend on high end shader tricks and thus works on smartphones too and second it does not require expensive precalculation steps that depend on atom positions it can thus visualize moving atoms allowing to perform interactive molecular_dynamics simulations on smartphones and tablets
