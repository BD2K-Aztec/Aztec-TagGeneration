a method for de_novo nucleic_acid diagnostic target discovery motivation a proper target or marker is essential in any diagnosis e g an infection or cancer an ideal diagnostic target should be both conserved in and unique to the pathogen currently these targets can only be identified manually which is time consuming and usually error_prone because of the increasingly frequent occurrences of emerging epidemics and multidrug_resistant superbugs a rapid diagnostic target_identification process is needed results a new method that can identify uniquely conserved_regions ucrs as candidate diagnostic targets for a selected group of organisms solely from their genomic_sequences has been developed and successfully tested using a sequence indexing algorithm to identify ucrs and a k_mer integer mapping model for computational_efficiency this method has successfully identified ucrs within the bacteria domain for test groups including pathogenic probiotic commensal and extremophilic bacterial_species or strains based on the identified ucrs new diagnostic primer_sets were designed and their specificity and efficiency were tested by polymerase_chain amplifications from both pure isolates and samples containing mixed cultures availability_and the ucrs identified for the bacterial_species are now freely_available ucr synblex com the source_code of the programs used in this study is accessible atfinding the proper target or marker for a specific disease e g an infection or cancer is essential for its successful diagnosis an ideal candidate_region must be both conserved in and unique to the specific target e g a pathogen species or strain i e a uniquely conserved_region to ensure specific and effective detection target specific nucleic_acid diagnostic_methods including hybridization amplification and sequencing have been widely used in academia and in health_care food_safety and biosecurity industries specific yet sensitive oligonucleotides probes or primers are essential to all of these assays current_tools such as primer and primer blast can only facilitate probe or primer_design when a candidate_region is provided but are not able to identify these candidate_regions by themselves so_far no existing_tools can identify these candidate_regions de_novo and these candidate targets can only be selected manually usually based on the pathogens known properties such as secreted toxins or genes involved in its pathogenesis this process is time consuming and usually error_prone as the proposed detection primers must be thoroughly examined to ensure that they are universally present within the targeted group e g a pathogenic_species or strain and to rule out high similarity matches in unintended groups more pressingly the number of emerging epidemics and cases with multidrugresistant pathogens has continued to increase in recent_years early and accurate_diagnosis is crucial in these cases which often necessitate a rapid_diagnostic development as a result methods that can automatically identify these candidate_regions within a reasonable time frame and have an affordable cost are desirable a total of bacterial_genomes were obtained from the ncbi nucleotide database in december because of the high_probability of horizontal_gene for plasmids only genomic_dna was included the k_mer length was selected as which can produce ucr k_mers that may be directly used as primers while at the same time maintaining a manageable index size the background mer occurrence index was computed costing cpu h ghz and the total uncompressed size was gb these mer occurrences were largely uniformly_distributed across the mapped integer space close to of the mers did not exist in the known bacterial_genomes and among those that did exist only had no more than five occurrences this indicates that the bacterial mer space is unsaturated which means that there are many potential ucr mers the ucr identification method described here was able to successfully and automatically with reasonable efficiency identify regions that are both conserved in and unique to a selected bacterial group a species or strain solely based on their genomic_sequences these regions are by definition ideal diagnostic targets for nucleic_acid amplification and or sequencing although high_throughput has been used in major medical_centers to identify and track emerging epidemics and multidrug_resistant bacterial_infections most medical_facilities and reference laboratories lack the necessary equipment or personnel to take full advantage of these latest technologies however with this method effective and accurate nucleic_acid diagnostic targets could be rapidly identified from the data generated at those major medical_centers or government_agencies and can be quickly adopted by most hospitals and laboratories with existing procedures such as pcr the ucrs identified for the bacterial_species are now freely_available ucr synblex com the source_code of the programs used in this study is accessible at http ucr synblex com bacterialidsourcecode d zip while an automated pipeline for diagnostic target and primer selection is under development hopefully this new method could rapidly and efficiently generate diagnostic targets that are both specific and sensitive and ultimately lead to improved bacterial infectious_disease management
