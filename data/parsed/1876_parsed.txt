fragment free approach to protein_folding using conditional neural fields motivation one of the major bottlenecks with ab_initio is an effective conformation sampling algorithm that can generate native like conformations quickly the popular fragment assembly method generates conformations by restricting the local conformations of a protein to short structural_fragments in the pdb this method may limit conformations to a subspace to which the native_fold does not belong because i a protein with really new fold may contain some structural_fragments not in the pdb and ii the discrete nature of fragments may prevent them from building a native like fold previously we have developed a conditional_random crf method for fragment free protein_folding that can sample conformations in a continuous space and demonstrated that this crf method compares_favorably to the popular fragment assembly method however the crf method is still limited by its capability of generating conformations compatible with a sequence results we present a new fragment free approach to protein_folding using a recently invented probabilistic_graphical conditional neural fields cnf this new cnf method is much more powerful than crf in modeling the sophisticated protein_sequence structure relationship and thus enables us to generate native like conformations more easily we show that when coupled with a simple energy function and replica exchange monte_carlo our cnf method can generate decoys much better than crf on a variety of test proteins including the casp free modeling targets in particular our cnf method can predict a correct fold for t d one of the two casp_targets with truly new fold our predicted model for t is significantly better than all the casp models contact despite significant progress in recent_years ab_initio is still one of the most challenging problems in computational_structural fragment based ab_initio and lattice models has been extensively_studied these two popular_methods and their combination for protein modeling have achieved great success in critical assessment of structure_prediction casp competitions for example the widely used fragment assembly program rosetta is one of the most successful ab_initio programs the tasser program and its derivative zhang server have achieved outstanding to whom correspondence should be addressed performance in both casp and casp by combining lattice model and threading generated fragments and distance_restraints although fragment based ab_initio demonstrates encouraging performance several important issues remain with this method first there is no guarantee that the local conformations of a protein can be accurately covered by short structural_fragments in the pdb since a protein with new fold is likely to be composed of some structural_motifs that rarely occur in the pdb andras fiser casp talk second the conformation space defined by a fragment library is discrete in nature this discrete nature may exclude the native_fold from the conformational search_space since even a slight_change in backbone angles especially in the middle region of a protein can result in a totally different fold to resolve these two limitations this article will propose a fragment free folding method that can efficiently explore protein conformations in a continuous space in literature there are quite a few fragment free methods for ab_initio protein_folding for example joe et_al described an iterative folding method which folds a protein by mimicking folding_pathway and explores the conformation space by directly sampling the backbone angles using a trimer library shakhnovich group also described a method that can directly sample backbone angles using a trimer library first predict the backbone angles of a protein using a machine_learning and then explore protein conformation search_space using a genetic_algorithm based upon the predicted backbone angles recently have developed two hidden_markov hmms i e fb hmm and torus hmm for fragment free conformation sampling using a torus hmm_model they can generate local conformations as accurately as the fragment assembly method however these hmm models have not been applied to realworld ab_initio yet recently we have proposed a protein conformation sampling algorithm based on conditional_random crf and directional statistics the crf model is a generalization of the hmm models and much more powerful than hmm our crf model can accurately describe the complex sequence angle relationship and estimate the probability_distribution of virtual backbone angles directly from sequence_information and predicted_secondary we have shown that by using the crf models we can sample protein conformations with much better quality than fb hmm we have also shown that by coupling our crf model with a simple energy function our method compares_favorably with fragment assembly in the casp blind prediction this article_presents a new probabilistic_graphical conditional neural fields cnfs for ab_initio cnf is recently invented by our group for the modeling of sequential data seefor a detailed exposition cnf ispage i i i since in our previous work we have demonstrated that our crf method compares_favorably with the popular fragment based robetta server in the casp blind prediction in this article we will focus on the comparison between our cnf and crf methods and show that our nre method is indeed superior over our previous method we test our new method using two datasets and compare it with our previous method these two datasets were used to evaluate our previous method before the first dataset consists of proteins aa beo ctfa dkta enha fc c fca fgp jer nkl pgb sro trla croa gb a icba t t t t t and t these proteins have very different secondary_structure type and their sizes range from to residues some proteins e g t t t t t and t in this dataset are very old casp_targets therefore we denote this dataset as old testset the second dataset contains casp free modeling targets t d t d t d t t d t d t t t t d t d and t d these proteins are called free modeling targets because a structurally_similar template cannot be identified for them using a template based method we denote this dataset as casp testset to avoid bias we removed all the proteins similar to the first dataset from our training_set see section since the training_set was constructed before casp started there is no overlap between our training data and the casp testset this article has presented a new fragment free approach to protein ab_initio by using a recently invented probabilistic_graphical cnf our fragment free approach can overcome some limitations of the popular fragment assembly method that is this new method can sample protein conformations in a continuous space while the fragment based_methods cannot do so this cnf method is also better than our previous crf method in that i this method can easily model non linear relationship between protein_sequence and structure and ii we can also minimize energy function to lower values experimental_results indicate that our cnf method clearly outperforms the crf method on most of the test proteins previously we have compared our crf method with the popular fragment based robetta server in the casp blind prediction and shown that our crf method is on average better than robetta on mainly alpha or small beta proteins this article further confirms our advantage on mainly alpha or small beta proteins since cnf is better than crf in modeling non linear sequence structure relationship we are going to incorporate more information such as amino_acid physicalchemical property profile to our model so that we can improve sampling efficiency further we will also extend our cnf method so that long_range hydrogen_bonding can also be modeled
