sequence_analysis bima v an aligner customized for mate_pair library sequencing mate_pair library sequencing is an effective and economical method for detecting genomic structural_variants and chromo somal abnormalities unfortunately the mapping and alignment of mate_pair read_pairs to a reference_genome is a challenging and time consuming process for most next_generation alignment programs large insert_sizes introduction of library_preparation protocol artifacts biotin junction reads paired_end contamination chimeras etc and presence of structural variant breakpoints within reads increase mapping and alignment complexity we describe an algorithm that is up to times_faster and more accurate than popular next_generation alignment programs when processing mate_pair sequencing large_genomic chromosomal_rearrangements play_an in the development and progression of many cancers amplifications inversions deletions and translocations can modify the expression and or functionality of many tumor_suppressors and oncogenes thus identification of large genomic_rearrangements in cancer_cells can greatly aid in our understanding of the mechanisms_underlying cancer_progression mate_pair mp library sequencing offers an efficient a costeffective and a comprehensive method to detect the presence of and to determine the fine grain structure of structural_variants throughout the entire_genome mps large kb fragment_size increases the likelihood that a read_pair will span a structural variant and minimizes the number of read_pairs required to detect and characterize an event multiple samples can be processed on a single lane of a flow cell reducing costs without degrading accuracy coverage analysis can accurately determine aneuploidy amplification and deletion on multiplexed samples for a detailed_description of the mp sequencing protocol please refer to http www illumina com technology mate_pair sequen_cing assay ilmn the mp library_preparation protocol introduces several sequencing artifacts that complicate mp read_pair mapping and alignment after shearing biotin end labeling and size_selection kb dna_fragments are circularized by joining two ends of a single fragment in the circularization step chimeras or false mps can be generated when two separate fragments ligate before sequencing the circularized dna is randomly sheared into bp fragments and the biotin containing fragments are isolated because shearing is random the biotin junction can be within the sequencers read_length of either end of the fragment producing reads containing sequence from two different genomic_locations finally the biotin isolation step is not efficient of the sequenced read_pairs consist of paired_end the use of large insert_sizes and the presence of paired_end biotin junctions chimeras and breakpoint junctions in mp sequencing make alignment more difficult and time consuming large insert_sizes and chimeric reads increase the expected paired read_mapping search_space sequencing through biotin junctions of bp reads and structural variant breakpoint junctions produces reads containing sequence from multiple genomic_locations the presence of pair_end chimeras and discordant read_pairs spanning structural_variants increases the complexity of correctly scoring paired genomic_locations to address the difficulties of mp sequencing alignment we have created binary indexing mapping algorithm bima v the latest_version of a mapping and alignment_tool designed to handle mp sequencing artifacts building on bimas proven track record v s enhancements allow it to accurately align up to more reads in up to the time of currently popular next_generation ngs alignment programs the accuracy and execution time of bima v were compared with two popular ngs alignment programs burrows_wheeler aligner bwa and novoalign http www novocraft com two data_sets one synthetic and one real were used to measure alignment_accuracy and single threaded execution time each data_set consisted of mp read_pairs total reads each bp in length the whole_genome simulator for next_generation dwgsim https github com nh dwgsim wiki were used to generate and evaluate the synthetic data_set the real data_set was sequencing from the lymph_node prostate_cancer cell_line lncap prostate_adenocarcinoma and was evaluated by comparing the reference_genome position predicted by the ngs alignment programs with reference_genome positions predicted by blast like alignment_tool blat the synthetic data_set portrays all evaluated aligners being roughly_equivalent in accuracy bima having a slight advantage but vary significantly in alignment time unfortunately synthetic mp sequencing does not accurately model all artifacts present in real mp sequencing biotin breakpoint junctions paired_end contamination chimeras etc both novoalign and bwa require a considerable amount of additional processing time to to deliver significantly_fewer accurately mapped_reads to on real mp sequencing bima v s utilization of three hash tables with bit keys requires a significant amount of process memory gb during hash_table creation and gb during alignment compared with novoalign and bwa gb and gb respectively it is faster for bima to generate indexes during every invocation seconds using three threads than read in a compressed pre_computed index from a shared file system because novoalign and bwa pre compute their indexes the alignment times reported in tables and do not include index generation bima v accurately aligns more mp reads in less time than popular ngs alignment programs enabling researchers to discover more structural_variants with less coverage researchers are already using it to develop new genetic_testing methods k cradic et_al manuscript submitted and reprocess s of existing mp data_sets to identify previously_undetected structural_variants the lncap cell_line was sequenced
