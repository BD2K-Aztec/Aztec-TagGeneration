data_and vizardous interactive analysis of microbial_populations with single_cell resolution motivation single_cell time lapse microscopy is a powerful method for investigating heterogeneous cell_behavior advances in microfluidic lab_on technologies and live_cell render the parallel observation of the development of individual cells in hundreds of populations possible while image_analysis tools are available for cell detection and tracking biologists are still confronted with the challenge of exploring and evaluating this data results we present the software_tool vizardous that assists scientists with explorative analysis and interpretation tasks of single_cell data in an interactive configurable and visual way with vizardous lineage tree drawings can be augmented with various time resolved cellular characteristics associated statistical moments bridge the gap between single_cell and the population average level availability_and the software including documentation and examples is available as executable java archive as well as in source form at https github com modsim vizardous single_cell analysis with time lapse fluorescence_microscopy has been widely established in the life_sciences in recent_years whereas microarray_analysis and flow_cytometry yield population_level at a particular point in time time lapse live_cell targets the assessment of individual cell parameters with their spatial and temporal lineage context microfluidic lab on chip technologies have enabled the parallel cultivation of hundreds of cells over several generations combined with time lapse imaging it has been used e g to study the dynamics of cellular_regulation mechanisms and stochasticity of metabolism to investigate cellular size homeostasis and phenotypic heterogeneity in dependence of stressors as well as the detection of rare_events the easy availability of time resolved data poses new challenges on data analysis by the mere amounts and complexity of acquired information while several typically organism specific image_analysis tools are available for cell detection feature_extraction and tracking tools for the generic task of analyzing and understanding this information are lacking we developed the software_tool vizardous to assist researchers with the following single_cell data related_tasks i visualize data with single_cell resolution in the lineage context ii visually detect emerging structural patterns such as a symmetries in subtrees and iii assessing joint cellular properties and structural_motifs
