data_and sqid_xlink implementation of an intensity incorporated algorithm for cross_linked peptide_identification peptide_identification algorithm is a major_bottleneck for mass_spectrometry based chemical_cross experiments our lab recently_developed an intensity incorporated peptide_identification algorithm and here we implemented this scheme for cross_linked peptide discovery our program sqid_xlink searches all regular dead_end intra_and cross_linked peptides simultaneously and its effectiveness is validated by testing a published dataset this new algorithm provides an alternative approach for high_confidence cross_linking identification availability sqid_xlink program is freely_available for download fromchemical cross_linking coupled_with is a powerful approach to analyze protein_structures and interactions in such an experiment spatially adjacent amino_acid from one or more proteins are covalently_linked by chemical reagents the cross_linked proteins are then enzymatically digested and the resulting cross_linked peptide pairs can be detected by mass_spectrometry identification of these cross_linked peptides enables researchers to define the interaction sites of proteins in a complex in their native states and to build or confirm structural_models compared with traditional_techniques such as nmr and x_ray mass_spectrometry based chemical_cross does not require a large quantity of sample moreover recent development of high_resolution and high_throughput mass_spectrometers such as the orbitrap have offered increased efficiency and sensitivity required for the identification of cross_linked peptides although the chemical_cross approach is promising the data analysis for chemical_cross forms a major_limitation for this technique this is mainly because cross_linked sequences are non linear thus traditional protein database_search algorithms such as sequest and x tandem cannot be directly employed the development of new database_searching algorithms enables more and more protein identification from a single_shot gun proteomics experiment however these novel approaches have seldom implemented a cross_linking search function to increase the number of identified cross_linked peptides moreover many current cross_linking algorithms are slow lack graphical_user and need extensive manual data interpretation before and after the search these shortcomings motivated us to make a powerful and user_friendly to identify cross_linked peptides here we report the implementation of our recently_developed peptide_identification algorithm sqid to cross_linked peptide_identification sqid_xlink our algorithm features an intensity incorporated scoring_function when a strong peak in a spectrum agrees with the statistical value the confidence will be boosted for example if a cid induced cleavage occurs n_terminal to proline or c terminal to glutamic_acid or aspartic_acid the score will be higher this is similar to manually checking a spectrum to confirm if the strong peaks are from cleavages expected to lead to abundant peaks due to the low_abundance of cross_linked peptides and corresponding poorer spectral_quality incorporating intensity into cross_linking search algorithms will be potentially very beneficial in addition sqid_xlink searches all regular dead_end cross_linked at only one reactive_site of the cross_linker intra peptide cross_linked at two locations within a single peptide and inter peptide cross_links simultaneously with the same scoring_function so that the probability of false identification can be minimized a published edc cross_linking dataset of human cytochrome_p e p and cytochrome b b was used to test the program the dataset contains spectra and was collected using an ltq_orbitrap with high_resolution for both the precursor and ms masses the search was performed with three missed cleavages and a ppm precursor and ppm fragment m z tolerance against both the target and decoy version of the database the decoy_database was built with reverse sequences of the two proteins plus twice the number of randomized sequences with times larger search_space compared with the target_database shows a plot of score versus precursor m z error the majority of high score hits observed have a precursor mass error within to ppm and decoy hits have a maximum_score of as a result using to ppm and a score of as a threshold should give a false_discovery fdr close to with these parameters we discovered high_confidence peptide_spectrum with from non cross_linked tryptic_peptides from cross_linked peptides and from intra peptide cross_links the minimum score for matched cross_linked peptides was which is far above the threshold used summarizes the unique cross_linked peptides that are assigned by sqid_xlink and comparison with a popular cross_linking search_engine xquest as well as comparison with previously_published from crux and popitam xquest was searched using the same parameters as sqid_xlink and the fdr was determined with the same target decoy_database search_strategy we use published popitam and crux results directly instead of using our own search results because popitam needs an additional algorithm to pre filter the data and needs extensive manual interpretation to associate the modification mass with peptide_sequence while crux relies on its own fdr_estimation system which needs the optimization of many parameters the published_data were already optimized by the authors and manually verified so they represent the best performance of the two algorithms our results show that sqid_xlink can identify a larger number of cross_linked peptides at high_confidence the two intra protein cross_linked products gtvvvptldsvlydnqefpdpek fkpehflnengk and lytmdgitvtvadlffagtettsttlr ygllil mkypeieek inof the referenceare matched to linear_peptides with missed cleavages by both sqid_xlink and xquest the spectra of these products as well as a complete list of identified peptides by sqid_xlink crux from our own searches and xquest can be found in the supplementary_material in terms of speed the total search time including database processing was only min for sqid_xlink and min for crux on a bit computer with intel_xeon ghz cpu crux only works on bit computer while it took min for the xquest webserver depending on the server load we have introduced sqid_xlink an open_source program for cross_linked peptide_identification by testing it with a publisheddataset and comparing it with the results of existing algorithms sqid_xlink demonstrated its ability to identify more crosslinked peptides at high_confidence in addition sqid_xlink is fast and has an easy to use graphical_user more cross_linker support and better visualization of the results will be added in the near future
