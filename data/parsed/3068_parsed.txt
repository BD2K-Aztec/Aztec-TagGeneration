mogen a tool for reconstructing d models of genomes from chromosomal conformation capturing data motivation the three_dimensional d conformation of chromosomes and genomes play_an in cellular_processes such as gene_regulation dna_replication and genome methyla tion several methods have been developed to reconstruct d structures of individual chromosomes from chromosomal conformation capturing data such as hi c data however few methods can effectively reconstruct the d structures of an entire_genome due to the difficulty of handling noisy and inconsistent inter chromosomal contact data results we generalized a d chromosome reconstruction method to make it capable of reconstructing d models of genomes from both intra_and chromosomal hi c contact data and implemented it as a software_tool called mogen we validated mogen on synthetic datasets of a polymer worm_like and a yeast_genome at first and then applied it to generate an ensemble of d structural_models of the genome of human b cells from a hi c dataset these gen ome models not only were validated by some known structural patterns of the human_genome such as chromosome compartmentalization chromosome_territories co localization of small chromosomes in the nucleus center with the exception of chromosome enriched center toward inter chromosomal interactions between elongated or telomere regions of chromosomes but also demonstrated the intrinsically dynamic orientations between chromosomes therefore mogen is a useful tool for converting chromosomal contact data into d genome models to provide a better view into the spatial_organization of genomes availability_and the software of mogen is available at http calla rnet missouri edu mogen the three_dimensional d structures of chromosomes and genomes play_an in biological_processes such as gene_regulation dna_replication genegene_interaction genome methylation maintenance of genome_stability and recurrent chromosomal_translocation analyzing d structures of chromosomes and genomes is therefore an important task in studying functions of genomes fluorescence_in fish has been used to study the d organization of chromosomes and genomes however due to its low_throughput and low_resolution it cannot be applied to study genomes at a fine or large_scale recently chromosome_conformation c based techniques such as hi c and tcc have emerged as powerful_tools for capturing the proximity of chromosomal fragments within the same chromosome intrachromosomal contacts or between different chromosomes interchromosomal contacts these chromosomal contacts can provide new insights into the d organization of genomes moreover they can also be used to infer d structures of chromosomes and genomes several methods have been proposed to reconstruct d structures of chromosomes from chromosomal contacts which adopt one of the two main strategies the first strategy relies on the principles of polymer physics of the chromatin to build models that are consistent with observed chromosomal contacts the second strategy converts chromosomal contacts into restraints and then constructs models to satisfy these restraints methods utilize the second strategy are called restraint based_methods a common approach used by restraint based_methods is to convert chromosomal contacts into spatial distances first and then solves the problem of satisfying these spatial restraints as an optimization_problem depending how restraints are satisfied the optimization procedure could yield one single model or a set of models we developed a restraint based method in which contacts and non contacts are supposed to satisfy a distance threshold rather than a specific distance value which is tackled as an optimization_problem different from most restraint based_methods our method does not require converting contacts into distances when contacts are highly_consistent and can be satisfied altogether our method_produces similar models but when contacts are largely inconsistent different models are produced although reasonable d structures of individual chromosomes can be built by some of these methods it still difficult to reconstruct d structures of large_genomes such as the human_genome consisting of a number of chromosomes from both intra_and chromosomal contacts to the best of our knowledge currently no existing_methods had built the structural_models of the entire_human consisting of pairs of chromosomes from hi c data which exhibit the known features of the human_genome such as chromosome_territories and the clustering of small chromosomes in the center with the exception of chromosome the limitation could partially be due to the difficulty of handling noisy and often inconsistent inter chromosomal contacts of low interaction frequency if to assemble individual chromosome structures together while satisfying intra chromosomal contacts with much higher if in order to overcome this problem we generalized our d chromosome reconstruction method to make it capable of reconstructing d models of a large genome such as the human genomeutilizing both intra and interchromosomal contact data we benchmarked the method on two synthetic datasets of the yeast_genome and of a polymer worm_like and the real hi c data of the human_genome and implemented it as a software_tool called mogen for users to reconstruct d genome structures we validated our method on two independent synthetic datasets one from a polymer worm_like and one from a yeast_genome model consisting of several chromosomes the validation on the dataset of the worm_like is described in section and the validation on the dataset of the yeast_genome is included in the supplementary_material
