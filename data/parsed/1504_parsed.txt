genome_analysis dupliphy web a web_server for dupliphy and dupliphy ml gene_duplication and loss are important processes in the evolution of gene_families moreover growth of families by duplication and retention is an important mechanism by which organisms gain new functions therefore the ability to infer the evolutionary_histories of families is an important step in understanding the evolution of function we have recently_developed dupliphy a software_tool to infer gene family_histories using parsimony and maximum_likelihood here we present dupliphy web a web_server for dupliphy that implements additional maximum_likelihood functionality and provides users an intuitive_interface to run dupliphy availability_and dupliphy web is available at www bioinf manchester ac uk dupliphy ohno first proposed that gene or genome duplication is a major mechanism for generating functional innovation and genome_evolution for eukaryotes it has been estimated that of genes are expected to duplicate at least once in time scales of the order of million years indeed up to of the yeast_genome may have arisen by duplication_events there is also evidence for whole_genome wgd in yeast which was followed by rapid and extensive gene loss gene_duplication also seems to have been important in the evolution of humans determining the evolution of gene_families and identifying the gain_and is therefore necessary to understanding the processes of gene_family evolution previously we have released the software dupliphy that provides weighted parsimony and maximum_likelihood methods to accurately infer the evolutionary_histories of gene_families the software has been used to identify lineage_specific expansions of gene_families in yeast dupliphy works on gene_copy counts to infer gene_family evolution and is different from tree_reconciliation methods that infer duplication and loss events based on gene and species_trees the tool requires a file describing the membership of gene_families for a range of species and a phylogenetic_tree describing the evolutionary_relationship between these species the dupliphy programs are written in java v and are run from the command_line here we introduce dupliphy web a web_interface for the dupliphy programs that provides users with a visual method of running the programs without any local installation there is substantial help documentation and a walkthrough for novice users including advice on the interpretation of the results additionally dupliphy ml has been updated with a new model of gene_family evolution and to make the program more configurable ultimately dupliphy web will provide a useful tool for analysing gene_family evolution
