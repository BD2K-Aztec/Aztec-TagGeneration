gene_expression discovering transcription_factor regulatory_targets using gene_expression and binding data motivation identifying the target_genes regulated by transcription_factors tfs is the most basic step in understanding gene_regulation recent_advances in high_throughput together with chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip enable mapping tf_binding genome_wide but it is not possible to infer function from binding alone this is especially true in mammalian_systems where regulation often occurs through long_range enhancers in gene_rich neighborhoods rather than proximal promoters preventing straightforward assignment of a binding_site to a target_gene results we present ember expectation_maximization of binding and expression_profiles a method that integrates high_throughput binding data e g chip_chip or chip_seq with gene_expression data e g dna_microarray via an unsupervised machine_learning algorithm for inferring the gene_targets of sets of tf_binding genes selected are those that match overrepresented expression_patterns which can be used to provide information about multiple tf regulatory modes we apply the method to genome_wide human breast_cancer data and demonstrate that ember confirms a role for the tfs estrogen_receptor retinoic_acid alpha and gamma in breast_cancer development whereas the conventional approach of assigning regulatory_targets based on proximity does not additionally we compare several predicted target_genes from ember to interactions inferred previously examine combinatorial_effects of tfs on gene_regulation and illustrate the ability of ember to discover multiple_modes of regulation availability all code used for this work is available atthe fundamental step in gene_regulation is a transcription_factor tf_binding dna recent_advances in dna_sequencing and microarray_technologies have led to huge increases in the amount of information that biologists can accumulate about this process to whom correspondence should be addressed in particular chipchip and chip_seq have enabled genome_wide mapping of tf_binding in a single experiment knowledge of these binding_sites is one of the key_steps in determining which genes are regulated by a tf but the binding_sites alone are not sufficient to infer regulation in simple organisms such as bacteria or yeast most transcriptional_regulation occurs by a tf_binding in a promoter_region near the transcription_start tss of a gene however as organisms increase in complexity more regulation occurs through long_range enhancers often spanning many tens_of of base_pairs in fact these enhancer interactions become the principal form of gene_regulation in more complex species for example in the human chip_chip data that we discuss later in this article only of the binding_sites are in promoters defined as kb from a tss in this case it is not obvious which gene a particular binding_site may be regulating enhancer regulation is independent of the binding_site orientation relative to the regulated gene and even transcription_factors bound to a particular gene may regulate a different gene through an enhancer additionally binding_sites in gene_rich locations of the genome have a large number of potential targets nearby although we may have some idea of the maximum range at which an enhancer is likely to function any gene within that distance must be considered a potential target a common approach to assigning gene_targets to tf_binding is simply to use proximity regulation is inferred by the presence of a binding_site close to a gene most often by assignment to the nearest gene this approach is clearly an over simplification as it is not clear that a gene kb from a gene is significantly more likely to be regulated than a gene kb away for example more importantly this approach can miss important long_range and is unable to distinguish functional from non functional_binding in situations where enhancer regulation is predominant more information is needed to properly pair binding_sites with their regulatory_targets we propose using gene_expression information to assign tf_binding to gene_targets namely we assume that genes regulated by a tf should behave in some measurably consistent_manner that is there should be some subset of true targets within the many potential targets surrounding each binding_site and we should
