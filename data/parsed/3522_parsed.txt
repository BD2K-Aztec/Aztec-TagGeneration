pharmacogx an r package for analysis of large pharmacogenomic datasets pharmacogenomics holds_great for the development of biomarkers of drug response and the design of new therapeutic_options which are key_challenges in precision_medicine however such data are scattered and lack standards for efficient access and analysis consequently preventing the realization of the full potential of pharmacogenomics to address_these we implemented pharmacogx an easy to use open_source package for integrative_analysis of multiple pharmacogenomic datasets we demonstrate the utility of our package in comparing large drug_sensitivity datasets such as the genomics of drug_sensitivity in cancer and the cancer_cell moreover we show how to use our package to easily perform connectivity_map analysis with increasing availability of drug related data our package will open new avenues of research for meta_analysis of pharmacogenomic data availability_and pharmacogx is implemented in r and can be easily installed on any system the package is available from cran and its source_code is available from github one of the main challenges in precision_medicine consists in identifying the best therapy for each patient this is crucial in oncology where multiple cytotoxic and targeted_drugs are available but their therapeutic_benefits are either insufficient or limited to a subset of cancer patients there is therefore a dire need for new anticancer_drugs and robust biomarkers predictive of therapy response for individual patients in this context large_scale pharmacogenomic studiescould effectively achieve these goals by screening large panel of cancer_cell using multiple drug_candidates these data are referred to as drug_sensitivity datasets the genomics of drug_sensitivity in cancer gdsc and the cancer_cell ccle studies have reported results of such screens revealing several known and novel drug sensitivities and biomarkers subsequent evaluation however found only moderate inter laboratory concordance in the drug response phenotypes possibly due to differences in the experimental_protocols used in the two studies other pharmacogenomic studies such as the connectivity_map project characterized the transcriptional changes induced by a large set of drugs these data are referred to as drug perturbation datasets for the full potential of these pharmacogenomics to be realized new analytical_approaches must be developed to best leverage the large quantity of valuable molecular and pharmacological data in the context of drug_discovery and biomarker_development however the lack of standardization of experimental_protocols and annotations hinders meta_analysis of large pharmacogenomic studies to address_these we developed pharmacogx an r package enabling users to download and interrogate large pharmacogenomic datasets that were extensively curated to ensure maximum overlap and consistency pharmacogx provides parallelized functions not only to assess the reproducibility of pharmacological and molecular data but also to identify the molecular_features that are consistently associated with drug effects the pharmacogx package enables easy and efficient analysis of the increasingly available compendium of pharmacogenomic data to the best of the authors knowledge this package is the first to integrate_multiple pharmacogenomic datasets using structured objects incorporating standardization of cell_line and drug identifiers pharmacogx includes functions to link molecular_features to drug_sensitivity and perturbation phenotypes therefore providing with a unified_framework to develop drug related molecular_signatures given that the gdsc and ccle pharmacoset objects contain multiple types of molecular_profiles which are linked to pharmacological profiles these datasets open new avenues of research for the development of integrative biomarkers of drug response as more datasets will be curated in pharmacosets our package will enable meta_analysis of large pharmacogenomic studies with the aim to build better biomarkers by using multiple datasets in the discovery phase generation of robust biomarkers of drug response would constitute a major step toward the realization of precision_medicine
