nxtrim optimized trimming of illumina mate_pair reads motivation mate_pair protocols add to the utility of paired_end by boosting the gen_omic distance spanned by each pair of reads potentially allowing larger repeats to be bridged and resolved the illumina nextera_mate nmp protocol uses a circularization based strategy that leaves behind bp adapter sequences which must be computationally removed from the data while adapter trimming is a well studied area of bioinformatics existing_tools do not fully_exploit the particular properties of nmp data and discard more data than is necessary results we present nxtrim a tool that strives to discard as little sequence as possible from nmp reads nxtrim makes full use of the sequence on both sides of the adapter site to build virtual libraries of mate_pairs paired_end and single ended reads for bacterial data we show that aggregating these datasets allows a single nmp library to yield an assembly whose quality compares favourably to that obtained from regular paired_end availability_and the source_code is available at https github com sequencing nxtrima common design for dna sequencing_experiments is to sequence from both the and ends of the templates in a library to obtain paired_end for which the genomic_distance between the two halves of each pair is approximately known information which is useful for de_novo alignment and variant_calling mate_pair add further value by increasing the effective genomic_distance egd between the two reads the nextera_mate nmp protocol is typical a library of longer dna_molecules is circularized and then fragmented to a size suitable for sequencing the ends of each circle being joined by an adapter sequence tag that is biotinylated to allow enrichment for only those templates that span the join read_pairs from these templates have an egd that is determined by the length of the molecule that was circularised thus yielding longer range scaffolding information than can be deduced from a standard paired_end library before further processing the known adapter sequence must be removed in silico to leave only genomic_sequence behind adapter trimming is a generic task in bioinformatics for which a plethora of tools exist comprehensively surveyed by including some which are specialized to the particular needs of mate_pairs however to our knowledge all of them work by trimming the adapter and everything to the right of it i e the side retaining only the portion of the read that lies to the left of the adapter its side here we present a tool nxtrim which demonstrates that the ward portion of the read constitutes valuable real estate that can be retained to improve coverage and de_novo assembly_quality more specifically the sequence to the side of the adapter together with the other half of the read_pair can be reinterpreted as a standard paired_end depending on where the adapter lies in the read we reinterpret the whole read_pair as a single_read plus either a mate_pair or a paired_end choosing between the latter two options so as to maximize the number of bases that are paired nxtrim converts raw nmp reads into four virtual libraries bullet mp a set of known mate_pairs having an outward facing relative orientation and an egd whose distribution mirrors the size_distribution of the circularised dna bullet unknown a set of read_pairs for which the adapter could not be found within either read most likely the adapter will lie in the unsequenced portion of the template although we note supplementary some contamination with paired_end bullet pe a set of paired_end having an inward facing relative orientation and an egd whose distribution mirrors the size_distribution of the sequenced templates bullet se a set of single reads trimming tools following a only strategy would produce output similar to the mp and unknown libraries combined however the versatile velvet de_novo assembler can accept all four of these libraries as input to a single assembly and is able to treat the mp and unknown libraries differently in anticipation of a proportion of non mate paired_reads in the latter
