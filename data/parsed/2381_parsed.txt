structural_bioinformatics improvement of d protein models using multiple_templates guided by single_template model_quality motivation modelling the d structures of proteins can often be enhanced if more than one fold template is used during the modelling process however in many cases this may also result in poorer model quality for a given target or alignment_method there is a need for modelling protocols that can both consistently and significantly improve d models and provide an indication of when models might not benefit from the use of multiple target template alignments here we investigate the use of both global and local model quality prediction scores produced by modfoldclust to improve the selection of target template alignments for the construction of multiple template models additionally we evaluate clustering the resulting population of multi and single_template models for the improvement of our intfold ts tertiary_structure method results we find that using accurate local model quality_scores to guide alignment selection is the most consistent way to significantly improve models for each of the sequence to structure alignment_methods tested in addition using accurate global model quality for re ranking alignments prior to selection further improves the majority of multi template modelling_methods tested furthermore subsequent clustering of the resulting population of multiple template models significantly_improves the quality of selected models compared with the previous version of our tertiary_structure method intfold ts availability_and source_code can be freely downloaded from http www reading ac uk bioinf downloads sequence structure alignment_methods are the springboard of template based modelling tbm the d model output of singletemplate modeling_methods is based on the top_ranked best available single_template from the most similar protein of known structure single_template models_built for sequences with high_sequence between target to whom correspondence should be addressed and template are known to provide highly accurate_models sequence_identity the twilight zone models must be built using more intensive fold_recognition methods consensus based fold_recognition approaches such as lomets d jury dshotgun pcons and intfold ts improve the selection of single templates by the use of alternative_models from several independent servers or in house version of those methods run as metaservers the top_ranked consensus models however may not always be the best option due to suboptimal alignments it is important to consider optimal alignments both at the global overall protein_sequence and local_regions such as domains levels in addition the coverage of the targettemplate alignment must be considered when evaluating or selecting d models to guide experimental work after all the nearer native a protein model is the better information it can provide towards protein design for use in medicine agriculture biofuels and other fields of applications multiple template modelling_methods that mix and match recombine templates or thread alternative target template alignments b have been produced in an effort to improve the quality of predicted d models the advantage of using multiple template methods is mainly attributed either to the increased alignment coverage or the incorporation of the best single_template which is dependent on alignment_accuracy and template complementarity b additionally convergence is one problem identified in the use of multiple_templates which may arise from different alignments containing contradictory information the quality of a model can be improved by combining complementary good templates which is especially true for multi domain targets but model quality may deteriorate when there is one template that is closer to the target than all other available templates in general multiple template modelling can improve on single_template models when it can provide an increase in coverage of the target can give more useful information such as sequence and structure conservation and or conserved distance_restraints or can identify better alternative alignments for harder targets quality prediction as the remaining limiting_factors the top performing groups have attempted to address these limiting_factors in numerous ways various single_template and consensus methods incorporate model_quality mqa methods to rank alternative_models pconsm for example uses proq for model_quality of the top six models drawn from the top six template sequences of pcons net on the other hand raptorx peng and xu b uses tm_score zhang and skolnick as a quality measure of the sequence template alignment from which the quality of its d model can be estimated additionally multicom combines multiple_templates alternative alignments and similar models guided by global model_quality furthermore with i tasser known as zhang server in casp the multi template d models_include global confidence_scores which are a measure of their overall prediction_accuracy our own intfold ts method integrates modfoldclust into the core of its pipeline this mqa tool reranks all alternative_models generated by four in house versions of single_template methods based on their global quality_scores the accuracy of this method addressed the strong emphasis of casp on assessment of all atom models producing predicted per residue errors however while we were relatively successful at providing accurate local error estimates for our casp models we did not make any attempt at fixing the predicted errors prior to submission in an attempt to exploit our accurate per residue quality predictions we have now explored the multipletemplate modelling approach described here our approach is to use the modfoldclust local and global quality_assessment scores from the initial single_template models to inform target template alignment selection with the aim of consistently and significantly improving models through multiple template modeling the latest implementation of our template based modelling server intfold ts uses a further iteration of modfoldclust to rank the resulting pool of multiple template models our new intfold ts method shows a statistically significant_improvement over the singletemplate methods and consensus single_template methods tested three structural_alignment scoring methodsthe gdt ts global distance test total_score the tm_score template modelling score and the maxsub scoreprovide the performance_metrics for the benchmarking these scores generated by the tm_score method show how similar two protein_structures are to each other in this case the model and the experimentally_determined native_structure for clarity and brevity the results shown in this article are the benchmarking results against the casp full chain dataset however the full analyses for both the casp and casp full chain and domain datasets with and without fm domains are shown in the supplementary data furthermore in the supplementary data an analysis of the upper limits for multi template modelling based on perfect model_selection is shown in this case the tm_score between the model and native_structure is used to determine the global quality for each model the perfect local quality_scores are calculated as the distances between equivalent ca atoms based on the tm_score superposition between the model and native structures although all structural_alignment scores were used for benchmarking the main tables and figures shown here were based on the gdt ts score which has been used as an official casp measure since casp the fold_recognition methods that represent single_template modelling_methods are as follows sp sparks spk hhsearch coma qqq gggd gggf nnnd and sssc the consensus methods that cluster specific single_template methods and generate single_template models are represented here by lomets intfold ts and intfold ts the multi template methods applied to sets of alignments from individual methods are denoted by the subscript multi e g sp multi is the multi template modelling method applied to the sp alignments in this article we evaluate alternative_methods for the selection of target template alignments for multiple template modelling using the alignments generated by a number of alternative single_template modelling_methods we explore the use of modfoldclust local and global model_quality scores as a discriminatory measure to refine the selection of better target template alignmentsh o the method in the row produces models that are equal or lower in quality than those produced by the method in the column h the method in the row produces higher quality models than the method in the column p values indicate significant differences in boldface the wilcoxon signed rank_sum p values were calculated using gdt ts scores of casp full chain targets prior to multi template modelling although there is a basic nuance that using multiple_templates will translate into a better model this is shown not to be true in all cases and success is dependent on the target template selection method used comprehensive_analyses of our multiple template models showed that there are appropriate combinations of templates that will lead to improvement of a model quality over that of the single_template model when that combination is not found then multiple template modelling will not provide a better option over single_template modelling and may sometimes lead to a deterioration of model quality the aim of multiple template modelling should not be to simply mix and match segments of templates to achieve more coverage it should most importantly be to improve model quality from benchmarking the alternative alignment selection approaches on the casp and casp full chain and domain datasets we have found that the most consistent way to significantly improve models is to make use of accurate predicted local model quality_scores to guide alignment selection furthermore using accurate global quality prediction scores for re ranking the order of alignments prior to selection significantly_improves most of the multi template modelling_methods tested this corroborates the findings of the upper theoretical limits of these strategies are investigated through use of perfect model_quality scores supplementary tables and figures the results indicate that there is room for improvement and it is therefore worthwhile putting further effort into developing more accurate model assessment to guide multi template modeling overall sp proved to be a competitive single_template method when tested on the casp datasets and it provides a useful baseline single_template modelling method the increased performance of both intfold ts and intfold ts relative to sp points again to the usefulness of generating consensus single_template models using modfoldclust however these simple consensus methods only make use of the modfoldclust global scores and do not exploit the accurate per residue error predictions according to the casp assessors accurate per residue error predictions are crucial indicators of a models usefulness here we are now capitalizing on the accuracy of modfoldclust for predicting model quality at both the global and per residue_level using identified errors in single_template models to guide alignment selection for multi template modelling the multi and multi methods were observed to be the best performing methods and they consistently and significantly_improved model quality for all of the original sequence structure alignment_methods on all datasets and according to all model quality scoring metrics the multi works by simply rejecting any subsequent target template alignment after the top hit if the overlapping local_regions from the alignment are not predicted to improve the local model quality according to modfoldclust the multi method uses essentially the same approach but the targettemplate alignments for each method are firstly re ordered using the modfoldclust global scores
