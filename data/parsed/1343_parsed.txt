detecting critical state before phase_transition of complex_biological by hidden_markov motivation identifying the critical state or pre transition_state just before the occurrence of a phase_transition is a challenging_task because the state of the system may show little apparent change before this critical_transition during the gradual parameter variations such dynamics of phase_transition is generally composed of three stages i e before transition_state pre transition_state and after transition_state which can be considered as three different markov processes results by exploring the rich dynamical information provided by high_throughput data we present a novel computational_method i e hidden_markov hmm based_approach to detect the switching point of the two markov processes from the before transition_state a stationary markov_process to the pre transition_state a time varying markov_process thereby identifying the pre transition_state or early warning_signals of the phase_transition to validate the effectiveness we apply this method to detect the signals of the imminent phase_transitions of complex systems based on the simulated_datasets and further identify the pre transition_states as well as their critical modules for three real_datasets i e the acute_lung triggered by phosgene inhalation mcf human breast_cancer caused by heregulin and hcv induced dysplasia and hepatocellular_carcinoma both functional and pathway enrichment_analyses validate the computational results availability_and the source_code and some supporting files are available at https github com rabbitpei hmm_based method contacts there exist abrupt state changes in many biological_processes in particular during the progression of complex_diseases for instance in chronic_diseases such as cancer the malignant deterioration might take place merely within a few months while the illness might progress gradually and be protracted for years before the onset of such transitions in other words there exists a sudden catastrophic shift during the process of gradual health deterioration that results in a drastic transition from a normal state to a disease_state however it is a difficult_task to detect the critical state just before the phase_transition of the system from the observed data due to the lack of apparent state change before the generally disease_progression can be modeled into three states or stages i a normal state or the before transition_state with the high resilience and robustness to perturbations ii a pre disease_state or the pre transition_state with the low resilience and sensitive to perturbations which is the critical state just before the phase_transition and iii a disease_state or the after transition_state representing a seriously deteriorated stage possibly with high resilience and robustness it has been shown that even though there are no significant differences between the before transition_state and the pre transition_state in terms of static features e g average values of state_variables there are significant differences between them in terms of dynamic_features e g deviations and correlations of state_variables as described in specifically a dominant group or dynamical network biomarkers dnbs appears among the observed variables when the system state approaches the pre transition_state satisfying the following three conditions i e high correlations between the variables among this group low correlations between this group and other variables and high standard_deviations of the variables among this group these theoretical results indicate that the pre transition_state and the before transition_state are dynamically different but are statically similar thus the dynamics of these two states can be considered as two different markov processes which can be explored to detect the critical state or the pre transition_state from the observed data actually the whole phase_transition dynamics can be represented as three different markov processes i e one stationary markov_process for the before transition_state due to its relatively stable dynamics insensitive to parameter changes stationary feature one time varying markov_process for the pre transition_state due to its strong fluctuated dynamics sensitive to the parameter changes time varying feature and another stationary markov_process for the after transition_state due to their relatively stable dynamics insensitive to parameter changes stationary feature in this work by exploiting the different dynamical features between the before transition and pre transition_states we developed a novel computational_method based on hidden_markov hmm for identifying the pre transition_state before the critical_point is reached during the biological_process of complex_diseases specifically to identify the pre transition_state is then equivalent to detect the switching point from one stationary markov_process to one time varying markov_process utilizing the time course or stage course data we presented the computational_method and algorithm on estimating the inconsistence index of the switching or end_point of the stationary markov_process at each candidate sampling point our study indicates that such novel index which measures the inconsistence between observed samples and a stationary markov_process described by a trained hmm is a model free approach that can be theoretically applied to diseases or biological_systems with clear transition events to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method we applied the algorithm to a simulated regulatory_network and three real_datasets i e the microarray_dataset of acute_lung with carbonyl chloride inhalation_exposure gse the microarray_dataset of mcf human breast_cancer caused by heregulin hrg gse and the microarray_dataset of hcv induced dysplasia and hepatocellular_carcinoma hcc gse the pre transition_states were successfully identified for both numerical simulated dataset and real_datasets and the functional and pathway analyses also validated our theoretical detections on the early warning_signals of the imminent critical transitions for those diseases complex_diseases significantly damage the health of many people all over the world detecting the early warning_signal of the sudden deterioration provides an opportunity to interrupt and prevent the continuing costly cycle of managing these diseases and their complications although it is crucial to detect the pre transition_state so as to prevent the qualitative deterioration by taking appropriate intervention actions it is a challenging_task to reliably identify the pretransition state because the state of the system may show neither apparent change nor clear phenomenon before this critical_transition during the disease_progression this is also the reason why diagnosis based on traditional biomarkers may fail to indicate a pre transition_state in this work we presented a computational_method with an inconsistence index based on hmm to identify the imminent critical_transition which has been shown to be effective by real_datasets it is worth noting that this method aims to detect the early warning_signal generating from the pre transition_state or pre disease_state rather than to find the indication of the after transition_state or disease_state in which the qualitative deterioration has taken place as shown_inand in methods generally there are significant differences between the before transition_state and the after transition_state which is why we can find many molecular_biomarkers to accurately_diagnose the disease based on the differential expressions of those biomarkers but there may be no significant differences between the before transition_state and the pre transition_state in terms of expressions which requires the different types of biomarkers based on different signals dnb theory provides such conditions of the pre disease_state and we developed hmm_based method to quantitatively detect the signals of the pre disease_state based on those conditions we applied our method to the identification of the pre transition_state based on both the simulated dataset and the microarray_data from acute_lung experiment given that the lung_damage is not generally detectable until approximately h after exposure to phosgene gas we tested the hypothesis that the disease_progression can be modeled into three states i a before transition_state with high resilience and robustness to perturbations ii a pre transition_state defined as the prelude to catastrophic shift into the transition_state occurring just before the phase transition_point is reached therefore with low resilience and robustness to perturbation due to its dynamical structure iii an after transition_state representing the seriously deteriorated stage possibly with high resilience and robustness to perturbation then based on the microarray_data we indicated the existence of the pre transition stage right before the critical_transition induced by phosgene inhalation actually an indicative early warning_signal is presented at h after the expose to phosgene gas the validation based on simulated dataset and the microarray_data of acute_lung demonstrates the sensitivity and effectiveness of our method with the genomics or proteomics survey of the cd model rats we constructed bio molecular_networks to gauge the dynamical regulations among genes at different hours after exposure to phosgene besides we showed that some metabolic_pathways respond to the phosgene induced interruptions and become increasingly disordered therefore the hmm_based method provides a computational way of prying into the underlying mechanism of cell_differentiation and thus helping to achieve the timely intervention our dynamic network_analysis suggests in regard to lung_injury by focusing at the pre transition_state of the rat_model we are able to probe the in situ environment changes preceding the development of lung_tissue abnormalities this may not only lead to deep insights ofdetecting critical state by hmmexternal environment interactions but also identify the effective time window for novel therapeutic_strategies in phosgene triggered lung_injury there are limitations of this work first the validity of the identified pre transition_state and the accurate result need further supports from animal_experiments or clinical studies second the method is insensitive when the genes are not differentially_expressed although this work is merely a step_forward towards detecting the early warning_signals of a critical_transition during disease_progression and the algorithm is expected to be improved in both sensitive and accurate ways it opens a new way for identifying the earlywarning signals of a critical_transition during the progression of complex_diseases
