sequence_analysis improvements on bicriteria pairwise_sequence algorithms and applications motivation in this article we consider the bicriteria pairwise_sequence problem and propose extensions of dynamic_programming for several problem variants with a novel pruning technique that efficiently reduces the number of states to be processed moreover we present a method for the construction of phylo genetic trees based on this bicriteria framework two exemplary cases are discussed results numerical_results on a real_dataset show that this approach is very fast in practice the pruning technique saves up to in memory_usage and in cpu time based on this method phylo genetic trees are constructed from real_life data in addition of providing complementary information some of these trees match those obtained by the maximum_likelihood method availability_and source_code is freely availablerecently there has been a growing interest on the multi criteria formulation of optimization_problems that arise in computational_biology see an extensive review in however exact solution approaches for most of these new formulations have not been thoroughly investigated with the exception of the work offor bicriteria pairwise_sequence for an alignment of sequences a a a n and b b b n we denote by s the substitution score of alignment according to a substitution matrix m and by d and g the number of indels and gaps maximal consecutive run of indels of the two following score vector functions are considered vsd s d vsg s g two bicriteria problems that consist of finding the alignments that are maximal with respect to the score vector functions above are as follows where denotes the set of all feasible alignments the image of set in the score function space is called feasible score set to give a proper meaning to the operator vmax we introduce the following dominance relation between score vectors in problem vsdp given two alignments and vsd vsd dominates if and only if it holds that s s d d and vsd vsd an alignment is pareto_optimal if there exists no other alignment such that vsd vsd the set of all pareto_optimal alignments is called pareto_optimal alignment set the image of a pareto_optimal alignment in the score function space is a non dominated score and the set of all non dominated scores is called non dominated score set the dominance relation and the above notation also apply to problem vsgp with the necessary changes computing the pareto_optimal alignment set can be an intractable task consider the sequences a g n and b tgt n and the substitution matrix mi i and mi j i j then there exist n npareto optimal alignments that match g n in both sequences as there exists no other alignment with larger substitution score and lesser number of indels n indels the aforementioned example also applies to the number of gaps n gaps however the size of the non dominated score set is bounded by min n n where is the size of longest common subsequence of a and b interesting_properties of this formulation in relation to parametric sequence_alignment see are discussed in an optimal alignment for the parametric score function with positive parameters is a pareto_optimal alignment however there may exist pareto_optimal alignments that are not optimal for any parameter setting these alignments and corresponding scores are called supported and non supported respectively from a geometrical point_of supported scores are those that lie in the convex_hull boundary of the non dominated score set to whom correspondence should be addressed furthermore it is common to distinguish between extreme and non extreme supported scores a score is extreme supported if it is a vertex of the convex_hull boundary of the feasible score set otherwise it is a non extreme supported score although it is relatively easy to find all extreme supported scores it is more challenging to find all those that are non extreme finding the whole non dominated score set would allow identifying both extreme and non extreme supported non dominated scores as well as non supported nondominated scores therefore multicriteria sequence_alignment brings advantages to the practitioner as it allows to get rid of parameters and to explore a tractable set of alignments that are not reachable by any other methods however to the best of our knowledge few work has been done on multi criteria sequence_alignment in this article we propose extensions of dynamic_programming for several bicriteria problem variants with a pruning technique that is based on the comparison of lower_and as performed in branch and bound procedures moreover we describe an experimental analysis on a real_dataset and discuss the use of bicriteria pairwise_sequence in the context of phylogenetic_tree construction in this article a pruning technique is introduced to improve the performance of dynamic_programming for bicriteria pairwise_sequence which uses lower_and to discard states in early_stages of the process this technique can easily be extended for the case of affine gap by performing the necessary changes in the recurrence relation of matrices s and t see section they can also be extended for the three criteria case where the substitution score the number of indels and the number of gaps are simultaneously considered in the score vector function in addition this pruning technique can also be used in multi criteria multiple_sequence for instance in the context of progressive alignment with sum of pairs score function in the second part of this article we showed for the first time a successful link between non dominated score sets and phylogenetic_tree construction we present a simple method based on our bicriteria framework that allows to construct phylogenetic_trees as well as to give information about the reliability of the tree branches the advantage of this method is that no assumption about a priori_knowledge on users preferences is required therefore being less unbiased the two real_life test cases showed that few phylogenetic_trees can be obtained and are matched with those obtained with the ml method further research is needed to derive theoretical relation between ml estimations and the information provided by the non dominated score set for tree branch reliability
