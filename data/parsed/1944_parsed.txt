genome_analysis geca a fast tool for gene evolution and conservation analysis in eukaryotic protein_families geca is a fast user_friendly and freely_available tool for representing gene exon_intron organization and highlighting changes in gene structure among members of a gene_family it relies on protein alignment completed with the identification of common introns in the corresponding genes using ciwog geca produces a main graphical_representation showing the resulting aligned set of gene structures where exons are to scale the important and original feature of geca is that it combines these gene structures with a symbolic display highlighting sequence_similarity between subsequent genes it is worth noting that this combination of gene structure with the indications of similarities between related genes allows rapid identification of possible events of gain or loss of introns or points to erroneous structural annotations the output image is generated in a portable network graphics format which can be used for scientific_publications availability_and web implemented version and source_code are freely_available at https peroxibase toulouse inra fr geca input demo php and a detailed example can be found at https peroxibase the increasing pace of genome_sequencing is providing us with a growing number of sequences containing a wealth of information that will fuel studies for years to come one of the numerous resulting fields of investigation is the comparison of annotations and subsequent genic organizations in eukaryotic_genomes the amount of structurally annotated protein genes available has incited the development of web_tools such as gsds fancygene the purpose of these programs is to represent the exon_intron structure of several genes in a single image in order to perform global gene structure comparison however these resources display the gene structures independently rendering gene comparison difficult and leaving the individual gene structures lacking in information concerning sequence_conservation
