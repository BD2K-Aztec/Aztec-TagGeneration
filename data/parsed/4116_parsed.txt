structural_bioinformatics sapin a framework for the structural analysis of protein_interaction protein_interaction are widely used to depict the relationships between proteins these networks often lack the information on physical binary interactions and they do not inform whether there is incompatibility of structure between binding_partners here we introduce sapin a framework dedicated to the structural analysis of protein_interaction sapin first identifies the protein parts that could be involved in the interaction and provides template structures next sapin performs structural superimpositions to identify compatible and mutually_exclusive interactions finally the results are displayed using cytoscape_web availability the sapin server is available at http proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks are used to describe cellular_functions in normal and disease perturbed states however they often lack the information on physical binary interactions e g if non binary interaction methods such as co immunoprecipitation co ip or tandem_affinity tap tag were used reviewed in at the moment only statistical approximations such as the socio affinity index are used to decide which of the putative interactions detected in a co ip or tap tag experiments are direct further ppi_networks do not always inform whether several proteins binding to the same protein hub are compatible and or mutually_exclusive xor structurally integration of structural_information with ppi_networks can partially solve these limitations first information from d structures of protein domain complexes can be used to distinguish and from xor binding_sites adding and xor structural_information into protein_interaction is important to identify competing interactions where changes in concentration of one component could result in different pathways being active also it can help understanding different functional effects of mutations taking_place in the same protein but at different interaction surfaces limitations in the availability of structures of protein_complexes to decide whether interactions are of and or xor type can be partly circumvented by using structures of homologous_proteins as homologous pairs of binding_proteins tend to have a similar interaction topology in part the structural knowledge in the aforementioned structural interaction_network sin was increased by compiling the information of homologous_sequences as homologous pairs of binding_proteins tend to have a similar interaction topology second we propose that d information of homologous structures when combined with experimental information can be extremely_valuable for predicting physical binary interactions among proteins that were found together in a complex in a co immunoprecipitation experiment here we introduce sapin a framework dedicated to the structural analysis of protein_interaction it encompasses features allowing i a full analysis of the protein_sequence for the identification of the parts potentially involved in an interaction ii a mapping of the available structural data involving the previously_identified parts and iii the identification of compatible and mutually_exclusive interactions at the network level
