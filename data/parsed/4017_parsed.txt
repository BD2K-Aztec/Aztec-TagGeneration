ripper a framework for ms only metabolomics and proteomics label_free relative quantification ripper is a framework for mass_spectrometry based label_free relative quantification for proteomics and metabolomics_studies ripper combines a series of previously described algorithms for pre_processing analyte quantification retention time alignment and analyte grouping across runs it is also the first software framework to implement proximity based intensity normal ization ripper produces lists of analyte signals with their unnormalized and normalized intensities that can serve as input to statistical and directed mass_spectrometry ms methods for detecting quantitative differences between biological_samples using ms biological studies using liquid_chromatography lc and highresolution mass_spectrometry ms have the potential to aid the investigation of molecular_mechanisms by discovering biological_markers two important omics research_areas utilizing lc_ms are metabolomics and proteomics both face similar challenges in producing repeatable and reproducible data to address these challenges we recently_introduced proximitybased intensity normalization pin to implement pin we created a new quantitative framework ripper for label_free quantification lfq ripper has since become a valuable in house tool for new ms based quantitative method development because ripper does not rely on analyte identification before quantification users can process ms only data for proteomic ms based studies and generate an inclusion list for directed ms based identification by simply adjusting properties through a graphical_user users can also use ripper to extract analyte information for metabolomic_studies statistically analyze the results and conduct further fragmentation experiments on metabolites of interest here we describe ripper a java_based framework that takes in mzxml files extracts analyte features from ms spectral_data and reports validated analyte signal_intensities because it allows user specified options and is written in java ripper accommodates a wide_array of users on various platforms osx window and linux finally we compare ripper to other freely_available software namely maxquant xcms and mzmine maxquant couples lfq to identified peptides and proteins and is therefore not suitable to process ms only data furthermore maxquant cannot process metabolomic_data xcms is an online service for metabolomic_data and is not well suited for proteomic_data mzmine can process both proteomic and metabolomic dataand does not rely on identification prior to quantification we therefore chose mzmine as a benchmark for ripper we benchmarked ripper versus mzmine using high_resolution metabolomic_data and found that ripper identified six times as many analytes six times_faster see supplementary_materials ripper is the first framework implementing pin and enabling the proportionality paradigm for lc_ms compositional lfq workflows also ripper is extensible and therefore easily maintained and updated finally we have used ripper for numerous lc_ms omics experiments most notably differential proteomics directed ms and metabolomics tracer analysis with success in sum rippers introduction is an important step in advancing lfq workflows for investigating molecular_machinery and biomarker_discovery
