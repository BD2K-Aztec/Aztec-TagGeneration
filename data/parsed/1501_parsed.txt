dtminer identification of potential disease tar gets through biomedical_literature mining motivation biomedical_researchers often search through massive catalogues of literature to look for potential relationships between genes and diseases given the rapid_growth of biomedical_literature automatic relation extraction a crucial technology in biomedical_literature mining has_shown to support research of gene related_diseases existing work in this field has produced datasets that are limited both in scale and accuracy results in this study we propose a reliable and efficient framework that takes large biomedical_literature repositories as inputs identifies credible relationships between diseases and genes and presents possible genes related to a given disease and possible diseases related to a given gene the framework incorporates name entity recognition ner which identifies occurrences of genes and diseases in texts association detection whereby we extract and evaluate features from gene disease pairs and ranking algorithms that estimate how closely the pairs are related the f score of the ner phase is which is higher than existing_studies the association detection phase takes drastically less time than previous work while maintaining a comparable f score of the end_to result achieves a f score for the top genes associated with a disease which performs better than previous work in addition we released a web_service for public use of the dataset availability the implementation of the proposed algorithms is publicly_available at http gdr web rwebox com public html index php page download php the web_service is available atrecent scientific_discoveries have revealed the molecular cellular and genetic components of diseases researchers have gained many new insights into cellular_signaling genetic_alterations and their consequences combined with diagnostic breakthroughs there have been increasing efforts and successes in identifying patient segments defined by biomarkers that are more susceptible to certain diseases or will maximally benefit from certain treatments traditionally oncology was the disease area where the majority of such research was focused however in the last decades there have been considerable advancements in other disease areas such as respiratory_diseases infectious_diseases and inflammatory_diseases all of these new findings are contained in the vast amount of biomedical_literature the effective extraction of gene_disease from biomedical_literature will potentially enable the discovery and development of new therapeutic_targets and patient segment biomarkers however it has remained a daunting task because of the massive volume and the textual complexity of biomedical_literature given the strong demand for gene disease relation extraction from the biomedical_literature over the years ample studies have attempted to tackle it or part of it the task of gene disease relation extraction can be broken down into three phases the first is gene and disease recognition in free_text which can be categorized as a named_entity ner problem machine_learning based_methods are one of the approaches used to identify biomedical entities in free_text b settles proposed a conditional_random model abner to recognize biomedical named_entities based on orthographic and semantic features z used svm to recognize biomedical named_entities such as proteins and genes in biomedical_literature there are rule_based and pattern based_methods as well developed a rule_based method to recognize genes and proteins in biomedical_text singer and collins discussed the pattern based method for name entity recognition inthe number of associations extracted by our method is shown in the number of associations extracted by our method is significantly_larger than befree at the meantime the precision of our extraction is better than befree which is detailed in section in the named_entity phase the dictionary only method which is similar to the method befree and copub in the relation extraction phase we achieved an f score of using both the local lexical features and global syntactic features using the local lexical features or the global syntactic features alone gives a lower f score which indicates that both the local and the global features are effective and necessary while the f score of our method is nearly as good as that of befree our speed is more than times_faster it is because we utilized fewer but more representative features than befree so that we can achieve this advantage in speed while maintaining the f score furthermore our end_to results showed that our system extracted much more genes related to a given disease than befree and copub did this is due to the large_scale of our input and the good performance of our ner method and relationship extraction method in this paper we proposed a framework for the automatic extraction of gene disease relation from biomedical_literature for the gene and disease recognition we built large gene and disease libraries by combining and cross_referencing existing biomedical knowledge bases we enriched our dictionary by identifying new synonyms using search_engines for association detection we designated effective features and built an efficient svm classifier for the ranking we considered the weight of papers and the other contributions by the same authors and proposed three different algorithms for ranking in addition we launched a web_service for public access to our results overall our system created a diseasegene association dataset that is several times larger than any previously_reported dataset of similar nature achieved a good balance between accuracy and computation time and outperformed existing state of theart systems on similar tasks the system has been made available online for free public access which will potentially enable the discovery and development of new therapeutics and breakthrough in diagnostics
