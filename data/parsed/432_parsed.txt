genetics_and a power set based statistical selection procedure to locate susceptible rare_variants associated with complex_traits with sequencing_data abstract motivation existing association methods for rare_variants from sequencing_data have focused on aggregating variants in a gene or a genetic region because of the fact that analysing individual rare_variants is underpowered however these existing rare_variant detection methods are not able to identify which rare_variants in a gene or a genetic region of all variants are associated with the complex_diseases or traits once phenotypic associations of a gene or a genetic region are identified the natural next step in the association study with sequencing_data is to locate the susceptible rare_variants within the gene or the genetic region results in this article we propose a power set based statistical selection procedure that is able to identify the locations of the potentially susceptible rare_variants within a disease related gene or a genetic region the selection performance of the proposed selection procedure was evaluated through simulation_studies where we demonstrated the feasibility and superior power over several comparable existing_methods in particular the proposed method is able to handle the mixed effects when both risk and protective variants are present in a gene or a genetic region the proposed selection procedure was also applied to the sequence_data on the angptl gene_family from the dallas heart study to identify potentially susceptible rare_variants within the trait related genes availability_and an r package rvsel can be down loaded fromthe fundamental problem with rare_variants with minor_allele maf is their low_frequency i e the limited number of observed carriers lowers the statistical_power phenotypic association with any single rare_variant thus almost all existing statistical_methods to detect disease trait associated rare_variants follow the framework of aggregating and testing all rare_variants in a gene or a candidate genomic_region thereby boosting the association_signal the existing_methods try to improve this basic idea of aggregating signals in two aspects first by more potent extraction of signals from individual rare_variants and second by better aggregation signals extracted from multiple rare_variants in a gene or a genetic region of interest improvements of the first kind include upweighing variants as they become rarer along with flexibility of the threshold for a rare_variant and accommodation of both risk and protective variants in a genetic region of interest methods for more powerfully aggregating statistical signals include kernel_based adaptive clustering which assigns weights to multi rather than single site genotypes and the c test_statistic which contrasts the observed versus expected variance of binomially distributed allele counts and regression_based models that extract and aggregate signals however these existing rare_variant detection methods are not able to identify which rare_variants in a gene or a genetic region out of all variants are associated with the complex_diseases or traits once phenotypic associations of a gene or a genetic region are identified the natural next step in the association study with sequencing_data is to locate the susceptible rare_variants within the gene or the genetic region there have been a few testing procedures based on the subset selection of rare_variants such as the variable thresholding vt and rarecover rcover methods however vt is not designed to select potentially causal_variants within a gene or a genetic region rcover collapses multiple rare_variants within a gene or a genetic region using the combined multivariate and collapsing test cmc proposed by liu and leal it has low power to identify causal_variants when both risk and protective variants are present within a gene or a genetic region moreover rcover applies the pearsons statistic in the testing procedure which may not be optimal for rare_variants and is limited to case control designs only recently bayesian hierarchical_models have been proposed to estimate the effects of rare_variants under a regression_framework where bayesian credible regions for regression_coefficients were provided to assess the to whom correspondence should be addressed association of each individual rare_variant however credible regions for variants with low frequencies are too wide indicating the uncertainty for estimation in addition estimation results in bayesian_analysis often rely on settings of unknown hyper parameters and intensive computing is required all the time considered the problem of locating susceptible variants as a statistical variable_selection problem and attempted to select both common and rare_variants associated with a disease outcome using a penalized regression_model where regression_coefficients were regularised to select variants with relatively high impacts on the outcome in penalised regression_models the total number of non zero coefficients is tuned by a regularization_parameter so the choice of an optimal regularization_parameter is a crucial part of the l norm regularization procedure however did not try to select an optimal regularization_parameter as common methods such as cross_validation and resampling might not be applicable to rare_variants because of extreme sparsity alternatively the authors ranked the potentially disease related variants with their impact on the outcome thus the method is essentially unable to separate potentially causal_variants from non causal_variants within a gene or a genetic region in this article we propose a statistical selection procedure based on the linear_combinations of the power set of a set of rare_variants in a gene or a genetic region that is able to identify the locations of the potentially susceptible rare_variants within a disease related gene or genetic region a stage i association test first identifies the phenotypic association of a gene or a genetic region using existing_methods that aggregate multiple rare_variants the proposed method then selects the subset out of the power set of all the rare_variants that has the highest impact on the outcome either quantitative or qualitative the selection performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation_studies where different effect_sizes sample_sizes and proportions of risk_variants protective variants and non causal_variants were considered we also applied the proposed method to the sequence_data of the angptl gene_family from the dallas heart study dhs several studies have worked on the dhs data and have already identified some genes that are related to the traits for example associations between the angptl gene and both triglyceride and very_low in european american_population have been suggested by several studies however most of the existing rare_variant tests have not tried to locate potentially susceptible rare_variants within the angptl gene our proposed selection procedure was able to select several potentially causal rare_variants within the angptl gene that are associated with triglyceride and very_low in this article we proposed a power set based selection procedure to identify the locations of susceptible rare_variants associated with complex_diseases with sequencing_data the proposed selection procedure not only aggregates multiple rare_variants to boost association_signals but also locates potentially causal and noncausal variants within a disease related gene or a genetic region using the idea of the power set of all rare_variants in a gene or a genetic region the most outcome related subset of rare_variants among the power set is identified our simulation_studies suggested that the proposed power set based selection procedures apset and wpset are able to locate potentially causal_variants relatively accurately when both risk and protective variants are present in a gene or a genetic region in the analysis of the dhs sequencing_data the best subset of variants selected by the proposed method are promising and could be potential trait related variants for future validation selecting susceptible rare_variants is statistically challenging because of sparsity to improve the selection performance of the proposed power set based selection procedure there are three potential extensions first we used the data adaptive procedure to screen potentially protective variants however the procedure may not perform well when sample_size and effect_size are small as the procedure is based on a marginal association test we noticed in the simulation_studies that asps for both risk and protective variants could be improved by a maximum of data not shown if we knew which variants are protective therefore it is essential to develop an improved procedure to identify potentially protective variants second we used allele_frequency weights for wpset and observed a similar performance of wpset and apset in quantitative analysis one possible explanation is that this weight is designed for binary case control outcomes another possible explanation is that the weight is assigned on the individual variant level while the selection is on the feature level thus the variant level weights may not influence much on selecting the most outcome related feature the development of optimal weights for each feature rather than each variant may improve the selection performance of the proposed method third we combined variants within a subset using a weighted linear combination a recent_publication byhas suggested that an exponential combination might be more powerful than a linear combination to detect rare_variant associations when the number of causal_variants within a gene or a genetic region is small in addition to the improvement in the detection_power the exponential combination procedure combines both risk and protective variants without the need of initial screening of protective variants as it is not affected by the directions of variants however the numerical_values of the exponential combinations depend on the number of variants when the test_statistics of individual variants are exponentially combined i e the more the variants that are combined the larger statistic it has thus the proposed power set idea cannot be directly applied to the exponential combinations some modification of the exponential combination may be preceded to extend the proposed power set method to improve in these three areas are our future work our proposed selection procedure can be easily applied to different types of phenotypic outcomes we limited an outcome to be either quantitative or binary in this article however because our procedure is based on an association with regression residuals it is readily extended to other types of outcomes by simply applying the generalized regression_model
