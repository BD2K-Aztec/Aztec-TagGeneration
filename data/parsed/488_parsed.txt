databases_and arts automated randomization of multiple_traits for study_design collecting data from large studies on high_throughput platforms such as microarray or next_generation typically requires processing samples in batches there are often systematic but unpredictable biases from batch to batch so proper randomiza tion of biologically_relevant traits across batches is crucial for distinguishing true_biological differences from experimental artifacts when a large number of traits are biologically_relevant as is common for clinical studies of patients with varying sex age genotype and medical background proper randomization can be extremely_difficult to prepare by hand especially because traits may affect biological inferences such as differential_expression in a combinatorial manner here we present arts automated randomization of multiple_traits for study_design which aids researchers in study_design by automatically optimizing batch assignment for any number of samples any number of traits and any batch size data collected on high_throughput biological platforms such as microarray and next_generation ngs can often be processed in parallel in batches greatly lowering the cost and time for collection however details in the personnel protocol or instrument setting calibration often vary slightly from batchto batch when large studies with hundreds_or of samples are conducted these variations may result in statistically_significant but biologically irrelevant anomalies between batches confounding efforts to determine true_biological differences between sample conditions such batch_effects can be mitigated by proper randomization of samples across batches sample traits such as diseased or control should be evenly_distributed across batches a number of methods exist that attempt to remove batch_effects after data are already collected however these approaches should be considered a last resort to salvage data collected after poorly randomized studies as they must make assertions about the type of bias introduced by batches for example using linear_models to quantify distortions also these methods cannot correct for batch_effect in completely unrandomized studies for instance if all diseased samples are put into the same batch when one or two traits are pertinent for a large study randomization can be done manually with moderate effort however patients in large clinical studies often have many relevant traits such as sex age genotype medical background and multiple_measures of disease_state in such cases proper randomization cannot reasonably be prepared by hand and will be confounded by the likely combinatorial interaction between traits e g the combined effect of age_and may be different than the sum of age_and effects independently here we present the arts automated randomization of multiple_traits for study_design tool for automated study randomization arts uses a genetic_algorithm to optimize an objective_function based on a rigorous statistic from information_theory the mutual_information we validate arts using several objective_functions to illustrate the versatility of the one chosen and by showing that the genetic_algorithm we use for optimization obtains a good balance between computational speed and optimization quality
