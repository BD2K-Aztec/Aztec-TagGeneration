genetics_and famlbl detecting rare haplotype disease association based on common_snps using case parent triads motivation in recent_years there has been an increasing interest in using common single_nucleotide snps amassed in genome_wide to investigate rare haplotype effects on complex_diseases evidence has suggested that rare haplotypes may tag rare causal single_nucleotide making snp based rare haplotype analysis not only cost_effective but also more valuable for detecting causal_variants although a number of methods for detecting rare haplotype association have been proposed in recent_years they are population_based and thus susceptible to population_stratification results we propose family triad based logistic bayesian_lasso famlbl for estimating effects of haplotypes on complex_diseases using snp data by choosing appropriate prior_distribution effect_sizes of unassociated haplotypes can be shrunk toward zero allowing for more precise estimation of associated haplotypes especially those that are rare thereby achieving greater detection_power we evaluate famlbl using simulation to gauge its type_i and power compared with its population counterpart lbl highlights famlbls robustness property in the presence of population_substructure further investigation by comparing famlbl with family_based test fbat reveals its advantage for detecting rare haplotype association availability_and famlbl is implemented as an rgenome wide association studies gwas have identified common_variants that are associated with common diseases with genome_wide significance however gwas failed to explain a majority of the heritability and hence it is hypothesized that rare single_nucleotide rsnvs which cannot be detected by gwas platforms are responsible for at least part of the missing_heritability with the next_generation ngs_technology it becomes possible to investigate the role of rsnvs however the extremely_low frequencies and high_dimensionality render the tests developed for gwas powerless when applied to rare_variants numerous methods aiming at detecting rsnvs for casecontrol_studies have been developed in recent_years one class of tests burden tests focus on aggregating rare_variants and then using the collapsed super variant for the test tests of this category include the combined multivariate and collapsing method and the weighted_sum method collapsing multiple_variants into a single_variant can indeed effectively reduce the dimension of the data and increase the frequency of the super variant however power can be diminished when the rare_variants being collapsed are of opposite effects on the trait of interest other tests like c alpha sequence_kernel skat and a hierarchical modeling_approach are more powerful if there exist different directionality and variability in the coefficients of the regression parameters most of the methods proposed thus far can only detect regions of interests to identify the combination of causal_variants responsible for the disease it is advantageous to investigate haplotypes within each region while association between common_haplotypes and diseases is well studied in gwas those methods typically fail to detect individual effects of rare haplotypes traditionally rare haplotypes are either ignored combined into a super variant or grouped with common_haplotypes of similar sequence_variation such a practice is clearly deficient as causal rare haplotypes can result from common single_nucleotide snps further rare haplotypes that are disease associated may tag rsnvs that are causal and can even lead to greater_power for detecting association supplementary tables s and s and to remedy this situation so that rare haplotypes can be investigated proposed a lasso regularization of logistic regression_model for case control data that effectively combat the problem of non convergence of the em_algorithm due to estimation instability although methods are available for selecting optimal penalty parameters for lasso type regularization methods they are typically computationally_intensive moreover uncertainty resulted from setting the tuning parameters is hard to be investigated and be accounted for to avoid the need for specifying tuning parameters proposed a bayesian_model in which laplace distribution is used as prior_distribution for effect_size effectively shrinking the coefficient toward zero this approach also allows for testing individual haplotype effects and constructing confidence_intervals for effect_sizes further in their model a retrospective likelihood is used which is more appropriate than a prospective formulation for case control data given the data_collection process to whom correspondence should be addressed it has been argued recently that linkage peaks detected by family based_methods can potentially be caused by rare_variants and that using family data can avoid heterogeneity and be more fruitful for detecting such rare_variant further family based design should provide an increase in power compared with population_based designs for rare_variants as such variants are enriched in a family if it does exist most importantly family based design will not be affected by population_stratification whereas case control design may see an increase in type_i if left unadjusted the stage is therefore set for detecting associated rare and common_haplotypes using family data commonly used family based_methods for detecting common_haplotypes such as fbat may suffer from loss of power if used for detection of rare haplotypes because the estimated variance of rare haplotype effects could be large recent extension of fbat does provide a way to analyze rsnvs by collapsing and optionally weighting each variant but the method is not amenable to haplotypes in this article we propose a family based method aiming to detect both rare and common_haplotype associations using common snp data on case parent trios our retrospective likelihood correctly reflects the ascertainment procedure and its factorization resembles a match pair design as we will see in section to shrink the coefficients of unassociated haplotypes so that the effects of rare associated haplotypes can be more precisely estimated to increase the statistical_power of detection we adopted the logistic bayesian_lasso lbl methodology for parameter_estimation and statistical_inference leading to the famlbl algorithm the proposed famlbl method is thoroughly investigated to gauge its power and type_i we also compare famlbl with lbl and fbat in terms of robustness to population_stratification and effectiveness in detecting rare haplotype association finally we apply famlbl to the framingham_heart fhs data to illustrate its utility we carried_out extensive simulation to thoroughly evaluate the performance of famlbl and compared it with lbl and fbat a total of three sets of simulation are considered to evaluate power type_i sensitivity to population_substructure and comparisons with lbl and fbat we describe the three simulation_settings data generation_process and results in the following in the last subsection we present an application of famlbl to the fhs data
