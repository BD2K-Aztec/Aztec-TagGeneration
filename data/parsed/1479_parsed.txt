dr seq a quality_control and analysis_pipeline for droplet sequencing motivation drop seq has recently_emerged as a powerful technology to analyze gene_expression from thousands of individual cells simultaneously currently drop seq technology requires refinement and quality_control qc steps are critical for such data analysis there is a strong need for a convenient and comprehensive approach to obtain dedicated qc and to determine the relationships between cells for ultra high_dimensional results we developed dr seq a qc and analysis_pipeline for drop seq data by applying this pipeline dr seq provides four groups of qc measurements for given drop seq data including reads level bulk cell level individual cell level and cell clustering level qc we assessed dr seq on simulated and published drop seq data both assessments exhibit reliable results overall dr seq is a comprehensive qc and analysis_pipeline designed for drop seq data that is easily extended to other droplet based data types in recent_years the advances of rna_seq technology have allowed single_cell scrna_seq to emerge as a powerful and popular technique to study the cell to cell expression variability of thousands genes however the time and cost constraints of preparing libraries from many individual cells have prevented scrna_seq for more broad applications recently drop seq and indrop two new easy fast and low_cost technologies to quickly profile thousands of individual cells for rna_seq have been developed as both technologies are based on the combination of dropletbased microfluid and individual cell barcode approaches and their data_structures are largely similar we termed both technologies as drop seq in this study drop seq only requires h to prepare single_cell libraries for sequencing the breakthrough of this technology provides many applications such as the deconstruction of a cell_population the detection of rare cell_types and the inference of interactions between genes however drop seq technology still suffers from some restrictions currently the mrna capture rate conversion_efficiency and sequencing_depth are not sufficient to cover thousands of genes from a large fraction of cells leading to increased levels of noise which can influence the interpretation of drop seq data therefore quality_control qc should be the first step in the analysis_pipeline to assure the data_quality and to provide a solid basis for subsequent analysis although there are already some qc algorithms for bulk rna_seq and scrna_seq data a qc pipeline specifically for drop seq data is still necessary given the low capture efficiency high_dimensionality and sequenced cell number here we presentdr seq an integrated drop seq qc and analysis_pipeline dr seq can systematically evaluate drop seq data_quality together with the visualization of unsupervised cell clustering the dr seq qc and analysis_pipeline uses two paired sequencing files fastq or sam format as input one file contains transcript information and the other contains cell barcode and umi information the transcript sequencing file was aligned to the reference_genome and the mapped_reads with high sequencing quality were kept dr seq provides four groups of qc measurements supplementary methods i reads level qc including quality nucleotide_composition and gc_content of the reads ii bulk cell level qc including gene body coverage and reads alignment summary supplementary iii individual cell level qc including the distributions of reads duplicate rate intron reads rate and covered gene number in selected stamps for the evaluation of mrna capture efficiency at individual cell level supplementary iv cell clustering level qc including gap statistics and silhouette score for the evaluation of the sample_heterogeneity supplementary figs s a and s b in addition to a qc report document describing the above qc measurements dr seq also generated a series of analysis results including i expression index ii paired wise correlation table iii pca and t sne dimensional reduction output iv cluster assignment for selected stamps and v visualization of t sne and clustering output supplementary supplementary methods to evaluate the performance of our pipeline we simulated drop seq data from cell_types by sampling reads from bulk cell rna_seq in human cell_lines supplementary to assess the performance of cell clustering on the tolerance of low sequencing_depth and small cell number in certain cell_types we simulated drop seq data with different sequencing_depths per cell and different numbers of individual cells in certain cell_types respectively supplementary methods in supplementary_file to estimate the stability of cell clustering goodman kruskals lambda index was conducted to compare the clustering_results with predefined cell_type labels dr seq showed reliable cell clustering_results with or more reads per cell and or more individual cells per cell_type supplementary we applied dr seq on published drop seq data in mouse retinal cells and obtained a multifaceted and detailed qc reports supplementary_file together with a series of analysis results the running time of each qc and analysis step of dr seq was also displayed supplementary in summary dr seq is specifically_designed for qc and analysis of drop seq data it takes standard format input_files via simple commands reports informative qc measurements from four levels and provides detailed analysis results it also displays tolerance of low sequencing_depth and small cell number in certain cell_types besides dr seq has the potential to be easily extended to other droplet based data types such as drop chip dr seq
