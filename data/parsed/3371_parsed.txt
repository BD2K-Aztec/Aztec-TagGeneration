optimization method for obtaining nearest_neighbour dna entropies and enthalpies directly from melting_temperatures motivation free_energy nearest_neighbour nn thermodynamics is widely used in dna biochemistry ranging from the calculation of melting_temperatures to the prediction of secondary_structures methods to calculate nn parameters require the knowledge of total sequence entropies and enthalpies which are not always available results here we implement and test a new melting_temperature optimization method where we obtain the nn parameters directly from the temperatures in this way we bypass the constraints imposed by total sequence entropies and enthalpies this enabled us to calculate the missing nn entropies and enthalpies for some published datasets including salt_dependent parameters also this allowed us to combine sequences from different types of melting_temperature data for which we derived a new set of nn parameters which have a smaller uncertainty and an improved predictive_power availability_and c source_code and compiled binaries for several linux distributions are available from https sites google com site geraldweberufmg vargibbs and from opensuse build service at https build opensuse org package show home drgweber vargibbs the software_package contains scripts and data_files to reproduce all results presented here contact the concept of dividing a dna or rna_sequence into pieces of nearest_neighbour nn pairs for predicting melting_temperatures t m was pioneered years_ago byintroduced much of the concepts and terminologies that are in use today a more detailed analysis of the nn representation was given by and later by its simplicity of use and effectiveness has made it into a nearly universal method for applications in oligonucleotide chemistry and molecular_biology with this technique predictions of thermodynamic_properties for any unknown sequence can be made by summing over nn entropies and enthalpies dp nn with p h s the method which is currently in use for extracting dp nn is essentially based on writing a set of linear equations where each equation represents the total entropy or the total enthalpy variations dp i tot of a given sequence i for the remainder of this article we call this the total entropy and enthalpy variation teev method therefore it is necessary to first obtain the total dp i tot this can be done either by curve_fitting the melting_curve or from a linear_regression of t m versus log c t in which case one needs a number of measurements at different species concentrations c t unfortunately both curve_fitting or t m log c t methods introduce a certain amount of uncertainty into the resulting parameters dp nn furthermore the total dp i tot may for various reasons not be available at all here we propose a new melting_temperature optimization mto method which does not require the total parameters dp i tot instead we simply fit the dp nn which best describe the meltingthis direct approach has two advantages over the teev method one is that we fit the much more accurate melting_temperatures t m the other is that this method can be applied to situations where the total parameters dp i tot are unavailable for example one can work out the nn parameters from the melting_temperatures which were measured only for a single species concentration for each dna_sequence summarizes the differences between the methods another interesting feature of the model is that the initialization parameters can be obtained in the framework of the mto numerically the mto minimizes the difference between measured and predicted melting_temperatures by varying the dp nn parameters freely here we applied the mto method successfully to the dataset by santalucia and showed that the resulting predictive uncertainty is significantly_reduced we used a similar method for the non linear peyrard bishop model the good results obtained for the non linear_model were one of our main motivations to investigate the applications of the mto method to the linear nn model one key aspect of obtaining the free_energy parameters dp nn is the experimental set of melting_temperatures unsurprisingly different sets are bound to result in different parameters here we analysed the two sets by however as total sequence entropies and enthalpies are not required we could also analyse the datasets by d ow we discuss the significant differences resulting from those datasets especially regarding initiation parameters finally we combined the datasets dsl and d ow into a new set for which we obtain the best overall melting_temperature prediction we presented a new method for the calculation of nn parameters from experimental melting_temperatures because this method sidesteps the calculation of total entropies and enthalpies it enables us to calculate the nn parameters under conditions which cannot be handled by the traditional_methods it also allows us to combine datasets obtained under very dissimilar experimental_conditions the results of temperature predictions show a marked improvement especially when larger datasets are used to calculate the parameters the software that implements this method is made freely_available a comprehensive user_manual is part of the package and included as supplementary_material therefore the interested reader is provided with ability to calculate the thermodynamic_parameters for any desired dataset also the availability of the source_code allows for modifications for particular variants of the nn model for instance to include nucleation terms
