prody protein dynamics inferred from theory and experiments we developed a python_package prody for structure based analysis of protein dynamics prody allows for quantitative characterization of structural_variations in heterogeneous datasets of structures experimentally resolved for a given biomolecular system and for comparison of these variations with the theoretically predicted equilibrium dynamics datasets include structural ensembles for a given family or subfamily of proteins their mutants and sequence homologues in the presence absence of their substrates ligands or inhibitors numerous helper functions enable comparative_analysis of experimental and theoretical data and visualization of the principal changes in conformations that are accessible in different functional_states prody application_programming api has been designed so that users can easily extend the software and implement new methods protein dynamics plays_a in a wide_range of molecular_events in the cell including substrate ligand recognition binding allosteric signaling and transport for a number of well studied proteins the protein_data pdb hosts multiple highresolution structures typical examples are drug_targets resolved in the presence of different inhibitors these ensembles of structures convey_information on the structural changes that are physically accessible to the protein and the delineation of these structural_variations provides insights into structural mechanisms of biological_activity existing computational_tools and servers for characterizing protein dynamics are suitable for single structures e g anisotropic network model anm server elnmo flexserv pairs of structures e g open and closed forms of enzymes molmovdb or nucleic magnetic_resonance nmr models e g pca nest tools for systematic retrieval and analyses of ensembles of structures are not publicly_accessible ensembles include x_ray structures for a given protein and its complexes families and subfamilies of proteins that belong to particular structural folds or a protein and its mutants resolved in the presence of different inhibitors ligands or substrates theseveral web_servers have been developed for characterizing protein dynamics including elnmo anm and flexserv these servers perform coarse_grained enmbased nma calculations and as such are useful for elucidating structure encoded dynamics of proteins flexserv also offers the option to use distance_dependent force_constants in addition to protocols for coarsegrained generation and pca of trajectories prody differs from these as it allows for systematic retrieval and comparative_analysis of ensembles of heterogeneous structural datasets such datasets includes structural data collected for members of a protein_family in complex with different substrates inhibitors prody further allows for the quantitative_comparison of the results from experimental_datasets with theoretically predicted conformational_dynamics in addition prody offers the following advantages i it is extensible interoperable and suitable for use as a toolkit for developing new software ii it provides scripts for automated tasks and batch analyses of large_datasets iii it has a flexible api suitable for testing new methods and hypotheses and benchmarking them against existing_methods with minimal effort and without the need to modify the source_code iv it allows for producing publication quality figures when used with python plotting library matplotlib and v it provides the option to input user_defined distance_dependent force function or utilize elaborate classes that return force_constants based on the type and properties of interacting residues e g based on their secondary_structure or sequence separation prody is a free versatile easy to use and powerful_tool for inferring protein dynamics from both experiments i e pca of ensembles of structures and theory i e gnm anm and eda of md snapshots prody complements existing_tools by allowing the systematic retrieval and analysis of heterogeneous experimental_datasets leveraging on the wealth of structural data deposited in the pdb to gain insights into structure encoded dynamics in addition prody allows for comparison of the results from experimental_datasets with theoretically predicted conformational_dynamics finally through a flexible python based api prody can be used to quickly test and implement new methods and ideas thus lowering the technical barriers to apply such methods in more complex computational_analyses funding national_institutes r gm to i b and ul rr to a b
