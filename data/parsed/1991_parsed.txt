systems_biology genes related to differentiation are correlated with the gene_regulatory structure motivation many secondary messengers receptors and transcription_factors are related to cell_differentiation their role in cell_differentiation can be affected by their position in the gene_regulatory here we test whether the properties of the gene_regulatory can highlight which genes and proteins are associated with cell_differentiation we use a previously_developed purely theoretical algorithm built to detect nodes that can induce a state change in boolean gene_regulatory and show that most genes predicted to participate in differentiation in the theoretical_framework are also experimentally known to be associated with such differentiation these results show that genes related to differentiation are associated with specific features of the genetic regulatory_network the proposed algorithm produces a better classification than simple network measures such as the nodes degree or centrality boolean_networks were used in many previous theoretical_models here we show a direct_application of such networks to the detection of genes and subnetworks related to differentiation the subnetwork emerging from the genes and edges that are predicted to be associated with differentiation are the most active molecular_pathways experimentally described to be involved in cell_differentiation availability_and during differentiation stem_cells are converted to become new types of cells the converted cells can become similar to the cells that triggered the differentiation which is often the case with differentiation of adult_stem or they may become a different cell_type this can happen in transdifferentiation or during differentiation of tissue stem_cells from a nearby non neighboring cell_population for example the cells in the mesenchyme may send differentiation_signals to the stem_cells of the epithelium some genes and their products are classically related to cell_differentiation in the literature as they play_a in at least one case where one cell_type is converted to another these genes include e g the members of signaling_pathways related to cell_differentiation such as the epidermal_growth egf signaling_pathway the transforming_growth signaling_pathway and the nerve_growth signaling_pathway these genes and their products share different biophysical and functional properties some are growth_factors acting as extracellular signals others are the corresponding ligand receptors other signaling proteins transmit the differentiation signal to the nucleus there transcription_factors and other proteins_regulate chromatin_structure and gene_expression to model differentiation we use boolean_networks which have been shown to produce multiple features of regulatory gene_networks furthermore boolean_networks can approximate well the continuous expression_profiles of genes we developed a theoretical algorithm to detect using a random boolean gene_regulatory which genes and their products can participate in computer simulated differentiationlike events here we show that genes related to this in silico differentiation are associated with differentiation as documented in the literature multiple supervised machine_learning have been proposed to classify genes into categories using gene_expression or properties of the protein_interaction here we propose a novel approach to define genes related to differentiation based on first principles and not on blind machine_learning the function of genes and proteins is typically studied using their sequence structure expression pattern and biochemical_interactions however the function of genes may actually be induced by or at least correlated with the position of its protein in the genetic regulatory and proteinprotein_interactions network here we show that first principles on the expected dynamics of networks can help detecting genes correlated with differentiation to whom correspondence should be addressed we created boolean_networks consistent with the hn by choosing randomly for each gene a boolean function consistent with the activators and repressors it has according to thenetwork for each network we checked whether a conversion between two random cycles could occur the conversion is a model of differentiation like events in random boolean_networks we investigated these simulated differentiation like events using a set of signaling nodes simply stated a conversion in this context is the transfer of a boolean_network from one attractor to another following signaling from neighboring_cells to determine which genes nodes in the network are the most critical for the conversion a multistep_process was performed first genes that behave_similarly in the two cycles were eliminated see section then we chose within these genes those that could induce a cycle conversion among those we removed the genes residing in loops that do not affect the conversion as explained in section we computed how often each gene belongs to the resulting set of converting genes in these simulations the result of this process is a list of genes ordered by the fraction of simulations where each gene is predicted to participate in signaling that induces cell conversion this list is referred to as the gsl if our assumption that conversion is related to the network_structure and if our algorithm is correct we expect the result of this purely theoretical argument to be correlated with the experimental_observations of differentiations to show that this is the case we analyzed the order of the genes in the gsl among the genes at the top of the gsl are il r interleukin_receptor mitogen_activated extracellular_signal mek extracellular_signal erk epidermal_growth egfr and nuclear_factor kappa_light enhancer of activated b cells nf_kb these genes play_key known important differentiation_processes il r is a type i cytokine_receptor that by binding to interleukin promotes the differentiation of t cells to th cells mek and erk are involved in several differentiation_processes including neuronal_differentiation the egfr is a cell_surface for members of the epidermal_growth family it is involved in many differentiation_processes nf_kb is a protein complex that controls the transcription of dna nfkb is known not only for activating b cells but also for osteogenic_differentiation the top of the gsl is found in the full gsl is given in supplementary section s the top ranking genes are not the only ones related to differentiation actually a clear correlation between the order of genes in the list and the definitions of genes related to differentiation based on their go classification can be found throughout the list we compared the order of genes obtained from the algorithm with genes associated with differentiation using the go annotation see section using four statistical_tests according to the go based gene classification of the studied genes are associated with cellular_differentiation however when scoring the genes according to the fraction of time they participate in differentiation in the theoretical_model which will be denoted the sorted list hitherto of the top of the list are related to differentiation p the results are not sensitive to the cutoff and a cutoff led to p and p respectively similarly throughout the entire list genes associated with differentiation have higher scores p for the mannwhitney test and p for the gene rank test and the p values of these tests can be affected by correlation between neighboring genes in the network we thus used an extra test the enrichment test which avoids such biases we computed for each conversion the fraction of nodes with go annotations related to differentiation out of the nodes in the sufficient rsccsnote the full list is given in supplementary section s we have used multiple methods to determine_whether a gene is related to differentiation the second column represents genes with published_literature describing them as linked to differentiation see column for typical reference the third column represents genes with a go annotation related to differentiation and the fourth column represents genes related to differentiation using the categorizer automatic go hierarchy analyzer http www animalgenome org tools catego and compared it to the fraction of such nodes in the network we observed a enrichment in differentiation go annotations in cycles with nodes inducing differentiation in the model p e the relation between a specific pathway and differentiation can be the result of the specific interactions in these pathways and detailed molecular aspects of the component of this pathway or this relation may be the result of the position of the pathway in a larger network although the two explanations are not contradictory the first one has been classically highlighted here we have used a novel approach to test the second hypothesis we asked whether the properties of the gene_regulatory affect the genes and their products that are associated with cell_differentiation we have shown that our methodology that was developed as a theoretical_model of random boolean_networks can provide an educated guideline for the detection of genes experimentally_observed to participate in cell_differentiation events in humans although the algorithm was never trained on gene classification from experimental_data using non parametric statistics rank test we have demonstrated that the correlation between the genes that participated in the conversions of the simulations using our algorithms to those actually known to date to be involved in cellular_differentiation in human cells is statistically_significant we further validated that these results are not exclusively affected by the existing correlation between the participation of genes in conversions and their degree by using rewired networks as a control we have shown that the effect of degree is limited this confirms that the seemingly theoretical_approach actually uncovers features in the gene_regulatory that are inherent to stem_cell we have also tested for a possibility that our results are simply induced by the centrality which is highly_correlated with both the degree and our score but again the centrality is much less correlated with the go classification than our score we did find however that the signs of the edges are almost meaningless implying that the observed sign of the regulation is too partial to lead to useful conclusions at least in the current context the absence of a sign effect may be the result of a more inherent structure of the network a basic concept in boolean_networks introduced by kauffman is the core of the network the networks core is the set of nodes found fixed on the same boolean values in all of the networks cycles kauffman studied the emergence of the core and supplied sufficient mathematical theory for its formation however there is no good way to estimate a priori the dynamics of nodes not found in the core in the conversions studied here the nodes change their character between the two cycles and hence are not supposed to be a part of the core however we did find nodes in the sufficient rsccs that according to kauffman were supposed to be a part of the core moreover in the sufficient rsccs we found nodes not fixed in both of the cycles although the conversions are not dependent on the initial steps of the cycles thus the structural_element shaping the dynamics of cycles in boolean_networks may extend well beyond the standard definition of the core one aspect of this modeling may explain why sign scrambling the edges does not drastically affect the sufficient rsccs this may happen as changing the signs may compensate and preserve a similar core and perhaps even similar sufficient rsccs a detailed analysis of the structures beyond the network core will be given in a future work the algorithm not only detects genes but also detects the edges between them interaction between genes tightly_linked to differentiation we built a subgraph from the genes and edges that frequently participated in conversions the only long pathway detected was found to be one of the most active pathways in differentiation_processes of the adult human affecting the differentiation of cells in the hematopoietic system this long pathway is composed mainly of mid degree genes showing again that the degree is not at all the main element driving the participation in conversions to the best of our knowledge this work is the first to predict genes that are related to differentiation based only on a gene_regulatory the presented methodology can be largest cc of the emerged subgraph the sufficient rsccs contain not only genes but the edges between them as well each edge has a score reflecting the number of times it participated in the sufficient rsccs the emerged subgraph contains only genes and edges that participated frequently in conversions only one large cc connect component was found in supplementary section s the genes of the largest cc are presented with a short description applied to create a novel bioinformatics tool for gene classification and can also assist experimental biologists that wish to induce differentiation to cells in vitro and in vivo an important result from our previous theoretical work is that conversions are mostly reversible unlike the process of ipscs induced_pluripotent where fully differentiated_cells become pluripotent by the ectopic expression of key_transcription we suggested that differentiated_cells can be used as precursor_cells to the tissue stem_cells from which they originated by overexpressing relevant_genes products the presented methodology can be applied to assist experimental biologists that wish to attempt such a process boolean_networks were initially_developed to study theoretical concepts such as the number of possible attractors in a random_network or their properties here we have shown that these networks can have direct practical_application for the classification of genes this is the first time that such applications are presented for a concept that was considered purely theoretical we have shown that by pure mathematical_analysis of well curated gene_networks we can predict the genes that are associated with differentiation the algorithms that we have developed will become more and more useful as the gene_networks will grow and expand in the future
