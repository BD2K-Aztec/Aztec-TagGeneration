mptheory java_library a multi_platform java_library for systems_biology based on the metabolic p theory mptheory java_library is an open_source project collecting a set of objects and algorithms for modeling observed dynamics by means of the metabolic p mp theory that is a mathematical theory introduced in for modeling biological dynamics by means of the library it is possible to model biological_systems both at continuous and at discrete time moreover the library comprises a set of regression algorithms for inferring mp models starting from time series of observations to enhance the modeling experience beside a pure java usage the library can be directly used within the most popular computing environments such as matlab gnu octave mathematica and r availability_and the library is open_source and licensed under the gnu lesser general_public lgpl version source_code binaries and complete documentation are available at http mptheory systems_biology has been brought to the forefront of life_science research at the core of systems_biology lies the development of models describing biological_systems the definition of such models is often a laborious task which involves the use of numerical statistical and mathematical_analysis the java_library herein presented implements a metabolic p mp solution to this task by combining an initial intuition based on rewriting rules with linear algebra methods and statistical regression the presented software extends the modeling functionalities provided by metaplab an open_source standalone java_application based on mp theory that has been firstly released in http mplab sci univr it with respect to metaplab the library provides the implementation of new regression algorithms and supports new types of mp models e g based on differential_equations both ordinary_differential odes and delay differential_equations ddes the mp theory is a mathematical theory introduced in for modeling biological dynamics the letter p comes from pa uns p systems a particular type of computational_model inspired to the functioning of biological cells mp models inherit from p systems a native similitude with the functioning of a living_cell this closeness permits to define models that are comprehensible for both mathematicians and biologists and consistent with the intrinsic structure of the phenomena under examination the mp theory has been initially defined for modeling metabolic systems however it has then been extended along different directions and now it constitutes a framework for modeling any kind of dynamics v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comwe presented a new open_source java_library for modeling biological dynamics by means of the mp theory the software is distributed with a javadoc documentation and a pages user guide that introduces different modeling scenarios and discusses a comprehensive set of examples the library can be directly used within the most popular computing environments such as matlab gnu octave mathematica and r
