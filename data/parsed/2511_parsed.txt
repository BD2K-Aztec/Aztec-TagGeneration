genetics_and integrating summarizing and visualizing gwas hits and human diversity with dance disease ancestry networks motivation the genomes_project kgp and thousands of genome_wide gwas performed during the last years have generated an enormous amount of information that needs to be integrated to better understand the genetic_architecture of complex_diseases in different populations this integration is important in areas such as genetics epidemiology anthropology as well as admixture_mapping design and gwas replications network based_approaches that explore the genetic_bases of human_diseases and traits have not yet incorporated information on genetic_diversity among human populations results we propose disease ancestry networks dance a graph_based web_tool that allows to integrate and visualize information on human complex phenotypes and their gwas hits as well as their risk allele_frequencies in different populations dance provides an interactive way to explore the human snpdisease network and its projection a diseasedisease network with these func tionalities dance fills a gap in our ability to handle and understand the knowledge generated by gwas and kgp we provide a number of case studies that show how dance can be used to explore the relationships between human complex_diseases their genetic_bases and variability in different human populations availability_and dance is freely_available ldgh com br dance we recommend using dance with mozilla firefox safari chrome or internet explorer v or v information on human diversity and complex human phenotypes are currently organized in independent databases the genomes_project kgp database contains information on the spectrum of genetic_variants in different human populations the nhgri ebi gwas catalog contains information on the genetic_architecture of complex_diseases despite the importance of this information there are no tools to summarize integrate and visualize it which is critical for a wide_spectrum of areas such as genetics epidemiology anthropology to design admixture_mapping or gwas replications and to test the genetic_architecture of diseases in different populations relationships between human phenotypes and their causing genetic_variants have been modeled using network based_approaches v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com which provide a comprehensive and integrated view of phenotypes interrelations despite the fact that differences in allele_frequencies can account for unequal phenotype prevalences among populations current network approaches do not integrate this information here we present disease ancestry networks dance a graph_based web_tool that allows to organize and visualize information on human complex phenotypes and their gwas hits together with their allele_frequencies in african european and asian_populations
