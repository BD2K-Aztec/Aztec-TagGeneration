databases_and timetree species divergence times on the iphone scientists educators and the general public often need to know times of divergence between species but they rarely can locate that information because it is buried in the scientific_literature usually in a format that is inaccessible to text search_engines we have developed a public knowledgebase that enables data_driven access to the collection of peer_reviewed in molecular_evolution and phylogenetics that have reported estimates of time of divergence between species users can query the timetree resource by providing two names of organisms common or scientific that can correspond to species or groups of species the current timetree web_resource timetree contains timetrees reported from molecular_clock analyses in published_studies and species that span the diversity of life timetree interprets complex and hierarchical data from these studies for each user query which can be launched using an iphone application in addition to the website published time estimates are now readily_accessible to the scientific_community k and college educators and the general public without requiring knowledge of evolutionary nomenclature availability timetree is accessible from the url
