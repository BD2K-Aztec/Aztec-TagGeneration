structural_bioinformatics performance of protein_structure predictions with the physics based unres force_field in casp downloaded from participating as the cornell gdansk group we have used our physics based coarse_grained united residue unres force_field to predict protein_structure in the th community_wide experiment on the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp our methodology involved extensive multiplexed replica exchange simulations of the target_proteins with a recently improved unres force_field to provide better reproductions of the local structures of polypeptide_chains all simulations were started from fully extended polypeptide_chains and no external_information was included in the simulation process except for weak restraints on secondary_structure to enable us to finish each prediction within the allowed week time window because of simplified unres representation of polypeptide_chains use of enhanced sampling methods code optimization and parallelization and sufficient computational_resources we were able to treat for the first time all human prediction targets with sizes from to amino_acid the average size being residues complete structures of six single_domain were predicted accurately with the highest_accuracy being attained for the t for which the carmsd was a for residues of the experimental structure correct structures were also predicted for domains of multi_domain with accuracy comparable to that of the best template_based methods with further improvements of the unres force_field that are now underway our physics based coarse_grained approach to protein_structure will eventually reach global prediction capacity and consequently reliability in simulating protein_structure and dynamics that are important in biochemical_processes availability_and freely_available on the web attemplate based and other knowledge based_methods are currently used routinely for the modeling of unknown protein_structures however despite tremendous advancement in the field the quality of the resulting structures depends strongly on the similarity of the target protein_sequences to those in the protein_data pdb if even a small section of the sequence has weak similarity to those of pdb proteins the uncertainty of the prediction increases dramatically therefore advantage is taken of our coarse_grained procedure united residue unres which performs successfully with comparable accuracy as that of homology_modeling the latter performs better than unres only when there is a good template in the pdb however when no such templates exist homology_modeling is not superior to unres for that reason for the proteins for which there are no good templates in the databases the de_novo methods not using knowledge based information are superior to the template_based tbm methods in the physics based_approaches the prediction candidates are selected from the basin s with the lowest free_energy and consequently such methods involve large_scale molecular_dynamics md_simulations which enable us to perform extensive walks in the conformational_space e g replica exchange monte_carlo replica_exchange remd or the multiplexed remd mremd application such simulations are very expensive to perform with all atom representations even for small proteins and even with the use of the most powerful supercomputers available because of too large discrepancy between the md time step fs and the time scale of protein_folding microseconds for the fastest folders to seconds use of dedicated supercomputers such as anton helps to overcome some of the limitations but the access to such machines is restricted and the size or the effective time scale of the simulation is limited to amino_acid and microseconds respectively owing to the elimination of the fast moving degrees_of using the coarsegrained approaches enables us to extend both the time scale by about orders_of and the size scale of simulations thus the main advantage of coarse_grained models with properly designed knowledge_based such as cabs and primo or physics based potentials such as martini and unres that can locate native like structures not necessarily with perfect experimental quality resolution in free monte_carlo or md_simulations is the ability to simulate the dynamics of the relatively large systems in reasonable time scale however the development of coarse_grained force_fields is much more difficult than that of all atom force_fields because the effective energy function originates from the potential of mean force of the system in which the insignificant degrees_of have been integrated out and additional terms like multibody potentials are necessary to compensate for the missing effects in our laboratory we have been developing the unres force_field which uses a coarse_grained representation of polypeptide_chains our physicsbased approach to protein_structure that uses the unres force_field performed reasonably well in biannual casp community_wide experiment on the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure exercises to obtain fold topology e g for targets t t and t in casp t in casp t and t in casp t t t and t in casp t t and t in casp and t t t and t in casp however because the unres predictions are generally of medium resolution quality which is remarkably_lower than those for tbm targets unres was featured only for new fold targets proteins with unique orientation of the local structure and for targets with new types of domain packing in the casp experiment two unres based_predictions made only by the cornell gdansk group and by one other group with additional participants were featured by the assessors the first one was a two domain target t treated by the cornell gdansk group and the second one was t treated by the wfcpunk group within the wefold initiative in the second prediction exercise unres was supplemented with contact_prediction restraints in the casp experiment we proved that the unres force_field is a very good tool to predict the orientation of the domains for the fold symmetry target t that was further confirmed by post casp tests with use of restraints within the domains but not between them in the past casp experiments we were not able to predict all of the human prediction targets within the week time window from the target announcement to the submission deadline because of limited manpower and computer resources casp was the first exercise in which the cornell gdansk group was able to perform simulations for every human prediction target using our physicsbased approach treating all human prediction targets varying in size from for target t to amino_acid for target t with the average size being residues these targets represented all structural_classes we used the newest version of the unres force_field supplemented with energy_terms corresponding to the coupling between backbone local and sidechainlocal conformational_states knowledge based_methods in particular the template based_methods and methods with mixed approaches for the prediction ofprotein structure are at present more successful than the physicsbased approaches however as demonstrated by the recent casp exercises new proteins whose structures cannot be predicted with these approaches continue to emerge moreover the physics based_methods are the only ones with which to study protein dynamics and large_scale conformational changes which are crucial in the functioning of the machinery of life and further to study the mechanisms of diseases and to help design effective therapies in this regard assessment of the capability of the physics based_methods to predict protein_structures enables us to assess their applicability in the simulations of biochemical_processes the cornell gdansk group was the only group in the casp experiment that used only molecular_dynamics simulations without any knowledge based information except for weak secondarystructure restraints which were necessary in order to accomplish the predictions within the strict week time window and which carried_out all human prediction targets and achieved satisfactory_results moreover the applied prediction procedure was also physics based because mean structures from the conformational_ensembles with the lowest free_energy rather than the lowest energy conformations were selected as candidate predictions with our physicsbased approach we achieved good predictions of complete structures of six medium_sized single_domain and the structures of complete protein_domains and the general fold of the large multi_domain the best prediction in terms of rmsd was achieved for the tbm target t the c a rmsd from the experimental structure being a over the residues however the optimum character of the unres force_field can be seen from the prediction of the small fm target t which is an example of the situation in which due to the lack of good homologous_proteins in the database the structure_prediction with the tbm methods is not as good as that with the superior unres force_field unres force_field managed to achieve comparable results to the most of the tbm methods also for other fm targets and domains such as t d t d t d t d t d and t d it is also remarkable that in casp there is only a small differencebetween the ranking of our model s and our best models indicating that the unres force_field supplemented with the recently_introduced terms corresponding to the coupling of the backboneand side chain local_interactions enables us to select the most native like predictions out of the five models more accurately than the previous version of the force_field used in casp the better overall performance of our approach in casp compared with previous casp exercises was achieved because of recent addition of the new potentials coupling the backbone local and sidechain local conformational_states this improvement enables us to predict more folds and rank the models better nevertheless the results show that even though unres predicts a large number of folds correctly and the accuracy of a few targets is comparable with the best tbm methods especially for the tbm targets the predicted structures have higher rmsds from the experimental_structures compared with those predicted by tbm methods to improve the capacity of unres to predict new folds and to improve the accuracy of predictions at present we are working on the calibration of the force_field which is aimed at the refinement of the energy term weights of the parameters of the expressions for the energy_terms in equation for this purpose we have recently_developed a new method for force_field calibration which is based on the maximum_likelihood approach a very early variant of the unres force_field optimized with the use of this approach was already used in casp for a very limited number of targets the performance of this variant of unres will be described in a separate paper a k sieradzan et_al unpublished_data full optimization of unres is now being carried_out with the maximum_likelihood approach and the first results demonstrate that it improves the capability of finding the folds and to rank the models and the accuracy of the predicted structures because the simulations could not be run to achieve full convergence for the largest targets during casp work is also being carried_out in our laboratory to optimize and improve the parallel efficiency of the unres code for use with the optimized force_field it can be anticipated that these improvements will constitute yet another important step toward accurate prediction of protein_structure without the use of any database information and consequently simulations of important biochemical_processes with a great degree of reliability
