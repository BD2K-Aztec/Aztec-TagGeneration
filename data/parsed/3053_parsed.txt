data_and modelling based experiment retrieval a case study with gene_expression clustering motivation public and private repositories of experimental_data are growing to sizes that require dedicated methods for finding relevant data to improve on the state of the art of keyword searches from annotations methods for content based retrieval have been proposed in the context of gene_expression experiments most methods retrieve gene_expression requiring each experiment to be expressed as a single profile typically of case versus control a more general recently suggested alternative is to retrieve experiments whose models are good for modelling the query dataset however for very noisy and high_dimensional query data this retrieval criterion turns out to be very noisy as well results we propose doing retrieval using a denoised model of the query dataset instead of the original noisy dataset itself to this end we introduce a general probabilistic_framework where each experiment is modelled separately and the retrieval is done by finding related models for retrieval of gene_expression experiments we use a probabilistic_model called product partition model which induces a clustering of genes that show similar expression_patterns across a number of samples the suggested metric for retrieval using clusterings is the normalized information distance empirical results finally suggest that inference for the full probabilistic_model can be approximated with good performance using computationally faster heuristic clustering_approaches e g k means the method is highly scalable and straightforward to apply to construct a general_purpose gene_expression experiment retrieval method availability_and the method can be implemented using standard clustering_algorithms and normalized information distance available in many statistical software_packages as the use of high_throughput molecular measurement technologies continues to spread an ever increasing amount of data from biological_experiments is being stored in publicly_available repositories it is then often of interest for researchers to retrieve experimental_datasets with relevance to a given experiment in order to increase the power of statistical_analyses and to be able to make novel findings not obtainable from one experiment alone the current standard practice relies on however despite efforts to maintain compliance with standard formats of documenting experiments e g the miame standard information about experiments may often be missing insufficient or suffer from variations in terminology e g in view of the challenges associated with keyword based retrieval the complementary task of querying a database of experiments using measurement data instead of keywords has recently received increased attention in the literature most earlier content driven methods used for retrieval of gene_expression data represent each experiment in terms of a profile over genes or alternatively over known gene_sets or gene_modules predicted from other data_sources see and references therein a representative example is to compute differential expression_profiles of case versus control use the correlation between activity profiles as the measure of relevance and retrieve the experiments with the highest correlations e g this requires auxiliary information about the experiments namely case and control labels of experiment samples and possibly additional a priori defined sets of important genes in the context of gene_expression time series representative examples of retrieving gene_expression include recently two feasibility studies have gone beyond reducing experiments into single profiles by using probabilistic modelling of the experiments in the database being queried assumed that the query dataset can be explained as a mixture of the learnt models each model learnt from one dataset such that the measure of relevance is given by the inferred mixture weights in a slightly different approach experiments were retrieved by evaluating the posterior marginal likelihoods given the query data of individual models stored for the experiments in the database in this paper we introduce a method for retrieving full datasets i e experiments consisting of multiple samples which is also based on probabilistic modelling however instead of using the query dataset itself as a query we use a model learnt from it the measure of relevance is therefore not a likelihood but instead a suitably defined metric between the models the argument is that for noisy and complex datasets it is beneficial to extract relevant characteristics of the query dataset in the same way as was done with the datasets that are being queried we also make explicit the importance of marginalizing out nuisance parameters which are not directly relevant for the retrieval task for example in a gene_expression study one is often more interested in how sets of genes are co regulated rather than their exact expression values which are additionally affected by numerous other influences we tackle the specific problem of retrieving gene_expression experiments by using a product partition model to cluster together genes that show similar expression_patterns across a number of samples by integrating out expression levels of the gene_sets i e cluster specific information only the co expression_patterns revealed by the clustering structure are retained the clustering induced by the query dataset is then finally compared with the clusterings associated with the experiments in the database using the normalized information distance notice that this approach does not involve any training stage compared to that of and the retrieval step does not involve solving an optimization_problem compared towhile gene clustering has a long history in characterizing gene_expression it appears not to have been used in the context of experiment retrieval before the use of gene clustering provides a straightforward way of characterizing each experiment with minimal preprocessing of the data while capturing central co expression_patterns essentially all previous_approaches for retrieving gene_expression data have converted the data to differential_expression or gene_set enrichments requiring fixed and known casecontrol distinctions in contrast we have only applied standard quality_control and rma normalization steps carried_out in house at the european_bioinformatics ebi for datasets in the expression atlas database see our experimental evaluation further suggests that for the current application inference of the full probabilistic_model can be approximated by some computationally faster heuristic clustering_algorithm such as k means see supplement section a of the online material the computational simplicity makes the method highly scalable and easy to apply in a black_box manner as a general_purpose retrieval scheme in this paper we have introduced a general probabilistic_framework for content driven retrieval of experimental_datasets compared to earlier works which also employ probabilistic modelling e g we do not use the likelihood of the query data as a measure of relevance but instead learn a model of the query data and compare models we argue that this reduces noise in the query input with nuisance parameters further marginalized out only characteristics relevant for the retrieval task are retained a special instance of the general framework introduced in this paper has been previously used as a comparative method in a simulation_study with performance slightly inferior to a likelihood based_approach the simulation setting in that earlier study was however very simplistic compared to datasets encountered in many real_life scenarios such as that of section where the model distance based_approach was now seen to clearly outperform its likelihood_based counterpart contrary to likelihood based_approaches the model distancebased approach_requires all models under consideration to belong to the same family although this may seem somewhat restrictive in particular for the potential future scenario in which individual researchers independently store models in a repository along with their datasets e g there are also scenarios where the assumption is feasible datasets which arise as a result of some specific type of experiment are often in practice modelled using a fairly standardized set of approaches in particular if the models are constructed automatically or by a curator of a data repository the assumption of the models belonging to the same family is feasible as a specific application of the general framework in sections and we proposed a retrieval scheme for gene_expression experiments based on gene clustering it turned out with our current data that clustering was even a surprisingly good model for this purpose with minimal preprocessing and prior_knowledge about the experiments it was able to yield reasonable retrieval_performance section and to capture biologically_relevant characteristics about the experiments section finally we showed that it is straightforward to combine model distance based or any modelling based retrieval with retrieval using available keywords section evaluation of model distance based retrieval scheme with
