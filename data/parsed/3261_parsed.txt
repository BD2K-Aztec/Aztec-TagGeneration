genetics_and ngstools methods for population_genetics analyses from next_generation data next_generation produce short_reads that are either de_novo assembled or mapped to a reference_genome genotypes and or single_nucleotide are then determined from the read composition at each site which become the basis for many downstream_analyses however for low sequencing_depths e g there is considerable statistical uncertainty in the assignment of genotypes because of random_sampling of homologous base_pairs in heterozygotes and sequencing or alignment errors recently several probabilistic methods have been proposed to account for this uncertainty and make accurate inferences from low quality and or coverage sequencing_data we present ngstools a collection of programs to perform population_genetics analyses from next_generation data the methods implemented in these programs do not rely on single_nucleotide or genotype_calling and are particularly suitable for low sequencing_depth data next_generation ngs_technologies have revolutionized population_genetics research by enabling unparalleled data_collection from genomes or subsets of genomes from many individuals current_technologies produce short fragments of sequenced dna called reads that are either de_novo assembled or mapped to a pre_existing reference_genome this leads to chromosomal positions being sequenced a variable number of times across the genome usually referred to as the sequencing_depth individual genotypes are then inferred from the proportion of nucleotide_bases covering each site after the reads have been aligned low sequencing_depth along with high_error stemming from base_calling and mapping errors causes single_nucleotide and genotype_calling from ngs_data to be associated with considerable statistical uncertainty recently probabilistic_models that take these errors into account have been proposed to accurately assign genotypes and estimate allele_frequencies e g we present ngstools a collection of programs for population_genetics analyses that use methods which account for the statistical uncertainty of ngs_data the implemented methods are specially tailored for low depth sequencing_datasets with multiple_individuals and populations and can incorporate deviations from hardyweinberg equilibrium the inputs for these programs are the files generated by angsd a software for reading and handling ngs_data popgen dk angsd although sequencing_costs are decreasing ngs of large samples is still expensive causing many researchers to focus on low depth samples this is particularly true for nonhuman nonmodel organisms for which research funding typically does not provide for deep_sequencing of many individuals analyses of data from such species are particularly challenging because imputationbased methods used in human genomics are not available and because they may suffer from high levels of inbreeding this beckons for new and efficient computational_methods that directly address the problem of genotyping uncertainty on ngs_data the methods provided by ngstools are designed with this problem in mind ngstools provides tools to accurately estimate genetic_variation in case of low_coverage data the individual methods have been previously_tested providing extensive documentation of their statistical and computational properties we here report on the availability of an integrated open_source computer package facilitating access to the methods for the broader research_community ngstools is available on a public repository for shared development so that additional methods can be developed under this framework and integrated into the software_package
