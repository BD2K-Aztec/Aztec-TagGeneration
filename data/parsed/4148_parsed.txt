gene_expression scotty a web_tool for designing rna_seq experiments to measure differential_gene motivation a common question arises at the beginning of every experiment where rna_seq is used to detect differential_gene between two conditions how many reads should we sequence results scotty is an interactive web_based application that assists biologists to design an experiment with an appropriate sample_size and read_depth to satisfy the user_defined experimental objectives an experiments power to detect differences in expression is based on its ability to distinguish true_biological differences between conditions from the variability that occurs in repeated_measurements of the same condition in an rna_seq experiment this variability stems from three sources biological variance technical measurement imprecision and poisson variance stemming from the inherent nature of counting experiments supplementary section s these sources of variability lead to uncertainty about the genes true average expression in each condition limiting the resolution of the differences that can be detected as statistically_significant the uncertainty that is caused by biological and non poisson technical variance can be countered by increasing the number of biological_replicates of each condition biological_replicates are used because their measurements are subject to both in contrast poisson uncertainty is reduced to the same degree if a fixed number of reads is used to either add more replicates or sequence the existing replicates more deeply supplementary section s given a fixed number of reads the most power will be achieved if these reads are used to sequence the highest number of biological_replicates possible however biological_material and library_construction increase costs each time an additional replicate is added further measuring a large fraction of the genes with low read_counts can produce a dataset that is biased against identifying_differentially with low read_counts because these genes will be measured with higher noise we devised a simple web_based scotty which allows users to optimize the replicate number and read_depth to maximize the statistical_power achieved while excluding configurations that require too many replicates are too expensive do not have sufficient power or result in datasets where large subsets of genes are measured with a high measurement bias scotty is similar in function to existing programs that are available for microarray_experiments but is specifically adapted to rna_seq maximum power for each expression_level as the percentage that would be expected to be detected if there were no poisson noise as read_counts increase power asymptotically approaches this maximum power under the default_settings the power difference metric is the percentage of measurements that are measured with of maximum power to test how well scottys results can be generalized to other methods we used simulation_experiments to compare the power of a t test with the power of the deseq a statistical package whose approach shares information between genes to provide a better estimate of variance when it is poorly measured owing to low replicate number we found that while deseq has substantially_higher power to detect differentially_expressed when there are two replicates present the power of the two methods was similar when there were three or more replicates supplementary section s while general guidance exists for biologists on designing rna_seq experiments scotty is to our knowledge the first interactive tool aiding rna_seq experimental_design as the accuracy of scottys projections is determined by the degree of similarity between the pilot and the main experiment pilot_data should be collected under conditions closely_resembling the experimental_conditions
