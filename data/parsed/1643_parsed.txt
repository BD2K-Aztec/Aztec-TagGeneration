eug ne maize a web_site for maize gene prediction motivation a large part of the maize b genome_sequence is now available and emerging sequencing_technologies will offer cheap and easy ways to sequence areas of interest from many other maize genotypes one of the steps_required to turn these sequences into valuable information is gene content prediction to date there is no publicly_available gene predictor specifically trained for maize sequences to this end we have chosen to train the eugne software that can combine several sources of evidence into a consolidated gene model_prediction the b maize genome_sequence is now available we can anticipate that next_generation will soon supply a deluge of genomic_data from other maize genotypes therefore in addition to the annotation provided by the maize sequence consortium for the b genotype the community will also need a tool for the annotation of maize genomic_sequences produced from other genotypes to date the www maizesequence org web_site provides the filtered gene_set including annotation of gene models refgen v based on biological evidence however no tool is provided to annotate personal sequences yet fgenesh was among the first ab_initio gene prediction softwares available for maize while it was trained for monocot species combiner softwares like eugne can improve their own ab_initio prediction results by integrating information from sequence_alignment software from splice_site and translation_start prediction software or from other gene finder algorithms thereby improving prediction quality eugne uses probabilistic markov_models to discriminate coding_sequences from non coding ones or genuine splice_sites from false ones gene models generated by eugne are associated with a score based on all the available information in order to calculate the weight for each information_source and to calibrate its ab_initio prediction module eugne was trained using a maize curated gene sequence set built in this study to whom correspondence should be addressed
