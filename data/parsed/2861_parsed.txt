sequence_analysis meme lab motif analysis in clusters genome_wide can result in large_numbers of clusters of co expressed genes although there are tools for ab_initio discovery of transcription_factor most do not provide a quick and easy way to study large_numbers of clusters to address this we introduce a web_tool called meme lab the tool wraps meme an ab_initio motif finder providing an interface for users to input multiple gene_clusters retrieve promoter_sequences run motif_finding and then easily browse and condense the results facilitating better interpretation of the results from large_scale datasets availability meme lab is freely_accessible at http wsbc warwick ac uk wsbctoolswebpage analyzing microarray_expression using cluster_analysis is a common and frequently performed task in functional_genomics typically a large number of clusters are produced each containing a large_number e g clusters of genes each cluster is predicted to contain a set of genes that are co expressed and as such would be expected to share_common regulatory_features such as transcription_factor tfbss there are established methods and tools for predicting known tfbss such as athena o but ab_initio motif_discovery remains an important aspect to consider several tools exist to perform this task and meme in particular is a well recognized suite for motif_discovery but the meme web suite offers limited usage on large_numbers of clusters and subsequent navigation and post_processing of the results machanick and bailey provide a web_tool meme chip that is specifically tailored towards chip_seq providing a useful expansion in memes functionality here we describe a web_tool called meme lab meme launcher and browser which wraps the meme tool in ways that are ideally_suited to the task of ab_initio motif_finding in co expressed gene_clusters i users can input multiple gene_clusters at once ii promoter_sequences are automatically retrieved from a local database or from a user specified file iii meme is run on all clusters simultaneously and the results are presented in a condensed and navigable format iv identified motifs are compared for similarity with known tfbs motifs
