identifying cell specific microrna transcriptional_start motivation identification of microrna mirna transcriptional_start tsss is crucial to understand the transcriptional_regulation of mirna as mirna_expression is highly cell specific an automatic and systematic method that could identify mirna_tsss accurately and cell specifically is in urgent requirement results a workflow to identify the tsss of mirnas was built by integrating the data of h_k and dnase_i as well as combining the conservation level and sequence feature by applying the workflow to the data for cell_lines from the encode_project we successfully identified tsss for intragenic mirnas and intergenic mirnas which cover of all mirnas recorded in mirbase for these cell_lines we found alternative tsss for intragenic mirnas and alternative tsss for intergenic mirnas our method achieved a better performance than the previous non cell specific methods on mirna_tsss the cell specific method developed by georgakilas et_al gives tsss of higher accuracy in two cell_lines benefitting from the employment of deep_sequencing technique in contrast our method provided a much higher number of mirna_tsss for a broader range of cell_lines without the limitation of costly deep sequencing_data thus being more applicable for various experimental cases analysis showed that upstream promoters at kb to bp of tss are more conserved for independently transcribed mirnas while for mirnas transcribed with host_genes their core promoters bp to bp of tss are significantly conserved availability_and predicted mirna_tsss and promoters can be downloaded from supplementary files micrornas mirnas are small nt non_coding that negatively_regulates gene_expression by binding to the untranslated_region of mrnas studies so_far have revealed that mirnas are involved in almost all the key_biological such as development differentiation apoptosis cell_proliferation and carcinogenesis to understand the underlying mechanism of the mirna mediated regulatory_pathways it is important to know where the mirnas are produced from in the genome and v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com which genes they are targeting while the latter aspect has been intensely studied for both animals and plants system in the recent_years the picture of transcription of mirnas is far from complete especially for the transcriptional_start tsss of mirnas in general mirna_genes are firstly transcribed into primary mirnas pri mirnas by rna_polymerase pol_ii or iii in nucleus then the rnase drosha processes pri mirnas into precursor mirnas premirnas which later are exported into the cytosol and turn to mature_mirnas with the help of dicer the process of mirna transcription is basically the same as that of protein_coding however both and ends of pri mirna are subject to quick degradation the full_length transcript of a mirna gene is very difficult to be retained therefore it is hard to accurately locate the tss of mirna the database mirt collected predicted mirna_tsss from different sources and proved helpful for experimental_validation the methods of the identification of mirna_tsss available so_far are mainly based on the cap_analysis cage rna_polymerase pol_ii data or histone_modification data for example cage tags were used to identify mirna_tsss by considering its possibility to capture the cap however the rapid processing of the primary mirna transcript by drosha produces uncapped pre mirnas that cannot be captured by cage technology predicted mirna_tsss by modeling the rna_pol binding_patterns developed a method to predict the core promoters of mirnas with support_vector models based on rna_pol data more methods were developed by integrating the histone_modification data identified mirna_tsss by combining the information of rna_pol h_k and h k a data however these studies were limited to small amount of mirnas due to the insufficiency of pol_ii data and ignored the case of poly iii transcription in one aspect in further aspect they discarded the cell specific information of mirna_tsss by pooling the pol_ii data from experiments annotating the cell specific information of mirna_tsss is important because it has been proved that mirna is of higher tissue_specificity than protein_coding most recently georgios et_al developed an algorithm microtss for integrating rna sequencing_data with h_k pol_ii and dnase_seq data to identify the tissue_specific tsss of intergenic mirnas in high_resolution to overcome the effect of drosha processing and capture the primirnas of low_abundance microtss required high deep sequencing_data which seems not easy to obtain for the large number of cell_lines and various cellular environmental_conditions so_far mirna_tsss of very few cell_lines have been predicted in a cell specific way an automatic and systematic method that could identify mirna_tsss accurately and cell specifically in a broad range of cell_lines is still in urgent requirement here we developed a workflow to identify mirna_tsss in cell_lines based on h_k and dnase_i dhss which combined the features of species_conservation and sequences the proximal h_k region to each pre mirna in each cell_line is considered as the potential region containing the tss of the mirna dhss are potential transcription_factor and their existence of them in the promoter_region can assure the function of the identified tsss the accuracy of our predicted mirna_tsss is verified in several ways including comparing the results with the mirna_tsss that are identified by previous_studies showing expressed_sequence est evidence for them and analyzing their global conservation known cage tags showed a higher signal at the tsss that were identified using our approach however the signal levels were not comparable with those of protein_coding which indicates the effect of the rapid degradation of the cap of mirna transcript and proves the previous viewpoint that cage data is inadequate for the prediction of mirna_tsss current models of mirna_biogenesis were also confirmed by our finding that the cage signal detected in nucleus at the identified mirna_tsss was much higher than that detected in cytosol whereas the nuclear and cytosolic cage signals for protein_coding are comparable in addition the analysis on the predicted tsss showed the promoters upstream the independent tsss of either intragenic or intergenic mirnas are more conserved than that of the host gene tsss by which some intragenic mirnas are transcribed in cases that mirnas were broadly activated in various cell_lines alternative tsss and promoters were used in different cell_lines then they could be regulated in a promoter specific_manner in this study we developed a method for mirna tss prediction by integrating the information of experimental_data of h_k and dhs the species_conservation and sequence_features compared with other methods that are based on histone_modification we used dhss data to assure the function of promoters upstream of the predicted tsss in addition instead of pooling data of different cell_lines the information from cell_lines was processed separately in our workflow this proves useful for conducting experiments and analyzing the cell specificity of mirna_tsss to evaluate the performance of our method a set of experimentally_verified mirna_tsss were collected from literature as benchmark data and our method performs best comparing with other predictions to evaluate the performance of our method in a cell specific way a set of cell specific validated mirna_tsss in hesc cells were used to make an independent comparison our method performed better than those non cell specific methods but worse than microtss however the input_data for our method were more easily acquirable than microtss which enabled us to make predictions in a broader range of cell_lines with an acceptable precision in our method we set a distance threshold to discriminate a candidate tss from its nearby annotated host tss only the candidate tss that is more than this threshold distance away from its nearby host tss was considered as independent tss we set this distance threshold to bp based on the length of an h_k peak assuming that there is only one tss in one h_k peak region the influence of this threshold on the prediction was checked the number of intergenic and intragenic mirnas stays at about and respectively as the variation of threshold supplementaryin supplementary_file s for the number of tsss on average every intergenic intragenic mirna loses about tsss as the threshold increases by bp supplementaryin supplementary_file s the accuracy evaluated by experimentally_validated tsss is not influenced by the change therefore the influence of changing the threshold to tss prediction is limited it has always been a dispute whether cage data are able to efficiently capture the mirna tss because of the transient nature of mirna primary_transcripts to clarify this issue we analyzed the cage signal at predicted mirna tss and found the nuclear cage signal was much higher than the cytosolic cage signal at tss location it is evident that the cage signal at mirna tss would be reduced if the nuclear and cytosolic cage signals were pooled together to deal with this problem a deep_sequencing approach was employed to increase the cage signal at mirna tss by increasing the total_count of reads however the deep sequencing_data may also increase the noise signal in the background region and promoter_region of protein_coding to properly and efficiently use cage data maintaining the full mirna primary transcript is necessary such as in caenorhabditis_elegans full transcripts could be maintained when rnas were isolated from nucleolus alternatively inhibition of drosha could help to maintain full transcripts for deep_sequencing however this kind of data are very limited at present time in our result we noticed that some of the mirnas had quite long primary_transcripts for example hsa_mir as is embedded in its host gene gpc and its host transcript is over kb the long pri mirna transcript might provide the possibility of more alternative tsss on the basis of the analysis of species_conservation of mirna promoter we found that for the upstream promoters of tss which were regions of bp bp the mean conservation in the case that mirnas are independently transcribed was significantly_higher than that in the case that mirnas are co transcribed with the host_genes however at the core promoter_region which is the conservation behaves in opposite this observation showed a different pattern of conservation between the promoters of host gene dependently and independently transcribed mirna_genes found the promoters of intergenic mirnas were even more conserved than those of the intragenic mirnas that are co transcribed with the host_genes in opossum found only conserved host intragenic mirna pairs from intragenic mirnas in humans indicating the poor conservation for the promoters of host_genes dependent mirnas our result is consistent with these reports and draws a better explanation for these observations the different pattern of conservation on the core promoters and upstream promoters may indicate a different evolution process for host gene dependently and independently transcribed mirna_genes mirnas are mainly expressed in a cell specific_manner which could originate from the use of selectively activated tsss and specific_promoters however it should be noticed that there is no unambiguous correspondence between expression of a gene and its active tss neither for protein_coding nor for mirna_genes as reported for protein_coding many genes do not produce full_length transcripts nonetheless experience transcript initiation as reported from microtss for predicted tsss mirnas were expressed in mesc similarly in our result for predicted tsss mirnas were expressed in a gse so current methods could predict the possibly active tsss but there still needs more efforts to fill in the gap between the transcription and expression of mirnas anyway to know the active transcription_start is the first step in conclusion we predicted the mirna_tsss for cell_lines and several observations were made about the cell_line specificity of different types of tsss the conservation of mirna promoters and the long_non related to pri mirnas these results from this research could benefit the understanding of the specific expression of mirnas and their exact regulation_network in different cells
