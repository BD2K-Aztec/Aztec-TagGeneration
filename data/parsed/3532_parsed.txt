databases_and advance_access phi dac protein homology database through dihedral_angle conservation finding related conformations in the protein_data is essential in many areas of bioscience to assist this task we designed a dihedral_angle database for searching protein segment homologs the search_engine relies on encoding of the protein coordinates into text characters representing amino_acid and dihedral_angles the search_engine is advantageous owing to its high_speed and interactive nature and is expected to assist scientists in discovering conformation homologs and evolutionary kinship the search_engine is fast with query times lasting a few seconds and freely_available over the past_years structural data in the protein_data pdb has grown exponentially at the present time structures are available in the pdb the data abundance makes_it to navigate the information particularly when one tries to retrieve segment motifs to find segment motifs in the pdb structures several computational engines have been designed one such engine is spasm which finds spatial motifs consisting of arbitrary main_chain and side chain conformation in a database of protein_structures an additional search_engine named fragment finder was designed to identify similar structural_motifs based on backbone dihedral_angles another engine past is based on translationand rotation invariant representation of protein_backbone dihedral_angles both past and fragment finder suffer from dihedral_angle discretization of which coarse grains the results and preclude amino_acid which prevents a comprehensive search also noteworthy is the dali server which enables the user to browse for homologs in cartesian space none of these engines allows a combined search using amino_acid and dihedral_angles in a rapid manner here we describe an online search_engine that rapidly finds protein segments based on amino_acid and and dihedral_angles the search_engine named protein homology through dihedral_angle constraints phi dac is advantageous owing to its speed generality and simplicity it is expected to be helpful to the scientific_community by easing the identification of conformation homologs and distilling useful information from the pdb phi dac database in an example entry of the phidac database is shown the entry is composed of four pipe delimited fields the first and second fields contain the pdb identification id and the amino_acid respectively chain ids are referenced to the dssp files and cysteines are in lowercase letters duplicate lowercase letters form disulfide_bridges a with a b with b etc exclamation points denote a chain break or a new polypeptide_chain the third and fourth fields contain the and dihedral_angles encoded in double characters the first character represents units of a b s and a b and the second character represents units of thus a is a is a is s is or a is or to whom correspondence should be addressed and so on this protein_backbone representation is concise and accurate the database is available for download querying phi dac to perform a search for similar protein backbone_conformations in the pdb the web_interface offers the following search parameters pdb id chain first and last residue and tolerance the tolerance is a range of neighboring dihedral_angle intervals in increments the dihedral_angle discretization of is superior to fragment finder and past and allows for more accurate results the tolerance is limited to ae so as to provide_meaningful spatial superposition a screenshot of the query interface is shown in supplementary table s summarizes the run times and the work range of the server in terms of peptide length complexity of fold and dihedral_angle deviation note that the bottleneck of the server is the dihedral_angle deviation interpreting the results following a query submission the result table should be loaded automatically within few seconds a screenshot of the result table of the example query is shown in the result page contains the pdb id chain position and the amino_acid the pdb ids are hyperlinked to the respective pdb_file the results are classified according to the dihedral_angle root_mean rmsd between the query segment and the result segment low to high example queries two example queries are readily_accessible on the web_site in the first example query the coordinates of a small bent helix in pdb id xim residues are used searching with the and dihedral_angles by using a tolerance of ae and without conserving the amino_acid leads to matching segments belonging to different pdb entries in the second example query the coordinates of the hairpin segment of chain a of pdb id l w is used querying with the and dihedral_angles by using a tolerance of ae and without conserving the amino_acid leads to matching segments belonging to different pdb entries local versus global homology phi dac is based on local dihedral_angle homology and is not designed to detect global spatial similarities as such phi dac does not detect similarity between large scop or cath folds with perfect superimposition in the core and major differences in the loops for spatial superimposition scop cath and dali should be used our method of encoding the backbone and dihedral_angles into text characters has proven to be a fast solution for answering queries about local structural_similarities in the pdb compared with spasm phi dac shows similar results while being much faster and addressing a different question compared with dali therefore compared with dali we consider phi dac to be a valuable_tool for the fast detection of protein segments based on dihedral_angle conservation the phi dac search_engine the search_engine finds protein segment homologs based on and dihedral_angles and amino_acid a search parameters include pdb coordinates pdb and chain id as well as residue range b the result page of phi dac lists the segments that matched the query shown here is an example query for segment of chain a of pdb id l w with a torsion_angle tolerance of the results are listed in order of the rmsd of dihedral_angles between the query and result notice sequence_identity indicated by pipes
