systems_biology assimilating genome_scale reconstructions with modelborgifier motivation genome_scale reconstructions and models as collections of genomic and metabolic information provide a useful means to compare organisms comparison requires that models are similarly notated to pair shared components result matching and comparison of genome_scale reconstructions and models are facilitated by modelborgifier it reconciles models in light of different annotation schemes allowing diverse models to become useful for synchronous investigation availability_and the modelborgifier toolbox is freely_available www brain biotech de downloads model borgifier zip genomic reconstructions can help develop hypothesis driven discovery provide a background for high_throughput data and provide an in silico sandbox for metabolic_engineering because reconstructions are easily_interpretable and functionally testable representations of an organisms genome and metabolism they also provide a means to compare organisms comparing reconstructions allows for conserved metabolic_pathways growth predictions under similar conditions and multi organism communities to be investigated importantly these studies are predicated on the stipulation that the concerned models are semantically compatible consistently annotated and similarly notated ideally reaction and metabolite entries would use identical naming methods the increased popularity of genome_scale reconstructions and models gems has sparked the development of markup and semantic standards namely systems_biology sbml has been adopted as the lingua franca for model exchange however this standard does not define a naming scheme for reactions and metabolites or a generally_accepted reference_database consequently fully_automated comparison of gems from diverse sources is currently impossible to rectify this situation some attempts have been made to create collections of gems that use a standard reaction and metabolite nomenclature this includes the bigg database and metrxn although both provide online_databases of curated models users cannot submit models this precludes the spontaneous comparison of additional or novel gems such as those from the model seed tools do exist to compare and to merge arbitrary sbml formatted regulatory or biochemical_models however these methods are predominantly aimed at combining sub models into larger entities here we present modelborgifier a tool that is specifically aimed at comparing and combining large curated or automatically generated organism specific genome_scale reconstructions it is implemented in matlab and integrates seamlessly with the popular opencobra toolbox model comparison uses both greedy and network comparison techniques to find matching reaction and metabolite entries merging is done in a semiautomated fashion manual match no match decisions are fed to machine_learning to augment auto matching the resulting composite model provides a framework to compare models a means to share_information between them and a reaction database for in silico metabolic_engineering the original models can be extracted from the composition with mathematical fidelity and addended information
