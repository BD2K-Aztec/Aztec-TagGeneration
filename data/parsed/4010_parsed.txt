databases_and rightfield embedding ontology annotation in spreadsheets motivation in the life_sciences guidelines checklists and ontologies describing what metadata is required for the interpretation and reuse of experimental_data are emerging data producers however may have little experience in the use of such standards and require tools to support this form of data annotation results rightfield is an open_source application that provides a mechanism for embedding ontology annotation support for life_science data in excel spreadsheets individual cells columns or rows can be restricted to particular ranges of allowed classes or instances from chosen ontologies the rightfield enabled spreadsheet presents selected ontology_terms to the users as a simple drop down list enabling scientists to consistently annotate their data the result is semantic annotation by stealth with an annotation_process that is less error_prone more efficient and more consistent with community standards availability_and rightfield is open_source under a bsd_license and freely_available fromthe quantity and complexity of biological data produced during standard_laboratory projects has increased with the availability of high_throughput advances in areas such as transcriptomics and proteomics enable scientists to produce high volumes of data in single experiments in order to compare and reuse this data however rich metadata annotation is required the biocuration and data standards communities have been addressing this issue by providing recommendations for annotation requirements minimum information models with associated controlled_vocabularies or ontologies that define the terms that should be used to describe metadata elements are being developed in some cases publication submissions are not accepted unless the accompanying data is compliant with the relevant minimum information model for microarrays this is miame the minimum information about a microarray experiment however despite this drive to standardization there are few tools to help scientists manage this process rightfield was created to allow data curators informaticians and ontologists to augment standardsrightfield provides a simple and unobtrusive way of using semantic_web technologies to improve and standardize data annotation the novel part of this work lies in shielding the use of ontologies from laboratory scientists allowing them to continue working in familiar native spreadsheets other applications such as the isa tools provide similar functionality but operate from bespoke client applications and are designed for more expert users the anzo commercial platform has similar goals http www cambridgesemantics com the introduction of high_throughput omics_technologies has revolutionized experimental biology the data produced in these experiments however is difficult_to or reuse without the use of common vocabularies rightfield is an application that bridges this gap it restricts the choices of annotation terms to a manageable set which is accessible and understandable to the scientists
