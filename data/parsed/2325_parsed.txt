data_and identifying_functional mirna mrna regulatory_modules with correspondence latent_dirichlet motivation micrornas mirnas are small_non that cause mrna_degradation and translational inhibition they are important regulators of development and cellular_homeostasis through their control of diverse processes recently great efforts have been made to elucidate their regulatory_mechanism but the functions of most mirnas and their precise regulatory_mechanisms remain_elusive with more and more matched expression_profiles of mirnas and mrnas having been made available it is of great interest to utilize both expression_profiles to discover the functional regulatory_networks of mirnas and their target_mrnas for potential biological_processes that they may participate in results we present a probabilistic_graphical to discover functional mirna regulatory_modules at potential biological levels by integrating heterogeneous datasets including expression_profiles of mirnas and mrnas with or without the prior target binding information we applied this model to a mouse mammary dataset it effectively captured several biological_process specific modules involving mirnas and their target_mrnas furthermore without using prior target binding information the identified mirnas and mrnas in each module show a large proportion of overlap with predicted mirna_target relationships suggesting that expression_profiles are crucial for both target_identification and discovery of regulatory_modules contact micrornas mirnas are non protein_coding that are expressed from longer transcripts encoded in animals plants viruses and single celled eukaryotes they cause mrna_degradation translational inhibition or a combination of the two by completely or partially complementary base binding to their target_mrnas to whom correspondence should be addressed mirnas are pivotal regulators of development and cellular_homeostasis through their control of diverse processes including cell_differentiation proliferation growth mobility and apoptosis consequently dysregulation of mirna functions may lead to diseases recent_studies have reported differentially_expressed in diverse cancer_types such as breast_cancer lung_cancer prostate_cancer colon_cancer and ovarian_cancer therefore the understanding of mirna is critical in understanding basic biological_processes elucidating the development and inhibition of pathogenesis of many diseases and facilitating biotechnology projects many computational_approaches have been proposed to elucidate mirna functions in recent_years we classify these works into three categories i mirna_target that is to identify which mrnas are targeted by which mirnas ii discovering mirna regulatory_modules mrms that is to identify a group of co expressed mirnas and mrnas either at sequence level or by integrating sequence and expression_profiles of mirnas and mrnas iii prediction of functional mirna regulatory_modules fmrms which are regulatory_networks of mirnas and their target mirnas for specific biological_processes the identification of fmrms is critical in understanding the biological_pathways and the development and inhibition of pathogenesis of many diseases it also has a great_potential for the development of gene therapeutic_treatments and mirna based drugs for fmrm discovery proposed a method based on association_rule it associates the reverse expression_patterns of mirnas and mrnas with biological conditions a novel method is further proposed using bayesian_network structure_learning this method was designed to explore all the possible mirna regulatory_patterns for biological conditions under the comparative experiment designs these two methods are supervised methods where biological conditions are directly applied to the search for the fmrms an unsupervised method was proposed byfor fmrm discovery in this section we present the results and analysis of applying our model to a mouse mammary dataset the dataset were profiled with samples derived from nine classes of mouse_models representing one normal type and two breast_cancer basal and luminal the expression data were screened with probes of mirnas corresponding to unique mirnas and probes of mrnas for each type of the conditions samples were profiled with mirnas and mrnas details in supplementary_material in order to compare with the target prediction the expression datasets of mirnas and mrnas were further filtered with microcosm targets v and only those in microcosm were maintained for analysis consequently probes of mirnas and probes of mrnas were used in our experiment
