systems_biology computational_analysis of tissue_specific gene_networks application to murine retinal functional studies motivation the vertebrate_retina is a complex neuronal_tissue and its development normal_functioning and response to injury and disease is subject to a variety of genetic_factors to understand better the regulatory and functional_relationships between the genes expressed within the retina we constructed an interactive gene network of the mouse retina by applying a bayesian statistics approach to information derived from a variety of gene_expression proteinprotein_interaction and gene_ontology databases results the network contains retina related genes most of them are obtained through manual literature based curation while the others are the genes preferentially_expressed in the retina these retina related genes are linked by potential functional_associations in the network the prediction on the gene functional association using the bayesian_approach outperforms predictions using only one source of information the network includes five major gene_clusters each enriched in different biological_activities there are several applications to this network first we identified hub_genes that are predicted to play particularly important roles in the function of the retina some of them are not yet well studied second we can predict novel gene_functions using guilt by association method third we also predicted novel retinal_disease associated genes based on the network_analysis availability to provide easy access to the retinal network we constructed an interactive web_tool named morenet which isin the post genome era a major_challenge is to identify the functional_elements in the genomes both experimental and computational_approaches have been successful in identification of many functional_elements a next step is the determination of the properties of these elements especially for the genes that encode_proteins the properties of a gene include the biological_function of its gene_product the to whom correspondence should be addressed biological_pathways in which it acts and any disease associations one traditional method to predict the function of a novel protein is based on homology as proteins with similar primary sequences or d structures tend to share biological_function to understand the biological_pathways in which a protein is involved or to find evidence of a disease association generally requires detailed and time consuming laboratory work traditional_methods to study a genes properties often focus on the protein of interest and ignore its cellular_context an emerging technology to predict gene properties takes a different approach one based on the analysis of gene_networks d gene_co have been used to predict protein_function dna microarray_studies can generate huge_amounts of gene_expression data under a variety of different physiological_conditions based on the assumption that genes with similar gene_expression are likely to be functionally_related researchers have been successful in applying correlation based_approaches to predict gene function similar concepts have also been applied to predict gene function based on proteinprotein_interaction ppi_networks a more informative gene network and one with hopefully greater predictive_power could be constructed by integrating diverse types of biological_datasets for example probabilistic functional_networks have been developed for a number of organisms and these studies have resulted in the identification of novel interactions network_analysis has also been applied to predict disease associated genes however these studies often ignore the specific behavior of different cell_types or tissues and as a result yield only a unified network that is generic for all tissues for higher_eukaryotes we believe that important aspects of gene_networks are intrinsically tissue_specific in other words a unified network will likely only reflect the common basic_cellular shared by all types of tissues or cell_types in order to better understand the specific biological_systems for higher eukaryotic_cells we need to construct tissue_specific gene_networks in the analysis described here we used mouse retina as a model system to construct a tissue_specific gene network by integrating different types of available biological data supporting functional_relationships of genes in the network genes belonging to the
