traser an r package for performing trait associated snp enrichment_analysis in genomic_intervals genome_wide gwass have successfully identified many sequence_variants that are significantly associated with common diseases and traits tens_of of such trait associated snps have already been cataloged which we believe form a great resource for genomic_research recent_studies that the collection of trait associated snps can be exploited to indicate whether a given genomic interval or intervals are likely to be functionally connected with certain phenotypes or diseases despite this importance currently there is no ready to use computational_tool able to connect genomic_intervals to phenotypes here we present traser an easy to use r bioconductor_package that performs enrichment_analyses of trait associated snps in arbitrary genomic_intervals with flexible options including testing method type of background and inclusion of snps in ld availability_and the traser r package preloaded with up to date collection of trait associated snps are freely_available in bioconductorgenome wide association studies gwass have been conducted en_masse in the past_decade and have been tremendously successful in identifying sequence_variants that are significantly associated with common diseases and traits to this day thousands of gwas have been conducted and reported across diverse spectrums of diseases as well as qualitative_and phenotypes resources such as association result browser http www ncbi nlm nih gov projects gapplusprev sgap plus htm and nhgri gwas catalog have been established to catalog all the trait associated variants currently the association result browser contains association results checked on october which corresponds to autosomes plus chromosome x unique trait associated single_nucleotide tasnps linking to diseases or phenotypes we believe such a catalog of tasnps offers scientists a unique perspective to explore and annotate the functional potential of any given genomic_intervals showed that regulatory dna marked by deoxyribonuclease i dnase_i dhss was enriched with noncoding gwas snps recent_studies from encode and roadmap epigenome consortia systematically examined enrichment of tasnps in chip_seq of transcription_factors and histone_marks and unveiled biologically_interesting connections these results indicate the utilities of conducting tasnp enrichment_analyses in genomic_intervals of interest we believe that it will be a powerful_tool for researchers to be able to query any given set of genomic_intervals to see whether tasnps are enriched in these particular differentially_methylated and putative enhancers in this way we can build hypotheses linking these intervals to phenotypes this is similar to the gene_ontology go term enrichment_analysis or the gene_set gsea except that go terms or functional_categories are replaced by traits and a set of genes is replaced by a set of genomic_intervals we believe tasnps can bring important functional insights to genomic_regions especially intergenic_regions despite the great utilities currently there is no off_the computational_tool available to carry out this non trivial test to cater for this demand we developed an r bioconductor_package named traser trait associated snp enrichment_analysis which offers a turnkey solution for enrichment_analysis of tasnps
