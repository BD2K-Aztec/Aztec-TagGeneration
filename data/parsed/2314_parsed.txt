identifying cancer_driver in tumor genome_sequencing studies motivation major tumor sequencing_projects have been conducted in the past_few to identify genes that contain driver somatic_mutations in tumor_samples these genes have been defined as those for which the non silent mutation_rate is significantly_greater than a background_mutation estimated from silent mutations several methods have been used for estimating the background_mutation results we propose a new method for identifying cancer_driver which we believe provides improved accuracy the new method accounts for the functional impact of mutations on proteins variation in background_mutation among tumors and the redundancy of the genetic_code we reanalyzed sequence_data for candidate_genes in non small cell lung_tumors using the new method we found several important genes like pten which were not deemed significant by the previous method at the same time we determined that some genes previously_reported as drivers were not significant by the new analysis because mutations in these genes occurred mainly in tumors with large background mutation_rates availability the software is available at http linus nci nih gov data youna software zip contact major tumor sequencing_projects have been conducted and initiated in the past_few to identify genes that are frequently mutated and thereby are expected to have primary roles in the development of tumor one of the challenges in interpreting this data is distinguishing driver_mutations which have a role in oncogenesis or in the cancer phenotype from passenger_mutations that accumulate through dna_replication but are irrelevant to tumor development to find these driver_genes each gene is tested for whether its mutation_rate is significantly_higher than the background or passenger mutation_rate the background_mutation is estimated based to whom correspondence should be addressed on silent mutations which do not change amino_acid encoding and which are therefore considered to be passenger_mutations all current methods for estimating the background_mutation are based on a common approach in which background nonsilent mutation_rate n is estimated as a product s r where the background silent mutation_rate s is obtained by dividing the observed number of silent mutations by the number of base_pairs sequenced and r is the average ratio of the number of potential non silent mutations to the number of potential silent mutations having estimated the background non silent mutation_rate n each gene can be tested whether the number of mutations is significantly_greater than that expected under the background_mutation using a binomial_test the methods used for calculating r vary calculated r in the following way they mutate each nucleotide of each codon in silico to determine_whether it results in a non silent or silent mutation they then calculate the average of each hypothetical non silent or silent mutation by weighting it according to its relative frequency some investigators further divide mutations into several types according to the nucleotide and the neighboring nucleotides of the mutations they estimate a separate background_mutation for each mutation_type by multiplying relative_frequencies of each mutation_type by the background rate n they then test each gene by using a likelihood_ratio to assess whether the number of mutations occurring in the gene is unlikely under the background mutation_rates there are three shortcomings in the approaches previously_developed for identifying driver_genes first previous_approaches ignore the fact that different types of mutations can have different impact on proteins non silent mutations include missense_mutations which change an amino_acid to another amino_acid nonsense_mutations which change an amino_acid to a stop_codon mutations in splice_sites and insertions_or indels the indels can also be divided_into two types namely inframe indels and frameshift indels according to whether it changes the reading_frame since frameshift indels and nonsense_mutations change all the amino_acids that come after the amino_acid where the mutation occurred they have the greatest impact on the protein_function mutations in splice_sites also have strong impact since they disrupt splicing also different types of missense_mutations may have different impact based on how similar are the chemical_properties of the original and new amino_acids several studies also have shown that the selection_pressures vary by mutation_type and sequence location in cancer mutation datasets developed tests to examine the significance of selection toward missense nonsense and splice_site mutations in somatic cancer mutation datasets they found that the selection_pressures for nonsense and splice mutations are much higher than those for missense_mutations alsofound that somatic cancer mutation datasets have a significant_enrichment for mutations disrupting phosphorylation_sites if two genes a and b have a similar number of mutations but all mutations in gene a are expected to affect its protein_function significantly while those in gene b are not then the gene a is more likely to be a driver gene than gene b however the current methods are not able to differentiate genes a and b since they ignore the information of mutation types a second limitation of previous_approaches is that they ignore the fact that different samples have different background mutation_rates tumors differ substantially with regard to the number of somatic_mutations accumulated samples are exposed to different levels of mutagens for example smoking and some samples have mutations in genes that repair mutations therefore some samples have much higher background_mutation than others this can be seen infor the data fromwho sequenced genes in tumor_samples to identify nonsilent mutations and silent mutations shows the distribution of the number of mutations that occurred in each of the samples it shows that the number of mutations per sample ranges from to if a gene has mutations only in the samples with high background_mutation then those mutations are more likely byproducts of the high background_mutation rather than the cause of a cancer in contrast if a gene has mutations only in the samples with low_background mutation_rate then the gene is more likely to be a driver gene even if the number of mutations is small if we assume the same background_mutation across samples the analysis will be biased toward falsely identifying as drivers those genes that have mutations in highly mutated samples and falsely missing those genes with a small number of mutations in samples with low mutation_rates third previous_approaches ignore the fact that a different number of non silent mutations can occur at each base_pair according to the genetic_code for example consider a codon tgg which encodes the amino_acid tryptophan since this is the only codon encoding tryptophan any mutation at any nucleotide of the codon would change the amino_acid therefore any mutation results in a nonsilent mutation in contrast six codons encode the same amino_acid arginine aga agg cga cgg cgc and cgt therefore within the codon cga no non silent mutations can occur at the third position of the codon and only two non silent mutations can occur at the first position if a protein a consists mostly of tryptophan and a protein b consists mostly of arginine the gene a encoding the protein a is susceptible to more non silent mutations than the gene b encoding the protein b thus methods ignoring this difference will tend to misclassify as drivers genes rich in codons with limited redundancy and misclassify as non drivers genes rich in codons with substantial redundancy in this article we propose and evaluate a new method for identifying driver_genes in section we will define p values for testing whether a gene is a driver gene in section we will evaluate the new method using lung tumor genome_sequences we applied our method to the data of they sequenced coding_exons and splice donor acceptor_sites dinucleotides in the ends of introns of genes in samples from patients with lung_adenocarcinoma to identify non silent mutations they selected a subset of genes to identify silent mutations for measuring a background_mutation the table describing all the identified mutations is available in the paper of but the patient specific gene sequences are not thus we used the reference_sequence of coding_exons and splice donor acceptor_sites dinucleotides in the ends of introns of the genes from ensembl release we have developed a new method for identifying driver_genes that has several methodological advantages compared with the previously used methods first we assign scores to non silent mutations according to their expected impacts on the protein_function so that the genes with more driver like mutations will get smaller p values second we permit each sample to have a different background_mutation this has the effect of reducing the false_positives and increasing true_positives which was confirmed by the simulation_study third instead of assuming separate background mutation_rates for non silent and silent mutations we assume that each passenger mutation is generated from one background_mutation process and that whether the mutation is non silent or silent depends on the genetic_code thus our model accounts for the variable number of possible non silent mutations that can occur at each base_pair according to the genetic_code this takes_into the difference in the number of possible non silent mutations between genes according to the codon_usage within genes fourth we take into account uncertainties in the background_mutation by using empirical_bayes methods these methodological advances contributed to identifying a different set of driver_genes when compared with those identified by first we did not find the genes cdh and pdgfra whichfound significant these genes are not selected by our method because they are mainly mutated in the highly mutated samples and the scores of the mutations are not high second we found pten nras ltk zmynd epha myo b ntrk and tfdp whichdid not find significant it shows that our method is more sensitive in finding genes whose total number of mutations is small although we believe that our method provides an improvement over the previous methods there is room for improvement by extending our approach first we measure the functional impact of mutations by the significance of the change to amino_acids caused by the mutation however the functional impact is also dependent on the position in which a mutation_occurs for example all three mutations in nras occurred in the exact same base_pair position which implies that the mutation in the specific position is crucial to the function of the protein if a score for each position can be estimated that measures the significance of the position in protein_function it can be used in our test_statistics in the same way as the mutation score t ij second the current scoring system which assigns mutation scores in the order missense_mutation inframe indel mutation in splice_sites frameshift indel nonsense_mutation may be biased toward identifying tumor_suppressor over oncogenes loss offunction mutations such as frameshift indels or nonsense_mutations occur more frequently in tumor_suppressor than in oncogenes our use of the blosum matrix to refine the scoring of missense_mutations helps in the identification of new oncogenes alternative scoring_systems can be used however to increase sensitivity for identifying oncogenes for example we can assign the same scores as the current method to the missense_mutations but reduced scores to indels mutation in splice_sites or nonsense_mutations third we may refine our background mutation model inso that all six types of mutations a t g c a t c g a t t a g c a t g c t a g c c g have separate mutation_rates we separate the rates of mutations according to the mutation types transition or transversion base_pair types a t or g c and their context cpg_dinucleotide contexts therefore we did not separate the rates of the two types of mutation for each page
