drug_target prediction using adverse_event report systems a pharmacogenomic approach_motivation unexpected drug activities derived from off targets are usually undesired and harmful however they can occasionally be beneficial for different therapeutic_indications there are many uncharacterized drugs whose target_proteins including the primary target and off targets remain_unknown the identification of all potential_drug has become an important issue in drug_repositioning to reuse known drugs for new therapeutic_indications results we defined pharmacological similarity for all possible drugs using the us food and drug administrations fdas adverse_event aers and developed a new method to predict unknown drugtarget_interactions on a large_scale from the integration of pharmacological similarity of drugs and genomic sequence_similarity of target_proteins in the framework of a pharmacogenomic approach the proposed method was applicable to a large number of drugs and it was useful especially for predicting unknown drugtarget_interactions that could not be expected from drug chemical_structures we made a comprehensive prediction for potential off targets of drugs with known targets and potential target profiles of drugs without known targets which suggests many potential drugtarget_interactions that were not predicted by previous chemogenomic or pharmacogenomic approaches most drugs are molecules that interact and interfere with an appropriate protein target implicated in a disease of interest drugs may also interact with additional proteins off targets hereafter that are not their primary therapeutic_targets resulting in unexpected side_effects drug side_effects are complex phenomena attributed to many molecular scenarios e g metabolism disorder downstream pathway perturbations among which the interaction with off target_proteins is the most important cause unexpected drug activities derived from off targets are usually undesired and harmful however they can occasionally be beneficial and lead to different therapeutic_indications for example sildenafil viagra was developed to treat angina but it is now used for the treatment of erectile_dysfunction there are many drugs whose target_proteins including the primary target and off targets have not yet been characterized the identification of all potential targets for a given drug has become an important issue in drug_repositioning to reuse known drugs for new therapeutic_indications experimental_testing to identify drugtarget_interactions is a very expensive_and process and thus there is a strong incentive to develop new in silico prediction_methods which will enable to limit experimental_testing in recent_years the field of chemogenomics has rapidly gained importance primarily exploring the relationship between the chemical_space of possible compounds and the genomic space of possible proteins a variety of in silico chemogenomic methods have been developed to predict drugtarget or compoundprotein interactions on a genome_wide scale the underlying idea is that similar ligands are likely to interact with similar proteins and prediction is performed based on chemical_structures of ligand compounds protein_sequences of targets and the currently known compoundprotein interactions another promising approach is to use pharmacological information such as drug side_effects and adverse_drug the use of side effect similarity has been recently_proposed to infer whether two drugs share a target this method requires drug package_inserts that describe the detailed side effect information so it is applicable only to marketed drugs for which side effect information is provided to overcome_this several methods have been proposed to predict unknown side_effects from chemical_structures these methods are useful when chemical_structures and side_effects are correlated with each other to some extent however there are still some drugtarget_interactions that cannot be explained or predicted using these methods recently the adverse_event aers in the us food_and fda has been gaining a lot of attentions for computational applications of pharmaceutical analyses aers is a spontaneous reporting system that routinely collects adverse_drug reports from patients clinicians and pharmaceutical_companies in order to support the fdas postmarketing safety surveillance program for all approved drugs and biological_products one of the advantages of using aers over package_inserts is that the users need not wait for the sufficient amount of adverse_effect incidents to occur in order to be written on the package_inserts an algorithm has been developed to identify hidden drugdrug_interactions ddis in adverse eventreports and the same authors detected ddis between paroxetine and pravastatin which increases blood_glucose a data_mining technique has been used to analyze adverse_event profiles of platinum agents and it was observed that acute_renal was also more predominant forcisplatin and carboplatin did not increase the blood_level of creatinine these previous_works highlight the usefulness of aers for pharmaceutical and clinical research in this article we propose pharmacological similarity for all possible drugs using aers and develop a new method to predict unknown drugtarget_interactions on a large_scale from the integration of pharmacological similarity of drugs and genomic sequence_similarity of target_proteins in the framework of a pharmacogenomic approach the advantages of using the aersbased pharmacological similarity stem from the availability of information for a much larger number of drugs compared with the other more specific resources e g sider and japic used in the previous_works and unexpected drug_targets can be identified only through safety surveillance program and adverse_drug reported in the post_marketing study practice in the results we predict drugtarget_interactions involved in many protein_families and show the usefulness of our proposed method for predicting unknown drugtarget_interactions which cannot be expected from analyzing drug chemical_structures to our knowledge this is the first report to predict drug_targets using aers a comprehensive prediction of drugtarget_interaction enables us to suggest new potential drugtarget_interactions
