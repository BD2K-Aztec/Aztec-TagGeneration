stability_selection for regression_based models of transcription_factor dna binding_specificity motivation the dna binding_specificity of a transcription_factor tf is typically represented using a position_weight model which implicitly assumes that individual bases in a tf_binding contribute independently to the binding_affinity an assumption that does not always hold for this reason more complex models of binding speci ficity have been developed however these models have their own caveats they typically have a large number of parameters which makes them hard to learn and interpret results we propose novel regression_based models of tfdna binding_specificity trained using high_resolution in vitro data from custom protein binding microarray pbm experiments our pbms are specifically_designed to cover a large number of putative dna_binding for the tfs of interest yeast tfs cbf and tye and human tfs c_myc max and mad in their native genomic_context these high_throughput quantitative data are well suited for training complex models that take into account not only independent contributions from individual bases but also contributions from di and trinucleotides at various positions within or near the binding_sites to ensure that our models remain interpretable we use feature_selection to identify a small number of sequence_features that accurately_predict tfdna binding_specificity to further illustrate the accuracy of our regression_models we show that even in the case of paralogous tf with highly_similar position_weight our new models can distinguish the specificities of individual_factors thus our work represents an important step toward better sequence_based models of individual tfdna binding_specificity at the level of transcription gene_expression is regulated mainly via the binding of transcription_factors tfs to specific short dna sites in the promoters or enhancers of genes they regulate accurate characterization of the dna binding_specificity of tfs is critical to understand how these proteins achieve their regulatory purpose in the cell currently the most widely used model for representing the dna binding_specificity of a tf is the position_weight pwm or dna_motif a matrix containing scores or weights for each nucleotide at every position in the tf_binding pwms can perform well in practice these models have been combined with chromatin_accessibility data to successfully predict where specific tfs bind across the genome in a cell specific way however pwm models make the assumption that individual bases in a tf_binding contribute independently and additively to the affinity of that site which is not always true in practice dependencies among positions within tf_binding have been observed in small_scale experimental_studies in statistical_analyses of known tf_binding and in computational_analyses of high_throughput in vitro and in vivo tf_binding data this suggests that extending the classic definition of a pwm may lead to specificity models that better fit the tf_binding data indeed several studies have explored more complex models of tfdna binding_specificity and found that they outperform pwms however complex models are typically characterized by a large number of parameters which makes them hard to interpret and prone to overfitting here we present regression_based models of tfdna binding_specificity which take into account both the contributions from individual bases in a tf_binding and the contributions from higher_order k_mers our approach differs from previous work in three aspects i our models are trained on high_throughput quantitative data generated specifically for this task ii we use a new feature_selection method based on lasso_regression to restrict the number of features which makes our models easier to visualize and interpret and iii we include dependencies by using mers and mers as features and by using a non linear support_vector svr method the first aspect is important because many previous_models were trained either on a small number of high_resolution binding regions or on high_throughput in vivo data both of which are noisy have low_resolution and may reflect both direct and indirect dna_binding of the tested tfs in vitro data from high_throughput assayssuch as protein binding microarrays pbms mitomi or highthroughput selex are more appropriate for learning complex models of tfdna binding_specificity to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an

hundreds_or of genomic_dna regions centered at putative dna_binding for the tfs of interest see section for details the features used in our regression_models are based on the occurrences of mers mers and mers at various positions in the tf_binding or their flanking_regions regression_models that take into account all k_mers have hundreds_or of parameters depending on the value of k and on the size of the flanking_regions such a large number of parameters can lead to overfitting the training data and also make the models hard to visualize and interpret to overcome this problem we use a feature_selection approach based on lasso_regression this allows us to drastically reduce the number of parameters to estimate while maintaining high_prediction to illustrate the accuracy of our regression_models we train and test them on custom pbm data for five tfs from the bhlh protein_family yeast tfs cbf and tye and human tfs c_myc myc max and mad mad we show that for both yeast and human bhlh tfs our regression_models can distinguish the binding_specificities of individual family_members although their pwms are highly_similar this illustrates that our approach may be used to better understand the importance of intrinsic sequence preferences for achieving specificity within tf families
