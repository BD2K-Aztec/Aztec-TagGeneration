gene_expression lox inferring level of expression from diverse methods of census sequencing we present lox level of expression that estimates the level of gene_expression from high_throughput expressed sequence_datasets with multiple_treatments or samples unlike most analyses lox incorporates a gene bias model that facilitates integration of diverse transcriptomic sequencing_data that arises when transcriptomic_data have been produced using diverse experimental methodologies lox integrates overall sequence count tallies normalized by total expressed sequence count to provide expression levels for each gene relative to all treatments as well as bayesian credible_intervals the quantification of genomic gene_expression variation across conditions has become an increasingly common component of diverse research programs while microarray_technology has been widely and successfully_applied in the past high_throughput has garnered significant attention for the identification of differentially_expressed transcripts high_throughput facilitates discrete counts of expressed sequences enabling accurate and precise quantification of differential_expression levels especially for low_abundance transcripts and is not subject to issues of crosshybridization these features represent important_advantages over hybridization based microarray_technologies t provided that suitable approaches are applied for data analysis experimentally sequencing based expression methodologies differ in rna_isolation and priming strategies e g band cutting oligo dt primers random primers gene specific_primers or multitargeted primers as well as sequence_lengths and coverage e g solid and solexa for nearly all expression assays reverse transcription from messenger_rna mrna to complementary_dna cdna is a key_step that contributes considerable experimental variance throughput of the reaction is biased for each gene by secondary_and to make full use of diverse datasets gathered by different methodologies and to enable accurate and precise expression_profiling therefore it is necessary to be able to analyze gene_expression levels based on data from diverse methodologies although several recent tools are appropriate for sequencing based gene_expression data little attention has been devoted to the development of software that can support of analysis not just of homogeneously gathered datasets but also of datasets gathered by multiple methodologies here we present open_source cross_platform software lox level of expression enabling powerful accurate and precise quantification of expression from multiple_treatments and or sequencing methodologies lox quantifies gene_expression levels bayesian credible_intervals and statistical_significance across multiple_treatments or samples using mcmc integration as the cost of diverse high_throughput methodologies decreases lox will provide increasing utility to a burgeoning number of gene_expression studies
