halign fast multiple similar dna rna sequence_alignment based on the centre star strategy motivation multiple_sequence msa is important work but bottlenecks arise in the massive msa of homologous dna or genome_sequences most of the available state of the art software_tools cannot address large_scale datasets or they run rather slowly the similarity of homologous dna_sequences is often ignored lack of parallelization is still a challenge for msa research results we developed two software_tools to address the dna msa problem the first employed trie trees to accelerate the centre star msa strategy the expected time complexity was decreased to linear time from square time to address large_scale data parallelism was applied using the hadoop platform experiments demonstrated the performance of our proposed methods including their running time sum of pairs scores and scalability moreover we supplied two massive dna rna msa datasets for further testing and research availability_and the codes tools and data are accessible free of charge atdna sequence_alignment is considered the holy_grail problem in computational_biology and is of vital importance for molecular_function prediction the widely used databases pfam and rfam are constructed based on multiple_sequence msa molecular_function prediction sometimes depends on evolutionary_information msa is also required for evolutionary tree reconstruction most of the available phylogenetic_tree construction software_tools require previously aligned sequences as input when addressing the evolutionary_analysis of bacterial and viral_genomes large_scale similar dna_sequences often prevent these msa tools from functioning the evolution of viruses is rapid and massive viral dna_sequences often appear in phylogenetic reconstructions therefore it is necessary to improve the scalable capacity of msa tools when analyzing influenza_virus dna the appearance of increasing amounts of dna and genome data benefits from the improvement of dna_sequencing with the development of the genome and hapmap projects it makes sense to align massive dna_sequences whose size and length are both scalable most of the recent_studies on sequence_alignment have focused on mapping and de_novo the msa technique has not undergone any relevant improvements in recent_years the available state of the art msa software_tools address dna and protein_sequences equivalently andignore the high similarity of dna_sequences however we emphasize that the alignment of dna and protein_sequences is not synonymous the key problem in protein msa is aligning functional_regions the blosum and pam matrices are referenced for measuring performance a hidden_markov hmm is often employed for detecting shared functional_regions in contrast the core problem in dna msa is to match substrings that are as long as possible therefore tree memory structure is always exploited to obtain quick matches several msa software_tools have been developed in order with data_handling size these tools are t coffee small clustal medium muscle medium mafft medium large and kalign large as suggesting by embl ebi http www ebi ac uk tools msa t coffee is a consistency based msa tool that attempts to mitigate the pitfalls of progressive alignment_methods it only works on protein_sequences with a small_size clustal is a popular msa tool that employs tree based progressive alignments it is a multiplatform program that works on both windows and linux systems and can address both protein and dna_sequences the friendly graphic_user display makes clustal a popular tool muscle is well known for its accurate alignment of proteins mafft uses fast fourier_transforms which can run medium large_alignments to address massive sequences pasta divides the set of sequences into several subsets and employs mafft for aligning every subset in parallel and has been shown to achieve performance for thousands of rna_sequences kalign is a fast msa tool that concentrates on local_regions it is suitable for large_alignments however our testing suggests that none of these tools can address massive dna_sequences and they run rather slowly if the count of sequences is greater than a trie tree is an efficient data_structure for storing multiple_sequences and it facilitates the acceleration of searching multiple_sequences from a long string therefore it is helpful for detecting common regions and reducing the time required for alignment indeed various tree based string storage structures are widely used in dna searching and mapping such as blat and hobbes however the storage and acceleration from smart data_structure remains a gap in msa research parallel_computing has developed rapidly for scalable data in recent_years and has appeared in many bioinformatics applications however few parallel software_tools have been designed for msa therefore we developed a parallel msa software_tool based on the hadoop platform for scalable dna rna_sequences msa is an important and fundamental tool in bioinformatics especially for phylogenetic_tree there are complex interrelationships between msa and phylogenetic_tree involving mutual promotion and restraint phylogenetic_tree algorithms always require msa results as input_data while msa algorithms sometimes require phylogenetic_trees as guidelines for massive unaligned dna_sequences several msa free phylogenetic_tree algorithms have been proposed the core strategy of these algorithms is to calculate string distance based on the longest common substrings or word frequency instead of sequence_alignment this strategy is similar to our trie tree based algorithm this method would be better suited for dna_sequences than protein_sequences in this work we developed two msa tools based on the centre star strategy the first tool employed trie trees to accelerate the msa of highly_similar dna_sequences it runs fast but cannot deal with the big_data the second was designed to deal with scalable data it works in parallel with hadoop which is an open platform for parallel programming that has developed rapidly in recent_years experiments using files gb demonstrated the ability of halign from the experiments we can conclude that halign outperforms the available state of the art msa software_tools regarding its ability to handle large_scale dna rna datasets and it is suited for massive highly_similar dna_sequences it also runs faster for sequences of low similarity because it is a software_tool that runs in parallel here we simply employed dynamic_programming for basic alignment rna_structure information and a protein substitution matrix were not considered because they are time consuming taking such data into consideration will be future work to be performed for halign both the single thread and the parallel tools are coded with java which works on multiple operation systems hadoop is required for the parallel tool we have constructed a web_site datamining xmu edu cn software halign for sharing the software_tools and codes
