systems_biology evaluating the drosophila bicoid morphogen gradient system through dissecting the noise in transcriptional bursts motivation we describe a statistical_model to dissect the noise in transcriptional bursts in a developmental system results we assume that at any given moment of time each copy of a native gene inside a cell can exist in either a bursting active or non bursting inactive_state the experimentally_measured total noise in the transcriptional states of a gene in a population of cells can be mathematically dissected into two contributing components internal and external while internal noise quantifies the stochastic_nature of transcriptional bursts external noise is caused by cell to cell differences including fluctuations in activator concentration we use our developed methods to analyze the drosophila bicoid bcd morphogen gradient system for its target_gene hunchback hb the noise properties can be recapitulated by a simplified gene regulatory model in which bcd acts as the only input suggesting that the external noise in hb transcription is primarily derived from fluctuations in the bcd activator input however such a simplified gene regulatory model is insufficient to predict the noise properties of another bcd target_gene orthodenticle otd suggesting that otd transcription is sensitive to additional external fluctuations beyond those in bcd our results show that analysis of the relationship between input and output noise can reveal important insights into how a morphogen gradient system works our study also advances the knowledge about transcription at a fundamental level transcription is an inherently noisy molecular process that takes_place as burst like events how the incoherent transcriptional bursts lead to coherent and precise gene_expression during development is a fundamental_question and a subject of intense investigations martinez it has been suggested that averaging over time and or space allows a biological system to gain coherence and improve expression boundary precision to whom correspondence should be addressed to fully understand how precise gene_expression are achieved in response to morphogen inputs it is necessary to have methods that can evaluate the experimentally detected transcriptional bursts before such averaging takes_place here we develop a statistical_model for such a purpose where we mathematically dissect the experimentally_measured total noise into the internal and external components we use our model to analyze our experimental_data extracted from early drosophila_embryos where both the nuclear concentrations of the activator bicoid bcd and the transcriptional states of its target_genes hunchback hb and orthodenticle otd are simultaneously_measured we show that the dissected external noise in hb transcriptional bursts can be implicitly derived from the measured bcd input noise in contrast additional input noise is required to account for both the measured total noise and the dissected external noise in otd transcription these results suggest that although bcd acts as a direct and sustained input for both otd and hb transcription these two target_genes are distinct from each other our findings are consistent with recent_studies suggesting that in addition to bcd otd transcription also responds to other input s and thus is sensitive to additional external fluctuations our study provides an example illustrating the use of dissecting experimentally_measured transcriptional noise in understanding the mechanistic operations of a native morphogen gradient system
