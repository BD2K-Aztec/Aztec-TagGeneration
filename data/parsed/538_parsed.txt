genome_analysis associating microbiome_composition with environmental covariates using generalized unifrac distances understanding the compositional differences of microbial_communities microbiomes is essential in microbial_ecology with the development of next_generation to whom correspondence should be addressed microbiome_composition can now be determined by direct_dna without the need for laborious cultivation there has been a great interest in human microbiome_studies in different body sites ranging from skin to gut and respiratory_tract important insights have been gained from analysis of large_scale human_microbiome data including the discovery of enterotypes and discovery of the link between diet and these enterotypes although the metagenomic shotgun approach is potentially more powerful and unbiased s rrna gene targeted_sequencing is routinely performed to determine the taxonomic_composition the generated s rrna sequence_tags are usually clustered into operational_taxonomic otus with a specified amount of variability allowed within each otu at similarity these otus represent species downstream_analysis is then performed on the otu abundance data two central themes in human microbiome_studies are to identify potential biological and environmental_factors that are associated with microbiome_composition and to define the relationship between microbiome features and biological or clinical_outcomes the goal is to provide a better understanding of the factors that shape our microbiome and potentially contribute to the development of new therapeutic_strategies to modulate the microbiome_composition and affect human_health testing the association of microbiome_composition with potential environmental_factors using otu abundances directly is difficult due to high_dimensionality non normality and phylogenetic structure of the otu data instead distance based non parametric testing in which a distance measure is defined between any two microbiome samples is usually used to achieve_this the power of the distance based test depends on a proper choice of the distance measure numerous distance measures have been proposed to compare microbial_communities phylogenetic distance measures which account for the phylogenetic_relationship among the species provide far more power because they exploit the degree of divergence between different sequences among these the unifrac distances are the most popular ones copyedited by manuscript category original papermicrobiome data are multivariate count_data in their original_form and are statistically challenging to analyze due to their high_dimensionality phylogenetic constraints among species otus overdispersion and excessive zeros to circumvent the difficulty the data are often summarized in the form of distance_matrix testing association of microbiome_composition with environmental covariates is performed using the distance_matrix we have demonstrated in simulations that the weighted and unweighted unifrac impose large weight either to abundant lineages or to rare lineages they can be underpowered in detecting change in moderately abundant lineages since microbiome_composition change could occur in any lineages our generalized unifrac distances which unify the weighted and unweighted unifrac in a common framework enable us to detect a much wider_range of biologically_relevant changes our simulation_studies have clearly demonstrated that the generalized unifrac distance d is more robust than d w or d u and its performances are in general comparable to the best unifrac distances among the scenarios we considered in addition the generalized unifrac distances are very robust to tree constructing methods we suggest the use of d for testing association of microbiome_composition with environmental covariates to avoid missing important findings both weighted and unweighted unifrac distances are sensitive to sampling depth inflated distances at a low sampling depth are caused by sampling_variation especially for the rare lineages the generalized unifrac distances are also sensitive to sampling depth supplementary however as the sampling depth increases the distance stabilizes for the gut_microbiome dataset we found a sequencing_depth of reads is sufficient to stabilize the generalized unifrac distances to overcome the potential adverse_effects of uneven sampling rarefaction is usually used to subsample the samples to the same depth however when the sampling depth varies_greatly across the samples rarefaction throws away a significant portion of the s reads and increases the sampling_variation we found that rarefaction is not necessary at least in the context of testing the association of the microbiome_composition with covariates supplementary the power of unifrac variants can also be compared in the context of testing whether two microbial_communities differ significantly as in instead of comparing power for detecting the difference between two communities we focus our evaluations on the performance of unifrac distances for associating microbiome_composition to environmental covariates by collecting multiple independent samples the rational is that as the sequence depth increases two sample comparison will have increased power to detect differences due to sources that we are not interested in random noises such as the individual to individual variability day to day variability sampling location variability or even technical variability e g sample_preparation multiple samples from a population coupled with multivariate_statistical such as the distance based permanova provide powerful design and analysis methods to overcome these potential random noises as more and more large_scale microbiome datasets are being collected we expect that our generalized unifrac distances can help to identify important covariates that are associated with the microbiomes that could be missed using the commonly used unifrac distances in addition to identifying environmental covariates that may be determinants of microbiome_composition our approach would be equally suited to identifying microbiome features associated with biological or clinical_outcomes which is needed to begin to understand the impact of the microbiome on health
