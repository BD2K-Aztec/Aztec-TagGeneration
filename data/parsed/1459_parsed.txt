structural_bioinformatics dogsitescorer a web_server for automatic binding_site analysis and druggability assessment motivation many drug_discovery projects fail because the underlying target is finally found to be undruggable progress in structure_elucidation of proteins now opens up a route to automatic structure based target assessment dogsitescorer is a newly_developed automatic tool combining pocket prediction characterization and druggability estimation and is now available through a web_server availability the dogsitescorer web_server is freely_available for academic use at http rating the attractiveness of a drug_target is one of the major challenges in the early_stages of drug_discovery besides attractivity assessment based on medical rationale and commercial viability the properties of the target and its ability to be modulated by small drug like compounds further referred to as druggability have to be analyzed due to the large amount of available crystal_structures the automatic collection of target information gains importance in a first step binding_pockets have to be detected on the protein surface some methods fulfilling this task are available through web_services e g qsite finder castp screen pocketdepth metapocket and fpocket servers are referenced in the next step on the path toward target classification or druggability prediction is the annotation and comparison of target specific pocket properties some servers exist that allow besides binding_site predictionfor their analysis and functional_classification e g findsite splitpocket fpop probis and sitecomp many of these approaches search for structural_similarities which can help to predict side_effects of known drugs or to identify the role of yet uncharacterized_proteins although methods for fully_automatic structure based druggability predictions such as sitemap fpocket and dlid exist none of these methods is available online for predictions on new targets fpocket allocates a web_service where druggability scores and information can be requested but only for precalculated data_points dogsitescorer web_server provides an easy to use interface to predict pockets and subpockets of a protein_structure of interest furthermore key_properties characterizing the pocket and druggability estimations are supplied
