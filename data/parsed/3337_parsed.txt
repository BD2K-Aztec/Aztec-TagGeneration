online interactive analysis of protein_structure ensembles with bio d web bio d web is an online application for analyzing the sequence structure and conform ational heterogeneity of protein_families major functionality is provided for identifying protein_structure sets for analysis their alignment and refined structure superposition sequence and structure conservation analysis mapping and clustering of conformations and the quantitative_comparison of their predicted structural_dynamics availability bio d web is based on the bio d and shiny r packages all major browsers are supported and full source_code is available under a gpl license from http thegrantlab org bio d web many structures are now available for homologous_proteins determined under different crystallization conditions and oligomerization states detailed comparison of these structures can inform on structural dynamic mechanisms critical for protein_function including ligand_binding enzymatic_catalysis allosteric_regulation and bimolecular recognition a wide_range of bioinformatics_tools and online servers enable researchers to explore and analyze individual biomolecular structures notable examples_include molecular_visualization pairwise_structural and biophysics based tools including various normal_mode servers however existing_tools for detailed quantitative analysis of the sequence structure and dynamics of large heterogeneous protein_families often require significant computational expertise and typically remain accessible only to expert users with relevant programming_skills for example the bio d package requires r prody requires python and maven requires matlab knowledge a recent contribution to making such analysis more widely available online is the pdbflex database pdbflex catalogues the structural_variation of the same protein pdb structures sharing or more sequence_identity however more in depth interactive analysis of user_defined structure sets across species and diverse protein_families is not currently available to this end we have developed bio d weba web_application that implements a complete workflow for user customized investigation of protein_sequence structure dynamic relationships bio d web provides unparalleled online functionality including inter conformer relationship mapping with principal_component pca and quantitative_comparison of predicted internal dynamics across protein_families via new ensemble normal_mode enma together with conventional sequence and structure analysis methods these approaches allow researchers to map the structural dynamic_properties of proteins for which pdb structures are available bio d web requires no programming knowledge and thus decreases the entry barrier to performing advanced comparative sequence structure and dynamics analysis bio d web is powered by the previously described bio d r package for structural_bioinformatics in particular bio d approaches for identification of related protein_structures multiple_alignment rigid core identification optimal superposition pca and enma form the basis of the application supplementary structure and sequence annotations are derived from the rcsb_pdb and pfam databases bio d web employs shinys reactive programming and web_application framework to provide its interactive online interface shiny http shiny rstudio com
