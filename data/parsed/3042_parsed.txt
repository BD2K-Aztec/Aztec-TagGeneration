modeling dna_methylation dynamics with approaches from phylogenetics motivation methylation of cpg_dinucleotides is a prevalent epigen etic modification that is required for proper development in vertebrates genome_wide assays have become increasingly common and this has enabled characterization of dna_methylation in distinct stages across differentiating cellular lineages changes in cpg_methylation are essential to cellular_differentiation however current methods for modeling methylation dynamics do not account for the dependency_structure between precursor and dependent cell_types results we developed a continuous_time chain approach based on the observation that changes in methylation_state over tissue_differentiation can be modeled similarly to dna nucleotide changes over evolutionary time this model explicitly takes precursor to descendant relationships into account and enables inference of cpg_methylation dynamics to illustrate our method we analyzed a high_resolution methylation map of the differentiation of mouse stem_cells into several blood cell_types our model can successfully infer unob served cpg_methylation states from observations at the same sites in related cell_types correct and this approach more accurately reconstructs missing_data than imputation based on neighboring cpgs correct additionally the single cpg resolution of our methylation dynamics estimates enabled us to show that dna sequence_context of cpg_sites is informative about methylation dynamics across tissue_differentiation finally we identified genomic_regions with clusters of highly_dynamic cpgs and present a likely functional example our work establishes a framework for inference and modeling that is well suited to dna_methylation data and our success suggests that other methods for analyzing dna nucleotide_substitutions will also translate to the modeling of epigenetic phenomena availability_and source_code is available at www kostkalab net software contact dna_methylation is a common epigenetic_modification essential to organism development in vertebrates dna is most commonly methylated at the fifth carbon position on cytosine nucleotides mc that are followed by a guanine so_called cpg_sites a family of three dna_methyltransferase enzymes dnmt dnmt a dnmt b is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of methylation_state at the millions of cpg_sites in most mammalian_genomes recently the ability to perform genomewide assays of the methylation_state of individual cpgs has become a reality because of advances in microarray and dna_sequencing several approaches that vary in their accuracy biases coverage and cost are commonly used see laird for a detailed_review of current methods systematic_screening of dna_methylation across tissue_differentiation and development has improved our knowledge of its role in these processes the methylation profile of the mammalian_genome is largely stable but the methylation of specific_genomic changes dynamically across development and different cellular lineages have unique methylation profiles additionally the dna methylation_state nearby a genes transcription_start tss correlates with gene_expression and the correct orchestration of methylation changes is essential for proper cellular_differentiation aberrant_methylation changes may lead to tumorigenesis and other diseases studies assaying dna_methylation often focus on the comparison of two types of conditions like tumor versus normal_tissue or stem_cells versus lineage committed cells however the natural process of cellular_differentiation and development has an essentially tree like topology in which precursor cell_types are connected to their descendants by edges thereby forming a so_called lineage tree for example depicts a lineage tree for blood cell_differentiation where dna_methylation has been assayed in cell_types represented by nodes independent pairwise_comparisons cannot accommodate this structure to address_this we introduce an approach to model methylation_state changes between cell_types that explicitly takes dependencies induced by the lineage tree into account in this setup modeling methylation changes over developmental time is in many ways reminiscent of describing dna nucleotide changes over evolutionary time as a result we adapt established continuous_time models of sequence_evolution to fit this task in addition to accommodating cell_lineage relations during development our approach has the benefit that it works at single cpg_dinucleotide resolution and does not require the spatial aggregation of methylation measurements across the genome finally the analogy with models for dna sequence_evolution provides intuitive means to handle missing_data which are common in many dna_methylation datasets during parameter to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an

methylation states for unobserved data in context of the lineage tree as an illustration of our approach we analyzed methylation data collected across the cell_lineage tree infrom on this dataset our method enabled the accurate reconstruction of missing methylation states the single cpg resolution of our analysis allowed us to discover that the identity of neighboring dinucleotides is strongly correlated with cpg_methylation dynamics at many sites in the mouse_genome finally using our predictions of cpg_methylation variability we identified a cluster of highly_dynamic cpg_sites that show evidence of enhancer_activity in blood cells we applied our methylation dynamics model to an rrbs dataset tracing the differentiation of adult hscs this study queried a set of over million cpg_sites at different stages during blood lineage differentiation and the assayed cell_types with their relationships are summarized in the lineage tree in we fit a model with four rate categories three variable and one invariant to the discretized methylation status of cpg_sites along each chromosome section the maximum_likelihood of the model_parameters qualitatively agree across chromosomes and the resulting model is consistent with several previous_findings invariant cpg_sites are more prevalent than variable_sites of cpgs are invariant in our analysis and and fall into the slow medium and fast rate categories respectively as expected the equilibrium distribution for variable states favors methylated cpgs i e u p m for all chromosomes contrasting the dynamics at variable and invariant cpg_sites we find that invariant sites are most likely to remain unmethylated during differentiation whereas variable_sites are most likely to be in methylated states the branch_lengths obtained in our fitted models reflect the number of expected methylation state_transitions between cell_types and we see the longest branch_lengths between mep and ery cells and between hsc and mpp cells t and t averaged over chromosomes respectively these numbers correspond to an expected fraction of cpg_sites with observed methylation changes of for mep ery and of and for hsc mpp taking_into the prevalence of invariant sites and the different rate categories for variable_sites this is in qualitative agreement with previous i in this article we adapt phylogenetic markov_models which are prevalent in comparative_genomics and statistical genetics to accurately and efficiently analyze dna_methylation dynamics across lineage_specification as a proof_of we model rrbs methylation data collected from related stages of blood_cell using our model we illustrate that i cpg_site methylation status can be accurately reconstructed using data from related cell_types at the same site ii the single cpg_site resolution of our methylation dynamics estimates enable the discovery of attributes such as dna sequence_context that correlate with cpg_methylation dynamics and iii our models facilitate the identification of genomic_regions with highly_variable cpg_methylation states that are likely functional there are many additional methodologies that could be mapped from the rich reservoir of statistical genomics to the application of modeling methylation dynamics it will be exciting to see which will prove most useful as genome_wide data continue to be collected to elucidate tissue_differentiation and development for instance our analyses confirm that methylation dynamics are different between cpg_sites located in cpg islands and those elsewhere in the genome thus one way to extend our current approach would be to use different parameterizations based on such external annotations as is commonly done when modeling coding versus non coding_sequence in comparative_genomics further on such models could also be integrated in a hidden_markov hmm framework as in phylo hmms which could lead to genome segmentations that account for methylation dynamics an hmm framework has already proven useful in modeling the density of cpg_sites across a genome and defining cpg islands in section we demonstrated that progenitordescendant relationships in the lineage tree can be used to accurately_reconstruct the methylation status of cpg_sites in different cellular contexts average of accuracy these vertical relationships enabled more accurate reconstruction on the rrbs dataset analyzed here than using nearest genomic neighbors to predict missing_values however we note that there are many methods for reconstructing missing cpg_methylation status using genomic_information these methods have largely focused on cpgs in cpg islands but a recent approach used a random_forest to accurately_predict cpgmethylation from a methylation array based on a suite of features including neighboring cpg_methylation status and overlapping genomic_elements however the cpg coverage provided by methylation arrays and rrbs assays is different so it is difficult to directly compare the results of these methods on different datasets nonetheless our approach is complementary to existing_methods for reconstructing dna_methylation that use neighboring cpg_sites along the genome context dependent models that integrate such vertical i e progenitor to descendant and horizontal i e distance on chromosome relationships have the potential to further improve methods for reconstructing unobserved states and highlighting functionally_relevant shifts in methylation most existing_methods for analyzing dna_methylation dynamics are based on pairwise_comparisons of cellular contexts for example ziller et_al identify cpgs with large differences in their estimated methylation between pairs of tissues or cell_lines and then they cluster these to highlight differentially_methylated this type of pairwise_comparison is appropriate for much of the methylation data currently available but existing_methods are challenging to generalize to analysis of more densely sampled sets of dependent cell_types to address this our approach explicitly_models the existence of statistical_dependencies between methylation states from multiple related cell_types thus it enables multivariate_analyses of methylation patterns in differentiating cell_lineages like those from but it may not provide much improvement when analyzing essentially independent samples like distantly_related terminally_differentiated cell_types in addition our strategy is subject to the discretization of methylation status in a population of cells into discrete methylation states the three states and the thresholds we use are supported by the distribution of methylation_values in our data but including direct modeling of counts of methylated versus unmethylated instances of a cpg_site into our approach is a promising future direction dna_methylation is just one of several dynamic epigenetic biochemical modifications regulating precise spatiotemporal gene_expression that are essential for proper development the approach we have demonstrated here provides an integrative multivariate framework for modeling any epigenetic changes across multiple cell_types and lineages as phylogenetic_models proved essential in the identification and interpretation of functional dna sequence_regions we believe that lineage treeaware markov_models of epigenetic dynamics can play a similar role in developing a deeper_understanding of epigenetic phenomena and their roles in tissue_differentiation and vertebrate_development
