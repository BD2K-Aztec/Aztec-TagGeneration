data_and simdef definition based semantic_similarity measure of gene_ontology for functional_similarity analysis of genes motivation measures of protein functional_similarity are essential tools for function prediction evaluation of proteinprotein_interactions ppis and other applications several existing_methods perform comparisons between proteins based on the semantic_similarity of their go terms however these measures are highly_sensitive to modifications in the topological_structure of go tend to be focused on specific analytical tasks and concentrate on the go terms themselves rather than considering their textual definitions results we introduce simdef an efficient method for measuring semantic_similarity of go terms using their go definitions which is based on the gloss vector measure commonly used in natural_language the simdef approach builds optimized definition vectors for all relevant go terms and expresses the similarity of a pair of proteins as the cosine of the angle between their definition vectors relative to existing similarity_measures when validated on a yeast reference_database simdef improves correlation with sequence_homology by up to shows a correlation improvement with gene_expression in the biological_process hierarchy of go and increases ppi predictability by in f score for molecular_function hierarchy availability_and datasets results and source_code are available atgene ontology go describes the attributes of genes and gene_products using a structured vocabulary many biomedical databases such as uniprot and swissprot are annotated by go terms to communicate semantic meanings of biomedical entities computing functional_similarity of biomedical entities has been applied to problems such as prediction of proteinprotein_interaction ppi gene_expression studies and homology analysis also in the context of text_mining various studies have aimed to enhance the literature based go annotation of gene_products there are two main computational_models available to measure similarity of terms ontology_based models take advantage of lexical structures in their estimation of term similarity edge based ontology measures like wu and rss consider the number of edges along the paths that link two go terms node based measures which we designate as grasm and aic compare the properties of the terms augmented with the properties of their ancestors or descendants ic vectors represent ic_values in distributed forms in the computation of semantic_similarity hybrid measures such as those of liu et_al and hrss combine node based and edge based measures while these measures first compute semantic_similarity of two gene_products and then aggregate the results as a single functional_similarity value group wise measures such as simui simgic and sora calculate similarity by measuring two sets of go terms annotating these genes also proposed a similarity measure where gene_functional is based on vector representations of their go terms ontology_based measures suffer from three important_limitations first they depend on the constantly_changing topological_structure of go second they use incomplete go annotations to compute statistical_information and third they offer no guarantee of generalization to multiple biological tasks distributional based_approaches derive from firths idea that a term is characterized by the company it keeps in its context measures following this notion calculate terms specifications from relevant text data and represent them in a vector space for subsequent computation of their similarities the gloss vector semantic relatedness measure is a distributional based_approach with a wide_application in natural_language this measure constructs definitions glosses of terms from a predefined thesaurus and estimates semantic relatedness of two terms as the cosine of the angle between those terms gloss vectors interpolation of content words of a text corpus into the terms definition was shown to outperform the direct definition comparison gloss vectors offer a new opportunity to exploit the information of go term definitions and to infer gene_functional successfully_applied the gloss vector measure to the biomedical_domain using medline as the text corpus and the unified_medical and wordnet for the construction of extended definitions of medical concepts the gloss vector approach_requires a frequency cut_off in selecting the best features describing one term we have developed simdef an optimized version of the gloss vector targeted to analysis of gene_functions here by using medline as the text corpus we compare the performance of simdef with other leading approaches and demonstrate its effectiveness using comparisons based on sequence_homology gene_expression and ppi data our approach to similarity estimation based on shared context makes intuitive sense as concepts which share closely_related attributes in their representation should exhibit high levels of similarity we have shown that implementing these ideas via the gloss vector representation yields improved effectiveness across the majority of ontologies and problem types for the yeast database simdef increases the correlation of semantic_similarity with sequence_homology by yields an increase of in correlation with gene_expression on the bp ontology and improves the ppi prediction f score by on the mf ontology a key_advantage of simdef in comparison with ic based measures is its reduced dependency on annotation data and the go structure new go terms typically do not have rich annotation_information which can influence the ic calculation of all go terms as they depend on the root frequency which itself depends on all go term frequencies in contrast simdef needs to access only the direct parents and children of one go term to expand that go terms definition in future work simdef can be evaluated against enzyme commission ec and protein_family pfam similarities gene clustering and orthologous protein distinguishing tasks present yet another opportunity for simdef performance evaluation simdef needs to be tested on the other species than s cerevisiae as well moreover other statistical_measures of association such as chisquare and log lokelihood can be examined in replacement of pmi for further improvement of simdef more in depth studies can also find out if using larger window sizes of bigrams or even tri grams in the word extraction of medline_abstracts would improve the achieved results also current advancement in deep neural_networks for the low_dimensional yet more accurate representation of go terms leaves room for further investigation of semantic_similarity in the distributional model
