genetics_and tcsbu a tool to extend tcs network layout and visualization motivation tcs is a widely used haplotype network_reconstruction software but lacks the capability of overlapping genetic with geographic structure which is often a first step in phylogeographic analysis results tcsbu is a web_based program that extends the capabilities of tcs by implementing haplotype classification into an arbitrary user_defined scheme which is displayed as pie chart like graphs embedded into the network taking_advantage of modern graphic libraries tcsbu also improves the speed at which the final network layout is reached networks can be saved as a scalable_vector format availability_and tcsbu is available on line atconstruction of haplotype networks that represent genealogical relationships among genes at the population level is often a first step of any phylogeographic analysis because gene genealogies are usually polytomous and network like traditional tree building methods which force dichotomous branching patterns are seldom applicable different methods were developed to overcome such problems e g among these tcs is unique in that it implements the probabilistic_method of statistical parsimony this allows users to arbitrarily define the probability at which haplotypes connect with each other which may yield multiple_networks per analysis this feature has been suggested as a species_delimitation tool in barcoding analysis although the core tcs algorithm network computation is fast there are some major limitations related with its graphical output in most phylogeographic analyses it is often useful to combine genetic_structure network_topology with geographic structure haplotype occurrence but tcs has no built in way of classifying haplotypes and displaying that information in the final network tcs cannot use its spring method to layout multiple_networks meaning that the resulting overlapped networks should to be disentangled manually using an external vector manipulation software moreover the spring method is extremely slow to layout large or complex_networks as a consequence it takes a significant effort to edit the resulting tcs vector file to produce publication ready networks tcsbu extends tcs capabilities and speeds up the production of publication ready networks resulting from tcs analysis source_code is freely_available from github and improvements bug fixes are welcome
