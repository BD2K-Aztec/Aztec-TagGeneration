gene_expression rseqtools a modular framework to analyze rna_seq using compact anonymized data summaries the advent_of for functional_genomics has given rise to quantities of sequence_information that are often so large that they are difficult to handle moreover sequence_reads from a specific individual can contain sufficient information to potentially identify and genetically characterize that person raising privacy_concerns in order to address_these we have developed the mapped read format mrf a compact data summary format for both short and long read_alignments that enables the anonymization of confidential sequence_information while allowing one to still carry out many functional_genomics studies we have developed a suite of tools rseqtools that use this format for the analysis of rna_seq experiments these tools consist of a set of modules that perform common tasks such as calculating gene_expression values generating signal tracks of mapped_reads and segmenting that signal into actively_transcribed regions moreover the tools can readily be used to build customizable rna_seq workflows in addition to the anonymization afforded by mrf this format also facilitates the decoupling of the alignment of reads from downstream_analyses availability_and rseqtools is implemented in c and the source_code is available at http rseqtools the advent_of technologies has revolutionized the study of genomes and transcriptomes in particular the application of deep sequencing_approaches to transcriptome_profiling rna_seq is increasingly becoming the method of choice for studying the transcriptional landscape of cells typically the first step in this analysis is the alignment of thethe resulting mrf files can be divided in two files one with the alignment only and another with the corresponding sequence_reads the read identifiers provide a mapping between the two files then several modules perform the downstream_analyses independently from the mapping step such as expression quantification visualization of the mapped read and the calculation of annotation statistics etc other tools have been developed based on this framework to perform more sophisticated analyses such as transcript assembly isoform quantification iqseq http rnaseq gersteinlab org iqseq fusion_transcript identification fusionseq http rnaseq gersteinlab org fusionseq as well as aggregation and correlation of signal tracks act http act gersteinlab org
