sequence_analysis mirtcat a comprehensive map of human and mouse microrna target_sites including non canonical nucleation bulges micrornas mirnas regulate various biological_functions by binding hundreds of transcripts to impart post transcriptional_repression recently by applying a transcriptome_wide experimental method for identifying mirna_target ago hits_clip a novel non canonical target_site named nucleation bulge was discovered as widespread functional and evolutionally conserved although such non canonical nucleation bulges have been proven to be predictive by using pivot pairing rule and sequence_conservation this approach has not been applied yet to facilitate the functional studies of non canonical mirna_targets we implement mirtcat a comprehensive searchable map of mirna_target including non canonical nucle ation bulges not only mapped in experimentally_verified mirna bound regions but also predicted in all untranslated_regions utrs derived from human and mouse as expected false_positive micrornas mirnas are small rna_molecules nt that induce post transcriptional_repression of messenger_rnas mrnas affecting various biological phenotypes animal mirnas typically recognize mrna_targets through imperfect matches making the problem of predicting mirna_target challenging among these partial pairings it is well known that mirnas bind canonical mirna_target through short consecutive pairings with their seed regions position called seed pairing rule besides sequence complementarity evolutional conservation has been considered improving the performance of mirna_target predictions however a critical caveat of all seed centric approaches is its inability to identify non canonical mirna_target overlooking priori recognized non canonical target_sites validated as functionally_important recently by applying cross_linking immunoprecipitation method clip coupled with high_throughput hits to a protein called argonaute ago hits_clip all mirna binding regions in target_mrnas were experimentally mapped in high_resolution however not all mirna bound regions could be explained by the canonical seed pairing rule implicating existence of non canonical mirnatarget interactions by performing bioinformatic_analyses in such orphan regions non canonical sites called nucleation bulges were identified and validated as widespread functional and evolutionally conserved non canonical nucleation bulge sites are predictable as the mode of their interactions is generalized by pivot pairing rule dictating a nucleotide in bulge position and to be competent to pair with a nucleotide in position six of a mirna named pivot to confer the thermodynamic_stability on consecutive five base_pairings position supplementary such initial five base_pairings are proposed to be served as nuclei of interactions nucleation followed by bulge formation where originally matched pivot nucleotide in position six becomes bulged out and propagating hybridization toward end of the mirna however such a rule_based on a pivot pairing has not been applied for mirna_target yet to offer opportunities of studying non canonical mirna_targets here we describe mirna_target maps specialized for nucleation bulge sites named mirtcat mirtcat provides comprehensive maps searchable for mirna_target including non canonical nucleation bulges of which locations are not only predicted in all untranslated_regions utrs annotated by refseq in human and mouse but also mapped in mirna bound regions that are experimentally_verified such functionalities will aid to generate hypothesis starting from interactions between mirna and non canonical targets as previously_reported nucleation bulge sites have propensity to be more conserved in mirna bound regionsthis notion we examine the performance of mirtcat depending on the level of conservation by using experimentally_identified mirna bound regions determine default cut_offs pcs for both sites and estimate the false_positive for seed matches and for nucleation bulges and supplementaryd validation analysis using experiment datasets of mirna dependant repression shows that transcripts identified by mirtcat pcs are more significantly_downregulated than the targets found by simple seed matching p and supplementary furthermore mirtcat is estimated to outperform in sensitivity fold increase with comparable precision with other prediction_methods and supplementary overall mirtcat offers comprehensive mappings with increased number of target_sites by identifying non canonical nucleation bulges predicting bona_fide sites nucleation bulges mers comparable with mer seed sites in human utrs and mapping sites nucleation bulges mer seed sites in all compiled data from experimentally_identified mirna bound regions
