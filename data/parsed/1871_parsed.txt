genetics_and forqs forward in time simulation of recombination quantitative_traits and selection forqs is a forward in time simulation of recombination quantitative_traits and selection it was designed to investigate haplo type patterns resulting from scenarios where substantial evolutionary_change has taken place in a small number of generations due to recombination and or selection on polygenic quantitative_traits availability_and forqs is implemented as a command_line c program source_code and binary executables for linux osx and windows are freely_available under a permissive bsd_license https bitbucket org dkessner forqs simulations have a long history in population_genetics both for verifying analytical results and for exploring population models that are mathematically intractable population_genetics simulations can be broadly classified as forward in time e g wrightfisher or backward in time e g coalescent coalescent simulations e g ms macs fastsimcoal are efficient for simulating neutral sequence_data because they only need to track lineages that are ancestral to the sample although it is possible to simulate certain selection scenarios within the coalescent framework one must turn to forward in time simulations to model_selection in a flexible way many forward in time simulators are currently available most of these simulators use a mutation centric approach implemented by storing the mutations carried by individuals in an array to handle selection the majority of these simulators assign selection coefficients to individual mutations e g forwsim fregene genomepop carvajal sfs code treesimj o slim although a few also include support for quantitative_traits e g forsim quantinemo simupop are recent_reviews providing a comprehensive comparison of these and other simulators in many scenarios of biological interest substantial evolutionary_change has taken place in a small number of generations due to recombination and or selection on standing variation rather than mutational input for example one may be interested in the genome_wide haplotype patterns that emerge from admixture between historically isolated populations or from artificial selection on a quantitative_trait studying these haplotype patterns can be difficult with existing forward in time simulators because detailed information about the mosaic haplotype_structure of individuals is not readily available and must be inferred from the output sequences of the simulation and or stored recombination event data in addition forward in time simulators that store entire sequences incur a severe trade_off between the size of the genomic_regions and the size of the populations simulated motivated by such examples we have implemented a new forward in time simulation approach that instead of tracking single site variants tracks individual haplotype chunks as they recombine over multiple_generations further we have designed the simulator for fast simulation of quantitative_traits under selection we have labeled this software forqs forward in time simulation of recombination quantitative_traits and selection similar approaches have been implemented recently byand byfor the simple selection models with per mutation fitness_effects the haplotype_based design allows for fast simulation of whole genomes with efficient memory_usage for example forqs can easily simulate two populations size each selected for different optimal trait_values where individuals have human sized genomes chromosome pairs mb each taking s generation for comparison existing forward simulators are limited by the amount of sequence that can be stored in arrays in memory for the aforementioned individuals gb of memory would permit the storage of only million base_pairs of sequence per individual which is an order_of than the smallest human_chromosome the forqs design also preserves information about the haplotype_structure of individuals which allows for immediate identification of genomic_regions where individuals share identical by descent haplotype tracts our simulator uses a modular_architecture to allow the user to flexibly specify recombination maps mutation_rates demographic models quantitative_traits and fitness functions this modular approach_facilitates simulation of complicated scenarios and investigation of the resulting haplotype patterns forqs is currently under active development to support ongoing projects to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by this is an open_access the terms of the creative commons attribution license http creativecommons org licenses by which_permits distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original_work
