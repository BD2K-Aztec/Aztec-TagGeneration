bamview viewing mapped read_alignment data in the context of the reference_sequence bamview is an interactive java_application for visualizing the large_amounts of data stored for sequence_reads which are aligned against a reference genome_sequence it supports the bam binary alignment map format it can be used in a number of contexts including snp_calling and structural annotation bamview has also been integrated into artemis so that the reads can be viewed in the context of the nucleotide_sequence and genomic_features availability bamview and artemis are freely_available under a gpl licence for download for macosx unix and windows at http bamview sourceforge net second generation sequencing produces large volumes of short_read in common applications of the technology such as resequencing or transcriptome_sequencing reads are mapped against a reference_genome in many cases bases in a reference are covered with alignment depths varying by orders_of and therefore present a challenge for visualization sam sequence_alignment and bam binary alignment map formats are emerging as a standard representation for read_alignments it is therefore important to have visualization software for this format bam_files contain the same information as sam as bam format is compressed it provides an efficient means to store the data and enables fast retrieval of regions and so this format has been adopted here samtools includes a very simple text alignment viewer using the gnu ncurses library giving a detailed view at the nucleotide_resolution level lookseq is a perl cgi application used to display in a web_browser reads_mapped against a reference it can read the data either directly from bam_files or from a relational_database to display reads and plots paired_read positions against their inferred size alignment tools can be used to produce bam format files for instance ssaha now supports sam format and maq output can be converted to sam bam using samtools bamview can be used as a stand alone java_application or displayed in artemis in conjunction with the reference_sequence and annotation to whom correspondence should be addressed b artemis is a freely_available genome_browser and annotation tool bamview in artemis provides the annotator with an extra level of information that can inform them about structural annotation bamview not only displays the lookseq type of view plotting against the paired_reads inferred size but also has other types of views that are described below it does not require a web_server and reads the data from an indexed bam_file
