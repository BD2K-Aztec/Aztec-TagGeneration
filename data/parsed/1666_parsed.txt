structural_bioinformatics evolutionary solution for the rna design problem motivation rnas play fundamental roles in cellular_processes the function of an rna is highly dependent on its d conformation which is referred to as the rna tertiary_structure because the prediction or experimental determination of these structures is difficult so many works focus on the problems associated with the rna_secondary here we consider the rna_inverse in which an rna_secondary is given as a target structure and the goal is to design an rna_sequence that folds into the target structure in this article we introduce a new evolutionary algorithm for the rna_inverse our algorithm entitled evolutionary rna design generates a sequence whose minimum_free is the same as the target structure results we compare our algorithm with info rna modena rnaifold and nupack approaches for some biological test_sets the results presented in this article indicate that for longer structures our algorithm performs better than the other mentioned algorithms in terms of the energy_range accuracy speedup and nucleotide distribution particularly the generated rna_sequences in our method are much more reliable and similar to the natural rna_sequences availability_and the web_server and source_code are available atrnas perform a wide_range of functions in biological_systems the functional_form of rna frequently requires a specific tertiary_structure the scaffold for this structure is provided by secondary_structural that are hydrogen_bonds within the molecule therefore the study and the analysis of rna_secondary are crucial to understanding their functional_roles in this sense it is of great interest to propose computational_techniques for predicting the rna_secondary most of the existing computational_approaches are based on thermodynamic models that predict the rna_secondary with the minimum_free value several other approaches are introduced based on maximizing the ensemble probability of the predicted rna_secondary an important problem in the rna research area is the rna_inverse in which the secondary_structure of an rna is given and the goal is to find a proper sequence that folds into the given structure the rna_inverse can be used to design non_coding which are involved in gene_regulation chromosome replication and rna_modification the designed sequences are also applicable to construct ribozymes and riboswitches which may be used as drugs and therapeutic_agents in research or for building self assembling structures from small rna_molecules in nanobiotechnology in the rna_inverse there are exponential number of sequences to be considered as candidates for the solution it is also suggested that the rna_inverse may be np_hard i e finding an exact global solution would require exponential time therefore the heuristic search_methods are widely used to address this problem rnainverse available as a part of the vienna rna package is an original approach to solve this problem this algorithm uses a distance score to measure the distance between the structure of the designed sequence and the target structure the goal of this algorithm is to minimize the distance score as well as to maximize the probability of folding the designed sequence into the target structure when the distance score is the algorithm ends and the generated sequence is returned the second algorithm entitled rna_secondary designer rna ssd tries to minimize the structural distance via recursive stochastic local_search proposed another algorithm based on dynamic_programming and local_search called inforna this algorithm consists of two steps in the first step it generates an initial sequence using dynamic_programming in the second step it uses a stochastic local_search method to improve the quality of the initial sequence genetic_algorithm is also used to solve the rna_inverse both for rna_secondary and pseudoknotted structures introduced a new method to whom correspondence should be addressed based on a genetic_algorithm entitled frnakenstein which is implemented in python this method allows multiple structures to be specified as target and has a variety of schemes for choosing mutation and recombination operations or defining fitness and objective_functions the newest version of this method allows pseudoknotted structures to be specified as target or sequence_motifs as input contains parallelization and includes improved searching heuristics as well as multiple folding paradigms used a dynamic_programming nupack for designing the rna_sequence that is intended to adopt a target secondary_structure at equilibrium in this method the sequence design problem is considered as an optimization_problem with the goal of reducing the ensemble defect the ensemble defect for a sequence and a target secondary_structure is the average number of incorrectly paired nucleotides at equilibrium evaluated over the ensemble of secondary_structures recently a constraint programming approach entitled rnaifold was presented to solve the rna_inverse this approach allows a wide_range of design constraints to be specified it also introduces a large neighborhood search approach that allows larger instances at the cost of losing completeness while retaining the advantages of meeting design constraints motif gc_content etc it should be mentioned that the existing_methods use a folding algorithm for evaluating and improving the accuracy and the quality of the generated sequences it is well known that the fold method of the vienna rna package requires on operations thus using this algorithm over the whole sequence increases the overall running time to resolve this problem some structural decomposition schemes have been used in the previous_studies to reduce the impact of the fold method in this article a different decomposition scheme is also used to produce the smaller sub structures and a new method based on evolutionary algorithms is presented to recursively solve and combine the obtained sub structures our evolutionary algorithm designs an rna_sequence that folds into a given target structure any rna_secondary contains different structural_components each having a different length therefore we first reconstruct rna sub sequences pools corresponding to different components with different lengths using the pools we reconstruct an initial rna_sequence that is compatible in which the base_pairs are canonical with the given target structure then we use an evolutionary algorithm to improve the quality of the sub sequences corresponding to the components the major_contributions of our algorithm are using the natural rna_sequences a different method for evaluating the sequences in each population and a different hierarchical decomposition of the target structure into smaller sub structures the rest of this article is organized as follows in section the details of our approach are presented section represents the results of our approach and the others as well as the comparisons finally the conclusion is presented in section to test the accuracy and reliability of our algorithm we use two different datasets the first one is the dataset that is used in dataset a this dataset contains sequences with length between and nt the structures of these sequences are determined by rnafold and they are used as target structures in our comparison the second dataset is chosen from taneda which contains structures with length between and nt dataset b the existence of large loops in the structures of this dataset makes_it to design rna_sequences we compare our algorithm with four other approaches namely info rna modena rnaifold and nupack different measures are used in our comparison as presented in the following subsections all the results are obtained by a computer with core duo ghz cpu having gb of memory and running linux ubuntu as the operating system the vienna rna package version along with the turner free_energy parameters is used in all approaches among these approaches nupack is the only one that uses the ensemble defect as afitness function where the threshold value is considered for generating the results the constraint programming version of rnaifold is used without any constraint default mode also in modena the default_parameters for both population_size and iterations are used in this article a new evolutionary algorithm is proposed for solving the rna_inverse our algorithm is composed of several steps to design a reliable rna_sequence the results presented in this article indicate that for longer structures our algorithm performs better than the other mentioned algorithms in terms of accuracy speedup and nucleotide distribution also the produced energy ranges of our algorithm are comparable with those produced by modena therefore our method could generate much more reliable sequences that have diverse stability in terms of energy_range and are more similar to the natural rna_sequences although gc base_pairs are energetically most favorable the sequences generated by erd do not have a high_gc in the future it is desirable to introduce sequence constraints in erd to control the gc_content and consequently the stability and the energy_range of the designed sequence
