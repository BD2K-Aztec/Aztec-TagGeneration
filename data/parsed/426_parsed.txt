structural_bioinformatics apollo a quality_assessment service for single and multiple protein models we built a web_server named apollo which can evaluate the absolute global and local qualities of a single protein model using machine_learning or the global and local qualities of a pool of models using a pair_wise comparison approach based on our evaluations on casp critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure targets the predicted quality_scores generated from our machine_learning and pair_wise methods have an average per target correlation of and respectively with the true model quality_scores based on our test on casp_targets our predicted absolute local qualities have an average difference of with the actual distances to native_structure protein model_quality plays an important role in protein_structure and application assessing the quality of protein models is essential for ranking models refining models and using models model_quality programs mqaps predict model qualities from two perspectives the global quality of the entire model and the residue specific local qualities the techniques often used by mqaps include multiple model clustering_methods single model methods and hybrid methods according to the casp experiments multiple model clustering_methods are currently more accurate than single model methods however they cannot work well if only a small number of models are available a hybrid quality_assessment method was recently_developed to combine the two approaches and integrate their respective strengths here we build a web_server to provide the community with access to all three model_quality approaches i e single clustering and hybrid to whom correspondence should be addressed we assessed most of the methods used by apollo on valid casp_targets we downloaded all the casp models from casp http predictioncenter org download area casp and the experimental_structures from the pdb these pdb files were preprocessed in order to select correct chains and residues that match the casp target_sequences tm_score was used to align each model with the corresponding native_structure and generate its real quality_score gdt ts the casp qa predictions made by our methods were evaluated against the actual quality_scores by four criteria average per target correlation the average sum of the gdt ts scores of the top one ranked models the overall correlation on all targets and the average loss the difference in gdt ts score between the top_ranked model and the best model the results show that the average correlation can be as high as respectively and the average loss can be as low as respectively for multiple model respectively single model our multipleand single model global qa methods were ranked among the most accurate qa methods of their respective kind according to the casp official assessment http www predictioncenter org casp doc presentations casp qa pdf the average per target correlation of our pair_wise local quality predictions is which is also among the top local quality predictors in casp we alsoconducted a blind_test of the absolute local quality predictor trained on the casp dataset on the casp models of casp single_domain on the residues whose actual distances to the native are and the average absolute_difference between our predicted distances and the actual distances is and respectively
