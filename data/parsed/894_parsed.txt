cd_hit suite a web_server for clustering and comparing biological_sequences cd_hit is a widely used program for clustering and comparing large biological sequence_datasets in order to further assist the cd_hit users we significantly_improved this program with more functions and better accuracy scalability and flexibility most importantly we developed a new web_server cd_hit suite for clustering a user uploaded sequence_dataset or comparing it to another dataset at different identity levels users can now interactively explore the clusters within web_browsers we also provide downloadable clusters for several public_databases ncbi nr swissprot and pdb at different identity levels availability free access at http cd_hit orgthe size of the biological sequence_databases is rapidly_growing due to large_scale genome_projects and the emerging field of metagenomics new sequencing_technologies are now producing sequence_data at a very high rate and this has created a greater need for bioinformatics_tools to effectively organize and analyze the data fortunately biological_sequences are related and may share homology and thus clustering these sequences into groups and finding a representative or a consensus for each group are practical ways to solve the sequence_analysis problems our previous_works introduced cd_hit based on short word filtering and a greedy incremental clustering_algorithm to cluster and compare large biological sequence_datasets one advantage of cd_hit is its ultrahigh speed and the ability to handle large_datasets since its release cd_hit has been widely used by many groups in various fields including uniref smart and metagenome data analyses in the last few years we have been continuously improving this program with more functions and better accuracy scalability and flexibility we also implemented a new web_server to allow to whom correspondence should be addressed present_address department of medicine university of california san_diego la jolla ca usa users to cluster or compare sequences without installing and executing the command_line version of cd_hit locally the server provides interactive interface and additional visualization_tools it also provides precalculated and regularly updated sequence clusters for several widely used databases including ncbi nr swissprot and pdb cd_hit has been significantly_improved from our previous work cd_hit suite provides users with a friendly web_interface to perform biological sequence_clustering and comparison with additional visualization_tools it also provides precalculated clusters for several public sequence_databases which are regularly updated
