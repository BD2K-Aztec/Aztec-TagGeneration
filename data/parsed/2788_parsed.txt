mango a bias correcting chia_pet analysis_pipeline motivation chromatin_interaction analysis by paired_end tag sequencing chia_pet is an established method for detecting genome_wide looping interactions at high_resolution current chia_pet analysis software_packages either fail to correct for non specific interactions due to genomic proximity or only address a fraction of the steps_required for data_processing we present mango a complete chia_pet data analysis_pipeline that provides statistical confidence estimates for interactions and corrects for major sources of bias including differential peak enrichment and genomic proximity results comparison to the existing software_packages chia_pet tool and chiasig revealed that mango interactions exhibit much better agreement with high_resolution hi c data importantly mango executes all steps_required for processing chia_pet datasets whereas chiasig only completes of the required steps application of mango to multiple available chia_pet datasets permitted the independent rediscovery of known trends in chromatin_loops including enrichment of ctcf rad smc and znf at the anchor regions of interactions and strong bias for conver gent ctcf motifs availability_and mango is open_source and distributed through github at https github com dphansti mango increasing evidence suggests that the three_dimensional structure of mammalian chromatin plays an important role in regulating gene_expression and biological_function g nd r and to study chromatin_structure multiple high_throughput based assays have been developed including c c c hi c and the newest addition chromatin_interaction analysis by paired_end tag sequencing chia_pet though the methods differ in scope and resolution they all share the same basic steps including cross_linking native chromatin ligating interacting fragments and sequencing chimeric dna_fragments to assess interaction frequency informatic analysis of the resulting data then entails identifying which pairs of loci exhibit more interactions than expected by random chance it has been well established by c fish and hi c studies that pairs of genomic_loci exhibit random polymer like behavior in which genomic interaction frequencies decrease as a function of genomic_distance supplementaryand b therefore it is critical that software_designed to detect interactions between pairs of loci must consider and accurately model the expected interaction frequency of pairs of loci given linear genomic_distance indeed most if not all availablesoftware packages to identify interactions from c and hi c datasets do consider genomic_distance in the null_model furthermore chia_pet has the unique property of specifically enriching for loci bound by a specific protein as these regions are bound at different affinities throughout the genome the depth of coverage at interacting peaks must be considered in any analysis paradigm several analysis methods exist to process chia_pet data however these methods either fail to address the major sources of bias or require the user to write a large portion of the analysis code themselves rendering them unusable for many wet_lab biologists chia_pet tool cpt was the first software to address the unique problems associated with chia_pet data and has established an effective workflow for data_processing the authors of cpt employ both random_sampling and statistical_methods to filter out noise due to random ligations that occur in solution rather than in vivo however cpt fails to address the most common source of bias in c based techniques non specific interactions due to linear genomic_distance i e the random polymer effect cpt uses the hypergeometric_distribution to assess significance of interactions this model assumes that any two genomic_loci are equally likely to be linked by a pet regardless of genomic_distance therefore in addition to detecting true looping interactions this approach is likely to detect a large_number that exhibit nonrandom interaction frequencies due to genomic proximity rather than genomic looping indeed a recent study revealed that interactions determined by cpt showed poor agreement with highresolution hi c datasets in addition cpt is extremely_difficult to install as it requires a very specific os configuration including a complex array of programming_languages and environments including c perl python r mysql apache web_server and php recently paulsen et_al described a novel method to process chia_pet data that does consider genomic_distance in the null_model this method chiasig uses the non central hypergeometric to identify statistically_significant interactions paulsen bn as expected this method identifies far fewer interactions than cpt while this approach yields accurate interactions the software only executes the very final step in chia_pet data analysis interaction scoring therefore users must write their own software to find and remove linker sequences align pets remove duplicates call peaks group pets into interactions and determine the lower_bound cutoff for pet distances as such this software is only useful to researchers with significant programming_skills other software_packages have been described but either are not publicly_available or have similar limitations to cpt and chiasig to address these shortcomings we introduce mango an open_source chia_pet data analysis_pipeline mango models the likelihood of interactions between genomic_loci as a function of both distance and peak depth and uses this model to assign statistical confidence to interactions this software is simple to install requires only fastq_files as input and completes all steps_required to analyze chia_pet datasets with only a single command to evaluate the applicability of mango we compared the interactions determined by mango chiasig and cpt for three publicly_available chia_pet datasets we demonstrate that interactions detected by mango show better agreement with recently_published high_resolution hi c data and independently recapitulate several recently_discovered characteristics of long_range first the anchor regions of interactions detected by mango were strongly enriched for the proteins ctcf rad smc and znf with between and of anchor regions overlapping a ctcf binding_site second the majority to of interactions linked two loci that harbored ctcf motifs that had a convergent orientation here we describe mango a chia_pet data analysis_pipeline that corrects for non specific interactions as a function of genomic proximity and peak depth we demonstrate that mango exhibits increased accuracy compared with both cpt the only existing chia_pet analysis_pipeline and chiasig a software_package that provides statistical confidence estimates for chia_pet interactions application of mango to multiple chia_pet datasets allowed for the independent_replication of findings regarding the nature of d chromatin_loops including strong enrichment for ctcf binding_sites with inward oriented motifs in addition to improved accuracy one of the key benefits of mango is usability mango was designed to be usable by all researchers even those with minimal computer competency mango is easily installed and completes all steps from fastq to interactions with a single command it relies on only four widely used and easily installed software_packages in contrast cpt requires a very specific os configuration including a complex array of programming_languages and environments including c perl python r mysql apache web_server and php and is accompanied by a seven page installation guide chiasig can be installed easily yet only performs a single step required for the analysis of chia_pet data users are therefore required to write their own code to perform the majority of processing_steps including linker parsing read_alignment duplicate removal peak_calling and distance filtering the software presented here improves upon methods used in our previous work most notably mango replaces the computationally_expensive distance matched rewiring method with a simple and robust bayesian_approach because of improvements in ease of use and accuracy mango will drastically improve our ability to uncover the characteristics and function of d chromatin_structure through the analysis of chia_pet datasets
