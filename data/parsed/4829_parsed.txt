bioinformatics_discovery using the plurality of codon positions to identify deleterious variants in human exomes motivation a codon position could perform different or multiple_roles in alternative transcripts of a gene for instance a non synonymous position in one transcript could be a synonymous site in another alternatively a position could remain as non synonymous in multiple_transcripts here we examined the impact of codon position plurality on the frequency of deleterious single_nucleotide snvs using data from human exomes results our results showed that the proportion of deleterious snvs was more than fold_higher in positions that remain non synonymous in multiple_transcripts compared with that observed in positions that are non synonymous in one or some transcript s and synonymous or intronic in other s furthermore we observed a positive relationship between the fraction of deleterious non synonymous snvs and the number of proteins alternative_splice affected these results demonstrate that the plurality of codon positions is an important attribute which could be useful in identifying mutations associated with diseases a major task in clinical genomics is to identify mutations associated with human_diseases a number of computational_prediction have been developed in the recent_past to detect these deleterious_mutations and to distinguish them from benign population polymorphisms most of these methods examined the long_term evolutionary consequences of a mutation using the multiple_sequence of human and other species these methods predicted that mutations occurring in evolutionarily_conserved positions are likely to be deleterious and hence have the potential to be associated with human_diseases some of these methods evaluated the functional consequences of a mutation as well these methods proposed that mutations occurring in critical positions of a protein such as a substrate_binding or a splice_site are likely to be deleterious as they disrupt the function and or structure of a protein or mrna furthermore these methods suggested that mutations that result in changes between dissimilar amino_acids are more deleterious than those between similar amino_acids however unlike conservation based_methods these methods are applicable only to protein_coding nevertheless these function based_methods have immense use in clinical genomics because almost of the disease associated mutations were found to be located in protein_coding using conservation as well as function based_methods recent_studies revealed an abundance of deleterious amino_acid polymorphisms in human exomes although these methods are useful in predicting deleterious variants additional methods are still required to improve the accuracy of finding them for this purpose it is important to examine the possibility of using various genomic_features in this study we focused on the roles of a position in human proteincoding_genes a codon position could perform different and or multiple_roles in alternate transcripts of a gene for instance a non synonymous position in one transcript could be a synonymous or intronic position in another on the other hand a site could remain non synonymous in multiple_transcripts it is not clear how this site plurality influences the frequency of occurrence of deleterious single_nucleotide snvs furthermore it is interesting to examine the relationship between the frequency of deleterious non synonymous snvs and the number of proteins alternative_splice affected the availability of large exome datasets has enabled us to address_these
