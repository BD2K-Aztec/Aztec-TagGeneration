databases_and ontocat an r package for ontology traversal and search motivation there exist few simple and easily_accessible methods to integrate ontologies programmatically in the r environment we present ontocatan r package to access ontologies in widely used standard formats stored locally in the filesystem or available online the ontocat package supports a number of traversal and search functions on a single ontology as well as searching for ontology_terms across multiple ontologies and in major ontology repositories availability the package and sources are freely_available in bioconductor starting from version the r package ontocat was created to support basic operations on ontologies traversal and search uniform access to ontologies in owl and obo formats and to provide r access to major ontology repositories ols and bioportal several hundreds of public ontologies and numerous private ontologies for describing biological data exist today using ontologies in r is difficult due to the lack of uniform package support at the same time numerous java_based ontology projects are available ontocat takes_advantage of a standard java_library with the same name ontocat to implement its functionality the ontocat package bullet gives unified format independent access to ontology_terms and the ontology hierarchy represented in owl and obo formats bullet provides basic methods for ontology traversal such as searching for terms listing a specific terms relations showing paths to the term from the root element of the ontology showing flattened tree representations of the ontology hierarchy and bullet supports working with groups of ontologies and with major public ontology repositories searching for terms across to whom correspondence should be addressed ontologies listing available ontologies and loading ontologies for further analysis as necessary no other package with similar functionality exists at the moment in the r environment the integration of the above functionality into r allows combining and automating ontology related_tasks different examples of ontology related_tasks that can be accomplished with the help of the ontocat package are given in the package documentation http www ontocat org wiki ontocatguide gene enrichment test and grouping of results search and re annotation of free_text to ontology and operations with relationships ontocat has been included into bioconductor the main r open_source project in bioinformatics ontocat has been downloaded times since its first release in december there is a large research_community already using r to work with gene_ontology go working with other ontologies is not as welldeveloped and ontocat helps to fill the gap the ontocat r package consists of convenient methods for working with ontologies in the r environment the package has been successfully used in a number of
