accurate estimation of short_read quality for next generation genome_sequencing motivation several software_tools specialize in the alignment of short next_generation reads to a reference_sequence some of these tools report a mapping quality_score for each alignmentin principle this quality_score tells researchers the likelihood that the alignment is correct however the reported mapping quality often correlates weakly with actual accuracy and the qualities of many mappings are underestimated encouraging the researchers to discard correct mappings further these low quality mappings tend to correlate with variations in the genome both single nucleotide and structural and such mappings are important in accurately identifying genomic_variants approach we develop a machine learning_tool loqum logistic_regression tool for calibrating the quality of short_read mappings to assign reliable mapping quality_scores to mappings of illumina_reads returned by any alignment_tool loqum uses statistics on the read base quality_scores reported by the sequencer and the alignment number of matches mismatches and deletions mapping quality_score returned by the alignment_tool if available and number of mappings as features for classification and uses simulated reads to learn a logistic regression_model that relates these features to actual mapping quality results we test the predictions of loqum on an independent dataset generated by the art short_read simulation software and observe that loqum can resurrect many mappings that are assigned zero quality_scores by the alignment tools and are therefore likely to be discarded by researchers we also observe that the recalibration of mapping quality_scores greatly_enhances the precision of called single_nucleotide availability loqum is available as open_source atnext generation genome_sequencing ngs has quickly become very popular in life_sciences because of its utility in efficiently generating high_quality sequence_data applications of ngs include analysis of gene_expression and alternative_splicing rna_seq dna_protein chromatin_immunoprecipitation d e novo genome_sequencing metagenomics and identification of genetic_variants within and across populations many computational_methods are already available for analyzing genetic to whom correspondence should be addressed variants using ngs_data these variants include single_nucleotide snps and structural_variants such as copy_numbers insertions deletions tandem_duplications inversions and translocations characterization of such variants is useful in many applications including genome_wide identification of driver_mutations in cancer and comparative_genomics hudson we evaluate our classification_framework by considering the relationship between precision and recall as one varies a threshold on prediction output in calculating these measures we consider a true_positive tp as a read that is correctly mapped and whose score exceeds this threshold a false_positive fp is a read that is incorrectly mapped but whose score exceeds this threshold and a false_negative fn is a read that is correctly mapped but is discarded because its score is less than the threshold we then use the standard definition of precision as tp tp fp similarly recall is defined as tp tp fn we evaluate the performance of loqum on multiple_alignment tools and compare the classifier output with the raw mapping quality if provided we then examine the relationship between our prediction scores and actual mapping accuracy and the effect of these recalibrated mapping quality_scores on snp_calling with the samtools mpileup variant caller shows precision versus recall for the bwa alignment_tool withshowing the raw mapping qualities andshowing the output of loqum we see that the raw mapping qualities provide relatively little information about reads that are incorrectly mappedeven at the highest mapping quality of bwa provides high recall and precision of loqum however identifies these high_quality incorrect mappings and provides much higher_precision at comparable recall values shows soap s precision and recall as a function of a threshold on mapping quality or logistic_regression output from the raw mapping quality precision_recall in we see that soaps quality_scores have very low dynamic range and discriminative_power in fact soap only reports mapping qualities of or and all quality mappings are at the top of the red line precision with all quality mappings represented as an invisible blue dot under the red line at precision nonetheless this logistic regression_framework can accurately classify reads as correctly or incorrectly mapped this is shown inloqum provides higher area under the precision_recall curve and i in this article we show that a machine_learning framework that uses a combination of read and alignment statistics as classification features and simulated reads as training data to predict mapping accuracy can improve on mapping quality_scores reported by available tools these improved mapping quality_scores might be particularly useful in improving the identification of genomic_variants since they can save potentially informative mappings that would be conservatively assigned low quality_scores by the assignment tools additionally loqums recalibrated mapping quality_scores can reduce false_positive variant_calls due to overestimated mapping accuracy assessment of the effect of mapping quality_scores on identification of more genomic_variants remains an important and interesting problem for future_studies
