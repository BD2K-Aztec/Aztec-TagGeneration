data_and irootlab a free_and matlab toolbox for vibrational biospectroscopy data analysis irootlab is a free_and matlab toolbox for vibrational biospectroscopy vbs data analysis it offers an object oriented programming class library graphical_user guis and automatic matlab_code generation the class library contains a large number of methods concepts and visualizations for vbs data analysis some of which are introduced in the toolbox the guis provide an interface to the class library including a module to merge several spectral files into a dataset automatic code allows developers to quickly write vbs data analysis scripts and is a unique resource among tools for vbs documentation includes a manual tutorials doxygen generated reference and a demonstration showcase irootlab can handle some of the most popular file_formats used in vbs license gnu lgpl availability official website http irootlab vibrational biospectroscopy vbs is the application of infrared and raman_spectroscopy to biological studies and biomedical_applications in the past_decades vibrational_spectroscopy data_processing was developed on the grounds of signal_processing statistics and pattern_recognition resulting in a large number of computational_methods that are routinely applied in the field however the field needs further development and establishment of data analysis strategies partially owing to a continuous push from instrumental advancements but also motivated by challenges in pre_processing biomarker extraction and standardization of inter experimental_datasets and inspired by the increasing power of computers vbs data analysis is largely carried_out by commercial softwares such as cytospec www cytospec com neurodeveloper www neurodeveloper com unscrambler www camo com pirouette www infometrix com opus www bruker com and wire www renishaw com popularly used commercial matlab toolboxes include the neural_network and the bioinformatics toolbox others are free to use but closed source such as prtools and ga ors while these are all high_quality software the use of closed source software contradicts the multidisciplinary aspect of the field as researchers looking for new analysis strategies remain dependant from the software manufacturers on the other hand open_source softwares available are largely restricted to a given task such as libsvm functional data analysis toolbox and various other resources available online irootlab is a free libre and open_source foss matlab toolbox created to fulfil the need for foss software encompassing every stage of vbs data analysis it is a highly modular software that was created based on existing theory of data analysis and as such applied to vbs bringing together families of methods such as outlier removal pre_processing feature_extraction feature_selection feature construction classification classifier aggregation clustering concepts such as cross_validation random sub sampling peak_detection biomarker identification a set of unique visualization options supplementary and a matlab_code generator the basic modular design is simple which makes irootlab a flexible and intuitive resource for vibrational_spectroscopy data analysis developers
