data_and proteomics to go proteomatic enables the user_friendly creation of versatile ms_ms data evaluation workflows we present proteomatic an operating system independent and user_friendly platform that enables the construction and execution of ms_ms data evaluation pipelines using free and commercial software required external programs such as for peptide_identification are downloaded automatically in the case of free software due to a strict separation of functionality and presentation and support for multiple scripting languages new processing_steps can be added easily availability_and proteomatic is implemented in c qt scripts are implemented in ruby python and php all source_code is released under the lgpl source_code and installers for windows mac os x and linux are freely_available atmass spectrometry has evolved as a powerful_tool for the high_throughput analysis of complex_protein producing immense amounts of data dedicated software is essential for the identification of peptides and proteins from tandem_mass ms_ms in addition to commercial software the increasing availability of free tools for different purposes allows for manifold alterations in the choice of individual programs and their arrangement in an ms_ms data evaluation pipeline most programs are controlled via the command_line cli which is necessary in order for the program to be included into an automated pipeline on the other hand this mode of interaction makes the program less accessible to users some programs are delivered with a dedicated graphical_user gui which facilitates changing parameters and running the program however in order to create an automated processing pipeline in which multiple programs are chained together cli tools must be used and programming knowledge is required here we report on proteomatic a versatile and user_friendly platform for the construction of ms_ms data_processing pipelines although alternatives exist we chose to design a system that implements a strict separation of functionality and the gui where new processing stepsproteomatic contains more than scripts for various purposes e g peptide and protein identification at a user_defined false_discovery using a target_decoy approach in addition protein groups can be determined thus reducing the amount of peptides matching to multiple_sequences proteomatic can also be used for peptide and protein_quantitation using a novel quantitation tool qtrace as demonstrated in detailed documentation of proteomatic and all available scripts can be found on the proteomatic web_site
