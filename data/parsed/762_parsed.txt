databases_and biologistics diffusion_coefficients for complete proteome of escherichia_coli motivation biologistics provides data for quantitative analysis of transport diffusion processes and their spatio_temporal correlations in cells mobility of proteins is one of the few parameters necessary to describe reaction_rates for gene_regulation although understanding of diffusion limited biochemical_reactions in vivo requires mobility data for the largest possible number of proteins in their native forms currently there is no database that would contain the complete information about the diffusion_coefficients dcs of proteins in a given cell_type results we demonstrate a method for the determination of in vivo dcs for any moleculeregardless of its molecular_weight size and structurein any type of cell we exemplify the method with the database of in vivo dc for all proteins records from the proteome of k strain of escherichia_coli together with examples of dc of amino_acids sugars rna and dna the database follows from the scale dependent viscosity reference curve sdvrc construction of sdvrc for prokaryotic or eukaryotic_cell requires in vivo measurements using techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectro scopy fcs fluorescence_recovery frap nuclear_magnetic nmr or particle_tracking the shape of the sdvrc would be different for each organism but the mathematical form of the curve remains the same the presented method has a high predictive_power as the measurements of dcs of several inert properly chosen probes in a single cell_type allows to determine the dcs of thousands of proteins additionally obtained mobility data allow quantitative study of biochemical_interactions in vivo biologistics and biochemistry in a crowded environment are two emerging interdisciplinary fields of science they provide quantitative analysis of transport of proteins and their spatio_temporal correlations involved in gene_expression and regulation according to the current state of the art theory of gene_expression activation or repression in bacteria mobility of proteins is one of the few parameters necessary to describe reaction_rates of gene_regulation the mobility is understood as a three_dimensional diffusion or one dimensional sliding along dna for prokaryotes and eukaryotes or by velocity of molecular_motors in eukaryotic_cells understanding of diffusion limited biochemical_reactions requires accurate in vivo mobility data for the largest possible number of proteins in their native forms the three_dimensional diffusion of different types of macromolecules in the cytoplasm of escherichia_coli has been experimentally_studied in several cases but experimental determination of the mobility of all proteins is technically an impossible task because of their large number in a given cell for example the proteome of the k strain of e coli contains more than proteins moreover most of the recent_studies concern measurements mainly performed with the use of green_fluorescent gfp or gfp_fusion attempts to study the diffusion of many proteins simultaneously under conditions resembling the interior of the cells were performed in silico by mcguffee and elcock computational_methods however have limitations arising from the speed and capacity of computing hardware and small number of interacting_proteins in the system different types of proteins an alternative approach is the quantitative analysis of available literature data mika and poolman gathered literature data of diffusion_coefficients dcs of different types of proteins in e coli and proposed a power_law dependence of the dc on the molecular_weight of proteins this power_law however can be applied only for the proteins in a narrow range of molecular_weights i e between and kda in this work we present a method for predictions of the dcs of proteins for the proteome of any cell we collected all available literature data on diffusion of various probes including small_molecules water glucose proteins and plasmids in the cytoplasm of e coli we used those data and the scaling function of viscosity to whom correspondence should be addressed the author

medium provided the original_work the method presented above has a high predictive_power although so_far a large error of the method for proteins the experimentally_measured dcs coincide remarkably well with the predicted dcs cf therefore measurements of dcs of several inert probes in a single cell_type allow to determine the dcs of thousands of proteins and other macro molecules correctly designed experiment would require involvement of different experimental_techniques nmr frap fcs particle_tracking and the use of probes in a wide_range of sizes one needs to know the dc of a given probe in water and or the hydrodynamic_radius of this probe additionally for the same probe measurements of diffusion in cytoplasm of the cell should be performed sizes of selected probes should be uniformly_distributed along the logarithmic scale of sizes we showed that only measurements are required to predict the cytoplasmic dc of the typical protein with accuracy analysis of the sdvrc allows to determine the characteristic length_scales r h and and the dc of any macro molecule in the cytoplasm for the cytoplasm of e coli we found that r h is surprisingly well correlated with the average radius of the dna loops forming the nucleoid this suggests that the nucloeid is the main crowding agent responsible for the macroscopic viscosity in the cytoplasm of e coli finally it should be noted that there are no additional requirements except experimental_data to construct analogous database of dcs in other systems such as the nucleus or mitochondria of eukaryotic_cells we also believe that sdvrc can be easily adopted to calculate other types of mobility including one dimensional sliding velocity of molecular_motors etc as they all are inversely proportional to the viscosity
