lcr exxxplorer a web platform to search visualize and share data for low complexity regions in protein_sequences motivation local compositionally biased and low complexity regions lcrs in amino_acid have initially attracted the interest of researchers due to their implication in generating artifacts in sequence database_searches there is accumulating_evidence of the biological_significance of lcrs both in physiological and in pathological situations nonetheless lcr related algorithms and tools have not gained wide appreciation across the research_community partly due to the fact that only a handful of user_friendly software is currently freely_available results we developed lcr exxxplorer an extensible online platform attempting to fill this gap lcr exxxplorer offers tools for displaying lcrs from the uniprot swissprot knowledgebase in combination with other relevant protein features predicted or experimentally_verified moreover users may perform powerful queries against a custom_designed sequence lcr centric database we anticipate that lcr exxxplorer will be a useful starting_point in research_efforts for the elucida tion of the structure function and evolution of proteins with lcrs availability_and lcr exxxplorer is freely_available at the url http repeat biol during the past_years the main focus of research related to regions of local compositional extremes low complexity regions lcrs was their identification for the purpose of sequence masking for eliminating spurious hits in database_searches several studies have been published showcasing the abundance and importance of such regions at the molecular structural e g functional e g organismic e g and habitat level e g despite the apparent biological_importance of lcrs theres a distinct lack of tools or services capable of helping biologists to study them in depth most of the methods capable of detecting lcrs were developed for the sole purpose of masking them and are meant to be used from the command_line as part of a sequence_analysis or search pipeline while some tools such as seg cast or bias do offer more advanced reports as an option their results are mostly meant to be parsed by a computer software and not a biologist in this work we present lcr exxxplorer an online service to search visualize and share lcrs in protein_sequences we highlight v c the author published_by
