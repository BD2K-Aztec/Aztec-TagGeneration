structural_bioinformatics pyetv a pymol evolutionary trace viewer to analyze functional site predictions in protein_complexes pyetv is a pymol plugin for viewing analyzing and manipulating predictions of evolutionarily important residues and sites in protein_structures and their complexes it seamlessly captures the output of the evolutionary trace server namely ranked importance of residues for multiple chains of a complex it then yields a high_resolution graphical_interface showing their distribution and clustering throughout a quaternary_structure including at interfaces together with other tools in the popular pymol viewer pyetv thus provides a novel tool to integrate evolutionary_forces into the design of experiments targeting the most functionally_relevant sites of a protein availability the pyetv module is written in python installation_instructions and video demonstrations may be found at the url since proteinprotein_interactions are ubiquitous and an emerging target for design and therapeutics it is critical to improve the tools that enable their characterization here we present an et viewer that provides a high_quality interface to map and analyze evolutionary_forces and the functional sites they define across multi protein interfaces and assemblies importantly it enables the integration of evolutionary trace et analysis with any type of structural and biophysical information accessible to pymol et is a well validated method to identify functional sites and their residue determinants in proteins it drives experiments that efficiently elucidate_the of binding catalysis and allostery and that rationally perturb networks et ranks the evolutionary importance of sequence_positions by tracking whether their variations during evolution correlate with large or small divergences among orthologs and paralogs these et ranks are robust and the best ranked sequence_positions form continuous spatial clusters that reveal functional sites and their functional determinants varying the threshold of importance reveals these sites at varying levels of to whom correspondence should be addressed detail recent_studies show that small motifs of et residues can be compared across all protein_structures to predict functions in enzymes and non enzymes alike thereby validating et predictions of functional determinants on a large_scale yet the study of the structural interactions of evolutionary important et residues across structural interfaces has been limited the et report maker only provided a pdf report of individual sequence or structure et analysis with no graphical_user a prior evolutionary trace viewer etv that did provide an interactive molecular viewer could only display just a single protein chain at a time and it could not show surfaces secondary_structure or any other type of information such as crystallographic b factors electrostatics or bound ligands by addressing these problems pyetv offers a tool to study protein functional determinants and evolutionary_forces in the more relevant structural context of quaternary interactions
