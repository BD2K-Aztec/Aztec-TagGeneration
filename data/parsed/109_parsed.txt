genome_analysis adacgh parallelized analysis of big cna data motivation studies of genomic_dna copy_number can deal with datasets with several million probes and thousands of subjects analyzing these data with currently available software e g as available from bioconductor can be extremely slow and may not be feasible because of memory_requirements results we have developed a bioconductor_package adacgh that parallelizes the main segmentation_algorithms using forking on multicore computers or parallelization via message_passing etc in clusters of computers and uses ff objects for reading and data storage we show examples of data with million probes per array we can analyze data that would otherwise not fit in memory and compared with the non parallelized versions we can achieve speed ups of times on a cores machine availability_and adacgh is an r package available from bioconductor version or higher is available from the development branchcurrent studies of genomic copy_number cna are using platforms with several million probes per array and several thousand subjects e g but the canonical implementations of the widely used open_source packages for the analysis of cna data did not allow for parallelized execution of the analysis this makes_it to use clusters of servers and does not take advantage of the trends in parallel_computing toward multicore machines servers with cores or laptops with or cores are nowadays common moreover especially for r bioconductor software the available packages will not be able to analyze big datasets if these are larger than about a quarter to a half of the available memory unless one uses time consuming and ad_hoc manual partition of the input and subsequent recombination of the outputsee discussion in section why adacgh instead of a manual solution in the vignette of the package here i describe adacgh a bioconductor_package designed to address the above deficiencies i leverage on two r packages parallel part of the standard set of r packages and ff and combine them to provide the following parallelized analysis i have parallelized the most widely used segmentation approaches that can be applied to cna data including both comparative_genomic cgh and snp_arrays and also covering sequencing_data when these have been appropriately processed but seethe ability to analyze data that cannot fit in memory using ff we only access the section of the data currently being analyzed keeping in ram and moving between processes only a pointer to the rest of the data on disk parallelization of data input and output and plotting input from and output to other bioconductor_packages here i present the main functions of the package the differences with former version and some benchmarks a full set of examples further benchmarks and detailed suggestions for usage are included in the package vignettes the code has been rewritten to use forking data_handling and reading of input_data has been completely modified so that data much larger than available memory can be read and analyzed and missing value handling has been changed to use all available data per array the vignette benchmarks pdf provides extensive comparisons between the new and latest previous running versions version but the main differences between these two versions are as follows reading and analysis of large_datasets the new version can read datasets much larger than the old one and datasets much larger than available memory see details in section as a consequence of being able to read much larger datasets the new version can analyze datasets much larger than the old one missing value handling the old version used row wise deletion of missing_values when reading data i e a probe would be deleted from the data if it had one missing value in any array column the new version deals with missing_values array by array so for each array or column all available data or probes are used in the segmentation forking and clusters the new version of adacgh allows for the usage of forking or an explicit cluster e g mpi sockets to parallelize reading and analysis in posix operating_systems including unix gnu linux and mac os forking can be faster less memory consuming and much easier to use than a cluster flexibility of reading data and compatibility with former version the new version of adacgh has not removed the mechanisms of reading data available in the old version when data are small or memory is plentiful reading data from a single rdata is an available option and accepts data read by the former version however the old version cannot accept data read by the new version because it assumes that data that have been read contain no missing_values these differences in implementation however do not affect the underlying core code for the algorithms which is the same as in the previous version there have been however changes in some defaults to adapt the package to really large data e g using mad as merging default or using haarseg as the smoothfunc for daglad following recommendations in the package vignette for glad shows benchmarks of reading and analyzing data with probes per array column those figures compare memory_usage and wall time of the old and new versions and of the non parallelized np versions in two different machines data for the figures as well as benchmarks for a third machine and with mpi over two machines are available from the vignette benchmarks pdf to give an idea of sizes the rdata file for the arrays data is of gb and the directory with the data for columns arrays occupies gb compared with the np version in the analysis of data adacgh leads to speed increases by factors of times in the cores machines and times in the cores machines and allows us to analyze data that would not fit in memory compared with the former version the new version uses less memory for analysis more importantly the new version allows us to read and analyze much larger datasets in the and wall time and memory use summed over all spawned processes of reading and analysis as a function of number of arrays reading comparison between new and old versions analysis new and old versions with four segmentation_methods and np for two methods no benchmark allowed to run for h without parallelization in the amd machine no runs of cbs with arrays or haarseg with can be done r runs out of memory in the intel machine no runs for arrays with any method can be done r runs out of memory work flow from input_data to figures r functions are shown with courier font inside boxes in italics are the names of other packages which can provide input accept output data frames are stored in memory in contrast to ff objects data input and conversion to ff objects are done with inputtoadacgh maybe after using cutfile for parallelized reading of single_column files segmentation is performed with psegment and results can then be plotted pchromplot or used by other packages outputtocghregions when using ff objects after data input in a single machine the remaining analyses can be conducted in a cluster
