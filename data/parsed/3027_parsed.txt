moccasin converting matlab ode_models to sbml matlab is popular in biological_research for creating and simulating models that use ordinary_differential odes however sharing or using these models outside of matlab is often problematic a community standard such as systems_biology sbml can serve as a neutral exchange format but translating models from matlab to sbml can be challenging especially for legacy models not written with translation in mind we developed moccasin model ode converter for creating automated sbml interoperability to help moccasin can convert ode based matlab models of biochemical_reaction into the sbml format availability_and moccasin is available under the terms of the lgpl licensematlab is a general_purpose numerical computing environment whose powerful features have attracted many researchers it has been the substrate for countless models as well as software_tools written in its object oriented programming_language despite its popularity there are reasons why matlab programs are not themselves a desirable format for exchanging publishing or archiving computational_models in biology these include the lack of biological semantics in matlab programs which makes clear interpretation of programs as models of biological_processes more difficult the fact that matlab is proprietary and expensive which makes it unsuitable as a universal format for open scientific exchange and the fact that model details are often intertwined with program implementation details which makes_it to determine which parts constitute the essence of a model systems_biology sbml is an open format for representing models in systems_biology designed to resolve incompatibilities between systems that use different formats to describe models sbml is neutral with respect to modeling framework and computational platform this helps make models portable across tools and ensures that models as research products can persist regardless of changes to any particular software_tool or operating system unfortunately translating models from matlab to sbml is not straightforward some matlab toolboxes offer sbml capabilities however they have limited utility for translating legacy models lack support for the latest sbml releases and must be used from the start of a modeling project to have an effect
