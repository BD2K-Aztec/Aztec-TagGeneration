bioinformatics_discovery sequence_analysis isomirid a framework to identify microrna isoforms micrornas mirnas have been extensively_studied owing to their important regulatory_roles in genic expression an increasingly number of reports are performing extensive data_mining in small_rna libraries to detect mirnas isoforms and also and post_transcriptional nucleotide additions as well as edited mirnas sequences a ready to use pipeline isomirid was developed to standardize and automatize the search for mirnas isoforms in high_throughput small_rna libraries availability isomirid is a command_line python script available atseveral high_throughput small_rna srna sequencing_projects have increased the discovery and number of small_non related to gene_expression regulation micrornas mirnas are endogenous srnas with nt in length to regulate protein_coding mature mirna binds in the mrna target_sites leading to their degradation or repression of translation recently reports have demonstrated the existence of isomirs the isomir classification relies in three major categories and polymorphic isomirs with the sub classification of and isomirs into templated or non templated modifications according to the mirna precursor sequence furthermore efforts have been made to identify and understand the biological_processes where non templated nucleotides are added in the end of mature_mirnas altering the mirna stability and efficiency nucleotide additions at the end have also been reported altering the mirna seed_region and consequently its functionality several isomir variants have been discovered with deep sequencing_technologies some of these variations may have biological_origin and functions once the modifications were seen repeatedly at the same sites with higher_frequencies than random errors to improve and automate the search for isomirs in srna sequenced libraries we developed a simplified workflow isomirid allows the identification of and polymorphic isomirs based on the canonical mirna known sequence and also from other regions on the same mirna precursor additionally the program can also identify non templated or end variations by mapping the srnas in the known premirnas this framework is a simple method to identify and compare isomirs abundance in different sequencing libraries providing an initial view for biological relevant isomirs we also highlight that this pipeline could be applied to study isomirs from plants animals or any other living_organisms was tested on linux and mac osx environment and settled in a simple and standardized text_file see supplementary_file with the use of this configuration file it is possible to set more than one input srna sequencing file to be analyzed and compared sequence files can be in fastq or fasta_format the filtering process using reference_genome or transcriptome is optional as well as the abundance cutoff which can be applied for more than one value e g and corresponding to the reads sum in all libraries analyzed
