genome_analysis oncodriveclust exploiting the positional clustering of somatic_mutations to identify cancer_genes motivation gain_of often cluster in specific protein regions a signal that those mutations provide an adaptive advantage to cancer_cells and consequently are positively_selected during clonal_evolution of tumours we sought to determine the overall extent of this feature in cancer and the possibility to use this feature to identify drivers results we have developed oncodriveclust a method to identify genes with a significant bias towards mutation clustering within the protein_sequence this method constructs the background model by assessing coding silent mutations which are assumed not to be under positive_selection and thus may reflect the baseline tendency of som atic mutations to be clustered oncodriveclust analysis of the catalogue of somatic_mutations in cancer retrieved a list of genes enriched by the cancer gene census prioritizing those with dominant phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer_genes which showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters assessment of datasets from the cancer_genome demonstrated that oncodriveclust selected cancer_genes that were nevertheless missed by methods based on frequency and functional impact criteria this stressed the benefit of combining approaches based on complementary principles to identify driver_mutations we propose oncodriveclust as an effective tool for that purpose one of the current_challenges of oncogenomics is to distinguish the genomic_alterations that are involved in tumourigenesis i e drivers from those that give no advantage to cancer_cells but occur stochastically as a by product of cancer development i e passengers in line with this distinction driver_genes i e those bearing driver alterations confer selective_advantage to tumour_development and can be identified by detecting signals of positive_selection across a cohort of tumours one of the most intuitive approachesand the most profusely used at presentto detect positive_selection is based on frequency briefly it consists in identifying genes more frequently mutated than the background_mutation we recently described a second complementary_approach oncodrivefm gonzalez to identify genes under positive_selection in tumour_development by assessing their bias towards the accumulation of mutations with high functional impact fmbias across a cohort of tumour_samples here we propose a third alternative and complementary_approach aimed at detecting genes that bear mutations significantly clustered in specific regions of the amino_acid gainof function mutations in cancer_genes predominantly occur at specific protein residues or active domains for example most kras_mutations are found in residues and of the protein and mutations in pik_ca are predominantly found in the kinase and helical domains of the pik_ca subunit however the extent of this phenomenon in cancer_genes and how it can be used to nominate drivers not just gain of function cancer_genes remains to be clarified the clustering of mutations in the amino_acid of proteinsmutations clustering for clarityhas already been suggested as a marker of positive_selection and some approaches have been described to measure it in cancer however the methods described in previous_reports assume that mutation probability is homogeneous across the gene sequence which is likely an oversimplification that introduces a bias in the detection of meaningful events to solve this problem we have developed oncodriveclust a novel method that measures the bias of genes towards large mutation clustering with respect to a background model composed of coding silent mutations which are in principle under no selective_pressure and thus may reflect the baseline clustering of somatic_mutations we have applied oncodriveclust to the set of mutations reported in the catalogue of somatic_mutations in cancer cosmic with the objective of assessing its performance to select known cancer drivers i e those found in the cancer gene census cgc and to determine the extent of the mutations clustering phenomenon among known driver_genes both those described as oncogenes and to whom correspondence should be addressed tumour suppressors we have also applied oncodriveclust to several available large_datasets of cancer somatic_mutations from the cancer_genome tcga initiative and compared these results with other methods to identify driver candidates namely oncodrivefm gonzalez perez and and mutsig because all three approaches measure complementary and independent criteria aimed to discover positive_selection i e mutation clustering fmbias and mutation_frequency and each of them likely detects important events we conclude that the optimal_solution is to combine them to retrieve the most reliable and comprehensive list of cancer drivers from datasets of somatic_mutations of diverse tumour_types the elucidation of cancer drivers relies on identifying the marks of positive_selection that occur during the clonal_evolution of tumours the trend shown by protein affecting mutations to accumulate predominantly in certain gene regions is a fingerprint that may denote events targeted by the tumourigenesis however it is now apparent that the probability of occurrence of somatic_mutations is affected by several factors and varies across the genomic_sequence this should be taken into account when identifying mutation clusters because the assumption of a uniform mutation distribution as the null_model may overestimate the significance of observed clusters however the factors_determining the occurrence of mutational hotspots are not fully understood and their inference is not straightforward by mining the data under analysis to obtain a background model per gene and sample instead we propose to construct the background model using the degree of clustering of synonymous mutations which are assumed not to be under positive_selection and may thus reflect the baseline mutationclustering of the tumour this assumption also probably comprises a simplification because some coding silent mutations could in principle alter processes such as chromatin_remodeling or mrna_processing nevertheless apart from this they are not in general functionally_involved in tumourigenesis moreover and owing to the low recurrence of synonymous mutations the background model cannot establish constraints for particular genomic_regions therefore the method presents several caveats which have to be taken into account however although limited this null_model shall in principle specifically support the identification of genes whose mutations are grouped above the background as a matter of fact this approach was proven successful in prioritizing genes involved in the disease because oncodriveclust retrieved a reduced list of genes enriched for cancer drivers in all the datasets analysed in general the clustering analysis better detected drivers known to exhibit a dominant phenotype because mutations in these genes occur at particular sites that lead to the favoured gain of function however recessive genes were also highlighted over the background model because their mutations occur in larger but still delimited regions leading to loss of function the identification of drivers can profit from the combination of methods based on different theoretical principles in particular if they use complementary criteria in this regard oncodriveclust complements oncodrivefm because it better captures the behaviour of gain of function cancer_genes whereas oncodrivefm is better at identifying tumour_suppressor which bear loss_of that usually receive higher functional impact scores by comparison mutations conferring gainof function are more prone to produce lower scores of functional impact for instance mutations that change residue of pik_ca are known to be oncogenic but are underestimated by functional impact metrics because they rely largely on conservation criteria and this particular residue is highly_variable across species therefore oncodrivefm overlooks this gene in the brca dataset because most pik_ca occur in that specific position nevertheless this scenario in which gene_mutations predominantly occur at certain protein positions is well highlighted by the oncodriveclust analysis illustrating how the bias of a method is captured by using complementary criteria at present the most widely used approach to identify driver_genes consists in detecting those that are mutated more frequently than expected by chance therefore we compared the oncodriveclust results obtained in the tgca datasets with those obtained by mutsig a well established method to detect significantly mutated genes across cohorts of tumour_samples to avoid further interpretation we limited the comparison with already well described drivers i e genes contained in the cgc as a result we demonstrated that oncodriveclust selected several cancer drivers that were missed not only by oncodrivefm but also by the recurrence analysis of note this suggests that oncodriveclust could identify novel driver candidates i e not included in the cgc that are nevertheless overlooked by other methods and emphasizes the benefit of using a combination of methods to elucidate driver_genes that balances the strengths_and of each approach this would allow the retrieval of a more comprehensive list of putative drivers because each may exhibit different signals of positive_selection in addition it could also help to estimate the reliability of the results because the false_positives of a method are unlikely to be picked up by another one based on complementary criteria and therefore with its own sources of bias one important advantage of oncodriveclust and of oncodrivefm as well is that the required input consists only on the list of tumour somatic_mutations in the cohort raw_data such as bam_files are not required which reduces the burden of download storage and computational processing this is a major_issue because the amount of data generated by tumour genome re sequencing studies continues to increase and the technical requirements of some methods could limit the analysis of large_datasets this is specially true for initiatives aimed at integrating data from different projects e g intogen in summary the elucidation of genes involved in cancer is a challenging_task that requires the combined use of approaches based on different criteria in this regard we show that oncodrive clust complements well other existing_methods and should be taken into account for the identification of cancer drivers
