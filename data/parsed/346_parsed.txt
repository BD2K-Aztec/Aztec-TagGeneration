structural_bioinformatics an hmm_based algorithm for evaluating rates of receptor_ligand binding_kinetics from thermal_fluctuation data motivation abrupt reduction resumption of thermal_fluctuations of a force probe has been used to identify association dissociation events of proteinligand bonds we show that off rate of molecular dissociation can be estimated by the analysis of the bond lifetime while the on rate of molecular association can be estimated by the analysis of the waiting_time between two neighboring bond events however the analysis relies heavily on subjective judgments and is time consuming to automate the process of mapping out bond events from thermal_fluctuation data we develop a hidden_markov hmm_based method results the hmm method represents the bond state by a hidden variable with two values bound and unbound the bond association dissociation is visualized and pinpointed we apply the method to analyze a key receptorligand interaction in the early_stage of hemo stasis and thrombosis the von_willebrand vwf binding to platelet_glycoprotein ib gpib the numbers of bond lifetime and waiting_time events estimated by the hmm are much more than those estimated by a descriptive statistical_method from the same set of raw_data the kinetic_parameters estimated by the hmm are in excellent_agreement with those by a descriptive statistical_analysis but have much smaller errors for both wild_type and two mutant vwf a domains thus the computerized_analysis allows us to speed up the analysis and improve the quality of estimates of receptorligand binding_kinetics during the early_stage of hemostatic and thrombotic processes platelets tether to and roll on the immobilized von_willebrand vwf which is mediated through binding between the kda n_terminal domain of the alpha_subunit of the gpib ixv complex gpib and the a domain of the vwf disease related mutations in the vwf have been found to change the mechanical regulation of platelet_adhesion resulting in the bleeding_disorder von_willebrand vwd from a biophysical perspective these mutations alter vwfgpib binding_kinetics it has been shown that single_residue mutation r e that exhibits the type b vwd phenotype increases vwfgpib binding_affinity and supports the rolling of more platelets at slower velocities without a minimum shear requirement another single_residue mutation g s that exhibits the type m vwd phenotype decreases the binding_affinity between these two molecules the binding_affinity is the ratio of the on to off rates which quantifies the net effects of receptorligand association and dissociation to measure the on and off rates separately mechanical methods such as the thermal_fluctuation assay that use ultrasensitive force probes e g the biomembrane force probe bfp and optical_tweezers have been developed to measure the interactions of proteins immobilized on surfaces the idea stems from the observation that force probes used for single_molecule experiments are usually susceptible to thermal_fluctuations the formation of a molecular bond spanning across the gap between the force probe and the target physically connects the two surfaces and reduces the thermal_fluctuation of the force probe in other words the newly_formed bond is equivalent to adding a constraint to the force probe in the analysis of experimental_data bond formation is detected from the reduction in the thermal_fluctuation of the probe position and bond_dissociation is detected from the resumption of thermal_fluctuation as judged by the sliding standard_deviation moving below or above certain thresholds although this descriptive statistical_method is simple it has several disadvantages it is time consuming not robust susceptible to noise and subjective to overcome these drawbacks we developed a hidden_markov hmm_based algorithm that provides an automatic and systematic procedure for analyzing thermal_fluctuation data efficiently we first assume a hidden state bound or unbound for each observed probe position given the hidden_states the probe positions are assumed to be independent and normally distributed with unknown_parameters the forwardbackward algorithm was used to estimate the underlying states and unknown_parameters because of its versatility in modeling and robustness in prediction_performance hmm has wide_applications in computational_biology for example hmms can detect tumor_subtypes with to whom correspondence should be addressed ythe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first two authors should be regarded_as microarray_data and identify protein binding_sites in dna however to the best of our knowledge no hmm_based computer algorithm has been developed for analyzing thermal_fluctuation data in the thermal_fluctuation assay if the probe is in either the bound or unbound state at one moment it is more likely to be in the same state at the next moment this memory effect can be successfully captured by assuming a markovian structure at the transition of the underlying states y hung et_al submitted for publication furthermore hmm enables us to provide statistical_inference such as the confidence_interval and the prediction interval in particular by using the likelihood_ratio based on the fitted hmm we can verify the memory effect objectively and rigorously in repeated adhesions y hung et_al submitted for publication this article is organized as follows sections and describe the experiment setup and the existing method section illustrates the procedures to analyze thermal_fluctuation data sections discuss the modeling and computation of hmm in section we use the hmm to derive kinetic rates by analyzing thermal_fluctuation data obtained for the interaction of vwf a and glycocalicin gc the extracellular portion of gpib we also show the performance of the hmm method in comparison to the manual method based on descriptive_statistics in addition to running a performance test of the hmm method with the dataset of wild_type wt a we ran more performance tests with datasets of two single_residue a vwd mutants r e type b and g s type m all above show that the hmm method is far easier to use section_presents the discussion and concluding_remarks it has long been recognized that changes in thermal_fluctuation can be used to identify single_molecule events this idea was implemented in early work to probe the duration and contact stiffness of myosin motors interacting with actin_filament more recently it was used to analyze d kinetics of adhesion_molecules interacting with their ligands to measure molecular elasticity and to determine protein conformational changes some studies used bfp that was customdesigned and home made in a handful of laboratories others used optical_tweezers and atomic_force that are commercially_available in many laboratories therefore these methods have high potential for a broad range of applications by many investigators unfortunately previous_analyses were done using merely eyeballing or descriptive statistical_analysis the drawbacks of these primitive analyses may limit the applications of the thermal_fluctuation methods because the descriptive statistical based algorithm is time consuming subjective and prone to noise and error in this study we developed a computational algorithm based on analytical statistics rather than descriptivethe relative_error of off rate versus p by comparing the hmm with descriptive statistical_method with the same data as the whole sequence statistics the hmm_based algorithm automates and highthroughputs the processing of data and has the advantage of being rigorous and objective we used the vwf a gc system to test the hmm method the estimates from hmm are comparable with those from the descriptive statistical_method manual_analysis figs c and a with the same tuning parameters figs and this article compares the on and off rates of gc interactions with wt and two mutant a domains at static conditions platelet gpib does not bind wt vwf unless a modulator ristocetin is added to induce the conformational activation of the a domain by comparison the type b vwd mutant r e binds gpib spontaneously without ristocetin whereas the type m vwd mutation g s abolishes the ristocetin induced binding to gpib our kinetics measurements correlate well with these biochemical characterizations in that the r e mutant gains the function with an increased on rate whereas the g s mutant loses the function with a decreased on rate the data indicate that the association kinetics reflect the conformational_states of vwf a there has recently been significant progress in correlating protein_structure and binding_kinetics a web_server has been developed for prediction of association rate_constant by incorporating the protein conformational changes based on the archived proteinligand complex structures complementing such efforts the hmm method combined with the thermal_fluctuation assay provides experimentally_measured binding_kinetics and their correlation to protein_structure and function the hmm method consistently shows higher accuracy than the manual method regardless of the biological_variation embedded inside the datasets and b furthermore it also detects far more waiting_time and bond lifetime events than the descriptive method and d possible reasons for the descriptive method to capture less events include the following first the calculation of sliding standard_deviation may not resolve short bonds if their lifetimes are shorter than the chosen length of the sliding_window thus the calculation mixes both bound and unbound observations which may miss many waiting_times and short bond lifetime events second the decision_rule bound versus unbound of the descriptive statistical_method heavily relies on an empirical threshold in most cases this threshold will be manually drawn in a conservative way to avoid false_positive annotation caused by noise because the reduction of variance by bond formation is relatively small and may not be detected sometimes the manual method tends to miss bonds when experimental_noise is not well controlled aside from its advantage of robustness in prediction the hmm method is more convenient and requires less learning times than the descriptive method the comparison was made after an automated prescreening process to eliminate erroneous data resulted from the experimental_errors drifting and noises it should be noted that the hmm method shares the same biophysical rationales as the descriptive method but provides the statistical basis to computerize the manual_analysis yet it requires on average s for the hmm to finish annotation of one data trace but it takes min for the manual method to do so figs c and a
