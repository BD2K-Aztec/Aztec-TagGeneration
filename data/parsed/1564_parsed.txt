genome_analysis egm encapsulated gene by gene matching to identify gene orthologs and homologous segments in genomes motivation identification of functionally equivalent genes in different species is essential to understand the evolution of biological_pathways and processes at the same time identification of strings of conserved orthologous_genes helps identify complex genomic_rearrangements across different organisms such an insight is particularly useful for example in the transfer of experimental_results between different experimental_systems such as drosophila and mammals results here we describe the encapsulated gene by gene matching egm approach a method that employs a graph_matching strategy to identify gene orthologs and conserved gene_segments given a pair of genomes egm constructs a global gene match for all genes taking_into gene context and family information the hungarian method for identifying the maximum_weight matching in bipartite graphs is employed where the resulting matching reveals one to one correspondences between nodes genes in a manner that maximizes the gene similarity and context conclusion we tested our approach by performing several comparisons including a detailed human versus mouse genome_mapping we find that the algorithm is robust and sensitive in detecting orthologs and conserved gene_segments egm can sensitively detect rearrangements within large and small chromosomal segments the egm tool is fully_automated and easy to use compared to other more complex methods that also require extensive manual intervention and input availability the egm software supplementary_information and other tools are available online from http vbc inferring orthology_relationships and identifying conserved gene_segments are essential tasks in genome comparison identification of matching genes and their contiguous strings provide a perspective to whom correspondence should be addressed on how genomes are related how they function and how the species evolve segments of conserved homologous_genes across species are termed as conserved synteny a core task in identifying conserved synteny is the assignment of putative orthologous_genes the presence of several homologous_genes across the species makes this a complex task however global_genome properties used in comparative_studies have shown that strings of genes are well preserved especially in closely_related organisms further genes with evolutionary_relationship tend to conserve their genomic_context especially in closely_related therefore gene context and neighborhood provides important information for assigning the best orthologs commonly methods used to identify orthologs and synteny between a pair of genomes work by identifying homologous_genes followed by their expansion to build larger collinear blocks of similar genes these techniques can be grouped into two categories from an algorithmic perspective i the first category is similar to an alignment of molecular sequences semi_automated techniques have been used to align genome_sequences mainly when information regarding the conserved_regions is known such as in the comparison of mycoplasma_genitalium and m pneumonioae species presented in often these semi_automated techniques work by initially identifying conserved_regions using all againstall gene comparisons manual identification of conserved_regions is challenging especially when larger genomes with complex rearrangements are involved these regions are then separated and aligned using standard_tools such as blast in addition automated methods to determine conserved_regions based on the comparison of fixed_length segments string of genes have been developed such as those used to compare the genomes of caenorhabditis briggsae and c elegans in however they cannot be efficiently applied in the case of large sequences the second classification of techniques can be categorized as matching of corresponding homologous_genes unlike alignments where the precedence of the nodes genes is maintained matching based techniques workwe applied egm to automatically map homologous_gene strings between the human mouse rat and zebrafish http www sanger ac uk projects d rerio genomes the datasets of protein_sequences were obtained from the integr database these sets were sorted according to their encoding_gene reference positions available as gene cross reference data proteins without reference positions were omitted from the genome datasets details of the dataset and tools are available online from http egm presents a further step towards fully automating the complex process of gene by gene matching egm is a powerful_tool capable of identifying the best one to one gene correspondences between a pair of genomes that leads to the identification of conserved homologous segments a crucial step in the identification of syntenic regions we have shown the egm tool to be a useful method that integrates several pieces of information through the pipeline to produce a global comparative map a series of complex genome comparison including a human and mouse comparison wereperformed using egm the results clearly show its effectiveness in providing a detailed comparison the results include information about the putative gene orthologs protein_families their context and organization on the genomes our experiments show that egm is able to sensitively identify_conserved gene_segments and reveal complex evolutionary rearrangement events in large_scale specieslevel and small_scale chromosome level data the combination of data provided by egm comparison is a useful tool in the prediction of protein_function with respect to conserved gene_segments encapsulated genomes allow easier detection of identical cluster labels rather than individual proteins encapsulation also makes it easy to comprehend gene context and topology_information especially in highly conserved_regions we believe this has a potential to help researchers explain their functional significance and possible interactions comparison with dagchainer adhore and osfinder revealed egms ability to consistently detect more orthologs while maintaining high similarity dagchainer works by utilizing the diagonal properties from the anchors and similar to the findings of the precision to identify accurate orthologs diminishes when comparing distant_species such as the comparisons involving the zebrafish as non orthologous anchors significantly outnumber the orthologous anchors in the input therefore resulting in fewer gene matches in smaller syntenic regions adhore a quality based method determines orthologous segments by iteratively increasing the inter segmental distance threshold for sets of anchors that fit diagonal linear_regressions the quality of these diagonals is assessed by the goodness of their fit overall dagchainer adhore and osfinder performed well in the comparisons between the human mouse and rat genomes but to a lesser degree in comparisons involving more distantly_related organisms such as the zebrafish genome however from a point_of of the methodology a practical limitation with dagchainer and adhore is their reliance on quality parameter scoring_schemes that are not well characterized and difficult to ascertain when little is known about the genomes being compared further dagchainer and adhore gene matches reveal many to many relationships and in many cases this leads to many variations of the same conserved segments being reported the ensembl compara database tool curates multi species comparative_data we utilized these compara curated orthologs to evaluate the precision of the four methods mentioned here egm showed high_precision in detecting true_positive orthologs for species at varying evolutionary_distances identification of best one to one gene matches between a pair of genomes is a pivotal step in characterizing unknown_proteins as such relationships help identify genes with common_ancestors in the case of egm the identification of best orthologs relies on sequence_similarity and conservation of genome context and not on any quality based measure or threshold the use of similarity_scores in detecting functional orthologs remains a preferred method used in several studies and was found to perform significantly well in comparison to other more sophisticated techniques further as mentioned earlier one to one orthologs are important in several studies ranging from proteinprotein_interactions in multiple species to identification of biological_pathways however as thousands of new proteins are sequenced from increasingly_complex genomes the task of assigning orthologs is becoming more complex in addition the presence of large protein_families paralogs evolutionary_processes such as speciation and gene_duplications or both are not uncommon therefore it is a non trivial yet important task to identify co orthologs as opposed to only the best orthologs and homologous segments to paint a more comprehensive evolutionary picture as future_directions we are pursuing to evolve our egm approach to perform this task deploying an iterative strategy where at every iteration a new set of matching can be reported while eliminating the possibility of identifying the previously_reported matching we believe collectively from all iterations we can extract sets of co orthologs and syntenic regions a bottleneck that remains in most of the current methods is the reliance on external tools such as blast to assign initial similarity relationships this is often time consuming and involves manual processing we believe that alignment_free can be employed to significantly accelerate this task with reasonable sensitivity we are also pursuing this as a future direction similarly visualizing comparative maps remains complicated much of these data are generated as long text_files unrolling complex information recently resources such as the synteny database along with other web technologies such as html have demonstrated their usefulness to simplify the visualization development of efficient visualization_tools can greatly improve the analysis of such data gene similarity gene context and order are a common_theme when searching for functionally_related and overall conservation of proteins analyzing these properties often requires manual intervention we believe that egm with its modular approach is able to help automate these tasks we have found egm to be a powerful method that identifies gene matching at the one to one level the egm tool is a simple to use and fully_automated our results indicate that egm has a great_potential in its competitive_performance in comparison with other popular approaches based on comparisons between several species the resulting comparative maps have also shown egm to be sensitive in detecting complex rearrangement events in addition the output produced by egm clearly depicts how individual genes match across a pair of genomes their genomic_context and protein_family information egm is able to perform two major integrated tasks i finding the best ortholog for each gene and ii identifying homologous segments shared between the compared species
