systems_biology an integrated computational_approach for metabolic_flux coupled with inference of tandem_ms collisional fragments motivation metabolic_flux mfa is a commonly used approach for quantifying metabolic_fluxes based on tracking isotope labeling of metabolite within cells tandem_mass ms_ms has been recently shown to be especially useful for mfa by providing rich_information on metabolite positional labeling measuring isotopic_labeling patterns of collisional fragments however a major_limitation in this approach is the requirement that the positional origin of atoms in a collisional fragment would be known a priori which in many cases is difficult to determine results here we show that ms_ms data could also be used to improve flux inference even when the positional origin of fragments is unknown we develop a novel method metabolic_flux un known fragments that extends on standard mfa and jointly searches for the most likely metabolic_fluxes together with the most plausible position of collisional fragments that would optimally match measured ms_ms data mfa uf is shown to markedly_improve flux prediction_accuracy in a simulation_model of gluconeogenesis and using experimental ms_ms data in bacillus_subtilis metabolic_flux mfa enables the determination of in vivo metabolic_fluxes and is commonly used to address problems in biotechnology and medicine it is based on feeding cells with isotopelabeled nutrients measuring isotopic_labeling patterns of intracellular metabolites and applying computational_approaches that analyze metabolite labeling data to estimate fluxes biotechnological_applications of mfa are especially diverse and include metabolic_engineering pathway discovery filling gaps in annotated genomes and mapping of environmental microbial_metabolism the measurement of isotopic_labeling patterns uses either nmr or mass_spectrometry coupled with liquid lc_ms or gas gc_ms chromatography nmr provides detailed information on positional labeling of metabolites however nmr_analysis requires a large amount of sample long analysis times and expensive_equipment on the other hand mass_spectrometry is more readily_accessible although it typically provides limited information on positional labeling as isotopomers i e distinct labeling patterns with the same number of labeled atoms have the same mass regardless of their position a set of isotopomers with the same mass is referred to as massisotopomers whereas the relative_abundance of a metabolites mass isotopomers is denoted as mass_isotopomer distribution tandem_mass ms_ms e g gc ms_ms and lc_ms provides information on metabolite positional labeling that can be used to improve flux inference it works by isolating a single_parent ion from the full spectrum and measuring its mass followed by a collision that yields product_ions whose mass is also measured we denote the mass isotopomers of a parent ion by m having no labeled atoms m having one labeled atom and so forth and the mass isotopomers of a product ion by m m and so forth various ms_ms ion scanning modes enable to measure the mass_isotopomer distribution of a parent molecule as well as that of a fragmented product ruhl et_al have recently used lc_ms to measure the mass_isotopomer distribution of various metabolite fragments in bacillus_subtilis which were shown to improve flux inference ms_ms can further measure the abundance of specific collisional transitions from certain parent to product mass isotopomers referred to as tandem mass isotopomers e g a transition from parent mass_isotopomer m to product mass_isotopomer m denoted m m the relative_abundance of all tandem mass isotopomers is referred to as tandem mass_isotopomer distribution the importance of tandem mass_isotopomer distribution data for flux inference was also recently demonstrated a current limitation of using ms_ms data for mfa is that the positional origin of atoms in a collisional fragment must be known a priori which in some cases may be difficult to infer one method for inferring fragment positions involves injecting the mass spec with multiple isotopically_labeled standards however this approach is limited by the lack of availability of such standards for most metabolites as well as the high price of existing isotopic labeled standards another approach is to computationally predict fragment positions using rule_based and combinatorial fragmentation methods to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com ruhl et_al have recently applied such methods to examine the position of ms_ms collisional fragments of metabolites in b subtilis however considering that these methods predicted multiple possible positions for most fragments and that further experimental_validation of predicted positions is of need the unique position of just of the fragments was determined and used for flux inference here we show that ms_ms data can be highly_valuable for mfa even when fragment positions are unknown specifically we suggest an extension to the standard mfa approach metabolic_flux unknown fragments mfa ufs which uses steady_state ms_ms data to jointly infer the most likely fluxes in a metabolic_network and the positional origin of fragment atoms the method is first applied to predict fluxes in a simulation_model of gluconeogenesis given metabolite tandem massisotopomer distribution data then it is applied to predict fluxes in b subtilis given measured mass_isotopomer distributions for both intact metabolites and their collisional fragments in both cases an improved flux prediction_performance of mfa uf in comparison with the standard mfa approach is demonstrated
