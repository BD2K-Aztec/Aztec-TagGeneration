alternative preprocessing of rna sequencing_data in the cancer_genome leads to improved analysis results motivation the cancer_genome tcga rna sequencing_data are used widely for research tcga provides level data which have been processed using a pipeline specific to that resource however we have found using experimentally_derived data that this pipeline produces gene_expression values that vary_considerably across biological_replicates in addition some rna_sequencing analysis tools require integer based read_counts which are not provided with the level data as an alternative we have reprocessed the data for tumor and normal samples across cancer_types using the rsubread package we have also collated corresponding clinical data for these samples we provide these data as a community resource results we compared tcga samples processed using either pipeline and found that the rsubread pipeline produced fewer zero expression genes and more consistent expression levels across replicate samples than the tcga pipeline additionally we used a genomic signature approach to estimate her erbb activation_status for breast tumor_samples and found that the rsubread data resulted in stronger predictions of her pathway activity finally we used data from both pipelines to classify lung_cancer samples based on histological_type this analysis identified various non coding rna that may influence lung_cancer histology availability_and the rna_sequencing and clinical data can be downloaded from gene_expression accession_number gse scripts and code that were used to process and analyze the data are available from https github com srp tcga rnaseq clinical the cancer_genome research network has profiled thousands of human tumors to discover various types of molecular level aberrations that occur within tumors researchers have used these data to derive new insights about tumorigenesis and to validate and inform experimental_findings the cancer_genome research rna_seq which have been aligned to the reference_genome using mapsplice quantified at the gene and transcript_levels using rsem and standardized using upper_quartile normalization however the use of these data comes with some caveats first some analytic tools designed specifically for rna_seq datafor example deseq require the user to input integer based read_counts yet level read_counts are represented as non integer numbers second the upper_quartile normalization method scales gene counts by the upper_quartile value of the non zero distribution however when a sample has a relatively high number of zero counts or genes with extremely_high read_counts the value distributions may vary_considerably across samples third when researchers seek to compare the tcga level data against clinical_covariates and outcomes additional processing_steps are necessary to match rna_seq identifiers to the clinical data users without computational training may face difficulty performing these steps and scientists may duplicate each others efforts the tcga consortium also provides the rna_seq in raw form thus it is possible for researchers to reprocess the data using alternative computational_pipelines we obtained raw_sequencing for tumor_samples and normal samples across cancer_types and reprocessed the data using the subread algorithm which shows high concordance with other existing_methods regarding assignment of reads to genes but takes a relatively short time for processing seqc maqc iii rna_transcripts often span_multiple exon exon_junctions making it challenging for aligners to map reads that are smaller than the transcript length rsubreads vote and seed readmapping technique addresses this problem by breaking the reads into relatively small segments mapping the segments to the reference_genome and identifying locations where adjacent segments map to different exons this approach has been shown to be more accurate in mapping junction reads than other aligners including mapsplice the rsubread package which implements the subread algorithm is convenient for this task because i it can be applied to both single and paired_end ii it is considerably faster and requires less computer memory than many other methods and iii it requires no external software_packages for processing whereas many other packages require a series of steps that span_multiple packages we used the featurecounts function within the rsubread package to summarize the data to integer based gene level read_counts and we calculated two types of normalized value fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads_mapped fpkm and transcripts per million tpm in this pipeline the fpkm and tpm values are calculated using the total number of mapped_reads and the total number of non overlapping exonic basepairs both fpkm and tpm methods account for the length of genomic_features fpkm corrects for the number of reads that have been sequenced and tpm accounts for the average number of mapped bases per read fpkm values are used widely whereas tpm values have been shown to meet the invariant average criterion and thus may be more comparable across samples importantly fpkm and tpm are calculated using only data from an individual rna_seq sample thus adding new samples to the dataset will not require changes to the existing expression values such an approach is crucial for precision_medicine applications and for integrating data across technology platforms furthermore because we have provided raw counts it is possible for others to normalize the data using other methods with relative_ease we have made these data publicly_available along with all clinical_variables provided by tcga for these samples we have also aligned the rna_seq sample identifiers with the clinical identifiers a total of tumor_samples across cancer_types are included in the database to our knowledge this compendium of rna_seq tumor data is the largest compiled to date it includes tumor_samples and normal samples across cancer_types these data offer an alternative to the lone pipeline used by the tcga consortium in contrast to the tcga data portal which provides the rna_seq in individual files for each sample we have compiled the rsubread tumor data into aggregate data_files thus it will be easier for researchers to analyze the data and compare across cancer_types we have matched these data to clinical_variables to ease the process of examining relationships between these variables and gene_expression levels different rna_seq processing pipelines differ_considerably in accuracy for quantifying gene level expression values however our goal was not to perform an exhaustive benchmark comparison across the many tools available for processing rna_seq although others have shown that rsubread performs quite well in such benchmarks at quantifying gene_expression levels seqc maqc iii rather our goals were to provide a new community resource and to provide evidence that this alternative dataset is of high_quality and performs better in various downstream_analyses than the standard tcga data we have demonstrated that rsubread produces more consistent values across biological_replicates and we have provided evidence that our data lead to more biologically_relevant conclusions tens_of of hours of computational processing time were necessary to compile this dataset thus we also hope to prevent the need for other scientists to invest similar resources our dataset will be most useful to researchers who wish to compare gene level expression values across samples researchers who wish to work with transcript or exon level values or who wish to identify splice_junctions may find the tcga level data useful for this purpose various web_based portals exist for visualizing and analyzing tcga data these include cbioportal for cancer_genomics and the ucsc cancer_genomics browser our data could be incorporated into these portals as an additional option for users who wish to analyze raw gene counts or to use the fpkm and tpm values that we provide we plan to update the data as more cancer_types and tumor_samples become available we used open_source to align and normalize the data and have made our processing code publicly_available in addition we used single sample normalization techniques to process the data thus one can add new samples as they become available without affecting the existing data however we emphasize that it may still be necessary for researchers to correct for intersample variation when comparing data across batches and cancer_types conflict of interest none declared
