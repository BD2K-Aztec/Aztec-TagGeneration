sequence_analysis twine display and analysis of cis_regulatory many algorithms analyze enhancers for overrepresentation of known and novel motifs with the goal of identifying binding_sites for direct regulators of gene_expression twine is a java gui with multiple graphical_representations views of enhancer alignments that displays motifs as iupac consensus_sequences or position frequency matrices in the context of phylogenetic conservation to facilitate cis_regulatory discovery thresholds of phylogenetic conservation and motif stringency can be altered dynamically to facilitate detailed analysis of enhancer architecture views can be exported to vector_graphics programs to generate high_quality figures for publication twine can be extended via java plugins to manipulate alignments and analyze sequences availability twine is freely_available as a compiled java jar package or java source_code attranscription is controlled by binding of sequence specific transcription_factors to dna_sequences near a gene these binding_sites are organized into modules called cis_regulatory or enhancers understanding how specific combinations of binding_sites lead to the precise control of gene_expression in developmental_patterns or in response to physiological_regulation is a major_goal of modern biology many software_tools have been devised to aid in deciphering cis_regulatory logic by predicting binding_sites for known transcriptional_regulators or by identifying putative motifs for novel regulators databases of in vitro and in vivo binding_specificities for thousands of transcription_factors enable predictions of possible regulators for an enhancer of interest various algorithms search for enrichment of short_sequences motifs above statistical noise reviewed in however most program outputs are either text_based or output graphical_representations as raster images and it is tedious to manually annotate enhancers with binding_site predictions genome_browsers and gene browsers map binding_sites and functional genomic_information on the whole_genome and single gene scales in a dynamic fashion that allow greater user control twine complements these programs as an interactive graphical tool to analyze and compare enhancers twine displays the most common information used by researchers motif locations and evolutionary_conservation in several intuitive views to help analysis and prediction of regulatory information and the views can be exported as vector_graphics files to generate figures with scaled representations of conservation and motif locations independently set allowing control over match density strength of each match is indicated by opacity of each block the range of opacity and threshold are user adjusted clicking on graphical_representations of the alignments comparison view or conservation views automatically moves the sequence view to the appropriate location once a matrix is added thresholds can be adjusted on the fly using a slider to adjust the similarity threshold the threshold score is the negative log of the product of each positions frequency in the matrix therefore zero is the most stringent possible score to identify conserved_motifs in non optimal alignments and compensatory binding_site shifts the drift of matches between species from linear alignment can be increased so that these will be considered conserved supplementary matches can also be filtered to display only matches conserved at the current threshold motif libraries can be saved to organize collections and they can be imported en_masse from text_files containing motif matrices in commonly used formats e g jaspar motif libraries can be filtered using strings literal or regular expression matching motif descriptors supplementary using zeroto third order_markov background models enrichment of each motif over the background model are calculated using binomial and poisson distributions after opening enhancer alignments and adding motifs the organization and conservation of binding_sites within each enhancer as well as patterns of motif clustering between enhancers can be identified in the different views when threshold parameters have been adjusted to user specification each view can be saved as scalable_vector svg files where each element can be independently manipulated by programs such as adobe illustrator or inkscape in addition to svg outputs of each alignment view sub alignments can be saved in fasta_format by drag selecting a region in the aligned species or conservation plot views and saving the selection as fasta alignments thus potential minimal enhancers from larger fragments can be extracted by analyzing the conservation patterns and clustered binding_sites of likely regulators alignment data motif statistics and the set of all motif matches can be exported as a tab_delimited file for further analysis to generate representations of all deletions or binding_site mutations of a given enhancer such as from in vitro mutagenesis experiments an alignment of the wild_type sequence to sequences with each variant can be opened in twine inputting motifs for tested binding_sites generates an aligned sequence view indicating presence_or or deletion of all tested variants supplementary using a plugin interface implementing the java simple plugin framework alignedsequence objects a custom java class containing all alignments and motifs can be sent to user written java plugins modified e g aligned analyzed and manipulated then returned to twine for display several example plugins as well as a template are included future work includes expanding the suite of plugins and supporting manual adjustments to alignments and an unidentified motif motif and position frequency matrices for snail twist and dorsal from flyfactorsurvey were added the comparison view displays all four enhancers with dark blocks representing regions conserved in at least of species specified by threshold the single minded sim mesectoderm enhancer is displayed in the conservation view and sequence view organization and conservation of motif matches can be visualized at multiple_scales and thresholds and exported to vector_graphics programs
