sequence_analysis funcpatch a web_server for the fast bayesian_inference of conserved functional patches in protein d structures motivation a number of statistical phylogenetic_methods have been developed to infer conserved functional sites or regions in proteins many methods e g rate site apply the standard phylogenetic_models to infer site_specific substitution_rates and totally ignore the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates in protein tertiary_structures which may reduce their power to identify_conserved functional patches in protein tertiary_structures when the sequences used in the analysis are highly_similar the d sliding_window method has been proposed to infer conserved functional patches in protein tertiary_structures but the window_size which reflects the strength of the spatial_correlation must be predefined and is not inferred from data we recently_developed gp rate to solve these problems under the bayesian_framework unfortunately gp rate is computationally slow here we present an intuitive web_server funcpatch to perform a fast approximate bayesian_inference of conserved functional patches in protein tertiary_structures results both simulations and four case studies based on empirical data suggest that funcpatch is a good approximation to gp rate however funcpatch is orders of magnitudes faster than gp rate in addition simulations suggest that funcpatch is potentially a useful tool complementary to rate site but the d sliding_window method is less powerful than funcpatch and rate site the functional patches predicted by funcpatch in the four case studies are supported by experimental_evidence which corroborates the usefulness of funcpatch availability_and the software funcpatch is freely_available at the web_site http info mcmaster ca yifei funcpatchbecause of the fast development of sequencing_techniques the amount of sequence_data is increasing exponentially the best ways to extract biological_insights from massive sequence_data have become important questions in biology comparisons between homologous_sequences from different species are very common strategies to analyze biological_sequences for example given a set of homologous protein_sequences from different species we can compare these sequences to identify_conserved amino_acid these conserved amino_acid are more likely to be functionally_important since mutations at these sites are more likely to be deleterious to infer the conservation levels of amino_acid we need evolutionary_models to describe the substitution process of amino_acids in the evolutionary_history the simplest idea is to use the standard statistical phylogenetic_models to infer the site_specific substitution_rates and the sites with low substitution_rates may be considered to be functional for example a widely used web_server consurf uses the site_specific substitution_rates estimated by the rate site program to infer the conservation levels of amino_acid then the conservation scores are mapped onto the protein tertiary_structure to get insights on the possible functions of the highly_conserved sites while the standard phylogenetic_models are useful tools for inferring conserved sites in proteins they typically model the substitution_rate variation by some discretized distributions e g the discretized gamma_distribution and ignore the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates in protein tertiary_structures however it is well known that functional amino_acids are clustered together in protein tertiary_structures in many proteins and modeling the spatial clustering can improve the prediction of functional sites the independence_assumption of site_specific substitution_rates in the standard phylogenetic_methods may make it difficult to infer conserved functional patches in protein tertiary_structures the problem is especially acute when the sequences used in the analysis are very similar to each other because it is difficult to estimate site_specific substitution_rates accurately in this scenario due to the limited information at each amino_acid site a few methods have been proposed to relax the independence_assumption of site_specific substitution_rates to predict conserved protein patches in protein tertiary_structures these methods are useful tools for inferring conserved protein patches especially when the sequences in the dataset are highly_similar however most of these methods are based on the d sliding_window framework or other heuristic_algorithms the common problem of these methods is that they cannot infer the strength of the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates which in turn makes the inference of sitespecific substitution_rates unreliable for example the window to whom correspondence should be addressed recently we developed gp rate a phylogenetic gaussian_process model which combines statistical phylogenetics and gaussian processes to infer conserved functional_regions in protein tertiary_structures our previous study has already shown that gp rate is a powerful method to infer conserved functional_regions and is potentially a useful complementary to rate site but gp rate is a slow mcmc program in this study we present a new statistical_method funcpatch which is designed as a fast approximation to gp rate while it takes from hours to days for gp rate to analyze a protein_family funcpatch can finish a similar analysis within a few minutes an intuitive web_based graphical_interface of funcpatch is available and makes it more accessible to experimental biologists both simulations and four case studies suggest that funcpatch is an accurate approximation to gp rate the simulations also show that funcpatch may be a useful complementary to rate site but the d sliding_window method typically leads to bad results the conserved patches predicted by funcpatch in the four case studies are supported by experimental_evidence therefore we believe funcpatch is a useful tool for analyzing protein_families and guiding mutagenesis experiments unlike many other alternative_methods e g the d sliding_window method funcpatch uses a gaussian prior_distribution which naturally captures the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates in protein tertiary_structures therefore it can infer the strength of the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates in addition a bayesian_model comparison method has been implemented in funcpatch to test whether the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates is significant in a dataset the four case studies of empirical data suggest that the strength of the spatial_correlation may vary in different protein_families and our preliminary analyses on a few other protein_families also suggest that the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates may be insignificant in some protein_families data not shown we believe that the ability of inferring the strength and significance of the spatial_correlation of substitution_rates is a significant_advantage of funcpatch over the d sliding_window method our case studies in this work focus on four empirical datasets in which the divergence levels of sequences are relatively low however it is by no means the case that funcpatch cannot be used to analyze datasets in which the sequence_divergence level is high as shown in the supplementary_material the site_specific substitution_rates estimated by funcpatch are strongly correlated with the rates estimated by rate site in two large gene_families each of which consists of highly diverged sequences together with the results in simulations it seems that funcpatch and rate site typically give similar results when the sequence_divergence levels are high in practice it is always helpful to include more sequences in the analyses if it is believed that the sequences share the same conserved patches however functional_divergence may happen after gene_duplication therefore including remote_homologs may reduce the power of detecting functional patches unique to an orthologous family if researchers believe that a family of orthologous_genes has distinct biological_functions from its remote_homologs it is beneficial to infer conserved patches solely based on the family itself the traditional_methods e g rate site may not be very powerful in this scenario because of the limited information about the substitution_rate at each site funcpatch may alleviate the problem because the gaussian_process prior used in funcpatch can let an amino_acid site to borrow statistical strength from neighboring sites with similar substitution_rates therefore funcpatch is particularly useful for analyzing small gene_families or gene subfamilies derived from recent gene duplication_events
