genome_analysis vegamc a r bioconductor_package for fast downstream_analysis of large array_comparative datasets identification of genetic_alterations of tumor_cells has become a common method to detect the genes involved in development and progression of cancer in order to detect driver_genes several samples need to be simultaneously_analyzed the cancer_genome tcga project provides access to a large amount of data for several cancer_types tgca is an invaluable source of information but analysis of this huge dataset possess important computational problems in terms of memory and execution times here we present a r package called vegamc vega multi_channel that enables fast and efficient detection of significant recurrent copy_number in very large_datasets vegamc is integrated with the output of the common tools that convert allele signal_intensities in log r ratio and b allele_frequency it also enables the detection of loss of hetero zigosity and provides in output two web_pages allowing a rapid and easy navigation of the aberrant genes synthetic data and real_data are used for quantitative and qualitative_evaluation purposes in particular we demonstrate the ability of vegamc on two large tgca datasets colon_adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma_multiforme for both the datasets we provide the list of aberrant genes which contain previously validated genes and can be used as basis for further investigations availability vegamc is a r bioconductor_package available atgenetic alterations such as deletions amplification and loss of heterozigosity loh represent an important component of tumor initialization and progression technologies based on array_comparative acgh enabled the study of copy_number cnas in cancer and developmental_disorders recently high_density snp_genotyping snp cgh using a combination of two genotyping parameters a normalized intensity measurement and an allelic ratio have been used to detect cnas including loh with a high_level of accuracy and resolution genotyping_data consist of two channel intensity data corresponding to the two alleles used to compute normalized intensity and allele_frequency supplementaryshows the typical analysis process that starting from raw_data enables the detection of candidate_genes analysis starts with processing of raw_data for extraction of allele signal_intensities these intensity values are successively used to compute the log r ratio lrr and b allele_frequency baf associated with each probe lrr and baf are calculated by comparing the intensities of tumor_samples with the intensities of the respective normal samples or alternatively with the intensities of a reference_genome such as the hapmap reference_genome as also reported in the supplementary_information data are then segmented or smoothed both to decrease the noise_level and to aggregate adjacent probes into a single region generally segmentation and data smoothing are performed on one sample at time and results are independent across the samples the adjusted dataset is the input for the next analysis tool that looks for recurrent_cnas the distinction between regions functionally_related with the tumor driver cna and regions that are detected as altered by biological and experimental_noise is a critical step for these tools in order to deal with this problem statistical frameworks have been widely used to compute the probability associated with driver_mutations of course these frameworks can gain statistical strength by the analysis of a large amount of samples in this scenario the tcga project represents an invaluable source of information indeed the tcga database provides thousands of copy_number samples for common cancer_types given the resolution of snp cgh with affymetrix snp millions of probes are observed for each sample analysis of these large_datasets is not a trivial task in particular for large_datasets memory and time requirements often represent enormous obstacles for most analysis tools in the last step of the analysis available online_databases are used to get information on the genes overlapping the identified driver cna here we present a r bioconductor_package that exploiting a novel multichannel segmentation_algorithm identifies the driver_genes from lrr and baf observations supplementary we test vegamc both on synthetic data which have been previously used to compare performance of other algorithms and on two tcga datasets colon_adenocarcinoma coad and glioblastoma_multiforme gbm the analyzed tcga datasets are composed of samples of coad and samples of gbm most of the tumor_samples are also matched with normal_tissues for a total of samples in the coad dataset and samples in the gbm dataset the processing of these to whom correspondence should be addressed data represents a challenging_task results are publicly_available and they can be used for further investigations
