databases_and advance_access ontomaton a bioportal powered ontology widget for google spreadsheets motivation data_collection in spreadsheets is ubiquitous but current solutions lack support for collaborative semantic annotation that would promote shared and interdisciplinary annotation practices supporting geographically distributed players results ontomaton is an open_source solution that brings ontology lookup and tagging capabilities into a cloud_based collaborative editing environment harnessing google spreadsheets and the ncbo web_services it is a general_purpose format agnostic tool that may serve as a component of the isa software_suite ontomaton can also be used to assist the ontology development process availability ontomaton is freely_available from google widgets under the cpal open_source documentation and examples at https github com isa tools ontomaton well annotated and shared bioscience research data offer new discovery opportunities and drive science of the future several data management plans and sharing policies have emerged along with a growing number of community developed guidelines and ontologies to harmonize the reporting of experiments from different domains so that these can be comprehensible and in turn reproducible and reusable in many research_projects however the generation and collection of experimental_data occur in a multicentric distributed fashion and a variety of data types are generated often in a single experiment use of spreadsheets and related editors such as microsoft_excel for collecting experimental description is widespread among researchers due to their flexibility low learning_curve and above all ubiquity of tooling however misalignment conflicting versions the heterogeneity of free_text and also silent and unwanted auto corrections are major shortcomings to be addressed this scenario and the current budgetary restrictions require invest to save solutions to promote consistent annotation and collaborative editing of bioscience experiments assisting researchers in complying with reporting policies and community standards ontomaton is an open_source tool that leverages the collaborative environment and editing functionalities brought by google spreadsheets and provides access to ontology look up and tagging functionalities served by the ncbo bioportal and annotator web_services developed by harnessing the google spreadsheet environment and the term lookup and annotation power of the ncbo web_services ontomaton is an effective tool assisting both collaborative semantic annotation of experiments and the ontology development process several annotation tools exist but not all have support for community driven guidelines and ontologies and none of them allow collaborative annotation moreover excel based tools jones and cote cotecote tend to be platform and version dependent google spreadsheets on the other hand work across all platforms a comparison of tools attempting to mix spreadsheets with access to vocabulary servers is available at http goo gl nv lz ongoing_development of ontomaton focuses on i transformation of data into the resource_description and linked data ii support for cell level vocabulary drop down list as soon as the google api supports it and iii further integration with the isa software_suite as requested by users
