improving hiv_coreceptor usage prediction in the clinic using hints from next_generation due to the high mutation_rate of human_immunodeficiency hiv drug resistant_variants emerge frequently therefore researchers are constantly searching for new ways to attack the virus one new class of anti_hiv drugs is the class of coreceptor antagonists that block cell entry by occupying a coreceptor on cd cells this type of drug just has an effect on the subset of hivs that use the inhibited coreceptor a good prediction of whether the viral_population inside a patient is susceptible to the treatment is hence very important for therapy_decisions and prerequisite to administering the respective drug the first prediction_models were based on data from sanger_sequencing of the v loop of hiv recently a method based on next_generation ngs_data was introduced that predicts labels for each read separately and decides on the patient label through a percentage threshold for the resistant viral minority results we model the prediction_problem on the patient level taking the information of all reads from ngs_data jointly into account this enables us to improve prediction_performance for ngs_data but we can also use the trained model to improve predictions based on sanger sequencing_data therefore also laboratories without ngs capabilities can benefit from the improvements furthermore we show which amino_acids at which position are important for prediction success giving clues on how the interaction mechanism between the v loop and the particular coreceptors might be influenced availability a webserver is available atsince the discovery of the human_immunodeficiency hiv in there has been an enormous attention of researchers to hiv and the associated disease the acquired_immune the first drug against hiv was already introduced in but it soon became obvious that additional anti_hiv drugs would be needed due to the high mutation_rate of the virus even with the introduction of combination drug_therapy in the mid s the viral_populations of hiv_infected under therapy could become resistant after a certain period of time creating the need for further anti_hiv drugs that attack the virus in a different manner therefore researchers are constantly searching for new ways to to whom correspondence should be addressed limit viral_load in hiv_infected hiv needs a coreceptor on cd cells to enter the cell different hiv_strains use different coreceptors the two most prominent coreceptors are ccr and cxcr the first approved drug that blocks cell entry of ccr using viruses r viruses by serving as a ccr antagonist is called maraviroc but there is no approved drug that blocks cell entry of cxcr using hivs x viruses administering ccr blockers requires use of a companion diagnostic determining viral coreceptor usage also called viral tropism for this purpose introduced a laboratory test called trofile which was replaced by the enhanced sensitivity trofile assay esta but these methods have a long turnaround time are costly are not widely accessible and require large sample_volume recently approaches that predict viral tropism based on the genetic sequence of the v loop which is part of the envelope env_protein of hiv have been introduced all of these models were trained with either clonal sequenced data or bulk sequenced data in the former case the sequences of individual clones of r or x viruses are used and in the latter case each sequence represents a consensus of the dominating strains in the whole viral_population inside a patient such bulk sequences also comprise ambiguous sequence_positions called wobbles prediction_models based on bulk sequenced data perform in general worse than methods on clonal sequences presumably this is due partly to the fact that bulk consensus_sequences describe the dominating strains in a viral_population only incompletely and partly because small viral minorities do not show up in bulk data at all further improvements were achieved by utilizing other parts of the env sequence and information on the three_dimensional structure of the v loop of the viral surface gene very recently prediction_models for deep sequencing_data of the v loop were introduced by they used next_generation ngs_data from the maraviroc versus optimized therapy in viremic antiretroviral_treatment experienced patients motivate studies to predict virologic_response to maraviroc this dataset comprises reads per patient sample where each read corresponds to a particular v loop of an hiv variant inside the patient classified each read with standard_tools and then classified the whole sample depending on how large the fraction of reads with predicted x capable label was this means that they had to use one cutoff for the method that predicted the label for each read and another cutoff to specify the minimal fraction of x capable reads such that the sample was classified as x capable unfortunately the authors trained these thresholds directly on of the data that they then used for validation which is why it is unclear how well the method performs on unseen data instead of classifying each read separately we consider the reads of a sample jointly and train a classifier on this joint representation this is motivated by the fact that a mere percentage threshold might not have the adequate_information for deciding whether a viral_population withstands treatment with maraviroc here we present a method that analyzes the ngs_data in a more elaborate fashion we show that the new method performs better than existing_methods without training any parameters on the test data furthermore we introduce new models for predictions based on bulk sanger sequences and show how to improve predictions with a model trained on ngs_data this is particularly important since many clinics will not have access to ngs techniques for some time to come additionally we show how one can obtain interpretable prediction results and evaluate information on which of the residues of the v loop contribute to the improvement of prediction_accuracy specifically we find amino_acids at certain positions that are highly_predictive and might lead to new insights about the interaction between the v loop and the different coreceptors this section is structured into three main parts in the first part we show that by considering the reads of a patient jointly our new method that uses ngs_data has higher predictive_power than established methods furthermore we can show that one can use our ngs model to improve performance for predictions based on sanger sequences this is particularly important since many clinics are still using this sequencing_technology thus any improvement directly has an impact in the second part we demonstrate how we can use our model to visualize which sequence_positions are most informative about the classification the third part shows that the most significant sequence_positions are localized at structurally important places due to the high mutation_rate of hiv the viral_populations inside a patient are constantly_changing this is one of the main reasons why until today there is no approved vaccine against hiv it is also the main_reason why researchers constantly have to find new ways to attack the virus one of the new classes of anti_hiv drugs are ccr coreceptor antagonists since they are only effective against r viruses it is very important to apply a reliable and fast companion diagnostic before administering this type of drug to a patient phenotypic tests such as trofile or esta have a long turnaround time are costly and not easily_accessible and require a large sample_volume which is why an accurate genotypic test has many advantages we were able to build a superior predictor by prioritizing the most informative strains in a viral_population and crafting a more complex information merging procedure based on a set kernel rather than uniformly processing all strains occurring in the population and merging information by using simple cutoffs furthermore we could show how to construct better predictors for bulk sequenced sanger sequences this is very important since few clinics have the means to routinely sequence patient samples with ngs techniques additionally we provided a method to visualize how informative particular positions in the sequences are in terms of the final prediction we were also able to show which amino_acids at which positions were probably responsible for the performance_gain we used this information to speculate about the structural_differences between the v loops of r and x viruses and might help to identify important interactions between the v loop and the particular coreceptors our framework is very general one can easily incorporate additional features of interest e g structural_descriptors by using different feature encodings or other kernel functions in the inner kernel furthermore this approach is not limited to predicting coreceptor usage and should be applicable to a wide_variety of prediction_problems with ngs_data especially in cases where the whole region of interest can be covered by one read
