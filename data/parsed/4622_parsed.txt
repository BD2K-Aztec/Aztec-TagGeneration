the new protein topology graph library web_server we present a new extended version of the protein topology graph library web_server the protein topology graph library describes the protein topology on the super secondary_structure level it allows to compute and visualize protein ligand graphs and search for protein structural_motifs the new server features additional information on ligand_binding to secondary_structure increased usability and an application_programming api to retrieve data allowing for an automated analysis of protein topology availability_and the protein topology graph library server is freely_available on the web atthe huge amount of three_dimensional d protein_structures available in databases like the pdb call for tools for automated analysis and intuitive visualization of protein_structures databases such as scop and cath classify global protein topology based on semi_automated methods and expert_knowledge some automated methods such as fssp rely on global d alignments and pairwise_comparison d complex focuses on protein_complexes prosmos tops tops pro origami and the protein topology graph library ptgl all work on the super secondary_structure level and apply different methods to find substructures ligand information is of great interest to determine protein_function and in drug_discovery but most databases ignore information on ligand_binding to secondary_structure sses the ptgl is a database that uses a graph_model to describe proteins on the chain level the graphs are based on d atom data from the pdb and the sse assignments of the dssp algorithm a protein ligand graph plg is a labeled undirected graph that models one protein chain each vertex represents an sse of that chain or a ligand assigned to the chain in the pdb_file and the edges model contacts between sses including their relative spatial_orientation a hard_sphere model is used to define atom contacts a rule set determines whether two sses are in a contact based on the number of atom contacts between them for details on how the contacts and orientations are computed seefour different linear notation strings for fgs users can search the database for protein structural_motifs which is based on fast text matching in the linear notations the ptgl provides intuitive twodimensional visualizations of the fgs for all linear notations we rewrote the ptgl from scratch implemented ligand support and other new features and updated all data to the april version of the pdb which contains information on more than protein_chains the data will be updated on a regular basis by our automated update procedure
