reaction decoder tool rdt extracting features from chemical_reactions extracting chemical_features like atomatom mapping aam bond changes bcs and reaction centres from biochemical_reactions helps us understand the chemical_composition of en zymatic reactions reaction decoder is a robust command_line which performs this task with high_accuracy it supports standard chemical input_output exchange formats i e rxn smiles computes aam highlights bcs and creates images of the mapped reaction this aids in the analysis of metabolic_pathways and the ability to perform comparative_studies of chemical_reactions based on these features availability_and this software is implemented_in supported on windows linux and mac osx and freely_available at https github com asad reactiondecoderlarge scale chemical_reaction databases such as kegg brenda rhea and metacyc link reactions to enzymes and provide data_mining opportunities for novel pathways and the discovery of drugs natural_products and green_chemistry one of the primary bottlenecks for automated analyses of these chemical_reactions comes from the realizations of the imperfect quality of data such as unmapped or unbalanced reactions accurate atomatom mapping aam the one to one correspondence between the substrate and product atoms will lead to correct prediction of bond changes bcs and the ability to locate the fate of interesting atoms or substructure across metabolic_networks etc linking novel pathways or optimizing pathways of biological commercial relevance demands better understanding of metabolic routes and pathway annotation we present reaction decoder tool rdt a robust open_source for mining reaction features i e bcs reaction centres and to calculate similarity between reactions etc the algorithm and competing tools have been published in our previous_article here we present the source_code with relevant changes and below mentioned features reaction decoder is a robust tool to compute aam and extract chemical_features and calculate similarity between chemical_reactions this is coded in java and optimized to run as a computationally asynchronous process it is distributed under gnu gpl v license
