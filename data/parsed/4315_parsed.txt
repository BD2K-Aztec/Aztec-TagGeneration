genome_analysis snpsnap a web_based for identification and annotation of matched snps an important computational step following genome_wide gwas is to assess whether disease or trait associated single_nucleotide snps enrich for particular biological annotations snp based enrichment_analysis needs to account for biases such as co localization of gwas signals to gene dense and high linkage_disequilibrium ld regions and correlations of gene size location and function the snpsnap web_server enables snp based enrichment_analysis by providing matched sets of snps that can be used to calibrate background expectations specifically snpsnap efficiently identifies sets of randomly drawn snps that are matched to a set of query snps based on allele_frequency number of snps in ld distance to nearest gene and gene density availability_and snpsnap server is available atgenetic loci identified by genome_wide gwas point to biology that help us to understand the etiology of complex_traits and diseases a typical first step following gwas is to assess whether associated loci as a group implicate biological_pathways or whether associated single_nucleotide snps are enriched for annotations such as non coding functional_elements or missense_variants the simple approach comparison of associated snps with random sets of snps is susceptible to bias from nonrandom clustering of functionally_related and the greater likelihood of associated snps to be within large genes and regions of strong linkage_disequilibrium ld and other potential_confounders if not properly accounted for by appropriate matching of random sets of snps these biases may lead to spurious enrichments for instance brain pathways typically containing large genes that are more likely to harbor associated snps will appear to be overrepresented in most sets of gwas loci the snpsnap web_server identifies randomly_selected snps with similar genetic properties as a set of query associated snps random snps are matched based on minor_allele number of snps in ld ld buddies distance to nearest gene and number of nearby genes gene density by using sets of random but matched snps investigators can compute enrichment statistics on more appropriate negative controls to get an unbiased empirical estimate of the significance of enrichment results obtained with associated snps we and others have previously used a similar approach however currently there is no software_tool that formally implements this approach
