genome_analysis parent specific copy_number in paired_tumor studies using circular_binary motivation high_throughput techniques facilitate the simultaneous measurement of dna_copy at hundreds of thousands of sites on a genome older techniques allow measurement only of total copy_number the sum of the copy_number contributions from the two parental chromosomes newer single_nucleotide snp techniques can in addition enable quantifying parent specific copy_number pscn the raw_data from such experiments are two_dimensional but are unphased consequently inference based on them necessitates development of new analytic_methods methods we have adapted and enhanced the circular_binary cbs algorithm for this purpose with focus on paired test and reference samples the essence of paired parent specific cbs paired pscbs is to utilize the original cbs algorithm to identify regions of equal total copy_number and then to further segment these regions where there have been changes in pscn for the final_set of regions calls are made of equal parental copy_number and loss_of loh pscn estimates are computed both before and after calling results the methodology is evaluated by simulation and on glioblastoma data in the simulation pscbs compares_favorably to established methods on the glioblastoma data pscbs identifies interesting genomic_regions such as copy neutral loh availability the paired pscbs method is implemented in an open_source r package named pscbs available on cran http cran r project org changes in the number of copies of genomic_dna is an important step in the progression of cancer comparative_genomic cgh was developed to identify these changes at a resolution of mb platforms for copy_number cn analysis that employ microarray_technology and that achieve high_resolution include array_cgh roma and snp_arrays current_technology has improved the resolution to as low as kb with custom arrays also available the resolution in particular neighborhoods can be even higher heretofore cn analysis has consisted primarily of examining total copy_number tcn tcn is the sum of the cns from the two parental chromosomes for normal human cells total cn is two one from each parental chromosome snp_arrays allow separate estimates of cn from the parental chromosomes this is parentspecific copy_number pscn pscn may be interesting for two major reasons first there may be alleles that differentially undergo cn change estimating pscn would help elucidate this situation second when the total cn is c the pscns may be more complicated than c for instance diploid c cn is maintained when one parental copy is lost and the other is doubled this type of alteration is called copy_neutral cn loh and it occurs often in many cancers including glioblastoma and hematologic_malignancies o such a region would be assumed normal if there was analysis only of total cn direct estimates of pscn can be made only for snps at which a subject is heterozygous homozygous snps are not directly informative because all the cn signal is in one allele for example if both parents contributed g then there would only be a g cn signal and this would result in no information additional to that contained in total cn for heterozygous snps however there are two components to the cn information if the subject was gt at a snp then there would be a cn estimate corresponding to g and one corresponding to t one of the cns would be expected to have come from one parent and the other to have come from the otherhere we assess the performance and correctness of paired pscbs first we assess the performance of pscbs relative to extant methods on previously simulated_data second we show that pscbs finds interesting genomic_regions on glioblastoma data and that its results are similar for affymetrix and illumina arrays we developed an extension of cbs to estimate parent specific cn from snp data in a simulation it identified gains_and accurately and performed favorably compared with some of its competitors a matched affymetrix and illumina real_data example showed consistent and visually appealing segmentation_results pscbs consists of a concatenation of several tests and estimates in an ideal world we would compute an exact probability that it estimates allele specific cn correctly anyone who sees explicit computation as a target will conclude that at any step of the process an accurate calculation would be conditional on the outcomes of all previous steps such a computation is impossible no matter the order in which it is attempted despite our inability to provide a precise probability we trust that readers will agree that there are persuasive arguments for use of the algorithm they include demonstration that it is successful in achieving goals for which it is intended as mentioned in section regions in the simulation were called cn loh if they were not called gained or lost and if the parentspecific estimates were unequal the first should be uncontroversial
