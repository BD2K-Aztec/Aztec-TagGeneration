automated quantmap for rapid quantitative molecular network_topology analysis the previously disclosed quantmap method for grouping chemicals by biological_activity used online services for much of the data_gathering and some of the numerical_analysis the present work attempts to streamline this process by using local copies of the databases and in house analysis using computational_methods similar or identical to those used in the previous work a qualitatively equivalent result was found in just a few seconds on the same dataset collection of drugs we use the user_friendly galaxy framework to enable users to analyze their own datasets hopefully this will make the quantmap method more practical and accessible and help achieve its goals to provide_substantial assistance to drug_repositioning pharmacology evaluation and toxicology risk_assessment availability http understanding interrelationships between drugs toxins and other chemicals is an important part of discovering new ways to make better medicines avoid toxicity or achieve any of a variety of goals for systems chemical_biology for many applications chemicals are commonly compared structurally according to computed or measured properties another method is to compare the associations with biological_systems one notable application of this method is the connectivity_map which relates biologically_active chemicals to gene_expression data our published quantmap method explores the connections of chemicals to proteins through proteinprotein networks in this article we adapt the partially manual quantmap method to a rapid automated system with an easy to use interface opening up for moderately larger datasets as well as integration with other tools in batch analysis
