state and parameter_estimation of the heat_shock system using kalman and particle filters motivation traditional models of systems_biology describe dynamic biological_phenomena as solutions to ordinary_differential which when parameters in them are set to correct values faithfully mimic observations often parameter_values are tweaked by hand until desired results are achieved or computed from biochemical_experiments carried_out in vitro of interest in this article is the use of probabilistic modelling tools with which parameters and unobserved variables modelled as hidden_states can be estimated from limited noisy observations of parts of a dynamical system results here we focus on sequential filtering_methods and take a detailed look at the capabilities of three members of this family i extended_kalman ekf ii unscented_kalman ukf and iii the particle filter in estimating parameters and unobserved states of cellular response to sudden temperature elevation of the bacterium escherichia_coli while previous_literature has studied this system with the ekf we show that parameter_estimation is only possible with this method when the initial guesses are sufficiently close to the true_values the same turns out to be true for the ukf in this thorough empirical exploration we show that the non parametric method of particle_filtering is able to reliably estimate_parameters and states converging from initial distributions relatively far away from the underlying true_values availability_and software implementation of the three filters on this problem can be freely downloaded fromin systems_biology sets of ordinary_differential odes are often used to characterize biochemical_reactions the differential_equations capture our knowledge of the underlying interactions in a quantitative way and solutions to such systems of equations help explain behaviour at an overall systems level much of the work in the area deals with deterministic differential_equations often non linear e g hill kinetics unknown parameter_values in their specification such as reaction_rates are obtained from biochemical to whom correspondence should be addressed experiments_conducted in vitro or are set to specific values by elaborate hand tuning so that a set of observations from the system under study are best explained sometimes such parameters may not have direct biological interpretations and are used as approximations the yeast_cell model of is a good example of this the parameter_estimation problem has often been posed as a search and optimization_problem in the literature for example have explored a range of optimization_methods including steepest descent gradient search techniques and methods suitable for global optimization such as simulated_annealing and genetic_programming in the parameter_estimation of metabolic systems an alternate method using spline approximation of the solution using linear_and programming is described in a recent paper these authors consider an enzyme_kinetic system and a subset of a cell_cycle model show how parameters of a developmental gap gene circuit model may be estimated by extensive search_methods such approaches to model based explanation of biological_phenomena often do not take into account system and measurement noise in the modelling process they also do not explicitly seek to infer parameter_values or unobserved states from noisy measurements techniques using bayesian_inference are alternatives to optimization based_approaches but having the added motivation of being able to capture uncertainties in parameter and state estimates examples of work along these lines include who consider stochastic systems and vyshemirsky andaddress ode based systems for which parameter_estimation is performed by markov_chain mcmc methods in a probabilistic_inference framework some authors have recently studied the role of sequential estimation methods for state and parameter_estimation from systems_biology models formulated as state_space models lillacci and khammash fall into this category the first three of these use parametric methods based on kalman filtering whereas the latter two use the non parametric approach of particle_filtering the power of the tools we explore in this article have been demonstrated in other areas of application over many decades these include the adaptive estimation of neural_networks target tracking from bearing only measurements modelling futures contracts in computational finance and to find global minima of artificial_neural in the context of biology and wilkinson are examples of using probabilistic dynamical_systems models to characterize biological_systems and to make parameter_estimation and inferences from them while most literature on the subject focuses on batch based models in which parameter_estimation and inference are performed on all the available data our attention is on sequential or online methods the kalman_filter and its variants and the particle filter pf belong to this family the formulation of jointly estimating state and parameters by an extended state representation we pursue is due to who applied unscented_kalman ukf to analyze two dynamical_systems the lotkavolterra system and the lorenz system unknown_parameters are treated as states with their time variation set to zero to motivate non parametric particle_filtering with the argument that computation is sufficiently cheap to be able to do this used an exceedingly large number of monte_carlo samples to completely cover all the possible states and parameters space for a complex system such as the mammals circadian genetic control model which has unknown_parameters while this is an ambitious attempt motivated under the term peta computing we do not believe the authors make a persuasive case for flooding the space with particles instead as we find in this work a modest number of particles of the order of a few thousands offer very attractive performance in parameter_estimation additionally applied extended_kalman ekf to simultaneously estimate the states and parameters of two real_datasets i e jak_stat signal_transduction and ras_raf regulatory_pathway the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section we give the generic formulation of systems_biology models cast in state_space form in section we describe the three algorithms in section we define the heat_shock model we use as our test problem and in section we present our results and discuss them typical results needed to support our conclusions are presented in the main_body of this article and more detailed results covering the estimation of various parameter combinations being estimated are given as online supplementary_material accompanying this article in the journals website this work demonstrates the effectiveness of the method of particle_filtering in state and parameter_estimation of deterministic systems biological_models from noisy observations we have shown this via a comparative_study between extended kalman unscented kalman and particle_filtering applied to the heat_shock system using single and multiple parameter estimations while previous authors have argued that the kalman_filter itself is capable of such estimations our critical_appraisal shows that this is only possible when the initial guess of the state and or state parameters are very close to the true_values convergence is not achieved when the initial_conditions differ significantly from the corresponding true_values the pf on the other hand is able to converge to true_values even when all the particles are initially set to values far away from the underlying true_values providing a powerful yet simple to implement way of tackling difficult inference problems in systems_biology we further showed in this work that when the complexity of the problem is gradually_increased i e the number unknown_parameters states to be inferred the kalman_filter algorithms failed well before the pf did even in the extreme case of all parameters being unknown the pf manages to find correct estimates of five of the six this suggests that the non parametric approach of the pf by virtue of being able to systematically propagate uncertainties while exploring the space over a wide_range is a powerful methodology to tackle such difficult_problems our current work concentrates on stretching such analyses to more difficult higher dimensional problems such as cell_cycle circadian_rhythm and sino atrial pace making in heart_tissues
