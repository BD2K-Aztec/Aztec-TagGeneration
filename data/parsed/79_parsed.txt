gene_expression a combined omics study on activated_macrophages enhanced role of stats in apoptosis immunity and lipid_metabolism background macrophage_activation by lipopolysaccharide and ad enosine triphosphate atp has been studied extensively because this model system mimics the physiological context of bacterial_infection and subsequent inflammatory_responses previous_studies on macro phages elucidated the biological_roles of caspase in post transla tional activation of interleukin b and interleukin in inflammation and apoptosis however the results from these studies focused only on a small number of factors to better understand the host response we have performed a high_throughput study of kdo lipid a kla primed macrophages stimulated with atp results the study suggests that treating mouse bone_marrow with kla and atp produces synergistic_effects that are not seen with treatment of kla or atp alone the syn ergistic regulation of genes related to immunity apoptosis and lipid_metabolism is observed in a time dependent_manner the synergistic_effects are produced by nuclear_factor kappa_light enhancer of activated b cells nf_kb and activator_protein ap through regulation of their target cytokines the synergistically regulated cytokines then activate signal_transducer stat factors that result in enhanced immunity apoptosis and lipid_metabolism stat enhances immunity by promoting anti_microbial factors and stat contributes to downregulation of cell_cycle and upregula tion of apoptosis stat and stat also regulate glycerolipid and eicosanoid metabolism respectively further western_blot for stat and stat showed that the changes in transcriptomic levels were consistent with their proteomic levels in summary this study shows the synergistic interaction between the toll_like and purinergic receptor_signaling during macrophage_activation on bacterial_infection availability time course data of transcriptomics and lipidomics can be queried or downloaded from http www lipidmaps org lipopolysaccharide lps is an endotoxin from bacterial_cell that stimulates leukocytes via a toll_like tlr pathway kdo lipid a kla is an active_component of lps with an analogous response in activating macrophages the tlr signaling_pathway ultimately mediates the release of pro_and factors by activating mitogen_activated nuclear_factor kappa_light enhancer of activated b cells nf_kb and or activator_protein ap in this study we have primed macrophages with kla before stimulation with atp kla priming represents bacterial exposure which elicits subsequent_release of atp in the extracellular_space from inflamed damaged or dying cells atp then acts via autocrine_and signaling and is interpreted as a danger_signal by immune_cells these events induce the transcription of pro_inflammatory through the transcription_factors tfs nf_kb and ap interestingly a model system of atp stimulation of lps primed macrophages exhibited increased cell_death compared with the macrophages treated with either atp or lps alone the increased apoptosis caused by lps and atp treatment was reduced with caspase_inhibitors but not with mitogen_activated protein_kinase pk c or pk a inhibitors in addition to lps and atp treatment there have been a number of studies on lps primed macrophages stimulated by various ligands including air particles lysophosphatidic_acid interferon ifn il and toxicants el moreover sequential_activation of one or more tlr receptors by their respective ligands was studied in lpsprimed macrophages most of these studies showed the importance of selected genes or cytokines in lps primed macrophages to mimic the biological_context of bacterial_infection and subsequent immune_response in addition to the cytokine_response lps_stimulated macrophages showed changes in lipids such as eicosanoids sphingolipids sterols glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids knapp and english to whom correspondence should be addressed we used paired_t between experiments and control case i analysis and unpaired_t between the three treatments case ii analysis to identify differentially_regulated see section the results from the paired_t in the case i analysis showed few significantly regulated_genes in the a group at min h with the number increasing from min to h and then decreasing and b in the case of k and ka groups h priming with k before the first measurement affected many genes so that the number of significantly regulated_genes at min was in the k group the number of significantly regulated_genes peaked at min equivalent to h min after treatment with k and decreased_substantially after min in contrast the ka group showed the number of regulated_genes to remain_high for most of the time points to identify the similarities and the differences across the different treatments venn diagrams were drawn for all the time points and supplementary the results suggested that there is a significant number of regulated_genes unique to the ka treatment zone c in the venn_diagram not regulated in either the k or the a treatment alone however case i analysis has two problems the first problem relates to false ka unique genes that showed up as differentially_regulated in the ka treatment because of slight_differences in p values near the threshold for example a gene with a p value just below the threshold in the ka treatment but just above it in the k or a treatment would erroneously be identified as unique to the ka treatment the second problem relates to missed kaunique genes genes differentially_regulated in all three treatment groups but significantly more regulated in the ka group than in the k or the a group as a result of synergistic_effect to circumvent these problems the case ii analysis of the unpaired_t between the treatment groups was adopted in the case ii analysis two independent unpaired t tests were performed between ka and k groups and between ka and a groups the results from the first t test produced the list of the genes that are differently regulated in the ka group compared with the k group these genes were either affected by a or synergistically affected by ka circle a similarly the genes from the second t test were either affected by k or synergistically affected by ka circle k the intersection between the two t test results then produced the list of genes that are differently regulated in the ka group compared with both the k and the a groups intersection aik uniquely regulated_genes in the ka group were categorized into synergistic and antagonistic subsets based on the direction and the magnitude of the regulation in the two comparisons synergistic regulation is used here in a less restricted manner to include genes significantly regulated by ka as compared with k and a alone this view includes but goes beyond the traditional definition of synergism this approach was taken to identify all the genes regulated by both k and a a gene was considered to be synergistically regulated if its regulation in the ka group versus both the k and the a group was significantly_higher or lower for example a gene that shows a fold_change in the ka group but only fold changes in both the k and the a group was considered to be synergistically upregulated other possible cases of the synergistic_effect are defined in supplementary on the other hand a gene was considered to be antagonistic if its regulation in the ka group was upregulated with respect to the k group but downregulated with respect to the a group or vice_versa pathway enrichment for the case ii synergistic genes was done for all the time points to find the pathways that are synergistically affected by the ka treatment shows the histogram of the number of regulated_genes for all the time points in selected top enriched pathways tfs from the case ii synergistic set of genes were also mapped to the subset of their target_genes which showed synergistic regulation at the same or future time points for case i tf target_genes mapping see supplementary the results of case ii analyses are presented here
