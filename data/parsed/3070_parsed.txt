molblocks decomposing small_molecule sets and uncovering enriched fragments the chemical_structures of biomolecules whether naturally_occurring or synthetic are composed of functionally_important building_blocks given a set of small moleculesfor example those known to bind a particular proteincomputationally decomposing them into chemically meaningful fragments can help elucidate their functional properties and may be useful for designing novel compounds with similar properties here we introduce molblocks a suite of programs for breaking down sets of small_molecules into fragments according to a predefined set of chemical rules clustering the resulting fragments and uncovering statistically enriched fragments among other applications our software should be a great aid in large_scale chemical analysis of ligands binding specific targets of interest availability_and molblocks is available as gpl c source_code atendogenous small_molecules are synthesized in the cell in a modular fashion using building_blocks or fragments that are often conserved across organisms fragment_based has also emerged as an important paradigm to navigate the diversity of the chemical landscape and to profile protein druggability further it has been shown that the toxicity of certain drugs can be explained by the presence in their structure of fragments that are shared by toxic_compounds although many programs are available to assemble small_molecules from fragments the reverse problem of breaking down small_molecules and analyzing the corresponding fragment sets has been studied less extensively an implementation of the recap algorithm to fragment small_molecules can be found in a commercial program fragmenter www chemaxon com and is available in the rdkit library http www rdkit org which also implements the brics fragmentation algorithm however given a diverse set of small_molecules that share a property of interest there is no automated tool to identify statistically enriched fragments that might explain their activity here we introduce the molblocks suite which allows users to break down small_molecules into chemically meaningful fragments and analyze the resulting fragment distribution the software consists of two command_line programs fragment and analyze the fragment program reads userdefined rules to specify the bonds to break or uses default sets of rules recap ccq www chemaxon com and brics then the program applies these rules to fragment the molecules and generates all fragments with a number of heavy_atoms above a minimum_size defined by the user the analyze program collects statistics on the frequency with which each fragment occurs clusters fragments using a user_defined similarity threshold based on a fingerprint representation o of the fragments and selects a representative fragment for each cluster this program can also perform enrichment_analysis at the level of either fragments or clusters a typical scenario where fragment and enrichment_analyses can be applied is when dealing with a library of small_molecules a subset of which has a specific property of interest in these cases molblocks can be used to fragment the whole library and determine which if any fragments are significantly_enriched in the set with the property of interest fragmentation and enrichment_analysis of small_molecules may also be useful in analyzing proteins for example ligands bound by proteins that share a common property such as a specific function can be analyzed in this manner such an approach would provide a complement to the functional enrichment_analyses that are routinely performed with gene_ontology extensive fragmentation of the entire drugbank collection of small_molecules with the default rules took s on an imac with a ghz processor a users guide with implementation details and more tests is provided with the suite
