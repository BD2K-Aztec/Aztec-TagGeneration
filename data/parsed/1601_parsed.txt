epiq efficient detection of snp snp epistatic_interactions for quantitative_traits motivation genegene_interactions are of potential biological and medical interest as they can shed light on both the inheritance mechanism of a trait and on the underlying_biological evidence of epistatic_interactions has been reported in both humans and other organisms unlike single locus genome_wide gwas which proved efficient in detecting numerous genetic_loci related with various traits interaction based gwas have so_far produced very few reproducible discoveries such studies introduce a great computational and statistical burden by necessitating a large number of hypotheses to be tested including all pairs of single_nucleotide snps thus many software_tools have been developed for interaction based casecontrol_studies some leading to reliable discoveries for quantitative data on the other hand only a handful of tools exist and the computational_burden is still substantial results we present an efficient algorithm for detecting epistasis in quantitative gwas achieving a substantial runtime speedup by avoiding the need to exhaustively test all snp_pairs using metric embedding and random projections unlike previous metric embedding methods for casecontrol_studies we introduce a new embedding where each snp is mapped to two euclidean spaces we implemented our method in a tool named epiq epistasis detection for quantitative gwas and we show by simulations that epiq requires hours of processing time where other methods require days and sometimes weeks applying our method to a dataset from the ludwigshafen risk and cardiovascular_health study we discovered a pair of snps with a near significant interaction p genome_wide gwas have so_far detected thousands of single_nucleotide snp loci that are associated with various traits unfortunately for most complex_traits the discovered snps explain only a small fraction of the estimated heritability a phenomena often referred to as the missing_heritability one plausible explanation suggested for this problem is the existence of an epistatic effect where two or more loci have a synergetic influence on the phenotype also referred to as genegene_interactions the discovery of interacting snp loci has an additional benefit as it may shed light on the underlying biological mechanism or involved pathways despite evidences of genegene_interactions reported in both human and other organisms very few reproducible discoveries were reported by gwas for example the amount of data produced in a single study is a possible cause when searching for groups of k snps with an epistatic effect the number of possible k sized groups is m k where m is the number of snp loci with current gwas typically including hundreds of thousands of snps this implies both a computational and statistical burden even for groups sizes as small as k the numerous tests takes days and even weeks to compute and require a substantial correction for multiple hypothesis leading in some cases to a loss of power one common approach is the reduction of the search_space usually by filtering candidate loci pairs suggested selecting a subset of snps with a moderate marginal_effect and testing for interaction in pairs where at least one locus is included in the subset reduction of the search_space can also be done by manipulating contingency_tables or searching for a linkage_disequilibrium ld contrast between cases and controls a more straightforward approach is increasing the computational power either by multi_threaded implementations or by utilizing special hardware binary operations are used in some cases to speedup performance all of these tools and many others are designed for case_control whereas for the quantitative case where the tested phenotypes are physiological_measurements of some sort the selection of available software is limited since the phenotype tested is not dichotomous testing for quantitative associations can be more challenging compared with casecontrol_studies as methods utilizing contingency_tables ld contrast or binary operations are usually inapplicable methods

dichotomizing the phenotype as in however the resulting statistical_test is different than the original thus a loss of power is inevitable and would be difficult to quantify in this study we present epiq epistasis detection for quantitative gwas an efficient algorithm for detecting pairs of snp loci that have an epistatic effect on quantitative phenotypes epiq achieves a substantial runtime speedup by avoiding the need to exhaustively test all snp_pairs it applies a carefully_chosen transformation that maps each genotyped snp to a vector in a euclidean_space this transformation has the property that snp_pairs with an epistatic effect are converted to vector pairs with a large inner product a random projections method is subsequently applied to efficiently recover these snps a novelty of our method is that each snp is projected to two different points for a more efficient detection of interacting snps we show on simulated_data that in just h our algorithm was able to process a dataset that would take days or weeks using state of the art software and present the results of running epiq on data from the ludwigshafen risk and cardiovascular_health luric study in this section we show that in just a few hours epiq can process amounts of data that would take weeks and even years on common existing software we demonstrate how the power of epiq is affected by the underlying model of interaction and present the results of applying epiq to a dataset from the luric study in this article we demonstrated how random projections methods can be applied on quantitative gwas achieving in most cases at least an order of magnitude speedup compared with other existing_tools scaling linearly with the number of snp_pairs we showed that epiq required only h on processors for a real_dataset of snps and individuals identifying a pair of snps with a possible epistatic interaction demonstrating that the models assumptions do not hinder an efficient discovery of interacting pairs this speedup is gained in exchange of a minor loss of power as mentioned before a search for interacting snp_pairs in current gwas suffers from an inherent multiple_testing where p values must be as small as or less in order to be considered significant like rapid and sixpac prabhu and peer have done epiq turns this limitation into an advantage for a given sample_size smaller p values are a result of larger effect_sizes this in turn makes interacting pairs more distinct from the rest of the snps and consequently easier to detect by epiq the drawback is that as sample_size increases a smaller effect_size is required for achieving the same significance_level in this case epiq is required to perform more iterations in order to distinguish between interacting and non interacting pairs and therefore does not scale linearly with sample_size thus as gwas expand to include increasingly larger cohorts further adjustments in the algorithm would be required we wish to state that the settings used in this article are only a portion of a wide_range of options the approach we described can be extended to fit other statistical_tests and the binarycoding of the genotypes can be performed differently than described to match other underlying models of interaction epiq can also be used in conjunction with methods such as the genome_wide rapid association testing grat which utilize ld between snps for choosing a subset of proxy snps thus reducing the number of tests and further improving runtime moreover the runtime reported relates to the current code implementation of the algorithm different implementations such as gpu based code are likely to achieve even better results with the decrease in runtime permutation_tests for significance become a feasible option resulting in increased power compared with stringent methods for multiple hypothesis correction
