convolutional_neural architectures for predicting dna protein binding motivation convolutional_neural cnn have outperformed conventional methods in modeling the sequence_specificity of dnaprotein binding yet inappropriate cnn architectures can yield poorer_performance than simpler models thus an in depth understanding of how to match cnn architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of cnns for computational_biology applications results we present a systematic exploration of cnn architectures for predicting dna_sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription_factor datasets we identify the best performing architectures by varying cnn width depth and pooling designs we find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif based tasks we show the benefits of cnns in learning rich higher_order sequence_features such as secondary motifs and local sequence_context by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty we also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark_datasets using approaches that control potentially confounding_effects like positional or motif strength bias is critical in making fair comparisons between competing_methods we explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks and we have created a flexible cloud_based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural_network architectures for problems in computational_biology availability_and all the models analyzed are available at http cnn the recent application of convolutional_neural to sequence_based problems in genomics signals the advent of the deep_learning era in computational_biology two recent methods deepbind and deepsea successfully_applied deep_learning to modeling the sequence_specificity of protein binding with a performance superior to the best existing conventional learning methods learning tasks in genomics often have tens_of or more training examples which makes them well adapted to training convolutional_neural without overfitting such training examples are typically drawn from high_throughput data such as those produced by the encyclopedia of dna elements encode_project the convolutional_neural used by deepbind and deepsea are essential building_blocks in deep_learning approaches in computer vision the adaptation of convolutional_neural from computer vision to genomics can be accomplished by considering a window of genome_sequence as an image instead of processing d images with three color channels r g b we consider a genome_sequence as a fixed_length d sequence window with four channels a c g t therefore the genomic task of modeling dna_sequence proteinbinding specificity is analogous to the computer vision task of twoclass image classification one of the biggest advantages of a convolutional_neural for genomics is its ability to detect a motif wherever it is in the sequence window which perfectly suits the task of motif identification and hence binding classification we have conducted a systematic exploration of the performance of convolutional network architectures for the fundamental genomic task of characterizing the binding_affinity of transcription_factors to dna_sequence in different chip_seq we designed v c the author published_by
