structural_bioinformatics membuilder a web_based graphical_interface to build heterogeneously mixed membrane bilayers for the gromacs biomolecular simulation program motivation molecular_dynamics md_simulations have had a profound impact on studies of membrane_proteins during past_two but the accuracy of md_simulations of membranes is limited by the quality of membrane models and the applied force_fields membrane models used in md_simulations mostly contain one kind of lipid molecule this is far from reality for biological_membranes always contain more than one kind of lipid molecule moreover the lipid_composition and their distribution are functionally_important as a result there is a necessity to prepare more realistic lipid_membranes containing different types of lipids at physiological concentrations results to automate and simplify the building process of heterogeneous lipid_bilayers as well as providing molecular topologies for included lipids based on both united and all atom force_fields we provided membuilder as a web_based graphical_user availability_and membuilder is a free web_server available from www membuilder org the plasma_membrane forms a boundary between the cytoplasm and the extracellular_environment and as such plays fundamental roles in the chemistry of living_organisms membranes also partition eukaryotic cytoplasms into intracellular_compartments they are home to membrane_proteins accounting for of the genome that carry out a variety of functions ranging from membrane_trafficking and signal_transduction to transportation of organic_and compounds therefore there is an urgent need to understand membrane associated proteins better and to know how they interact with membrane components the spatial inhomogeneity of lipid_molecules in particular that of sphingomyelin and cholesterol across the secretory membrane system affects localization of membrane_proteins and permeability a fluid membrane_structure is needed to model how membranes affect protein_structure it has proved difficult to determine high_resolution d structure of membrane_proteins to map proteinmembrane interactions in atomic detail structural and energetic information on these interactions would provide_important about membrane protein_function and assembly molecular_dynamics md_simulations have provided significant new insight into fundamental interactions within membrane_systems one major_concern in setting up a membrane_protein simulation is the construction of realistic lipid_bilayers it is well known that lipid_molecules are distributed asymmetrically between the leaflets of biomembranes which have functional_importance accordingly md_simulation of membrane models should aim to model_membranes with physiologically_relevant lipid compositions heterogeneous membrane models with specified lipid_composition should be used for obtaining additional details on the properties of membrane_proteins even though it is realized that the equilibration of complex membranes will take a long time to this end published the charmm gui membrane builder for mixed bilayers following this approach here we provide membuilder a web_server with a simple interface to automate the building of heterogeneous membranes for the biomolecular simulation program gromacs because there is a large user base for the gromacs package there will be a significant demand for this kind of service using membuilder one can select a set of lipid_molecules with specified quantities to build heterogeneous lipid_bilayers based on both all atom and united atom force_fields with explicit support for bilayers with asymmetric lipid_composition membuilder assists gromacs users in building membrane bilayers it provides topology files of lipid_molecules in gromacs format currently the gromos a a s and a and amber slipid amber force_fields are supported to demonstrate the correctness of the output six simulations with generated bilayers are reported in the supporting_information all simulations are stable and equilibrate within ns further lipids force_fields and geometries such as micelles nanodisks and liposomes will be supported in future versions to help users to investigate membranes through molecular_dynamics simulations lipid a escherichia_coli l a e lipid a pseudomonas_aeruginosa l a p dipalmitoyl sn_glycero phosphoinositol bisphosphate dpi palmitoyl_oleoyl poc palmitoyl_oleoyl phosphoethanolamine poe palmitoyl_oleoyl pog n stearoyl d erythro sphingosylphosphorylcholine sgm stearoyl oleoyl sn_glycero sop
