bioinformatics btq tex systems_biology standard virtual biological_parts a repository of modular modeling components for synthetic_biology motivation fabrication of synthetic biological_systems is greatly_enhanced by incorporating engineering design principles and techniques such as computer_aided design to this end the ongoing standardization of biological_parts presents an opportunity to develop libraries of standard virtual parts in the form of mathematical_models that can be combined to inform system design results we present an online repository populated with a collection of standardized models that can readily be recombined to model different biological_systems using the inherent modularity support of the cellml model exchange format the applicability of this approach is demonstrated by modeling gold medal winning igem machines availability_and the repository is available online as part of http models cellml org we hope to stimulate the worldwide community to reuse and extend the models therein and contribute to the repository of standard virtual parts thus founded systems model architecture information for the systems model described here along with an additional example and a tutorial is also available as supplementary_information the example systems model from this manuscript can be found at http models cellml org workspace bugbuster the template models used in the example can be found atsince the discovery of recombinant_dna scientists have manipulated living_organisms in order to produce biofuels drugs or other biomaterials over the years a biotechnology industry has emerged exploiting this technology and delivered a number of successes however in most cases the development of biotechnology applications has been the product of a manually driven trial and error based_approach in order to achieve efficient and reliable biological system fabrication synthetic_biology promotes the application of to whom correspondence should be addressed engineering principles such as abstraction standardization and characterization to biology these concepts have proven to be crucial in other engineering disciplines in order to mature from dedicated craftsmanship to successful industrial solutions arguably to date in synthetic_biology the best example of such an approach is the registry of standard biological_parts sbps the registry http www partsregistry org provides a collection of standard dna parts biobricks that have been designed to facilitate dna assembly through the international genetically_engineered machine igem http www igem org competition the use of the registry has clearly demonstrated the power of standardization in biology to stimulate innovation and creativity a critical lesson learnt from other engineering disciplines is that mathematical_modeling can dramatically_increase the speed of the design process as well as reducing the cost of development a holy_grail in biological modeling would be to design reliable and robust biological_systems in silico prior to fabrication just as aeronautic engineers design planes using their computer_aided design cad tools cad tools are already being developed in order to ease the process of designing synthetic biological_systems however they currently lack access to modular and reusable mathematical_models accurate_models of sbps are required for the prediction of system function but it is also crucial that mechanisms to easily compose part models into complete systems are available therefore in parallel to increasing the number of parts available and characterizing them experimentally a logical extension to the registry would be to build a repository of modular models of sbps to complement the physical part registry here we describe the development of an online repository of standard virtual biological_parts svps mathematical_model components describing the function of sbps which can be downloaded extended and recombined to aid the design in silico of synthetic biological_systems repositories of models are already available such as the biomodels_database however the curated models in this database are monolithic and do not allow further composition without some modification previous work has already explored the importance of modularity in modeling biological_systems for example rodrigo et_al reports the use of a library of parts encoded in sbml the composition of models has also been demonstrated using the modeling system promot and the modeling descriptionwe have developed the first iteration of standardized modular synthetic_biology models in cellml incorporating both common genetic_elements and biochemical_reactions we show how models using these formulations can be reused and extended to compose complex models during the design of synthetic biological_systems without modification of the aggregated models we provide an online repository for collaborative development of further model components and systems models by the global synthetic_biology modeling community we demonstrate the applicability of this approach by modeling examples from award winning igem machines we hope to foster the development of more template svp and systems models by the modeling community and their storage online as more models are contributed and existing_models have their parameters refined the usefulness of the repository will increase this work provides an initial set of designs for templates and svps and as such does have some limitations for maximum benefit from modeling the kinetic_parameters for each svp would have to be accurately measured this issue is common to the entire field of synthetic_biology some important measures such as pops are not directly measurable at present however as is already occurring in the related field of systems_biology we expect accurate measurement for the parameterization of system components to be conducted as a process of iterative refinement the development of a library of promoters with quantified activity was recently demonstrated and specification sheets for biological_parts have also been proposed and developed efforts such as these may help to standardize the sbps that we are modeling with svps pragmatically useful formulations may depend upon what is measurable until measurement issues are resolved it may be that the optimal mathematical formulation for synthetic device_design purposes remains_unknown with complete certainty appropriate formulations may also be refined by the investigation of non specific effects in genetic_systems designed systems are sometimes partially limited in that we do not fully comprehend all the interactions in a living_cell particularly if the cell grows and divides in the future we hope to extend our models to realistically simulate the system output against the background functions of the cell on a time scale comparable with the cells growth_cycle to facilitate this it would be useful to develop experiment based tests for svps and systems models_built from themdoes the biological system actually behave as the simulation if not why not pursuing these questions may lead to further insights both for modeling and biological science at the technical level there are also opportunities for the development of more tools to enhance model construction the encapsulation of template models by svps is currently done interactively in environments such as opencell but could in theory be performed automatically by software prompting the user only for the appropriate parameterization the connection of the svps in the systems model is done by forming interface components these components tend to follow a standard format and could also be produced semi automatically by software with the user specifying which svps to connect and the positive_or effect of the associated fluxes on particular species this work presents the foundation on which tools catering for these more streamlined processes could be built to aid computational composition and synthetic_biology cad annotation of the models with metadata to give them semantic meaning would be of great benefit a research_project in this area is currently underway while at present models link where appropriate to the registry of sbps it would also be advantageous to link from the registry to the svp repository it may also be useful to link svp models with other repositories besides the parts registry for example molecular_species such as enzymes may benefit from having specific information associated with them such as ec_number or similar which could be implemented via each species having its own svp with metadata linking to the appropriate repository such metadata would facilitate much needed computerassisted searching for appropriate svps for particular modeling projects in addition currently svps can be combined in any order where the units of their connecting variables allow however aside from units checking it is up to the modeler to ensure that the connections make sense with respect to the biological reality being modeled metadata and metadata aware tools could potentially provide checking that svp connections are biologically_meaningful reducing cognitive_load on the modeler and structural_modeling mistakes since however the supporting metadata specification is still being defined these features have not been incorporated for this first design iteration the cellml language is itself under development with proposals for version being considered reusing svp and templates without modification has been demonstrated here through the use of flexible glue code but reusing entire systems models also without modification may become possible through proposed enhancements borrowed from set theory another proposal concerns extending cellml simulators to enable stochastic_simulation which if implemented would increase the applicability of svps still further finally the cellml model repository is under continuous development hence interface enhancements and new functionality
