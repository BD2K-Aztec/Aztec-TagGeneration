probfold a probabilistic_method for integration of probing_data in rna_secondary motivation recently new rna_secondary probing techniques have been developed including next_generation based_methods capable of probing transcriptome_wide these techniques hold_great for improving structure prediction_accuracy however each new data type comes with its own signal properties and biases which may even be experiment specific there is therefore a growing need for rna_structure prediction_methods that can be automatically trained on new data types and readily extended to integrate and fully_exploit multiple types of data results here we develop and explore a modular probabilistic_approach for integrating probing_data in rna_structure it can be automatically trained given a set of known structures with probing_data the approach is demonstrated on shape datasets where we evaluate and selectively model specific correlations the approach often makes superior use of the probing_data signal compared to other methods we illustrate the use of probfold on multiple data types using both simulations and a small set of structures with both shape dms and cmct data technically the approach_combines stochastic_context scfgs with probabilistic_graphical this approach allows rapid adaptation and integration of new probing_data types availability_and probfold is implemented in c models are specified using simple textual formats data reformatting is done using separate c programs source_code statically compiled binaries for x linux machines c programs example datasets and a tutor ial is available fromobtaining accurate secondary_structure is a crucial step toward understanding the physical_properties of rna_molecules and the biological_roles of structural rna_elements however computational predictions based only on the primary sequence are often inaccurate and therefore insufficient for in depth interpretation similarly structure probing_data typically only provides partial structural_information directly modeling both types of data in the folding_process generally improves structure prediction_accuracy while most studies have used methods based on energyminimization the inclusion of probing_data in probabilistic folding models has not been fully explored here we develop and explore a modular probabilistic_approach for integrating probing_data in rna_secondary which we call probfold the focus is on how to best exploit the structure signal of the probing_data while keeping the models general and easy to adapt to new probing_data types or additional layers of probing_data we have not aimed to develop a competitive single_sequence structure_prediction method the main focus is therefore on the use of the probing_data signal rather than the overall performance probabilistic modeling offers a coherent framework for combining different types of evidence as they are all naturally measured on the same scale structure models based on energy_minimization do not extend naturally to additional types of data in the same way for instance probing_data measurements must be translated to pseudoenergy perturbations before they can be included in the models though they do not have inherent thermodynamic interpretations probabilistic approaches have previously been used to incorporate comparative evidence in structure folding this is another example of supplementing the primary sequence with partial structure evidence and as such closely_related to the probing_data modeling problem studied here several of these methods exploit that generative probabilistic methods can be combined and their parameters optimized in a unified_approach for instance pfold combines previously_established models of molecular_evolution phylogenetic_models with probabilistic_models of rna_secondary stochastic_context scfgs we aimed to develop a method called probfold that could be readily extended to disparate data types and could encompass different probabilistic_models for these in particular they should be able to capture correlations both within and between data types this is achieved by combining scfgs with probabilistic_graphical pgms the scfg defines a prior over secondary_structures as it does in most other probabilistic methods the pgms model the sequence and any layers of probing_data given the structure pgms are flexible and modular models useful for capturing select dependencies in high_dimensional in our case they model dependencies between the sequence and the probing_data as well as dependencies along the sequence standard algorithms allow efficient training of both scfg and pgms as well as prediction of the optimal secondary_structure importantly this allows probfold to be automatically trained without hand setting any parameters given a sufficiently sized training_set of known structures with probing_data the size of the needed training_set depends on the number of free_parameters in the model rna_structure probing has a long history and many different methods exist including use of chemical_agents rnases b and spontaneous cleavage generally these modify bases or the backbone preferentially at either single or paired positions allowing positional_information on base_pair status through gel_electrophoresis or sequencing in the case of the shape reagent selective hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer_extension it is the flexibility of the backbone that determines reactivity which is generally higher for unpaired than paired regions the interpretation of structure probing_data is challenged by incomplete specificity of the methods noisy or missing_data nucleotide biases etc which results in incomplete labeling of the primary sequence into paired and unpaired positions for instance in the case of shape the distributions of reactivities for paired and unpaired bases are largely overlapping see section there is therefore a great need for computational_methods that can integrate and make optimal use of probing_data beyond interpreting the data as a definite labeling of the primary sequence recently progress have has been made on this problem with both physics based_methods sampling based_methods and a probabilistic_method these are briefly presented below see eddy for a detailed_review and discussion of their statistical foundations in rnastructure shape reactivities are converted to base_stacking pseudo energy change terms using a linear_model optimized by prediction_performance on a known structure s rrna from escherichia_coli e coli extends this approach in the rnasc method by also including pseudo energy change terms for unpaired positions gtfold provides a fast parallelized multi core implementation of the energy_minimization algorithm and similarly includes shape data in an extension of rnafold pseudo energy change terms are optimized for each structure given a loss function to maximize the agreement between the energy based prediction and the experimental_observations in particular no change is made when the sequence prediction is in complete_agreement with the shape data recently the viennarna package has been extended to include several forms of soft constraints and specifically include implementations of theapproaches a thorough performance comparison of the three approaches is also provided another class of approaches samples structures from the boltzmann weighted ensemble and selects a representative structure with minimal manhattan distance to a probing_data profile this has been extended to several layers of probing_data by a method that reduces them to a single binary pairing status profile the recently_proposed probabilistic_method ppfold extends pfold by modeling both comparative sequence_alignment data and experimental probing_data it uses stochastic_context scfgs to model secondary_structures phylogenetic_models to model alignment columns and fine_grained discrete probability_distributions to model shape probing_data the study provides a proof_of for including probing_data in probabilistic methods compared to ppfold probfold offers a more general extendible and parameter sparse modeling_approach that is evaluated using cross_validation we develop probfold using existing shape data combined with an extensive set of known rna_structures and evaluate a hierarchy of increasingly parameter rich models we find that including both base_pair stacking_interactions and neighbor correlations for the shape data improve performance we also show how multiple types of probing_data can be included in the models and may improve prediction_performance we find that the probfold approach exploits the probing_data well generally yielding higher performance gains than other methods and present automatic procedures for optimizing the models on new data types we have presented a probabilistic_method for rna_secondary that integrates experimental structure probing_data one of the virtues of our approach is its flexibility the underlying model was initially_developed on a capillary_electrophoresis shape dataset but it can readily be retrained and applied on other data types given sufficient training data as well as extended to handle multiple data types we demonstrated these extensions with proofof concept examples on existing datasets and on generated bootstrapped data we developed and trained versions of probfold for shape shape seq dms and cmct probing_data both individually and in combination we also evaluated different variants of these models for instance including nucleotide dependencies the flexibility is achieved by the use of a highly modular probabilistic_model with accompanying efficient algorithms for training and prediction as with most other probabilistic rna_secondary prediction_methods we use stochastic_context to model the secondary_structure we find limited_benefit of modeling stacking_interactions as have others this may be because individual base_pair parameters already account for most of the stacking interaction effects we factorize the grammar rules into transitions and emissions in contrast to other methods we explicitly specify the emission distributions using probabilistic_graphical pgms which may be defined over multi variate input_data the implementation closely reflects this modularity with separate textual specifications of the overall grammar the transitions the pgms defining the emission distributions and the mapping of observed data to pgm variables as part of the model development we evaluated correlations in the probing_data we found modeling shape probing_data correlations along the sequence improved_performance given enough training data was present in general detecting and modeling the prominent dependencies in the observed data is expected to improve the fit and the discriminatory_power of the emission distributions and hence overall model performance however including correlations makes the models more complex with many additional free_parameters to learn given the limited size of probing datasets for training overfitting and lack of robustness easily becomes a problem as shown for parameter rich versions of probfold e g supplementaryand supplementary probfold bins the continuous probing_data values to allow for the use of discrete pgms this simplifies the pgm implementation for instance by avoiding computationally_expensive numerical integration and avoids use of analytical continuous distributions with a potentially poor fit as the structural signal of the probing_data depends on the differences in its distribution in different structural regions both the number of bins and their boundaries are important parameters of the model we show that the number of bins should be kept small given the amount of available training data to avoid_overfitting we suggest to select bin boundaries by optimizing the difference between the single and pair probing_data distribution using kl divergence as an alternative to discretizing the data parameter free continuous distributions such as kernel distributions could be used these however easily become computationally heavy as they in principle are specified by the full training_dataset given knowledge of the uncertainty of the probing_data observations a more satisfying approach would be to explicitly_model the uncertainty of the individual probing_data values such knowledge would be available e g with counts from ngs based probing_data as some of transcriptome_wide approaches produce the rnastructure method converts shape reactivities to pseudo energy change terms which are incorporated when predicting the minimal free_energy structure the conversion is done using a simple linear parametric form which only requires two free_parameters using a simple parametric form limits the number of free_parameters but may also introduce bias if the fit is poor in part of the probing_data value range in particular rnastructure has been shown to perform extremely well on s rrna when introducing several preprocessing_steps and filters such as i selecting parameters performing well on s ii limiting the allowed distance between base_pairs iii focusing on sites with useful shape data and iv disregarding sites with clear incompatibilities with the comparative reference structure though individually helpful manually selecting parameters and introducing many preprocessing_steps risk making the approach more liable to overfitting on a concrete dataset direct calculation of pseudo energy change terms based on log likelihood_ratios of being paired versus unpaired has also been suggested which is closer to the approach taken by probfold probfold has been designed with the aim of extendibility to multi variate probing_data measurements this could for instance be the combination of shape with other chemical or enzymatic probing agents as in the proof_of example using cmct dms shape data if the noise in the individual measurements at a site are correlated it becomes important to capture these correlations in the model to retain specificity such correlations could for instance be caused by tertiary_structure interactions involving single_stranded regions which may affect several types of probing agents including shape specifically non canonical base_pairs will often give similar signal to canonically paired bases using shape but not dms learning such correlations would therefore be expected to improve prediction_performance as more and more rna_tertiary are found one solution could be to explicitly include tertiaryboth the f value and the change in f value df relative to the sequence only seq only predictions are shown the maximal performance score for each combination of probing_data types is denoted in bold see supplementaryfor the full set of performance statistics structure aspects into the model in the case of shape we did not observe any correlation between paired bases however such correlations may well exist for other types of probing agents such as double_stranded rnases even partial evidence for the presence of specific base_pairs could significantly improve performance by constraining and simplifying the folding problem such evidence would resemble the signal exploited from compensatory base_pair exploited in comparative rna_structure analysis as suggested by s k sd et_al additional power could be gained by combining experimental probing_data with comparative_data though this would be limited to functional and conserved rna_structures however exploring these extensions is beyond the scope of the current study through proof_of experiments we have illustrated the applicability of probfold to different types of probing_data and to multiple complementary datasets the performance_evaluations show that probfold can make efficient and competitive use of the probing_data both for shape data and when combining multiple datasets tables and retraining aids its adaptation to varying noise levels however model performance is limited by the small_size of the available training_datasets which restricts model_complexity and hence predictive_power we hope the advent of ngs based high_throughput structure probing techniques as pioneered by
