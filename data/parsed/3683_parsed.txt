prediction of the permeability of neutral drugs inferred from their solvation properties motivation determination of drug_absorption is an important component of the drug_discovery process in that it plays_a in the decision to promote drug_candidates to clinical_trials we have developed a method that on the basis of an analysis of the dynamic distribution of water_molecules around a compound obtained by molecular_dynamics simulations can compute a parameter free value that correlates very well with the compound permeability measured using the human_colon caco cell_line assay results the method has been tested on twenty three neutral drugs for which a consistent set of experimental_data is available we show here that our method reproduces the experimental_data better than other existing_tools furthermore it provides a detailed view of the relationship between the hydration and the permeability properties of molecules the study of drug_absorption is of critical importance in the development of effective drugs the path of a drug from the site of administration to its target cells or compartments implies the crossing of several semipermeable cell_membranes therefore it is relevant to be able to predict whether and to which extent a molecule can pass through the cell_membranes passive permeation of drugs through the biological cell_membranes is obviously strongly_dependent the molecule physicochemical_properties it has been established that the acidbase character of the molecule which influences the charge of the molecule at the specific ph its lipophilicity which affects its partition between aqueous and lipid environments and solubility are the most relevant_parameters to take into account these parameters are well described by the molecule hydropathy profile a more lipophilic drug is more likely to effectively cross the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer on the other hand extremely hydrophobic molecules insoluble in aqueous body_fluids might be poorly absorbed in summary there should be an appropriate balance between the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of a molecule from an experimental point_of data on permeability can be obtained by in situ and or in vivo animal_studies but these are time consuming and expensive experiments and therefore only performed towards the end of the drug_development process efforts have therefore focused on the development of in vitro permeability assays that can mimic the relevant characteristics of in vivo absorption among these there are the parallel artificial membrane_permeability assay pampa the human_colon caco cell_line assay the madin_darby mdck cell assay the rat duodenal immortalized cell_line assay a cell and the rat everted gut sac assay all of them are routinely used for the preliminary assessment of drug permeability in particular the caco cell is v c the author published_by in silico permeability prediction is consistent with available published_data we computed four indicators i y i n i and i described in the methods section for each of the drugs in our dataset as explained in detail in the methods section these indices are derived from the conditional_probability of finding a water_molecule with a given orientation around the solute atoms estimated from the results of molecular_dynamics simulations in particular the first two i y and i n provide information about the hydrophilic and hydrophobic_properties of the compound and are computed from the probability_values of finding water_molecules in the first and second hydration shells respectively i and i are related to the dipole orientation of the water_molecules surrounding the analyzed compound and therefore to the effect of its positive_and charges the values of the indices for the analyzed molecules are reported in supplementary table s three of these parameter free indicators i n i and i correlate remarkably well with the permeability data while the i y index shows a lower level of correlation we tested whether a combination of these indices can represent a good proxy for estimating the permeability of a molecule to this end we used a multiple_linear algorithm as implemented in the r function lm to find the weights providing the best correlation with the caco experimental_data the tool also provides the probability p value of a computed coefficient to be different from we tested both linear and quadratic terms in the regression the best correlation is obtained by a linear fit of the i n and i indices p value while i y and i were found to contribute very little to the overall correlation p value this is consistent with the values of their correlation_coefficients see the regression_model corresponding to the best fit is where a p value b p value and c p value histograms of p h hi jr and p h d jr for diazepam in both histograms the cells highlighted in grey are used to calculate the sum of the conditional_probability densities at each given angle and distance in the p hhi jr histogram the yellow arrows indicate the first and second component of the hydrophilic index related to the two peaks in the first hydration shell the green arrows show the first and the second component of the hydrophobic peaks that are localized in the second hydration shell in the p h d jr histogram the blue arrow indicates the contribution of positive charge_distribution the pink arrow indicates the contribution of the negative_charge distributionin table we also report the correlation between each index and the caco permeability_values as aspect the highest linear correlation value is between i n index hydrophobic index and caco permeability value because a more lipophilic drug is more likely to effectively cross the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer more interesting is the correlation linked to positive charge_distribution index i it can be observed that the index with the highest value of negative correlation is i indicating that most likely positive groups prevent uptake of compounds more than negative ones see also supplementary reports the predicted ppred permeability_values obtaining using eq for all the drugs considered and shows that they reproduce very well the experimental caco permeability_values pearsons_correlation r we also performed a cross_validation analysis by repeatedly leaving out of the compounds testing sets and re computing the coefficients of eq on the remaining ones training_sets as described in the methods section we iterated this procedure_times randomly choosing the training_set at each step the predicted average values p pred cv obtained for each drug in the test_set are reported in once again the correlation between prediction and experiment is very satisfactory the coefficients of eq are also very stable their average value and standard_deviation obtained in the cross_validation runs are a b and c the average difference between the predicted and experimental values is cm s it is relevant to mention here that the threshold used to discriminate between low absorbance and high absorbance compounds is usually set to cm s and the data shown indemonstrate that only in two cases acyclovir and zidovudine our method would significantly misclassify the compound in summary eq describes well the permeability properties of neutral compounds it is worth noticing that the p pred value is well balanced in the sense that it overestimates and underestimates the experimental values in a similar number of cases and respectively we compared our results with those of several other methods as described in the methods section and the results are reported inand supplementarye it can be appreciated that the correlation between predicted and experimental values is higher for our method the average_error is lower than all other tested methods but for the gua method that shows a very similar value also the correlation value between each index and caco experimental value is reported the first column reports the drug name the second reports the experimental values the third ppred the values obtained using eq the last column reports the predicted values obtained in the cross_validation test p pred cv we have shown here that an approach based on the simultaneous analysis of molecule hydrophobicity and charge_distribution has the potential to accurately_predict the passive plasma membrane_permeability of neutral drugs this method may be useful for investigating the mechanism of passive permeation of small neutral compounds since it can easily provide information on the role that every single atom plays on the hydration process our p pred indicator correlates very well with the experimentally_determined caco permeability_values and performs better than other available methods furthermore it only requires the knowledge of the chemical_structure of the compound given the cost and impact of late_stage failures in drug_development we believe that the relatively high_computational of running the molecular_dynamics simulations an average of hours on a cpu server for each molecule is not necessarily a relevant drawback of the approach as is the case also for several in vitro methods our method cannot estimate the permeability of drugs that use an active_uptake system in these cases additional techniques such as docking the compounds to efflux influx protein models should be explored the goodness_of parameters r and r are also shown
