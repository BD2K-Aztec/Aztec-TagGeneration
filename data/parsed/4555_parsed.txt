systems_biology testing multiple biological mediators simultaneously motivation modern biomedical and epidemiological_studies often measure hundreds_or of biomarkers such as gene_expression or metabolite_levels although there is an extensive statistical literature on adjusting for multiple_comparisons when testing whether these biomarkers are directly associated with a disease testing whether they are biological mediators between a known risk_factor and a disease requires a more complex null_hypothesis thus offering additional methodological_challenges results we propose a permutation approach that tests multiple putative mediators and controls the family_wise we demonstrate that unlike when testing direct_associations replacing the bonferroni_correction with a permutation approach that focuses on the maximum of the test_statistics can significantly improve the power to detect mediators even when all biomarkers are independent through simulations we show the power of our method is larger than the power achieved by bonferroni_correction finally we apply our permutation_test to a case_control of dietary risk_factors and colorectal_adenoma to show that of test metabolites docosahex aenoate is a possible mediator between fish_consumption and decreased colorectal_adenoma risk availability_and r package included in online supplementary_material mediation_analysis or causal_inference offers numerous methods for testing if a single variable mediates the relationship between a known exposure and an outcome these methods assume that a known exposure e affects an outcome y and aim to test whether this effect is at least partially transmitted through a mediator m for example in biology these methods have suggested that the negative impact of lead exposure on cognition is mediated by a decrease in the volumes of specific brain_regions and that the association between certain variants in the fto gene and increased body_weight is mediated by a lowered response to satiety cues with new technologies such as microarrays next_generation and highthroughput metabolomics it is possible to simultaneously test whether or s of biomarkers mediate a known relationship in our motivating study investigators aim to identify metabolites that mediate the association between increased fish_consumption and a reduced risk of colorectal_adenoma our current objective is to define a testing procedure that accounts for multiple_comparisons and maintains a desired family_wise fwer guided by the methods developed for testing direct_associations we develop a permutation approach for testing multiple mediators specifically we design a permutation method that tests whether any biomarker meets a common definition of a mediator we say that m is a mediator if it is both associated with the exposure e and conditional on e associated with the outcome y our first step is to define a permutation method for testing a single mediator our defined method uses the freedman andapproach for testing the conditional association between m and y in contrast to previous methods that use the manly approach and will therefore be more robust to outliers unfortunately as has already been noted there can be no exact permutation method for testing a conditional association in addition to having its own value our presentation of the single mediator test aims to illustrate the inherent difficulty in designing a permutation_test for a composite null_hypothesis when testing mediation the null_hypothesis allows for either an association between e and m or a conditional association between m and y approaches designed for testing direct_associations which permute only the exposure or outcome cannot simulate such a composite null_hypothesis this article is structured so that methods for testing mediators can be described by comparing and contrasting them with methods for testing associations we begin by describing permutation_tests for a single association and the extensions needed for testing multiple associations then we introduce permutation methods for testing a single mediator and the extensions for testing multiple mediators the following simulations_demonstrate that the potential increase in power from replacing the bonferroni_correction with a joint correction is greater when testing for mediation than when testing for direct association finally we apply our method to our motivating example and offer a brief discussion to whom correspondence should be addressed we developed permutation methods for testing multiple putative mediators although such methods can be applied in a variety of settings we considered the specific application of a modern epidemiological_study that measures or s of similar biomarkers e g gene_expression protein or metabolite_levels we show via simulations that testing putative mediators by using the joint correction has substantially_higher power over bonferroni_correction even when all biomarkers are conditionally independent we apply our approach to the navy colorectal_adenoma study and find evidence suggesting that dha may mediate the protective_effect of fish_consumption on adenoma risk which would not have been found using bonferroni we first defined a permutation method for testing a single mediator this method was used to lay the groundwork for describing our tests of multiple mediators but is also novel in the single mediator literature whereas prior permutation methods used the manly approach for testing the conditional association between m and y we used theapproach which in general appears to be a more robust approach we then extended this method to testing multiple mediators using either the bonferroni_correction or a joint correction the key_component of our methods required to handle the composite null_hypothesis in both the single and multiple mediator scenarios is to use two sets of permutations a simpler but incorrect alternative to our approach would be to repeatedly permute y to obtain one null_distribution of s joint then repeatedly permute e to obtain another null_distribution and let p s be the maximum of the two p values however if atest b limiting case the solid lines illustrate the power for test b light and test j dark as a function of within block correlation when there are null mediators and true mediator mediators in different blocks are uncorrelated the dashed lines show the limiting power when the null mediators are replaced with independent null mediators subset of metabolites was associated with the exposure and a different subset was associated with the outcome then the observed s joint would appear extreme as measured by either simple null_distribution as with any approach for testing mediation our method presumes that the causal paths considered inare correct thus we assumed that the only causal paths that may exist are from the exposure to the biomarkers from the biomarkers to the outcome and from the exposure directly to the outcome unmeasured confounders might also lead to incorrect inferences such a confounder might for example induce a relationship between m and y causing to appear to be non zero if this same metabolite were associated with e the result would be a false_positive despite this limitation causal analysis still offers one of the best methods for testing putative mediators given the popularity of high_throughput investigators will soon require methods for testing multiple putative mediators this manuscript is one of the first to introduce
