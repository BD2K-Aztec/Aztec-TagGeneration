systems_biology sparse non negative generalized pca with applications to metabolomics motivation nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy has been used to study mixtures of metabolites in biological_samples this technology produces a spectrum for each sample depicting the chemical_shifts at which an unknown number of latent metabolites resonate the interpretation of this data with common multivariate exploratory methods such as principal_components pca is limited due to high_dimensionality non negativity of the underlying spectra and dependencies at adjacent chemical_shifts results we develop a novel modification of pca that is appropriate for analysis of nmr_data entitled sparse non negative generalized pca this method yields interpretable principal_components and loading vectors that select important features and directly account for both the non negativity of the underlying spectra and dependencies at adjacent chemical_shifts through the reanalysis of experimental nmr_data on five purified neural_cell we demonstrate the utility of our methods for dimension_reduction pattern_recognition sample exploration and feature_selection our methods lead to the identification of novel metabolites that reflect the differences between these cell_types metabolomics one of the newest fields within systems_biology approaches to biomarker_discovery in medicine investigates an abundant pool of small_molecules present in cells and tissues one of the commonly used technologies for acquisition of this data is nuclear_magnetic nmr_spectroscopy it is a high_throughput technology for acquiring reproducible and resolved spectra that can be used to study the complete metabolic_profile of a biological_sample the spectra contain thousands of chemical resonances which may belong to hundreds of metabolites however many metabolites resonate at multiple resonances and thus unlike the typical dna microarray_data different metabolite spectra overlap to whom correspondence should be addressed and introduce complexities that need to be addressed by signal_processing and careful statistical_analysis as understanding relationships between the set of biological_samples and the underlying spectra is a challenge principal_components pca is commonly used for both dimension_reduction and pattern_recognition with nmr_data in high_dimensional settings however it is well known that pca can perform poorly due to the large number of irrelevant variables hence many have proposed to incorporate sparsity into the principal component directions thus selecting important features non negativity of the matrix factors or principal component directions has also been proposed in a number of settings to improve interpretability of the factors several recent papers have combined these concepts to encourage both sparsity and non negativity into the model in this article we make the following statistical contributions i propose a framework for incorporating sparsity known structural dependencies and non negativity into the principal component pc loadings and ii develop a fast computationally_efficient algorithm to compute these in high_dimensional settings this work is presented in section then in section we evaluate the performance of our methods on real nmr_data we also demonstrate how to interpret the pc loadings to understand important biological patterns and identify candidate metabolites in section we conclude with a summary of the implications of our work and future areas of research we have presented a framework for incorporating structural dependencies sparsity and non negativity into pca by comparing our techniques to traditional pca methods on real nmr_data we have demonstrated the many advantages of our methods future areas of research are to extend our framework to supervised multivariate_analysis techniques such as partial_least and linear discriminant to better classify nmr samples while we have demonstrated our methods on d h nmr_spectroscopy our approach can be applied to many other high_throughput metabolomics technologies mass_spectrometry and other spectroscopy techniques also produce a spectrum of non negative variables additionally many researchers employ multidimensional spectroscopy to further identify metabolites in a sample in this data each sample_consists of a matrix of spectroscopy variables sparse non negative gpca can be applied to this multidimensional data in a straightforward manner by vectorizing the matrix of variables and employing a d kernel smoother over the lattice of variables as a future area of research one can also extend our methods to tensors or higher_order pca to find patterns and achieve dimension_reduction for this multidimensional metabolomics_data in addition to metabolomics_data our methods are general and hence applicable to a variety of other structured biomedical data as the dependencies of the noise must be known to construct the quadratic operator our methods can be used to find patterns in data where these noise dependencies are well established possible further applications of our methods then include copy_number and methylation data in which variables strongly depend on known chromosomal location and microscopy neuroimaging and other bio medical_imaging data in which pixels are spatially_correlated with adjacent pixels in conclusion we have developed a novel modification of pca particularly suited to the challenges associated with analyzing nmr_data while our methods show numerous advantages in the analysis of metabolomics_data there are still many open research problems and potential extensions related to our work
