genome_analysis binoch binding inference from nucleosome_occupancy changes transcription_factor binding_events are frequently associated with a pattern of nucleosome_occupancy changes in which nucleosomes flanking the binding_site increase in occupancy while those in the vicinity of the binding_site itself are displaced genome_wide information on enhancer proximal nucleosome_occupancy can be readily acquired using chip_seq targeting enhancer related histone_modifications such as h_k here we present a software_package binoch that allows biologists to use such data to infer the identity of key transcription_factors the response of a cell to a stimulus or determine a program of differentiation availability the binoch open_source python_package is freely_available liulab dfci harvard edu binoch under the freebsdalthough transcription_factors are known to have a high_affinity for specific dna_sequences binding is often cell_type and condition specific therefore dna_sequence alone is a poor predictor of in vivo genome_wide binding locations when the relevant transcription_factors are known and suitable antibodies are available chip_chip technologies enable us to map their genome_wide binding locations in many cases however the transcription factors_governing a regulatory response are not known or antibodies suitable for chip_seq are not available without transcription_factor specific_antibodies it is nevertheless possible to infer transcription_factor binding_events based on two observations first transcription_factor are often associated with certain types of post_translational histone_modifications in particular histone h lysine mono h_k and di methylation h_k second transcription_factor binding is frequently associated with a pattern of nucleosome_occupancy changes in which nucleosomes flanking the binding_site increase in occupancy while those in the vicinity of the binding_site itself are displaced transcription_factor tf binding_events can therefore be inferred by comparing nucleosome resolution h_k chip_seq under treatment to whom correspondence should be addressed and control conditions we present a software_package binoch to allow biologists to carry out an analysis of nucleosome_occupancy data to discover stimulus induced transcription_factor binding
