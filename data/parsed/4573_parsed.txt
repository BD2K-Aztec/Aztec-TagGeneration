structural_bioinformatics the binding_site distance test score a robust method for the assessment of predicted protein binding_sites motivation we propose a novel method for scoring the accuracy of protein binding_site predictionsthe binding_site distance test bdt score recently the matthews correlation_coefficient mcc has been used to evaluate binding_site predictions both by developers of new methods and by the assessors for the community_wide prediction experimentcasp while being a rigorous scoring_method the mcc does not take into account the actual d location of the predicted residues from the observed binding_site thus an incorrectly predicted site that is nevertheless close to the observed binding_site will obtain an identical score to the same number of non binding residues predicted at random the mcc is somewhat affected by the subjectivity of determining observed binding residues and the ambiguity of choosing distance cutoffs by contrast the bdt method_produces continuous scores ranging between and relating to the distance between the predicted and observed residues residues predicted close to the binding_site will score higher than those more distant providing a better reflection of the true accuracy of predictions the casp function predictions were evaluated using both the mcc and bdt methods and the scores were compared the bdt was found to strongly correlate with the mcc scores while also being less susceptible to the subjectivity of defining binding residues we therefore suggest that this new simple score is a potentially more robust method for future evaluations of proteinligand binding_site predictions the prediction of a proteins ligand_binding location and potential interacting residues is important in the elucidation of protein_function de_novo drug_design mutagenesis_studies and ligand binding_specificity the casp experiment included a function prediction category for the first time in casp where the aim was to predict the enzyme commission number ec and gene_ontology go terms due to the difficulty in assessing these terms the casp assessors decided that casp was not the best place for this format of function prediction to whom correspondence should be addressed thus for casp function prediction was included in a different format with the assessment of observed ligand_binding residues as many casp_targets were shown to crystallize with biologically_interesting ligands in casp function predictions were assessed using the matthews correlation_coefficient mcc the mcc is a statistical metric that utilizes the number of true_positive false_positive false_negative and true negative residues giving a score between and a score of indicates a prefect prediction and a score close to indicates a random prediction the mcc provides a good assessment statistic because it heavily penalizes both over and under predictions and is appropriate for biased datasets such as binding versus non binding residues in order to assess binding residue prediction_accuracy the observed binding_site residues must be defined however defining which residues are in contact with a ligand can often be subjective particularly if we consider the inherent flexibility of protein backbones side_chains and many large ligands the distances used to define residueligand contacts can be adjusted nevertheless once a cutoff has been set all non binding residues are treated as incorrect by the mcc score regardless of their distance from the site the top methods in the function prediction category of casp were methods by the lee group and the sternberg group both groups assessed their own predictions by two additional metrics accuracy and coverage however these metrics also penalize close predictions to a similar extent as the mcc statistic in this article we are proposing a simple new metric the bindingsite distance test bdt score which addresses the problems associated with the mcc while maintaining the advantages the score is highly_correlated with the mcc and it appropriately penalizes both under and over predictions while also considering the distance of predicted residues from the observed binding_site
