gene_expression improved quality_control processing of peptide centric lc_ms proteomics_data motivation in the analysis of differential peptide peak_intensities i e abundance measures lc_ms analyses with poor_quality peptide abundance data can bias downstream statistical_analyses and hence the biological_interpretation for an otherwise high_quality dataset although considerable effort has been placed on assuring the quality of the peptide_identification with respect to spectral processing to date quality_assessment of the subsequent peptide abundance data matrix has been limited to a subjective visual_inspection of run by run correlation or individual peptide components identifying statistical outliers is a critical step in the processing of proteomics_data as many of the downstream statistical_analyses e g analysis_of anova rely upon accurate estimates of sample variance and their results are influenced by extreme_values results we describe a novel multivariate statistical strategy for the identification of lc_ms with extreme peptide abundance distributions comparison with current method run by run correlation demonstrates a significantly better rate of identification of outlier runs by the multivariate strategy simulation_studies also suggest that this strategy significantly_outperforms correlation alone in the identification of statistically extreme liquid_chromatography lc_ms the majority of statistical strategies to assess peptide protein differential abundances from liquid_chromatography lc_ms proteomic experiments are based on analysis_of anova methodologies applied to peak_intensities i e abundance measures of proteolytic peptides however to whom correspondence should be addressed the anova approach relies upon accurate estimates of sample variance and proteomics_studies not only have inherent variability associated with the biological_samples but potentially diverse process based sources of variability that is the accurate estimate of sample variances is often difficult to obtain for example sample_preparation protocols and instrument variations associated with the lc column particularly important for multi column platforms and mass_spectrometer can cause variations in peak_intensities as well as peptides identified across ms analyses within an experiment data_quality is especially important when the number of biological_samples is small often the case in proteomics experiments and extreme_values can negatively influence all subsequent data analysis outcomes identification of statistical outliers in univariate data is an established but highly debated statistical topic there are many consecutive outlier procedures focusing on one suspect value at a time that have been proposed and implemented across many fields of application such as grubbs test and dixons q test because these methods iteratively remove outlier points the false_positive i e type error is inflated in contrast recursive outlier_detection procedures detect the presence of any number of outliers and control type errors for example jain presents a recursive version of grubbs test andderived a sequential application of wilkss multivariate outlier test there are downfalls to these recursive procedures i they are designed for univariate data and if applied to multivariate_data will likely fail to detect statistically influential extreme_values and ii they are negatively_affected by masking i e the inability to detect an outlier in the presence of another outlier and swamping i e identify non outliers as outliers effects the identification of statistical outliers in multivariate_data such as microarray and proteomic_data is non trivial the multiple_dimensions of the data often subject outliers to masking the microarray community however has made considerable progress in applying statistical metrics to assess the quality of microarray_data of particular applicability to proteomics_data are the ideas presented bythey note that a poor_quality array will impede the statistical and biological_significance of the analysis due to the added noise this is also true for proteomics_data that is poor_quality peptide abundance data will hinder downstream statistical_analysis including normalization and subsequent biological interpretations page simulations of size based on the p variate standard normal distribution np i and an empirically influenced p variate normal distribution np were performed to examine a range of outlier configurations in addition we assessed the performance of the multi_dimensional outlier_detection method against the conventional method of using a pearsons_correlation previously described in section as metric equation to ascertain whether a lc_ms run is an outlier simulation is useful to investigate the properties of rmd pav however since simulation of expected distribution parameters in real proteomics_data is not well understood these results are presented in supplementary_material the results of the multi_dimensional outlier_detection analysis are displayed in a simple yet effective graphic in which rmd pav scores are plotted for each lc_ms run and compared with a reference line representing the critical value for improved visualization the rmd pav scores and the critical value are transformed to the log scale the red horizontal line represents the log critical value that is at a significance_level of a lc_ms run may be classified as a statistical outlier if the calculated test_statistic critical value or equivalently the p lc_ms with log rmd pav scores above the red horizontal line are suspect and should be removed from the dataset outlier_detection in multivariate_data is a non trivial statistical task often subject to the masking effect caution should always be taken when removing data from any dataset large or small and data should not be removed solely on the grounds of a statistical outlier test rather the results of any statistical outlier algorithm used should always be reviewed in the context of the research goal and the experiment often the extreme data values are of interest and may explain technical_difficulties in the process e g sample_preparation issues technical_difficulties with instrumentation and a mislabeling of samples however as with any statistical_analysis and especially those dealing with small_sample reviewing the outcome of the analysis is imperative specifically graphical methods allow the analyst to review the analysis in a stepwise manner for example as our first step we first plot the peptide abundances observed in the experiment for each lc_ms run using a box plot then to understand how the abundance distributions vary across the lc_ms we examine the scores plot resulting from the robust pca we have presented a novel approach to the identification of statistical outliers in lc_ms proteomics peptide abundance data the value of the multivariate outlier discovery strategy utilizing rmd pav scores is the use of an objective probabilistic_model to assess statistical certainty of the exclusion of runs within an experiment in the context of the complete dataset proteomics has placed considerable effort on assuring the quality of the peptide_identification with respect to spectral processing however quality_assessment of the subsequent data matrix has focused on subjective visual_inspection of run by run correlation or individual peptide components the quality of the lc_ms peptide abundance data matrix is essential to the identification of robust biomarkers moreover statistical_evaluation of the data relies upon tools often based on linear_models such as anova which require accurate estimates of variance without proper identification of statistical outlier runs the estimates of variance will be inflated which may have a considerable effect on the identification of significant peptides and proteins
