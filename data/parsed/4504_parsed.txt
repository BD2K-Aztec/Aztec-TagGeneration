sequence_analysis synbiowave a real_time communication platform for molecular and synthetic_biology synthetic_biology is advanced by many users and relies on the assembly of genetic_elements to devices systems and finally genomes synbiowave is a software_suite that enables multiple distributed users to analyze and construct genetic_parts in real_time collaboration it builds on google wave and provides an extensible robotrobotuser communication framework a menu driven user_interface biological data_handling including das and an internal database communication we demonstrate its use by implementing robots for genedata retrieval manipulation and display the initial development of synbiowave demonstrates the power of the underlying google wave protocol for synthetic_biology and lays the foundation for continuous and user_friendly extensions specialized wave robots with a manageable set of capabilities will divide_and the complex task of creating a genome in silico availability the robot is available at synbiowave appspot com the source_code at http scientific_research is a collaborative_effort requiring continuous exchange of ideas and data interlinking researchers at every level of the work flow since geographic separation should pose no hindrance such networking is best achieved using capabilities of the so_called web in the life_sciences numerous databases provide information and web_services solve specific tasks despite these efforts a technology to share the research working process from the decision and design phase of an experiment to the data_collection and the final_evaluation remained_elusive this gap is filled by an online platform named wave which was introduced in by google http wave google com google wave enables real_time collaboration between users and also integrates software_tools various types of content are incorporated in one evolving communication document processes are handled to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as by a wave server which offers sophisticated capabilities for synchronization annotation and versioning the underlying wave protocol as well as the server and client software are available as open_source http www waveprotocol org there are currently two ways to extend google wave gadgets and robots while gadgets are client side javascript applications that are synchronized by the wave server robots are java or python applications running on a server and appearing as artificial communication participants in a wave client this technology has been praised yet only a few single task robots have been released for scientific applications synbiowave builds upon google wave a real_time online collaboration software for molecular and synthetic_biology we added several features that are important for scientific tasks and provide a general_purpose extension framework wave is still undergoing significant development a continuous co development of synbiowave is envisioned and we for example upgraded to googles robot api v at present performance of the google wave server varies and the long_term availability is unclear users can set up their own wave servers and clients using open_source supplementary due to its open architecture synbiowave can be adapted to various clientserver implementations to ensure wide access and compatibility with the latest updates the synbiowave robot is currently hosted on the google wave server the code of synbiowave is maintained over the sourceforge platform for open_source projects enabling subversion control and feature request primary contact point is the project web_site www synbiowave org which provides documentation a screencast and a wordpress forum
