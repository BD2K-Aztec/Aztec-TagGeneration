genetics_and abacus an entropy based cumulative bivariate statistic robust to rare_variants and different direction of genotype effect motivation in the past_years both sequencing and microarray have been widely used to search for relations between genetic_variations and predisposition to complex pathologies such as diabetes or neuro logical disorders these studies however have been able to explain only a small fraction of disease heritability possibly because complex pathologies cannot be referred to few dysfunctional genes but are rather heterogeneous and multicausal as a result of a combination of rare and common_variants possibly impairing multiple regulatory_pathways rare_variants though are difficult to detect especially when the effects of causal_variants are in different directions i e with protective and detrimental_effects results here we propose abacus an algorithm based on a bivariate cumulative statistic to identify single nucleotide polymorph isms snps significantly associated with a disease within predefined sets of snps such as pathways or genomic_regions abacus is robust to the concurrent presence of snps with protective and detrimental_effects and of common and rare_variants moreover it is powerful even when few snps in the snp set are associated with the phenotype we assessed abacus performance on simulated_and and compared it with three state of the art methods when abacus was applied to type and diabetes data besides observing a wide overlap with already known associations we found a number of biologically sound pathways which might shed light on diabetes mechanism and etiology availability_and abacus is available atin the past_few the hereditary component of complex multifactorial_diseases has started to be explored through the novel paradigm of genome_wide gwass a gwas searches for patterns of genetic_variation in the form of single_nucleotide snps between a population of affected_individuals cases and a healthy control population although these studies have successfully identified a number of significant snpdisease associations they were able to explain only a small fraction of disease heritability one of the reasons for this lack of success as already faced in microarray_data analysis is that complex pathologies such as cancer diabetes or neurological_disorders are heterogeneous and multicausal as a result of the alteration of multiple regulatory_pathways and of the interplay between different genes and the environment rather than imputable to a single dysfunctional gene like monogenic diseases another important_reason is that a combination of rare and common_variants is likely to contribute to the disease rare_variants though are more difficult to detect than common_variants in fact single marker tests are not powerful enough when applied in a context of low evidence of association relatively low number of subjects_carrying the rare allele together with the need of correction_for several alternatives to single marker tests have been proposed in the literature to detect rare_variants multiple marker methods test the association of a group of variants e g snps within the same gene or pathway to the disease in this context a widely_applied approach is to test for the significance of accumulation of rare alleles within a phenotype across a group of snps briefly for each subject snps in the same group are collapsed to an indicator variable summarizing either the proportion of rare_variants that carry at least one minor_allele or the presence absence of at least one rare_variant these approaches known as collapsing methods or burden tests loose power when a portion of snps increases the risk of disease and the remaining portion is protective multi marker approaches alternative to burden tests include the hotelling two samples t test the zglobal statistic and the weighted score test proposed by the hotelling two samples t test is a generalization of the students t test whose degrees_of increase with the number of snps being simultaneously tested thus losing power with the snp set size the zglobal statistic and the weighted score test have only one degree of freedom however using these methods implies to know the risk_allele at each variant and as for burden tests power is affected by the relative proportions of snps increasing and decreasing the risk of disease alternatives whose power does not depend on the snp set size and that do not make any assumption on the direction of the snp effect i e on the protective or detrimental_effect of the variants on the phenotype are the methods based on genotype similarity between individual in the same group such as to whom correspondence should be addressed multivariate distance_matrix regression and kernel_based association tests kbat in particular multivariate distance_matrix regression has been shown to be more powerful for sets of correlated snps whereas kbat well handles both correlated and uncorrelated snps in general these latter methods based on genotype similarity between individuals are robust to the direction of genotype risk however they have been reported to lose power when higher minor_allele maf snps are included in the snp set or when many snps are jointly analyzed and only few of them are associated with the disease probably due to the relative low number of subjects compared with the number of possible combinations of rare_variants recently an optimal unified_approach for rare_variant testing has been proposed by the method called skat o combines burden tests with a sequence_kernel because in general a combination of rare and common_variants influencing the genotype with a protective or detrimental_effect is likely to contribute to the disease an ideal_method should be robust to different maf to different direction of genotype effects and to the number of associated snps within the snp set being analyzed moreover it is desirable to gain some knowledge on the specific snps associated with the disease in fact multi marker and cumulative test methods assess the association of a group of markers but do not distinguish between associated and not associated markers within the group here we propose abacus an algorithm based on a bivariate cumulative statistic designed to analyze snps with different maf in the same group independently on the protective or causative effect of the minor frequency allele being based on a bivariate statistic abacus differently from other methods performs multiple tests on each snp namely equal to the number of snps in the snp set minus this provides multiple evidence of associations and allows increasing the sensitivity with respect to other methods such as methods based on genotype similarity between individuals in the same group and sequence kernel association tests which instead calculate a cumulative snp set statistic to associate snp sets to phenotype moreover the bivariate statistic used by abacus is independent on the minor_allele being protective or causative to the disease which makes abacus advantageous with respect to burden tests relying just on a bivariate statistic though would be type error_prone because of the number of performed tests thus to control type_i abacus implements a bonferroni_correction within each snp set together with a graph_theoretic approach to identify groups of significant snps applied to a whole snp dataset abacus gives as output a list of snp sets associated with the disease and for each snpset the list of significant snps abacus like other methods first requires the definition of the snp sets such as pathways genes or genomic_regions encoding a priori information on the potential point effects of the snps in each subset we consider biological_pathways as the preferred definition of snp sets as studying the cumulative variation of snps mapping on genes in the same pathway interacting genes might fill in part the missing_heritability and guide mechanistic_studies helping uncovering the underlying_disease pathways moreover abacus is particularly suited for pathway analysis given its ability of simultaneously considering common and rare_variants and different direction of genotype effects in the following we introduce abacus and assess its performance in comparison with other methods on a number of simulated_datasets with known genotypephenotype associations to better appreciate the various facets of the method and assess it also on real_data we illustrate abacus application to the wellcome_trust case_control on type and diabetes the wellcome_trust results show how abacus is able to select a number of snps and genes associated to diabetes previously_identified either by the wtccc consortium or in different t d and t d gwas showing high_sensitivity in detecting both common and rare_variants moreover abacus identifies new biologically sound associations with diabetes involving genes associated with focal_adhesion platelet homeostasis inositol_phosphate metabolism and glutathione metabolism for type_diabetes and tryptophan metabolism and lipid_homeostasis for type_diabetes
