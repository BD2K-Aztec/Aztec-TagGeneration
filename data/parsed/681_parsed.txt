bayesian_network feature finder banff an r package for gene network feature_selection motivation network marker selection on genome_scale networks plays an important role in the understanding of biological_mechanisms and disease pathologies recently a bayesian nonparamet ric mixture_model has been developed and successfully_applied for selecting genes and gene sub networks hence extending this method to a unified_approach for network based feature_selection on general large_scale networks and creating an easy to use software_package is on demand results we extended the method and developed an r package the bayesian_network feature finder banff providing a package of posterior inference model comparison and graphical illustration of model_fitting the model was extended to a more general form and a parallel_computing algorithm for the markov_chain monte_carlo posterior inference and an expectation_maximization based algorithm for posterior approximation were added based on simulation_studies we demonstrate the use of banff on analyzing gene_expression on a proteinprotein_interaction feature_selection over genome_scale networks has become a very important research_question motivated by the needs of incorporating existing knowledge in the analysis of big_data in a broad range of biological and biomedical_applications commonly used genomescale networks include proteinprotein_interaction ppi_network transcriptional_regulatory signal_transduction network metabolomic network etc jointly analyzing high_throughput data with the networks can yield robust network markers i e sub networks critically related to the disease and deeper insights into disease mechanisms a bayesian_nonparametric mixture_model has been successfully_applied to select genes and gene sub networks under the large_scale simultaneous hypothesis_testing framework this method provides a general framework and can be applied to a wide_range of biomedical_applications however its model is relatively restrictive and the computation is not efficient enough on large_scale networks containing tens_of of nodes for improving and implementing this method we develop an computational time compared to the r code provided by banff is very user_friendly with a well written document for illustration of the software it provides a full package of r functions for data preprocessing efficient bayesian model_fitting with diagnostics quantitatively and graphically summarizing posterior samples of parameters along with tutorial examples for the analysis of simulated_data in summary banff implements a bayesian_nonparametric approach for large_scale multiple_hypothesis over the network motivated by the need for network marker selection on genome scalenetworks compared to the existing software banff achieves a high feature_selection accuracy controls the false_discovery very well and is computationally_efficient for large_scale network it has a broad range of applications in biomedical_sciences
