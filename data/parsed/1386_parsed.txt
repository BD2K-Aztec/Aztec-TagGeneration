gene_expression differential variability improves the identification of cancer risk markers in dna_methylation studies profiling precursor cancer lesions motivation the standard paradigm in omic disciplines has been to identify biologically_relevant biomarkers using statistics that reflect differences in mean levels of a molecular quantity such as mrna_expression or dna_methylation recently however it has been proposed that differential epigenetic variability may mark genes that contribute to the risk of complex genetic_diseases like cancer and that identification of risk and early detection markers may therefore benefit from statistics based on differential variability results using four genome_wide datasets totalling epithelial samples and encompassing all stages of cervical_carcinogenesis we here formally demonstrate that differential variability as a criterion for selecting dna_methylation features can identify cancer risk markers more reliably than statistics based on differences in mean methylation we show that differential variability selects features with heterogeneous outlier methylation profiles and that these play_a in the early_stages of carcinogenesis moreover differentially variable features identified in precursor non_invasive lesions exhibit significantly_increased enrichment for developmental genes compared with differentially_methylated sites conversely differential variability does not add predictive value in cancer studies profiling invasive tumours or whole blood tissue finally we incorporate the differential variability feature selection_step into a novel adaptive index prediction algorithm called evora epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis and demonstrate that evora compares favourably to powerful prediction_algorithms based on differential_methylation statistics conclusions statistics based on differential variability improve the detection of cancer risk markers in the context of dna_methylation studies profiling epithelial preinvasive neoplasias we present a novel algorithm evora which could be used for prediction and diagnosis of precursor epithelial cancer lesions availability r scripts implementing evora are available from cran www r project org statistical_testing in the context of large omic datasets e g mrna_expression or dna_methylation arrays has relied on the assumption that the most relevant_features are those which differ most significantly in terms of their mean levels thus parametric testing using t tests or regularized versions thereof has been the standard approach for identifying and ranking features of interest this paradigm of testing for differences in the means of two distributions has been enormously successful as demonstrated for instance by the popularity of algorithms and r packages such as limma or pamr however recent_insights obtained in cancer epigenomics suggest that identifying features that differ in terms of the second moment of a distribution i e variability may also be as relevant or important for understanding or predicting disease_phenotypes indeed it has been proposed that certain genes which are prone to stochastic epigenetic variation may contribute to the risk of complex genetic_diseases like cancer and that exposure to environmental risk_factors may underlie much of this stochastic variation supporting this view a recent_study that features that are differentially_methylated between cancer and normal_tissue are generally also much more variable in cancer tissue itself suggesting that the relevant_features could be identified using the concept of differential variability in this manuscript we formally demonstrate in the context of dna_methylation studies profiling precancerous conditions that statistics based on differential variability identifies true_positives more reliably than statistics based on differential_methylation we show how this can be attributed to the importance of heterogeneous outlier methylation profiles where the outliers define a small proportion of samples in the precancerous phenotype conversely we also demonstrate that differential variability underperforms whenever outlier methylation profiles are conspicuously absent as is the case for invasive_cancer and whole blood wb tissue we show that the outlier features present in the early precursor cancer lesions are more heavily enriched for developmental genes than differentially_methylated ones underpinning their biological_importance finally we incorporate the differentialbased on the insights of previous epigenetic_studies we hypothesized that differential variability in dna_methylation would play a particularly important role in the context of early carcinogenesis thus to formally demonstrate that differential variability identifies more biologically_relevant dna_methylation features than statistics based on differential_methylation we devised an objective training evaluation set strategy in the context of cc a cancer for which the cell of origin is known and for which access to early precursor_lesions is possible through routine large_scale screening_programs specifically we analyzed dna_methylation profiles for a total of samples including normal_tissue normal cells preceding a high_grade thus our strategy was to pick as discovery training_sets those cohorts representing the two earliest_stages of cc precursor cin and cin lesions both of which are non_invasive and to use cohorts representing similar or more advanced_stages as evaluation test_sets in one context we used lbc consisting of a balanced number of normal and cin samples as the discovery training_set and used sets lbc and cc for evaluation testing in the second context we used the artistic art cohort representing a balanced set of normal and precursor cin samples for discovery training and used lbc lbc and cc as evaluation test_sets
