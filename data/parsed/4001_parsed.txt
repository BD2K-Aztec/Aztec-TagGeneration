genome_analysis rgb a scriptable genome_browser for r thanks to its free licensing and the development of initiatives like bioconductor r has become an essential part of the bio informatics toolbox in the past_years and is more and more confronted with genomically located data while separate solutions are available to manipulate and visualize such data no r package currently offers the efficiency required for computationally_intensive tasks such as interactive genome browsing the package proposed here fulfills this specific need providing a multilevel interface suitable for most needs from a completely interfaced genome_browser to low_level classes and methods its time and memory_efficiency have been challenged in a human dataset where it outperformed existing solutions by several orders_of availability_and r sources and packages are freely_available at the cran repository and dedicated web_site http bio informatics ovsa fr rgb distributed under the gpl license compatible with most operating_systems windows linux mac os and architectures contact the growing demand from the biology community for statistically_robust approaches has made the r statistics oriented scripting language an essential part of the bioinformatics toolbox its graphical capabilities make it a valuable_tool to produce publication grade complex figures whereas its computational_efficiency allows it to handle huge datasets as currently required in fields like transcriptomics or next_generation these qualities come with an open_source licensing and various operating system ports that make it available virtually everywhere thanks to the bioconductor initiative large amount of software is freely_available as r packages for tasks as diverse as microarray processing feature annotation or sequence_analysis much of this software generates genomic_data i e lists of chromosome_regions defined by starting and ending coordinates such data are usually subset using chromosomal coordinates rather than row indexes a paradigm r was not developed to deal with bioconductor historically addressed this issue with the rangeddata class from the iranges package handling genomic_regions as ranges of integers base positions its flexibility and efficiency were extended a few years later by the genomicranges package making direct use of iranges components for the subsetting for visualization bioconductor provides two solutions rtracklayer and gviz the former sends data to visualize to the ucsc web genome_browser a model that implies frequent comings and goings between programs and consequent network burden the latter is more integrated within bioconductor and produces static graphics from the classes described above in delays incompatible with user interactivity and intensive computing the package described here reconciles these two aspects in a coherent way thus offering an interactive interface responsive enough for comfortable browsing and atomic operations suitable for computer intensive algorithms
