genome_analysis signal analysis for genome_wide maps of histone_modifications measured by chip_seq motivation chromatin_structure including post_translational of histones regulates gene_expression alternative_splicing and cell_identity chip_seq is an increasingly used assay to study chromatin function however tools for downstream bioinformatics_analysis are limited and are only based on the evaluation of signal_intensities we reasoned that new methods taking_into other signal_characteristics such as peak shape location and frequencies might reveal new insights into chromatin function particularly in situation where differences in read intensities are subtle results we introduced an analysis_pipeline based on linear predictive coding lpc which allows the capture and comparison of chip_seq histone profiles first we show that the modeled signal profiles distinguish differentially_expressed with comparable accuracy to signal_intensities the method was robust against parameter variations and performed well up to a signal_to of additionally we show that lpc profiles of activating and repressive histone_marks cluster into distinct groups and can be used to predict their function availability_and http www cancerresearch unsw edu au crcweb nsf page lpchp a matlab_implementation along with usage instructions and an example input_file are available from gene_expression is controlled at multiple levels including factors_regulating dna accessibility a combinatorial code of post_translational of the nucleosome proteins h a h b h and h can render their associated dna accessible or inaccessible for transcription and splicing acetylation is generally associated with activation while the affect to whom correspondence should be addressed of histone methylations is condition and position dependent chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip originally developed to enrich dna_fragments bound by specific proteins is now frequently used in studies of histone_modifications hms in brief a target protein such as a transcription_factor tf or histone with a particular modification is first crosslinked and immunoprecipitated using an antibody the associated dna is then extracted and detected using methods such as a hybridization array chip_chip or deep_sequencing chip_seq the later approach shows advantages in resolution and following bioinformatics processing provides genome_wide maps of tf_binding and hms a large number of algorithms for downstream processing of chip_seq have been developed these tools generally evaluate signal_intensities with the aim of detecting sparse highly_localized and enriched peaks however while this is a common characteristic for tf_binding the signals from hm chip_seq are more variable for example h_k and h a z localize at the transcription_start tss whereas others such as h_k and h_k spread over many base_pairs covering the promoter and full gene body in addition these signals often differ in peak shape and location as well as frequency by focusing the analysis on signal_intensity alone existing_methods are potentially limiting and constrain our ability to identify common motifs or patterns a number of genome_wide studies have recently been published and show correlations between hms and gene_expression while each study varied slightly in processing of the chip_seq in all cases the read intensities that mapped to an arbitrary region around the tss of a gene were extracted and normalized a vector containing quantification values from each dataset was constructed for each gene and these vectors were subsequently correlated with gene_expression using different multivariate statistical_approaches the earliest work analyzed chip_seq for histone methylations and identified two major gene groups by hierarchical_cluster the first contained active marks and genes expressed above average while the second cluster contained repressive marks and genes expressed below average a later study used the same methylation data but also included measures of histone_acetylation profiles here a linear_regression was used and again revealed that the hm chip_seq was predictive for gene_expression the analysis of enrichment profiles is currently based on read intensities and do not take into account signal structure we show that modeled signal structures lpchp from a set of chipseq experiments correlate well with gene_expression we also show that lpchp can be used to gain insights into chromatin function it is important to note that the binding profiles_obtained from hm chip_seq are a superposition of signals from the histone_modification and underlying location of the nucleosome therefore the reported correlations likely reflect the influence of both factors and normalization in the presence of data on total h h and h levels is necessary to avoid this bias lpchp is better suited for comparative_studies of chromatin function particular in situations where the signal structure is expected to change while the signal_intensity remains_constant importantly nucleosome free regions nfr mark general sites of transcription_initiation for coding and non_coding and are influenced by a combination of dna_sequence and transcription_factors radman if nucleosome repositioning is assumed in chip_seq libraries our approach is expected to detect the associated peak shift while no differences would be detected from the signal_intensities the lpc approach can also be extended for the analysis of other sequencing protocols such as the distinction of nucleosome_positioning between methylated and non methylated cpg islands incorporating peak shape_information will further facilitate the identification of specific tf_binding to one of multiple closely situated binding_sites as typically seen in promoters of critical developmentally regulated_genes furthermore our analysis_pipeline automatically reduces noise and handles data scaling and normalization while obtaining spectral_features which can be further analyzed using a variety of previously_developed spectral pattern comparison techniques in conclusion both applications show that the lpchp and the signal structural that they represent provide a useful feature that is currently neglected in the literature since we show that the lpchp can be used as an alternative to read intensities its utility may extend beyond chip_seq to other next_generation applications it will be particularly useful in situations where read intensity information is either insufficient or non informative in addition the transformation of the original signal into lpc feature_vectors is a useful intermediate allowing for the application of various machine_learning as recently noted a particular important task in bioinformatics is the identification of all possible chromatin_states which could be obtained from a simple vector quantization analysis of the lpchp other potential applications include the identification of enhancer or regulatory_regions in the genome in addition further methodological development is needed to extend the application of lpchp to the analysis of more complex genomic_features this includes for example the comparison of hm binding structures in gene body_regions that are variable in length and the number and length of exons introns and enhancers
