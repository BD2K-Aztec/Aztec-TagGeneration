systems_biology an optimal_experimental approach to model discrimination in dynamic biochemical_systems motivation finding suitable models of dynamic biochemical_systems is an important task in systems_biology approaches to the biosciences on the one hand a correct model helps to understand_the and on the other hand one can use the model to predict the behavior of a biological system under various circumstances typically before the correct model of a biochemical system is found different hypothetical models might be reasonable and consistent with previous_knowledge and available data the main goal now is to find the best suited model out of different hypotheses the process of falsifying inappropriate candidate models is called model discrimination results we have developed a new computational_tool to compute optimal experiments for biochemical kinetic systems with underlying ordinary_differential ode_models for the purpose of model discrimination we were inspired by the demands of biological experimentalists which perform one run measurement where perturbations to the system are possible we provide a criterion which calculates the number and location of time points of optimal measurements as well as optimal initial_conditions and optimal perturbations to the system availability the model discrimination algorithm described here is implemented in c in the package modeldiscriminationtoolkit the source_code can be downloaded fromtypically before the correct model of a biochemical system is found different hypothetical models might be reasonable and consistent with previous_knowledge and available data let us assume that all the models have in common that they fit one initial series of measurements the main goal now is to find the best suited model out of different hypotheses this is usually done by iterative measurements and successive fitting of the different models to the to whom correspondence should be addressed collectivity of all series of measurements this is repeated until all wrong models do not fit to the collectivity of all series of measurements any more thus the wrong models are iteratively falsified the whole process is called model discrimination to discriminate a set of candidate models against a given set of experimental_data often likelihood_ratio based on bootstrap methods are preformed see e g ranking_methods like stewarts method or the well known akaike_information see e g are popular as well in the field of biological modeling applications can be found for example inor bernacki and murphy this article deals with the problem of designing experiments so that these methods can be applied in an optimal sense this fundamentally differs from the case of finding an experimental_design to best estimate the parameters of a model for a given experimental system see e g an overview of different experimental_design techniques can be found in kreutz and timmer different approaches to design experiments for model discrimination exist beside optimization_methods see e g a model based feedback controller see e g and markov_chain methods are used to construct an appropriate design we have developed a new computational_tool to compute optimal experiments for biochemical kinetic systems with underlying ordinary_differential ode_models for the purpose of model discrimination we were inspired by the demands of biological experimentalists who perform one run measurement where perturbations to the system are possible we provide a criterion which calculates optimal measurement time points instead of a continuous design see e g the theory of the new criterion is presented in section in section we give a brief overview of kullbackleibler kl optimality introduced by lpez in section we derive our optimality criterion by use of kl optimality in section we present the numerical implementation of our optimal_design algorithm numerical_results on allosteric models for glycolytic oscillations are presented in section we provide supplementary_material for more details on theory and applications
