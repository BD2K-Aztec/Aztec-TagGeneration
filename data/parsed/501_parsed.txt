a simple method to control over alignment in the mafft multiple_sequence program motivation we present a new feature of the mafft multiple_alignment program for suppressing over alignment aligning unrelated segments conventional mafft is highly_sensitive in aligning conserved_regions in remote_homologs but the risk of over alignment is recently becoming greater as low quality or noisy sequences are increasing in protein sequence_databases due for example to sequencing_errors and difficulty in gene prediction results the proposed method_utilizes a variable scoring_matrix for different pairs of sequences or groups in a single multiple_sequence based on the global similarity of each pair this method significantly increases the correctly gapped sites in real examples and in simulations under various conditions regarding sensitivity the effect of the proposed method is slightly negative in real protein based benchmarks and mostly neutral in simulation based benchmarks this approach is based on natural biological reasoning and should be compatible with many methods based on dynamic_programming for multiple_sequence availability_and the new feature is available in mafft versions and higher many comparative_analyses of biological_sequences utilize multiple_sequence msa and the quality of an msa can affect the results of downstream_analyses therefore even incremental improvements in msa quality can have wide_ranging effects one area in msa technology that can potentially be improved is robustness against noise in sequence_data as a result of large_scale sequencing_projects we now have access to many amino_acid and nucleotide_sequences from widely divergent organisms unfortunately the quality of the sequences is not always high partly due to limitations in sequencing_technologies moreover at the amino_acid level a number of errors can be introduced due to difficulty in gene prediction with incorrect reading frames unrelated amino_acid segments can appear in a set of homologous_sequences even if such errors could be completely excluded splice_variants of a gene can be included in an msa of a eukaryotic gene_family another source of difficulty is when small structural_domains are surrounded by intrinsically_disordered or low complexity regions thus the existence of unrelated segments or noise in an msa is common especially in large_scale analyses of amino_acid for which human inspection is difficult therefore robustness in such situations is an important feature for any msa method used for large_scale analysis most msa methods assume that the input_sequences are all homologous when the input_sequences have unrelated segments these segments often end up being aligned this results in over alignment i e sites that are aligned but are in fact non homologous some msa methods including prank and bali phy are aware of this problem however these methods are not ranked highly in standard benchmarks based on protein structural_alignments this is not surprising because the standard criterion is essentially based on sensitivity a consequence of which is that the over alignment problem is not taken into account methods such as prank and bali phy usually utilize simulated input to test alignment_accuracy simulation based benchmarks generally have a limitation in that the simulation setting is inevitably oversimplified and the applicability to real_world situations is unclear on the other hand the use of real_data is problematic when considering over alignment due to the arbitrariness of reference alignments more specifically structural_alignments can only provide information about sites that are structurally_conserved not sites that are unrelated in simulation based benchmarks that take into consideration over alignment prank and bali phy consistently outperform other methods l oytynoja and thus there is a discrepancy between benchmarks based on real_data and simulated_data to assess the overalignment problem both types of benchmarks are necessary here we describe a simple method to control over alignment directly and flexibly in a protein msa in brief the proposed method_utilizes agreement between the local segments and the entire_sequence to determine which residues should be aligned if there is a dissimilar segment in a globally highly_similar pair of sequences the dissimilar segment is gapped this is accomplished by using a variable scoring_matrix vsm that adapts to the global similarity between a pair of sequences or groups within an msa given a single additional parameter that controls the risk of over alignment this is not a novel idea since it is based on a combination of two techniques known for more than years i adjusting the overall average of a scoring_matrix by rescaling the matrix according to the similarity of the pair of sequences or groups to be aligned and ii use of different scoring_matrices in an msa as originally proposed in clustalw but probably not inherited by clustal omega we have implemented the vsm technique in the mafft program which is one of the most sensitive methods in terms of standard_criteria we described the variable scoring_matrix vsm technique which uses a single scoring_matrix m orig with a variable a in methods there is another possibly more natural strategy the use of multiple scoring_matrices msm such as the blosum series each of which is for a specific similarity level this technique was originally used in clustalw we compared the effect of vsm and msm using a simple pairwise_alignment with four distinct regions
