structural_bioinformatics espritz accurate and fast prediction of protein disorder motivation intrinsically_disordered are key for the function of numerous proteins and the scant available experimental annotations suggest the existence of different disorder flavors while efficient predictions are required to annotate entire genomes most existing_methods require sequence_profiles for disorder prediction making them cumbersome for high_throughput applications results in this work we present an ensemble of protein disorder predictors called espritz these are based on bidirectional recursive neural_networks and trained on three different flavors of disorder including a novel nmr flexibility predictor espritz can produce fast and accurate sequence only predictions annotating entire genomes in the order of hours on a single processor core alternatively a slower but slightly more accurate espritz variant using sequence_profiles can be used for applications requiring maximum performance two levels of prediction confidence allow either to maximize reasonable disorder detection or to limit expected false_positives to espritz performs consistently well on the recent casp data reaching a s w measure of and area under the receiver_operator of the fast predictor is four orders_of and remains better than most publicly_available casp methods making it ideal for genomic_scale predictions conclusions espritz predicts three flavors of disorder at two distinct false_positive either with a fast or slower and slightly more accurate approach given its state of the art performance it can be especially useful for high_throughput applications availability both a web_server for high_throughput analysis and a linux executable version of espritz are available from protein_function has been traditionally thought to be determined by tertiary_structure more recently an alternative view is emerging with respect to non folding regions which suggests a reassessment of the structure to function paradigm flexible segments lacking a unique native_structure within a protein are known as disordered_regions disorder has been shown to be widespread within known natural proteins especially in eukaryotic_organisms to whom correspondence should be addressed it also plays_a in human disease where it is thought that of all cancer associated proteins are at least in part unstructured disordered proteins with disordered segments are frequently associated with molecular_recognition they have also been observed to be common among hub proteins i e those with a large number of interaction_partners in addition protein disorder is also important for protein expression purification and crystallization since difficulties often arise when long disordered_regions are present as happens frequently at the n and c termini protein disorder is experimentally_determined with an assortment of indirect biochemical_methods collected in the disprot database currently containing proteins alternatively missing residues in x_ray from structures deposited in the protein_data pdb can be used the analysis of nuclear_magnetic nmr ensembles from the pdb is also possible but to the best of our knowledge has never been used to train a prediction method it is assumed that different flavors of protein disorder exist the most common distinction is between long disprot and short x_ray segments alternatively there has also been an attempt to distinguish flavors based on enrichment for certain amino_acid types the characteristically skewed amino_acid distribution of disordered segments lacking in hydrophobic and enriched in polar and charged_residues can be easily exploited for sequencebased predictions available prediction_methods can be broadly divided_into three classes biophysical_methods exploit the sequence distribution to derive pseudo energy propensities to adopt a disordered state of these iupred is probably the most widely used due to its availability and efficiency as it does not require_multiple sequence_alignments machine_learning have been widely used for the prediction of protein disorder in most cases psi_blast sequence_profiles are combined with additional features e g predicted_secondary in the widely used disopred on average these methods are slower but somewhat more accurate than biophysical predictors the last and most recent category of disorder predictors use a consensus of various biophysical and machine_learning here a further improvement in accuracy is obtained at the cost of running several predictors in parallel and averaging their output among the applications of disorder prediction we can distinguish at least two different scenarios the first is represented by the critical assessment of techniques for protein_structure casp experiment where the methods are used to predict disorder on a relatively small number of proteins with maximum accuracy here clearly consensus predictors aiming for maximum accuracy should excel however a more practical scenario is represented by high_throughput analysis of protein disorder e g on entire genomes in this case the focus is shifted toward fast predictors producing a minimum number_of over the years most prediction_methods have addressed the first problem with comparatively little attention to the practicalities of largescale predictions this has led to a relative paucity of accurate fast predictors as adding more prediction layers has produced slightly more accurate but increasingly cumbersome methods e g here we present the espritz methods for determining disorder based solely on sequence aimed for high_throughput applications the predictor is tested on large_datasets of different disorder types including a novel nmr mobility definition the sole input for the espritz method is the amino_acid it does not require sliding_windows to capture local contextual_information or any complex sources of information and is shown to be both state of the art and efficient
