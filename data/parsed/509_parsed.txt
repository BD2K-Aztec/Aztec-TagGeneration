a spectral graph_theoretic approach to quantification and calibration of collective morphological_differences in cell images motivation high_throughput image_based assay technologies can rapidly produce a large number of cell images for drug_screening but data analysis is still a major_bottleneck that limits their utility quantifying a wide_variety of morphological_differences observed in cell images under different drug influences is still a challenging_task because the result can be highly_sensitive to sampling and noise results we propose a graph based_approach to cell image_analysis we define graph transition energy to quantify morphological_differences between image sets a spectral graph_theoretic regularization is applied to transform the feature_space based on training examples of extremely different images to calibrate the quantification calibration is essential for a practical quantification_method because we need to measure the confidence of the quantification we applied our method to quantify the degree of partial fragmentation of mitochondria in collections of fluorescent cell images we show that with transformation the quantification can be more accurate and sensitive than that without transformation we also show that our method outperforms competing_methods including neighbourhood component analysis and the multi variate drug profiling_method by loo et_al we illustrate its utility with a study of annonaceous acetogenins a family of compounds with drug potential our result reveals that squamocin induces more fragmented mitochondria than muricin a availability mitochondrial cell images their corresponding feature_sets sslf and wslf and the source_code of our proposed method are available at http aiia iis recently high_throughput image_based assay technologies or highcontent analysis have become a useful tool for drug_discovery small_molecule screen subcellular_localization etc these technologies make it possible to visualize trace and quantify cellular morphological changes in high_resolution and play an increasingly crucial_role to the understanding of biological_processes since the cost of acquiring a large number of microscopic cell images is decreasing the analysis tools must be powerful consider a study aiming at correlating drug influences to morphological changes of mitochondria this topic has become increasingly important mainly because of its relation to apoptosis and aging process shows some representative cell images with different levels of fragmentation of mitochondria as we can see intact or completely fragmented mitochondria are relatively easy to recognize but it is difficult to quantify partial fragmentation in fact in addition to fragmentation mitochondria may become tubular shortened elongated or swollen all these morphological changes are important biological_indicators however off_the analysis software only distinguishes morphological patterns at cellular_level no partial change or mixture of patterns at subcellular_level can be readily detected quantification requires human inspection which is infeasible for high_throughput our goal is to derive an objective and reliable quantification tool to correlate drug influences and morphological_differences at cellular or subcellular levels we assume that cell images are characterized given two sets of cell images with extremely different morphology patterns as training examples our method transforms the feature_space so that regularized graph transition energy between the two sets is minimized then we can quantify the morphological difference of cells by computing their graph transition energy with the training examples in the transformed feature_space by a feature_set extracted from the images and can be considered as a data point in the feature_space a straightforward quantification is to measure the euclidean_distance between data_points or apply other sophisticated similarity_metrics however there are key_challenges that must be addressed bullet a wide_variety of morphological categories must be considered bullet influence of a drug is a random variable the difference must be estimated between pairs of cell image collections averaging pairwise_differences of single images is not appropriate here because of the presence of noise and outliers in the end we summarize our contributions as follows bullet we defined graph transition energy to quantify morphological difference of two cell image collections under different perturbations bullet we applied a spectral graph_theoretic regularization to reweight the feature_space according to training examples of extremely different cases experimental_results show that our feature_space transformation method actually improves the quality of classification and quantification the method also allows for calibration by providing a confidence_score of the quantification bullet we demonstrated how to quantify morphological difference of collections of cell images in our approach and showed that our approach has a higher discrimination power than a competing approach by bullet we showed that after applying our feature_space transformation method the performance of a semi_supervised method byfor subcellular_localization can be improved_significantly bullet coupling with a k nn regression_method we demonstrated that our transformation method improves the accuracy of the estimation of partial fragmentation of mitochondria in cell images and that our method is more effective than nca bullet in section we demonstrated a case study of two annonaceous acetogenin compounds and their effects to mitochondrial_fragmentation our approach is not specific to any particular morphological_differences and can potentially be applied to quantify any difference with an appropriate set of features therefore it has the potential to rapidly screen many drug_candidates and understand their effects in our future work we will apply this approach to continue our study of annonaceous acetogenins and their various effects to mitochondria
