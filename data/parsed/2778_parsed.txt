systems_biology magna maximizing accuracy in global_network motivation biological network_alignment aims to identify similar regions between networks of different species existing_methods compute node similarities to rapidly_identify from possible alignments the high_scoring alignments with respect to the overall node similarity but the accuracy of the alignments is then evaluated with some other measure that is different than the node similarity used to construct the alignments typically one measures the amount of conserved edges thus the existing_methods align similar nodes between networks hoping to conserve many edges after the alignment is constructed results instead we introduce magna to directly optimize edge conservation while the alignment is constructed without decreasing the quality of node mapping magna uses a genetic_algorithm and our novel function for crossover of two parent alignments into a superior child alignment to simulate a population of alignments that evolves over time the fittest alignments survive and proceed to the next generation until the alignment_accuracy cannot be optimized further while we optimize our new and superior measure of the amount of conserved edges magna can optimize any alignment_accuracy measure including a combined measure of both node and edge conservation in systematic evaluations against state of the art methods isorank mi_graal and ghost on both synthetic networks and real_world biological data magna outperforms all of the existing_methods in terms of both node and edge conservation as well as both topological and biological alignment_accuracy
