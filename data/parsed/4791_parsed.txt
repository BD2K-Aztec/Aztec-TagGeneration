databases_and uniformly curated signaling_pathways reveal tissue_specific cross_talks and support drug_target motivation signaling_pathways control a large variety of cellular_processes however currently even within the same database signaling_pathways are often curated at different levels of detail this makes comparative and cross_talk analyses difficult results we present signalink a database containing eight major signaling_pathways from caenorhabditis_elegans drosophila_melanogaster and humans based on review and research_articles we have compiled pathways with semi_automatic searches and uniform well documented curation rules we found that in humans any two of the eight pathways can cross_talk we quantified the possible tissue and cancer specific activity of cross_talks and found pathway specific expression_profiles in addition we identified proteins relevant for drug_target conclusions we provide a novel resource for comparative and cross_talk analyses of signaling_pathways the identified multi pathway and tissue_specific cross_talks contribute to the understanding of the signaling complexity in health and disease and underscore its importance in network based drug target_selection intracellular_signaling from the simplest cascades to the highly intertwined networks of protein_kinases contributes extensively to the diversity of developmental programs and adaptation responses in metazoans pires dasilva and in humans defects in intracellular_signaling can cause various diseases e g cancer neurodegeneration or diabetes thus understanding the structure function and evolution of signal_transduction is an important task for both basic_research and medicine by now genetic_studies have uncovered functionally separate though interacting cross talking pathways and the direction of information_flow between pairs of signaling_molecules in a number of species on the other hand biochemical_experiments have allowed the detailed characterization of direct physical_interactions involved in signaling integrating these data_sets using uniform manual_curation criteria can significantly contribute to a more precise assessment of their tissue and cancer specific utilization and the effects of drug_treatments for example inhibitors used for eliminating a signaling_pathway in cancerous_cells may in fact have the opposite effect these drugs may suppress negative_feedback and thereby paradoxically activate the targeted pathway intracellular_signaling was originally regarded as an assembly of distinct and almost linear cascades over the past_decade however it has been realized that signaling_pathways are highly_structured and rich in cross_talks where cross_talk is defined here as a directed physical_interaction between pathways consequently intracellular_signaling is now viewed as a set of intertwined pathways forming a single signaling_network this paradigm_shift calls for novel experimental curation and network modeling techniques currently high_throughput htp experiments are the major sources of known proteinprotein_interactions ppis however so_far in most htp experiments extracellular membrane_bound and nuclear_proteins have been underrepresented these and other sampling_biases strongly reduce their usability for identifying signaling interactions another limitation of htp assays is that they produce undirected interactions even though in signaling directions are essential accordingly several signaling pathway_databases have been created recently by manually collecting the directed interactions from the literature manually_curated signaling pathway_databases are often assembled without strictly defined and published standardized curation criteria therefore even within the same database e g in kegg kyoto encyclopedia of the level of detail of curation and the rules for setting pathway boundaries can vary among pathways in addition in several signaling resources the definition of signaling_pathways has no evolutionary or biochemical background in other cases e g in reactome and netpath only the differences from signalink are listed the features setting signalink most clearly apart have a gray background curation criteria are standardized however
