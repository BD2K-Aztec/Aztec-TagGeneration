genome_analysis vat a computational framework to functionally annotate variants in personal genomes within a cloud_computing environment the functional_annotation of variants obtained through sequencing_projects is generally assumed to be a simple intersection of genomic_coordinates with genomic_features however complexities arise for several reasons including the differential_effects of a variant on alternatively_spliced as well as the difficulty in assessing the impact of small insertions_deletions and large structural_variants taking these factors into consideration we developed the variant annotation tool vat to functionally annotate variants from multiple personal genomes at the transcript_level as well as obtain summary_statistics across genes and individuals vat also allows visualization of the effects of different variants integrates allele_frequencies and genotype data from the underlying individuals and facilitates comparative_analysis between different groups of individuals vat can either be run through a command_line or as a web_application finally in order to enable on demand access and to minimize unnecessary transfers of large data_files vat can be run as a virtual_machine in a cloud_computing environment availability_and vat is implemented in c and php the vat web_service amazon machine image source_code and detailed documentation are available at vat recent_technological have significantly_reduced the cost of dna_sequencing and have made it possible to sequence complete_genomes on a large_scale currently a number of efforts aim to sequence and genotype large_numbers of individual_genomes these studies have already revealed many novel single_nucleotide to whom correspondence should be addressed the authors wish it to be known that in their opinion the first three authors should be regarded_as snps multi nucleotide polymorphisms mnps small insertions_and indels and structural_variants svs in order to assess the functional impact of identified_variants a key objective is to determine_whether those variants intersect with annotated elements however the intersection of variants with a gene_annotation set is non trivial first a variant may affect only a subset of the possible transcript_isoforms of a given gene or it may have different effects on alternatively_spliced for example a variant can affect the coding_region of one transcript and overlap the canonical splice_site of another in addition for cases in which neighboring snps i e mnps lie within the same codon one must assess both snps simultaneously to evaluate the resultant codon change as considering each independently could give rise to erroneous codon changes second indels in coding_regions can either preserve the frame or introduce frameshifts they can also partially overlap coding_exons thereby impairing splice_sites as well as coding_regions assessing the functional impact in such cases is especially challenging lastly large svs can have drastic effects on the structure of a gene if exons are removed in whole or in part as a result it can be difficult to assess the overall functional impact of different types of variants on gene structures without having visual representations supplementary to address these challenges we have developed the variant annotation tool vat like vat other tools have been implemented to assess the functional impact of variants one issue with these tools is that they are not cloud enabled cloud_computing provides immense storage capacity and scalable compute resources as well as the ability to share data and perform collaborative analyses given the increasing rate of data production many foresee that sequencing_reads will be stored on the cloud in addition the importance of software residing in the same space as the data on which it operates requires that the analysis_pipelines processing these reads migrate to the cloud as well thus as vat will constitute an integral part of such pipelines having it reside on the cloud will be necessary thus we provide vat as a virtual_machine vm that can be run within a cloud_computing environment including that operated by amazon to take advantage of the scalability and unlimited storageof the vat web_application the web_application may be accessed through the browser or a json based interface the i o layer of vat takes_advantage of the amazon s service and stores all data in s buckets or if s support is disabled simply writes to a local disk this architecture may also be easily scaled to use more sophisticated storage schemes such as hashing across multiple input and output buckets c the vat ec cloud service is implemented in a service oriented architecture consisting of a master node and a number of worker nodes the master node hosts the user facing interface and delegates tasks on behalf of the user to the worker nodes capacity offered by this framework the utility of vat has been demonstrated by its extensive use in annotating the loss of function variants obtained as part of the genomes_project
