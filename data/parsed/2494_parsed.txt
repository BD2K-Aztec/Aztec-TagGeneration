databases_and instruct a database of high_quality d structurally resolved protein interactome networks instruct is a database of high_quality d structurally resolved protein interactome networks in human and six model_organisms instruct combines the scale of available high_quality binary protein interaction data with the specificity of atomic_resolution structural_information derived from co crystal evidence using a tested interaction interface inference_method its web_interface is designed to allow for flexible search based on standard and organism specific protein and gene naming conventions visualization of protein architecture highlighting interaction interfaces and viewing and downloading custom d structurally resolved interactome datasets availability instruct is freely_available on the web at http instruct yulab org with all_major proteinprotein_interactions demonstrate functional principles of biological_processes because most proteins carry out their cellular_functions by interacting with other proteins the set of all protein interactions within an organism known as the interactome is often represented as a network interactome networks are powerful resources for biologists because they help elucidate the interconnected nature of signaling and communication within cellular_systems it has also been suggested that mechanistic explanations of many human_diseases can be obtained by studying alterations to this network for example a global guilt by association principle has been widely used to predict disease genes by dissecting molecular_networks however for an interactome network to be successfully_applied in biological studies it is imperative that it incorporate the intricate structural details of proteins within the network and not simply treat the proteins as mathematical points in a graph_theoretic network schuster as structure is the basis of protein_function elucidating structural details of interactions can help refine our current understanding of biochemical function from proteinprotein_interaction here we present instruct http instruct yulab org a comprehensive database of high_quality d structurally resolved protein interactome networks in human and six widely_studied model_organisms to our knowledge instruct is the first online repository containing structurally resolved interaction interfaces between proteins for which no co crystal_structure is available to accomplish this we used an interaction interface inference_method to structurally resolve interactions based on known co crystal_structures in the pdb in total instruct currently contains human arabidopsis_thaliana caenorhabditis_elegans drosophila_melanogaster mus_musculus saccharomyces_cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces_pombe structurally resolved interactions as a comprehensive database providing structural details not previously annotated in protein interactome networks instruct will be an invaluable resource in a wide_array of biological_research instruct will be a useful tool in a broad_spectrum of fundamental biological_research with the continued_growth of data_sources especially available co crystal_structures in the pdb we expect the coverage of our structurally resolved interactome networks to increase over time we plan to update instruct at least once per year to incorporate newly available information and to expand our repertoire of model_organisms as more structural data become available we will build more comprehensive d structurally resolved interactome networks for different organisms
