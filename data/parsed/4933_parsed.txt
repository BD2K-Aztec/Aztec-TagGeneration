xenosite server a web available site of metabolism prediction_tool cytochrome_p enzymes p s are metabolic_enzymes that process the majority of fda_approved small_molecule understanding how these enzymes modify molecule structure is key to the development of safe effective drugs xenosite server is an online implementation of the xenosite a recently_published computational_model for p metabolism xenosite predicts which atomic sites of a moleculesites of metabolism soms are modified by p s xenosite server accepts input in common chemical file_formats including sdf and smiles and provides tools for visualizing the likelihood that each atomic site is a site of metabolism for a variety of important p s as well as a flat file download of som predictions availability_and xenosite server is available atcytochrome p enzymes p s are a family of heme thiolated enzymes that catalyze a variety of oxidation reactions they oxidatively metabolize the majority of fda_approved small_molecule p s metabolize individual_molecules at specific atoms sites of metabolism soms the specific soms associated with a molecules p metabolism are important to know because they affect its bioavailability efficacy and toxicity for example acetominophen is metabolized by p s at a specific site into napqi which is toxic to hepatocytes which can acute_liver in some patients accurately predicting these soms enables medicinal chemists to modify molecule to avoid toxic_metabolites and maximize bioavailability there are in vitro assays capable of determining a molecules soms but computational_methods for predicting soms are quicker less expensive and frequently used in drug_development in addition to commercial software_packages for predicting soms there are at least two software_packages produced by academic groups rs predictor and smartcyp recently we reported a new method for predicting p soms xenosite that is more accurate than other approaches this article reports a public web_server that makes xenosite available to predict the soms of usersubmitted molecules xenosite is a machine_learning approach to modeling p metabolism using a neural_network xenosite models are trained on the largest set of publicly_available p metabolism data consisting of over compounds annotated with soms for the p isozymes a a b c c c d e and a as well as human_liver hlm which combines the individual p models to represent the expected metabolism of compounds in vivo in cross_validation experiments xenosite identifies experimentally_observed soms within the top two rank positions for substrate sets of each p isozyme with a high_level of accuracy and respectively on these isozymes
