classifying and segmenting microscopy_images with deep multiple instance learning motivation high_content hcs technologies have enabled large_scale imaging_experiments for studying cell_biology and for drug_screening these systems produce hundreds of thousands of microscopy_images per day and their utility depends on automated_image recently deep_learning approaches that learn feature representations directly from pixel intensity values have dominated object_recognition challenges these tasks typically have a single centered object per image and existing_models are not directly applicable to microscopy datasets here we develop an approach that combines deep convolutional_neural cnns with multiple instance learning mil in order to classify and segment microscopy_images using only whole image level annotations results we introduce a new neural_network architecture that uses mil to simultaneously classify and segment microscopy_images with populations of cells we base our approach on the similarity between the aggregation function used in mil and pooling layers used in cnns to facilitate aggre gating across large_numbers of instances in cnn feature maps we present the noisy and pooling function a new mil operator that is robust to outliers combining cnns with mil enables training cnns using whole microscopy_images with image level labels we show that training end_to mil cnns outperforms several previous methods on both mammalian and yeast datasets without requiring any segmentation steps availability_and torch implementation available upon request high_content hcs technologies that combine automated fluorescence_microscopy with high_throughput biotechnology have become powerful systems for studying cell_biology and for drug_screening these systems can produce more than images per day making their success dependent on automated_image previous analysis_pipelines heavily rely on hand tuning the segmentation feature_extraction and classification steps for each assay although comprehensive tools have become available they are typically optimized for mammalian_cells and not directly applicable to model_organisms such as yeast and caenorhabditis_elegans researchers studying these organisms often manually classify cellular patterns by eye recent_advances in deep_learning have proven that deep neural_networks trained end_to can learn powerful feature representations and outperform classifiers built on top of extracted_features although object_recognition models have been successfully trained using images with one or a few objects of interest at the center of the image microscopy_images often contain hundreds of cells with a phenotype of interest as well as outliers training similar recognition models on hcs screens is challenging due to the lack of datasets labeled at the single_cell level in this work we describe a convolutional_neural cnn that is trained on full resolution microscopy_images using multiple instance learning mil the network is designed to produce feature maps for every output category as proposed for segmentation tasks in we pose cellular_phenotype classification as a mil problem in which each element in a class specific feature map approximately representing the area of a single_cell in the input space is considered an instance an entire class specific feature map representing the area of the entire image is considered a bag of instances annotated with the whole image label typically binary mil problems assume that a bag is positive if at least one instance within the bag is positive this assumption does not hold for hcs images due to heterogeneities within cellular populations and v c the author published_by
