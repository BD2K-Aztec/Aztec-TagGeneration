identifying viral_integration using seqmap retroviral integration has been implicated in several biomedical_applications including identification of cancer associated genes and malignant_transformation in gene_therapy clinical_trials we introduce an efficient and scalable method for fast identification of viral_vector integration sites from long_read high_throughput individual sequence_reads are masked to remove non genomic_sequence aligned to the host_genome and assembled into contiguous fragments used to pinpoint the position of integration availability_and the method is implemented in a publicly_accessible web_server platform seqmap containing analysis tools and both private and shared lab workspaces that facilitate collaboration among researchers available at
