databases_and hspir a manually_annotated heat_shock information resource heat_shock information resource hspir is a concerted database of six major heat_shock hsps namely hsp hsp hsp hsp hsp and small hsp the hsps are essential for the survival of all living_organisms as they protect the conformations of proteins on exposure to various stress_conditions they are a highly_conserved group of proteins involved in diverse physiological_functions including de_novo folding disaggrega tion and protein_trafficking moreover their critical role in the control of disease_progression made them a prime target of research presently limited information is available on hsps in reference to their identification and structural_classification across genera to that extent hspir provides manually_curated information on sequence structure classification ontology domain_organization localization and possible biological_functions extracted from uniprot genbank protein_data and the literature the database offers interactive search with incorporated tools which enhances the analysis hspir is a reliable resource for researchers exploring structure function and evolution of hsps heat_shock hsps are a specialized group of proteins robustly synthesized in all living_organisms in response to various conditions of stress including elevated temperatures hsps are critical for cell_survival both constitutively and in times of stress to ensure proper_folding of non native states of proteins based on their nature of functions and molecular_mass hsps are classified broadly into six major families namely hsp hsp j proteins hsp chaperonins hsp hsp clp proteins and small hsps they function cooperatively by forming an intricate molecular_network thereby maintaining the overall cellular protein homeostasis their diversified nature and vast repertoire of functions have generated a significant interest to deduce an intricate cellular chaperone network and functional crosstalk among major families of hsps presently cpndb database exists but contains data only for hsp_family heat_shock information resource hspir provides a comprehensive collection of information on six major hsp families across various genomes with detailed subclassification based on their domain structural_organization and localization hspir also includes sequences that are not yet annotated in uniprot additionally hspir offers various tools like blast for homology_search clustalw for multiple_sequence archaeopteryx for phylogenetic_tree visualization and manipulation and jmol http www jmol org structural viewer the database currently holds hand curated entries from six kingdoms covering all the major model_organisms and d structures to identify domain_architecture and associated functional_motifs of hsps the secondary structural assignments were done using psipred version and subcellular_localization and signal_peptide regions were predicted using targetp wolfpsort and psort taxon information of each organism was obtained from ncbi taxonomy database gene ontologies were inferred from uniprotkb experimentally_determined d structures were retrieved from the pdb available literature references were generated from pubmed the cross_references and identifiers of external databases were also imported results of all the search tools are presented in the form of a paginated table protein records can be viewed by clicking the accession id or have been added to the hspir cart for downloading and further analysis individual protein records comprise names and lineage classification sequence_information domains and motifs structures ontologies references cross_references external links to different databases and finally the protein record information
