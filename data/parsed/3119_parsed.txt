sequence_analysis msisensor microsatellite_instability detection using paired_tumor sequence_data motivation microsatellite_instability msi is an important indicator of larger genome_instability and has been linked to many genetic_diseases including lynch_syndrome msi status is also an_independent for favorable_survival in multiple_cancer such as colorectal and endometrial it also informs the choice of chemother apeutic agents however the current pcrelectrophoresis based detection procedure is laborious and time consuming often requiring visual_inspection to categorize samples we developed msisensor a c program for automatically detecting somatic microsatellite changes it computes length distributions of microsatellites per site in paired tumor and normal sequence_data subsequently using these to statistically compare observed distributions in both samples comprehensive testing indicates msisensor is an efficient and effective tool for deriving msi status from standard tumor normal paired sequence_data availability_and https microsatellites are repetitive_sequences with unit length varying from bp during dna_replication those repetitive_sequences may expand or shrink due to strand slippage those errors are often recognized and repaired by the dna_mismatch machinery which includes genes such as mlh and msh however when mismatch_repair enzymes are defective replication errors will evade repair and will persist in somatic_cells as occurs in patients with hereditary_non also known as lynch_syndrome levels of microsatellite_instability msi are traditionally determined_experimentally the sizes of microsatellite_marker sets in tumor dna are compared via electrophoresis with corresponding dna isolated from a normal tissue_sample of the same patient the most widely used set of markers was recommended by a national_cancer consensus group and consists of either five or seven repeat markers samples are normally classified as microsatellite_instability high msi h microsatellite_instability low msi l and microsatellite stable mss although the experimental approach is considered_the its detection procedure is expensive and its scope is limited to only a small subset of microsatellites conversely paired_tumor genome_sequencing allows for comprehensive investigation of msi sites simultaneously and will likely become a routine part of diagnosis and treatment procedures recently it was reported that msi status can be derived from rna_seq but no stand alone pipeline is provided in that study here we describe msisensor a software_tool that quantifies msi in paired_tumor genome sequencing_data and reports somatic status of corresponding microsatellite sites in the human_genome msisensor is an efficient and effective software_tool for deriving msi status from tumor normal paired genome sequencing_data we will apply it to tcga data for msi screening and anticipate a wider usage of this tool in cancer clinical sequencing msisensor differentiates msi microsatellite instable samples from mss microsatellite stable ones the x axis is clinical classification of msi and mss the y axis is the percentage of microsatellite sites with a somatic indel
