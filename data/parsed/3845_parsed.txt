quartet inference from snp data under the coalescent model motivation increasing attention has been devoted to estimation of species level phylogenetic_relationships under the coalescent model however existing_methods either use summary_statistics gene_trees to carry out estimation ignoring an important source of variability in the estimates or involve computationally_intensive bayesian_markov algorithms that do not scale well to whole_genome datasets results we develop a method to infer relationships among quartets of taxa under the coalescent model using techniques from algebraic statistics uncertainty in the estimated relationships is quantified using the nonparametric bootstrap the performance of our method is assessed with simulated_data we then describe how our method could be used for species tree_inference in larger taxon samples and demonstrate its utility using datasets for sistrurus rattlesnakes and for soybeans availability_and the method to infer the phylogen etic relationship among quartets is implemented in the softwarewith recent_advances in dna_sequencing it is now common to have available alignments from multiple genes for inference of an overall species level phylogeny while this species_tree is generally the object that we seek to estimate it is widely known that each individual gene has its own phylogeny called a gene_tree which may not agree with the species_tree many possible causes of this gene incongruence are known including horizontal_gene gene_duplication and loss hybridization and incomplete_lineage of these the best studied is incomplete_lineage which is commonly modeled by the coalescent_process much recent effort has been devoted to the development of methods to estimate species level phylogenies from multi_locus data under the coalescent model here we consider this basic problem although our approach to the problem differs from previous_approaches in several important_ways previous_approaches can be divided_into two groups summary_statistics approaches and sequence based_approaches summary_statistics approaches first estimate a gene_tree independently for each gene and then treat the estimated gene_trees as data for a second stage of analysis to estimate the species_tree the most popular approaches in this category are maximum tree also implemented in the program stem star steac mp est and minimize deep coalescences as implemented in the program phylonet these methods are computationally_efficient for large_datasets but generally ignore variability in the estimated gene_trees and thus potentially lose accuracy the second group of methods uses the full data for estimation of the species_tree via a bayesian_framework for inference the three most common methods in this group best beast and snapp all seek to estimate the posterior_distribution for the species_tree using markov_chain mcmc but differ in some details of the implementation these methods become time consuming when the number of loci is large and assessment of convergence of the mcmc can be difficult our proposed method is distinct from both classes of existing_approaches in that it uses the full data directly but does not utilize a bayesian_framework it is thus computationally_efficient while incorporating all sources of variability both mutational variance and coalescent variance cf in the estimation process the theory underlying our method applies to unlinked single_nucleotide snp data for which each site is assumed to have its own genealogy drawn from the coalescent model however we use simulation to show that the method also performs well for multi_locus sequence_data to describe our proposed method we first begin with a brief overview of the coalescent model in the context of species level phylogenetics we use simulation to assess the performance of the method for both simulated and empirical data we conclude with a short discussion of how the proposed method can be scaled up to larger taxon sets for estimation of species phylogenies in a coalescent framework and apply it to two empirical datasets to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup comwe have presented a method to reliably infer the valid split in a set of four taxa we have demonstrated that the method performs very well over a range of simulation conditions the method can be easily extended for use in inferring species phylogenies in larger taxon samples as demonstrated by our applications to the rattlesnake data and to the soybean data the method thus makes a valuable contribution to the collection of methods for inferring species level phylogenetic_trees under the coalescent model for either multi_locus or unlinked snp data
