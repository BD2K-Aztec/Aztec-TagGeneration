structural_bioinformatics a knowledge based orientation potential for transcription_factor dna docking motivation computational_modeling of proteindna complexes remains_a in structural_bioinformatics one of the key_factors for a successful proteindna docking is a potential function that can accurately discriminate the near native structures from decoy complexes and at the same time make conformational_sampling more efficient here we developed a novel orientation dependent knowledge based residue_level potential for improving transcription_factor tf dna docking results we demonstrated the performance of this new potential in tfdna binding_affinity prediction discrimination of native protein_dna from decoy structures and most importantly in rigid tfdna docking the rigid tfdna docking with the new orientation potential on a benchmark of complexes successfully predicts of the cases with root_mean deviations lower than a and of the cases with root_mean deviations lower than a the results suggest that docking with this new orientation dependent coarse_grained statistical potential can achieve high docking accuracy and can serve as a crucial first step in multi_stage flexible proteindna docking availability_and the new potential is available atproteindna interactions play crucial roles in many biological_processes transcription_factors tfs which bind to specific cis_regulatory on dna and regulate_gene represent one of the largest groups of proteins in many genomes how tfs recognize and bind specifically to their dna target_sequences despite of decades of efforts is still not fully understood benefited from the technical_advances in experimental structure_determination high_resolution structures of tfdna complexes have provided a glimpse of tfdna interaction in each complex a collection of such views may offer valuable insights into the molecular_mechanism of tfdna recognition and the evolution of gene_regulatory a tfdna complex model is also a starting_point for structure based tf binding_site which has received much research_attention recently despite technical_advances in experimental structure_determination only a small percentage of tfdna complex structures have been solved and deposited in protein_data pdb computational docking between a protein and dna on the other hand has been considered as a cost efficient alternative to the usually time consuming experimental methods macromolecule docking relies on some sorts of energy_functions for building complex models there are two major types of the potentials for studying protein_dna physics based and knowledge based for example van dijk et_al applied a physics based potential originally developed for proteinprotein_docking to proteindna docking van knowledge_based derived from experimental_structures are considered more attractive and have more practical value in structural_bioinformatics studies owing to their relative simplicity these knowledgebased potentials generally vary in their resolutions from residue_level to atom level and in their distance scales from distance independent to distance_dependent although high_resolution atomic_level potentials can provide the details needed to accurately discriminate near native structures from decoys coarse_grained potentials can have a smooth and less rugged energy_landscape making it less likely to get trapped in local_minima during conformational search another advantage of the coarse_grained potentials at residue nucleotide level is their capability in addressing the dynamic nature of macromolecules as they are less sensitive to small conformational changes to take advantage of both the coarse level and the atomic_level potentials multi_scale approaches are often adopted in which near native models are constructed first with a coarse level potential followed by refinement with high_resolution potentials in this study we focus on the development of a novel knowledge based residue_level potential for accurate docking between tfs and their dna target_sequences previous_studies have revealed different interaction_modes between tfs and other major types of dna_binding such as restriction_enzymes and non specific dna_binding in addition the negatively_charged aspartate and glutamate are overrepresented in restriction_enzymes compared with other types of dna_binding as the major_goal of this study is to develop a proteindna_interaction potential for assessing tfdna binding_affinity in tfdna docking non tf proteindna complexes including restriction_enzymes and non specific dna_binding are not included in the dataset for potential development liu et_al have previously_developed a knowledge based residue_level potential based on statistical_analysis of known tfdna complex structures the potential uses dna tri nucleotides called triplets as an interaction unit to study the interactions between tf and dna_molecules the triplets could be real nucleotides with explicit positions native nucleotides or pseudo nucleotide placeholders that do not make any structural or energy contribution toward potential calculation the triplet representation has the advantage of covering both the preference of individual bases and the local environment around the nucleotides it has been shown that this multi body potential performs well in assessing tfdna interactions and in proteindna docking the binding_specificity between a dna and a protein is generally contributed by hydrogen_bonds it has been shown that two thirds of the hydrogen_bonds between amino_acids and bases lead to specific complex interactions kono and sarai have previously studied the radial and angular_distributions for hydrogen_bonds and found that the angular_distributions of protein atoms around potential hydrogen_bond forming atoms of bases have different patterns the strength of a hydrogen_bond is usually defined by bond_length s and angle s between a donor and an acceptor therefore adding angular information to a statistical potential can be expected to improve the accuracy in assessing tfdna binding_affinity and specificity in this article we present an orientation dependent knowledge based potential derived from a non redundant set of tf dna complex structures through converting the observed_frequencies of base residue pairs with respect to both distances and angles to a potential based on boltzmanns principle the performance of the new potential was assessed through binding_affinity prediction and tfdna rigid docking the results show much better accuracy in tfdna binding_affinity prediction and rigid tfdna docking with the new orientation potential when compared with the residue potential without angle information
