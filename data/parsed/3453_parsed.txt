pathwave discovering patterns of differentially_regulated enzymes in metabolic_pathways motivation gene_expression by microarrays or transcript sequencing enables observing the pathogenic function of tumors on a mesoscopic level results we investigated neuroblastoma tumors that clinically exhibit a very heterogeneous course ranging from rapid_growth with fatal_outcome to spontaneous_regression and detected regulatory oncogenetic shifts in their metabolic_networks in contrast to common enrichment tests we took network_topology into account by applying adjusted wavelet transforms on an elaborated and new d grid representation of curated pathway maps from the kyoto enzyclopedia of genes and genomes the aggressive form of the tumors showed regulatory shifts for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis as well as folate mediated metabolism of the one carbon pool in respect to increased nucleotide production we spotted an oncogentic regulatory switch in glutamate metabolism for which we provided experimental_validation being the first steps towards new possible drug_therapy the pattern_recognition method we used complements normal enrichment tests to detect such functionally_related regulation patterns availability_and pathwave is implemented in a package for r www r project org version or higher it is freely_available fromcancer cells exhibit a dramatically disturbed metabolism to satisfy their high bioenergetic demands for cell_proliferation accordingly a long_standing strategy for cancer treatment is to attack basic tumor metabolism mainly these treatments are rather unspecific and hinder nucleotide biosynthesis to whom correspondence should be addressed besides this the introduction of experimental high_throughput methods in functional_genomics such as gene_expression using microarrays and genomewide sequencing has evoked the challenging_task to observe and understand the pathogenic function of tumors on a mesoscopic level however the large_volume of information generated in these experiments must be funneled into manageable and functionally sensible partitions to select components that well describe the tumor pathologies intelligent embedding of the expression data into the underlying topology of the metabolic_network may enable the detection of tumor specific metabolism for directed and specific_targeting of tumor_cells neuroblastoma is the most common solid extracranial tumor of early childhood mainly affecting children at the age of about year it is derived from primitive cells of the sympathetic_nervous in many patients neuroblastoma is metastatic at the time of diagnosis and undergoes rapid progression with fatal_outcome alternatively neuroblastomas especially in infants_younger year at diagnosis can regress spontaneously and the tumor can differentiate into benign ganglioneuroma in older_infants detailed diagnosis and appropriate adjustment of therapy requires the support of investigations at the molecular level dna_microarray improved the prediction of patient outcome in comparison to established risk markers we wanted to track how aggressive neuroblastomas have specifically regulated their metabolism to optimize oncogenetic fitness and to elucidate ways to severely perturb this process an analysis method was required that discovers pathways in the metabolic_network especially showing significant shifts similar and contrasting in regulation when analyzing data on a metabolic_network enzymes can be represented by their corresponding genes transcriptional data and the topological information derived from the metabolic_network was connected by calculating zscores of highly_correlated sub networks improved classification of breast_cancers with expression_patterns of small subnets of a signal_transduction network common gene_expression levels of neighboring nodes in a metabolic_network were calculated by averaging over all neighbors
