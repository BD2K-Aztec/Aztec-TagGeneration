blockwise hmm computation for large_scale population genomic inference motivation a promising class of methods for large_scale population genomic inference use the conditional sampling distribution csd which approximates the probability of sampling an individual with a particular dna_sequence given that a collection of sequences from the population has already been observed the csd has a wide_range including imputing missing sequence_data estimating recombination_rates inferring human colonization history and identifying tracts of distinct ancestry in admixed_populations most well used csds are based on hidden_markov hmms although computationally_efficient in principle methods resulting from the common implementation of the relevant hmm techniques remain intractable for large genomic_datasets results to address_this a set of algorithmic improvements for performing the exact hmm computation is introduced here by exploiting the particular structure of the csd and typical characteristics of genomic_data it is empirically demonstrated that these improvements result in a speedup of several orders_of for large_datasets and that the speedup continues to increase with the number of sequences the optimized algorithms can be adopted in methods for various applications including the ones mentioned above and make previously impracticable analyses possible availability software available upon request with the cost of genomic_sequencing rapidly decreasing there is a growing need for statistical methodologies that can efficiently accommodate genomic_scale data for many individuals while accounting for complex patterns of variation e g linkage_disequilibrium caused by evolutionary_processes such as mutation and recombination the applicable underlying statistical_model is the coalescent with recombination which describes the distribution of genealogical histories for a collection of individuals known methods for inference under this model are generally intractable at the genomic_scale so practicable methods must realize a balance to whom correspondence should be addressed between computational_efficiency and approximating key_properties of the coalescent with recombination a promising class of such methods use the conditional sampling distribution csd a csd approximates the probability under the coalescent with recombination of sampling an individual with a particular dna_sequence given that a collection of sequences from the population has already been observed intuitively recombination partitions the newly sampled sequence into segments each of which is a copy of the corresponding segment in a previously sampled sequence with imperfections introduced by mutation for computational_efficiency this construction is often cast as a hidden_markov hmm the hidden state at a site indicates the previously sampled sequence being copied and the associated observed state the allele of the new sample even within this framework there are alternatives as it is possible to trade_off fidelity to the underlying coalescent_process for computational_efficiency the csd of for example is the most accurate but is a constant factor slower than csds proposed byand by with the latter being the fastest but least accurate csds for more complex models incorporating gene_conversion diploidy demography and admixture have also been proposed methods incorporating the csd generally fall into one of several categories likelihoods can be approximated using csd based importance sampling de coupled with composite methods or directly as a product of csds in conjunction with expectationmaximization or markov_chain these methods have been used for estimation of fine_scale recombination_rates gene_conversion parameters population demography and population_structure it is also possible to infer and use the hidden_states in the hmm csd computation this has been used for admixture inference in which genomic_segments corresponding to ancestral_populations are identified and also within a pseudo gibbs_sampling framework to phase genotype sequence_data into haplotype sequence_data and to impute missing_data we have presented three optimized algorithms for computing the conditional sampling probability csp smc n briefly recall that algorithm with c c t is equivalent to algorithm we have presented a number of optimized algorithms for computing the cspcsp csp smc n our optimizations are based on two intuitive observations first the number of unique haplotypes in a genomic sample is dramatically_reduced within relatively short regions and second the large number of non polymorphic_loci in a genomic sample though informative do not distinguish between haplotypes these observations are formalized and leveraged to refine the recursive equations for computingcomputing computing smc n yielding optimized yet exact algorithms we have described our optimization algorithms in the context of the hmm associated with the csdcsd csd smc proposed by it is natural to question whether similar optimizations are applicable to related csds such as those proposed by fearnhead and donnelly and by in section we described two sufficient_conditions property which stipulates that upon recombination a new hidden haplotype is chosen independently and uniformly at random and property which stipulates that the emission distribution depends only on the allele at the current locus of the hidden haplotype the aforementioned csds do satisfy both of these properties in particular stronger forms of property hold for both csds enabling additional optimizations we have not empirically analysed the resulting optimized algorithms but by considering the resulting asymptotic time complexities analogous to those in we anticipate that the speedups obtained will be qualitatively comparable to those observed forfor for smc though the corresponding magnitudes are difficult to estimate it is also interesting to consider csds for more complex demographic scenarios a theoretically straightforward extension of of of smc to variable population_size for example will continue to satisfy both properties and and will therefore be amenable to very similar optimizations on the other hand extension to structured populations populations that are divided_into several demes between which there is limited migration will not satisfy property as the new hidden haplotype chosen upon recombination depends on
