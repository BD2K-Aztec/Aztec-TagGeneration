genome_analysis sequential monte_carlo multiple testing motivation in molecular_biology as in many other scientific fields the scale of analyses is ever increasing often complex monte_carlo is required sometimes within a large_scale multiple testing setting the resulting computational costs may be prohibitively high results we here present mcfdr a simple novel algorithm for false_discovery fdr modulated sequential monte_carlo mc multiple_hypothesis the algorithm iterates between adding mc samples across tests and calculating intermediate fdr values for the collection of tests mc sampling is stopped either by sequential mc or based on a threshold on fdr an essential property of the algorithm is that it limits the total number of mc samples whatever the number of true null_hypotheses we show on both real and simulated_data that the proposed algorithm provides large gains in computational_efficiency availability mcfdr is implemented in the genomic hyperbrowser http hyperbrowser uio no mcfdr a web_based system for genome_analysis all input_data and results are available and can be reproduced through a galaxy pages document at the development of novel experimental_techniques is rapidly increasing the generation of data in many fields in biology in particular in genomics with the advent_of chromatin_immunoprecipitation chip technology combined with nextgeneration_sequencing generates high_resolution data along the genome on dna_methylation histone_modifications transcription_factor binding and more the large amount of data generated by these techniques opens up for statistical studies of relations between genomic properties both globally and locally along the genome an example of such a local analysis is the study of how the relation between histone_modifications and repeating elements varies across chromosomes a natural approach to such an investigation is to split the genome into bins along the genome e g one bin per chromosome cytoband or gene and then perform a statistical_test of a null_hypothesis h versus an alternative hypothesis h for each bin at the same time due to the complex structural_properties of the genome it is often inappropriate to make simplified assumptions that would enable analytic evaluation of significance instead monte_carlo mc sampling is often needed resorting to computationally_expensive reshuffling of genomic_elements for each mc sample as a consequence monte_carlo in multiple testing settings is rapidly becoming important with tests being performed for a large number of bins locally along the genome the computational requirements may become extremely_high as the effort needed is basically the multiple of a very large number of test by a possibly also very large number of mc samples several papers have considered ways to reduce the number of samples during mc based p value computation for individual_tests propose a sequential mc algorithm for p value computation reducing the needed number of mc samples for tests that are anyway insignificant other papers consider alternative ideas for p value estimation such as controlling resampling risk and prediction of p values using random_forest models also there has been some work on monte_carlo approaches for multiple testing in cases where p values can be calculated analytically in this article we propose an algorithm that limits the total number of needed mc samples regardless of how many tests are truly h in section we describe our algorithm in which mc sampling is stopped either according to the sequential mc stopping rule or when we reach a given multiple testing significance threshold then in section we show on both simulated_and that this method can lead to a drastically_reduced total number of mc samples finally section_presents a discussion and some conclusions further details are provided in the accompanying galaxy pages document
