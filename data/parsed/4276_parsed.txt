structural_bioinformatics sitecomp a server for ligand_binding analysis in protein_structures motivation computational characterization of ligand_binding in proteins provides preliminary information for functional_annotation protein design and ligand optimization sitecomp implements binding_site analysis for comparison of binding_sites evaluation of residue contribution to binding_sites and identification of sub sites with distinct molecular_interaction properties availability_and the sitecomp server and tutorials are freely_available atthe interaction of proteins with their ligands metabolites proteins nucleic_acids lipids etc is the most fundamental of all biological_mechanisms these interactions are often specific and are the consequence of distinct molecular_interaction properties of the binding_sites hence the analysis and comparison of binding_site properties can shed light on the basis of ligand affinity selectivity and ultimately the molecular_underpinnings of protein_function the most frequent questions that arise in binding_site analysis are i does a binding_site contain regions sub sites with special molecular_interaction properties ii what residues contribute to the formation of a binding_site iii what are the differences between two similar binding_sites sitecomp is a webserver designed to answer_these hence facilitating the design of new experiments and the analysis of existing data in the context of elucidating molecular_mechanisms and drug_design while tools for the characterization of sub sites within a ligandbinding region have been available since the development of the grid approach no freely_available webservers exist to carry out this type of analysis existing computational_methods have also achieved success in the identification of ligandbinding sites including detection of local_similarity or comparison of interaction properties of complete proteins however these methods are not well suited for identifying differences between similar binding_sites which can be exploited to improve ligand selectivity methods that address the question of to whom correspondence should be addressed residue contribution to a binding_site can be divided_into two groups i computational alanine_scanning methods massova and and ii energy decomposition methods the former have been developed exclusively for proteinprotein_interaction surfaces while the latter which are relatively accurate require computationally_expensive molecular_dynamics or monte_carlo sitecomp complements the existing_methods bridging several of the current gaps by providing a web_based interface for identification of differences between similar binding_sites discovery of sub sites with different interaction properties and for fast albeit more approximate calculations of residue contribution to binding_sites it integrates these three modes of binding_site analysis into an easy to use interactive interface with graphical input and output a larger binding_site visualization of the output in the server facilitates comparison and combination of mif clusters detected with different parameters and probes
