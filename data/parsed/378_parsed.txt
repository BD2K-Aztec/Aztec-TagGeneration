gene_expression a note on the false_discovery of novel peptides in proteogenomics motivation proteogenomics has been well accepted as a tool to discover novel genes in most conventional proteogenomic studies a global false_discovery is used to filter out false posi tives for identifying credible novel peptides however it has been found that the actual level of false_positives in novel peptides is often out of control and behaves differently for different genomes results to quantitatively model this problem we theoretically analyze the subgroup false_discovery of annotated and novel peptides our analysis shows that the annotation completeness ratio of a genome is the dominant factor_influencing the subgroup fdr of novel peptides experimental_results on two real_datasets of escherichia_coli and mycobacterium_tuberculosis support our conjecture tandem_mass ms_ms based proteogenomics has been applied to refinement of annotated_genes discovery of novel genes personal_genomics and disease related studies unlike traditional genomic annotation techniques such as in silico ab_initio or comparative or cdna seq based_methods proteogenomics allows validating proteincoding_genes directly at the protein level which is more favorable to identify novel genes researchers usually search the experimental ms_ms against a large protein database that is constructed from the genomic or transcriptomic sequences and filter the search results to control the false_discovery fdr it has been observed previously that under a fixed fdr the inflated database generated by e g six open_reading orf translation of a whole_genome significantly_decreases the sensitivity of peptide_identification however few studies probe into the effect of the large database on the estimated fdr especially for the novel peptides most proteogenomic studies estimate a global fdr for all peptide_identifications that is the identifications of annotated peptides and novel peptides are subject to fdr_estimation in combination some researchers noted the high actual fdr of novel peptides and therefore employed more stringent filtering strategies e g post error probability or separate fdrs for annotated and novel peptides highlighted that for well annotated genomes such as the escherichia coli_genome the post error probability_distribution ofby removing some genes from a completely annotated database based on their summed length we could perform numerical_simulation of h then experimental fdr ann x which is the ratio of the number of identified annotated decoys to the number of annotated targets and fdr new x which is the ratio of the number of identified novel decoys to the number of novel targets can be calculated and compared to the theoretical onesconcluded that the e coli_genome might have achieved a complete annotation we downloaded one of these e colis datasets from peptideatlas which consisted of six raw files trypsin digested sax sax ms_ms in total the latest genome_sequence and annotation data nc were downloaded from the ncbi website first a stop to stop orf translation was applied to the e colis genome and a commonly used contaminant database containing porcine trypsin and human keratins was concatenated the simply reversed form of each protein_sequence in the combined database was added resulting in a combined target decoy_database to facilitate fdr_estimation next the ms_ms were searched against the combined database using pfind studio version peptides were digested in silico with up to two missed cleavages allowed and carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as the fix modification and oxidation on methionine as the variable modification the precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set to ppm and da respectively a global peptide level fdr of was used for quality_assessment which allowed us to identify peptides among these peptides were contaminant ones were annotated ones and were novel ones since the e colis genome has been almost completely annotated the novel target identifications should be mostly false ones just as expected among the decoy identifications above the threshold of fdr were novel decoys very close to the number of novel targets indicating that the subgroup fdr of novel peptides was close to to simulate h we randomly removed some genes from the annotated database to vary the ratio of their summed length to all genes using the same global fdr threshold of we obtained the numbers of targets and decoys separately on annotated and novel peptides allowing us to calculate the experimental fdr ann x and fdr new x given h and l the theoretical fdr ann x and fdr new x were also calculated through equations and our simulation showed that the experimental fdr ann x were close to the theoretical value of with a minimum of and a maximum of moreover the experimental fdr new x fits well with the theoretical counterpart as shown in on the other hand we can deduce the value of h from the experimental fdr new x based on equation as shown in the pairs of sampled and deduced values of h distribute diagonally indicating that the deduced h could be used as an estimate of the real annotation completeness ratio we also found that if we remove the novel genes from the annotated database and search the spectra of novel peptides identified by orf translation search against the partially annotated database then these spectra will be assigned with false peptides and random scores see supplementary_materials s and s for more details
