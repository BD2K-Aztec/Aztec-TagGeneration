sequence_analysis accounting for epistatic_interactions improves the functional analysis of protein_structures motivation the constraints under which sequence structure and function coevolve are not fully understood bringing this mutual relationship to light can reveal the molecular basis of binding catalysis and allostery thereby identifying function and rationally guiding protein redesign underlying these relationships are the epistatic_interactions that occur when the consequences of a mutation to a protein are determined by the genetic_background in which it occurs based on prior data we hypothesize that epistatic forces operate most strongly between residues nearby in the structure resulting in smooth evolutionary importance across the structure methods and results we find that when residue scores of evolutionary importance are distributed smoothly between nearby residues functional site prediction_accuracy improves accordingly we designed a novel measure of evolutionary importance that focuses on the interaction between pairs of structurally neighboring residues this measure that we term pair interaction evolutionary trace yields greater functional site overlap and better structure based proteome_wide functional_predictions conclusions our data show that the structural smoothness of evolutionary importance is a fundamental feature of the coevolution of sequence structure and function mutations operate on individual_residues but selective_pressure depends in part on the extent to which a mutation perturbs interactions with neighboring residues in practice this principle led us to redefine the importance of a residue in terms of the importance of its epistatic_interactions with neighbors yielding better annotation of functional_residues motivating experimental_validation of a novel functional site in lexa and refining protein_function protein functional sites and their key residue determinants are important to elucidate the molecular_details underlying protein_function design drugs engineer proteins and predict protein_function the experimental gold_standard to map these sites is alanine_scanning but this approach is rarely exhaustive and limited by the availability of biologically_relevant assays therefore complementary inexpensive and scalable approaches search for functional sites and residues by analyzing the vast evolutionary record of protein_sequences computationally the evolutionary trace et identifies functionally_important residue positions by finding sequence substitution patterns correlated with divergences among homologs thereby explicitly taking phylogenetic_relationships into account et predictions have been extensively validated experimentally and through large_scale retrospective predictions of functional sites and protein functions these studies point to a number of general and consistent observations in well structured protein_domains i sequence_positions may be ranked by evolutionary importance ii most important sequence residues cluster structurally iii these structural clusters predict functional sites such that iv small structurefunction motifs called d templates based on these clusters can predict protein_function on a genomic_scale the evolutionary principles that give rise to these useful patterns remain_unclear this work suggests that epistasis drives these patterns traditionally epistasis means interactions between genes however it is also recognized as a major force in molecular_evolution of individual proteins strong epistatic interactions_occur

functional sites in that light the clustering of these residues simply reflects the fundamental epistatic coupling of neighbors these observations motivate a series of hypotheses we hypothesize that if epistasis and function constrain residue neighbors during selective_pressure then evolutionary importance should distribute smoothly over a protein_structure if so optimizing et rank smoothness for example by selecting sequences appropriately should improve predictions of functional sites molecular_determinants and functions thereby a modified et algorithm could directly enforce smoothness and improve predictions by focusing primarily on epistatic_interactions our results show that in practice we can assess et rank smoothness by treating the structure as a network or graph of amino_acid nodes linking these nodes by edges indicating structural contact and applying the discrete laplacian operator from a graph_theory to quantify et smoothness selections of input_sequences that minimize the smoothing function constructed from the laplacian operator then led to better functional site analyses by et moreover a new inherently smoother pair interaction evolutionary trace piet algorithm built to measure the importance of neighbor to neighbor residue pairs instead of single residues improves functional site predictions in retrospective_study and in an experimental application on escherichia_coli lexaa protein that triggers the sos_response through which bacteria evolve drug_resistance finally piet improves large_scale functional_annotations together these data show that the smoothest structural distribution of evolutionary importance reflects functional information best and that epistatic_interactions are strongly reflective of the effective distance between residues
