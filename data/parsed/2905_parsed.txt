genome_analysis metal fast and efficient meta_analysis of genomewide association scans metal provides a computationally_efficient tool for meta_analysis of genome_wide association scans which is a commonly used approach for improving power complex_traits gene_mapping studies metal provides a rich scripting interface and implements efficient memory management to allow analyses of very large_data and to support a variety of input file_formats availability_and metal including source_code documentation examples and executables is available atmeta analysis is becoming an increasingly important tool in genome_wide gwas of complex genetic_diseases and traits meta_analysis provides an efficient and practical strategy for detecting variants with modest effect_sizes we and others have used metal for performing meta_analysis of gwas to identify loci reproducibly associated with a variety of traits such as type_diabetes lipid_levels bmi blood_pressure and fasting_glucose meta_analysis of genome_wide association summary_statistics in contrast to direct analysis of pooled individual_level data alleviates common concerns with privacy of study participants and avoids cumbersome integration of genotype and phenotypic_data from different studies meta_analysis allows for custom analyses of individual studies to conveniently account for population_substructure the presence of related individuals study specific covariates and many other ascertainment related issues it has been shown that meta_analysis of summary_statistics is as efficient in terms of statistical_power as pooling individual_level data across studies but much less cumbersome since gwas routinely examine evidence for association at millions of directly genotyped and imputed snps across dozens or even hundreds of individual studies it is important to use a fast and flexible tool to perform meta_analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed overall p value p z
