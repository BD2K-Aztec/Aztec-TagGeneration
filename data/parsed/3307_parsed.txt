genome_analysis nust analysis of the interplay between nucleoid organization and gene_expression different experimental_results suggest the presence of an interplay between global transcriptional_regulation and chromosome spatial_organization in bacteria the identification and clear visualization of spatial clusters of contiguous genes targeted by specific dna_binding or sensitive to nucleoid perturbations can elucidate links between nucleoid structure and gene_expression similarly statistical_analysis to assess correlations between results from independent experiments can provide the integrated analysis needed in this line of research nust nucleoid survey tools based on the escherichia coli_genome gives the non expert the possibility to analyze the aggregation of genes or loci sets along the genome coordinate at different scales of observation it is useful to discover correlations between different sources of data e g expression binding or genomic_data and genome_organization a user can use it on datasets in the form of gene_lists coming from his her own experiments or bioinformatic_analyses but also make use of the internal database which collects data from many published_studies availability_and nust is a web_server available at http www lgm upmc fr nust the website is implemented in php sqlite and ajax with all_major while the core algorithms are optimized and implemented in c nust has an extensive help page and provides a direct visualization of results as well as different downloadable file_formats a template perl code for automated access to the web_server can be downloaded at http www lgm upmc fr nust downloads in order to allow the users to use nust in systematic bioinformatic_analyses
