systems_biology prediction of metabolic_reactions based on atomic and molecular_properties of small_molecule compounds motivation our knowledge of the metabolites in cells and their reactions is far from complete as revealed by metabolomic measurements that detect many more small_molecules than are documented in metabolic databases here we develop an approach for predicting the reactivity of small_molecule metabolites in enzyme_catalyzed that combines expert_knowledge computational_chemistry and machine_learning results we classified reactions documented in the kegg_database from all six enzyme commission classes ec into reaction classes each of which is marked by a characteristic functional_group transformation reaction_centers and surrounding local structures in substrates and products of these reactions were represented using smarts we found that each of the smarts defined chemical substructures is widely_distributed among metabolites but only a fraction of the functional_groups in these substructures are reactive using atomic properties of atoms in a putative reaction_center and molecular_properties as features we trained support_vector svm classifiers to discriminate between functional_groups that are reactive and non reactive classifier accuracy was assessed by cross_validation analysis a typical sensitivity tp tp fn or specificity tn tn fp is our results suggest that metabolic reactivity of small_molecule compounds can be predicted with reasonable accuracy based on the presence of a potentially reactive functional_group and the chemical_features of its local environment availability the classifiers presented here can be used to predict reactions via a web_site cellsignaling lanl gov reactivity the web_site is freely_available metabolomics the study of a cells complement of small_molecule metabolites has recently been recognized as an important part of post genomics science identification of metabolites including their chemical_structures and reconstruction of the network of enzyme_catalyzed in which metabolites to whom correspondence should be addressed participate are two of the important challenges for metabolomic_analysis of a cell large_scale metabolic_network reconstructions currently available are based on literature data and genome_annotation which identifies genes_encoding reconstructions intended to be suitable for flux analysis have been obtained in this way for a variety of organisms organism specific metabolic databases are also available for an example see the sequence knowledge based_approach to network_reconstruction has a number of limitations this approach can only account for reactions that have been characterized experimentally in some system and large gaps in our knowledge of metabolism seem likely more than of known metabolic_activities that are classified by enzyme commission ec numbers are not associated with known amino_acid in addition even for escherichia_coli the quintessential model_organism novel metabolic_reactions continue to be discovered xenobiotic_metabolism which ranges from biodegradation pathways in microorganisms to drug_metabolism in mammals is rarely considered in network reconstructions an aspect that is also largely neglected is the broad_substrate of many enzymes which has been exploited in synthesis of organic_compounds and in building libraries of drug_candidates broad_substrate has been stated to be the major reason why many more metabolites will be present in a metabolome than can be deduced from genome_sequence to improve network_reconstruction we must generate and use new types of data such as whole cell metabolite profiles which can be produced using techniques such as high_resolution ms these techniques have been used to detect many novel metabolites both endogenous and xenobiotic but signatures of novel metabolites typically cannot be easily associated with chemical_structures as our ability to analyze complex_mixtures obtained from cells grows so does appreciation of our ignorance of the metabolic_networks that produce the compounds in these mixtures although current msbased techniques enable researchers to detect a large fraction of the metabolome with relatively low per experiment cost methods
