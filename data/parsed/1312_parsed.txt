structural_bioinformatics deltagseg macrostate estimation via molecular_dynamics simulations and multiscale time series analysis binding free_energy obtained through molecular_dynamics simulations reflect intermolecular interaction states through a series of independent snapshots typically the free_energies of multiple simulated series each with slightly different starting conditions need to be estimated previous_approaches carry out this task by moving averages at certain decorrelation times assuming that the system comes from a single conformation description of binding_events here we discuss a more general approach that uses statistical_modeling wavelets denoising and hierarchical_clustering to estimate the significance of multiple statistically distinct_subpopulations reflecting potential macrostates of the system we present the deltagseg r package that performs macrostate estimation from multiple replicated series and allows molecular_biologists chemists to gain physical insight into the molecular_details that are not easily_accessible by experimental_techniques availability deltagseg is a bioconductor r package available atfree energy calculations are extensively used to understand intermolecular_interactions among the several free_energy estimation methods the mmgb pb sa molecular_mechanics with generalized born and surface_area solvation has gained popularity because of its fast performance and its ability to predict trends in affinities traditionally in mmgb pb sa one performs molecular_dynamics simulations mds and selects a set of representative snapshots from a stretch of the trajectory that is deemed to be at equilibrium or converged the mds are often replicated multiple times typically from to each time with slightly different starting conditions of primary interest is the calculation of the relative free binding_energy g g complex g receptor g ligand which is estimated from the replicated mds of the complex receptor and ligand terms the average g across the set of selected snapshots is then reported as the net free_energy which is subject to large variation all average based_methods assume that the g series originates from a single conformation description of binding_events they are designed to minimize autocorrelation and estimate the series on appropriate de correlation times otherwise the statistical error would be underestimated via the method of statistical inefficiency or block averaging it has been discovered that this approach is sensitive to the drift during the course of the simulation and especially in long simulations gives exponentially increased correlation times the unappealing consequence of the monotonic relationship between the correlation and the simulation times is that longer simulations lead to less data_points for reliable inference our new deltagseg methodology relaxes the restrictive single conformation assumption and estimates multiple distinct_subpopulations reflecting potential macrostates upon experimental_validation within a series and its replicates rigorous statistical_modeling avoids the correlation time estimation without compromising the statistical validity of the estimates
