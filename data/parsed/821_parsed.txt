brat nova fast and accurate mapping of bisulfite treated reads in response to increasing amounts of sequencing_data faster and faster aligners need to become available here we introduce brat nova a completely rewritten and improved implementation of the mapping tool brat bw for bisulfite treated reads bs_seq brat nova is very fast and accurate on the human_genome brat nova is times_faster than state of the art aligners while maintaining the same percentage of uniquely_mapped and space usage on synthetic reads brat nova is times_faster than state of the art aligners while maintaining similar mapping accuracy methylation call accuracy methylation_level accuracy and space efficiency availability_and the software is available in the public_domain atwhole genome bisulfite_sequencing bs_seq allows genome_wide studies of dna_methylation at single_base sodium bisulfite_treatment of dna followed by pcr and sequencing enables the detection of the methylation status of individual cytosines the first step in bs_seq analysis is to map bisulfite treated reads to the reference_genome since sodium_bisulfite converts unmethylated_cytosines to thymines the criteria for mapping bs_seq reads requires one to allow a t in a read to match a c in the reference_genome various indexes have been used to accelerate the mapping of bsseq reads to a reference_genome in practice tools that employ the fm_index achieve the best balance between space requirements mapping accuracy and speed among these bismark and bs seeker bsseeker are arguably the most commonly used tools for bs_seq data here we introduce brat nova a completely rewritten and improved implementation of brat bw for aligning bs_seq reads brat nova employs a novel space efficient representation of the genome and supports local_alignment by allowing one indel per read brat nova is times_faster on the human_genome than bismark bs seeker and bsmap while demonstrating comparable results in terms of the proportion of mapped unique reads mapping accuracy methylation_level and methylation call accuracy and ram usage negative strands with cs converted to ts and each read with cs converted to ts is aligned only once to a single index which speeds up the mapping step for large_genomes such as the human_genome the concatenation of positive_and strands is longer than bases which is the current genome_size limit for brat bw to handle this brat nova uses an additional bit per base to track the strand identity after mapping bisulfite treated reads brat nova determines the methylation_level of each cytosine the methylation_level of a cytosine is defined as the fraction of mapped_reads that have a c i e methylated thus not converted to a t in that genomic location to the total number of reads_mapped to that location i e with a c or a t brat nova supports a single variable_length indel in the middle of a read by using two exactly matched seeds surrounding the indel followed by the linear time dynamic_programming described in the supplemental notes
