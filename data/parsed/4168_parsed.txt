genetics_and seed a user_friendly for exploring and visualizing microbial_community data in this article we present simple exploration of ecological data seed a data exploration tool for microbial_communities seed is written in r using the shiny library this provides access to powerful r based functions and libraries through a simple user_interface seed allows users to explore ecological datasets using principal coordinate analyses scatter plots bar plots hierarchal clustering and heatmaps availability_and seed is open_source and available at https github com danlbek seed contact the proliferation of microbial_community profiling is allowing researchers to study microbial_communities in new ways increasingly researchers in diverse fields are asking questions relating to how microbial_communities vary across samples for example researchers studying the human_microbiome are interested in how microbial_composition changes across body sites and through time hmp researchers studying disease look at how microbial_communities differ between samples from healthy and unhealthy individuals it is now standard practice to use cultivation independent high_throughput to identify the microbial_composition of many samples this produces a wealth of data about microbial_composition in many different environments and conditions in conjunction with advances in sequencing resources researchers have developed a number of powerful software_tools to analyze and visualize this wealth of data packages such as mothur and qiime aggregate many tools to allow researchers to quickly and efficiently process large sequencing_datasets these currently available packages excel at performing robust computationally_intensive calculations that attempt to minimize the effects of noise and sequencing artifacts on downstream_analyses they often use a non visual interface for analysis even when they provide a graphical_user for their own functions requiring the user to know specific command and parameter combinations while this setup is ideal for pipeline development it is often a hindrance for data exploration simple exploration of ecological data seed fills a currently unmet need for a tool that allows researchers to quickly and easily visualize and explore the data that results from these pipelines this so_called exploratory_data has an important place in the toolbox of ecologists though there are texts that recommend specific exploratory techniques we know of no tool such as seed that bundles appropriate tools into an easy to use system for non programmers in this article we present seed a software_package that focuses on data exploration and visualization of microbial_community data derived from high_throughput abundance and hellinger transformations seed is not limited to microbial data though that was our primary research domain it can be used to explore any data that include both feature counts and values for response variables once the user has imported and verified their dataset they may easily explore their data with many plot types examples of some of the plots generated by seed are shown in the supplementary_information many of the plots include options to incorporate sample information by coloring points or bars according to metadata values this allows users to easily visualize the relationship between the sample metadata and the structure of the microbial_communities present in the samples the design of seed emphasizes simplicity over exhaustive inclusion of parameters in many or most cases researchers will use seed to understand general_trends in the data which may then inform more specialized analyses seed is designed to quickly explore ecological datasets and to act as a hypothesisgenerating tool publication quality figures and polished analyses are beyond the current scope of this project though seed can output all plots in pdf or png format additionally large dataset analysis may be too slow for a comfortable user experience note however that we used published microbiome and patient data with nearly samples and taxa on a standard laptop while preparing this publication seed is certainly capable of handling datasets with hundreds of samples and more than a thousand taxa as with any software_package not all analyses have been implemented in seed we encourage users to also consider other visualization_tools including phyloseq for analyses incorporating phylogenetic_relationships and emperor v azquez for pcoa analyses of very large_datasets additionally while seed provides some guidance for users tool selection and result interpretation still relies on user expertise
