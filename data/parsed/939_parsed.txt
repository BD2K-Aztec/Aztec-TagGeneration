characterizing rate_limiting steps in transcription from rna production times in live cells motivation single_molecule measurements of live escherichia_coli transcription dynamics suggest that this process ranges from sub to super poissonian depending on the conditions and on the promoter for its accurate quantification we propose a model that accommodates all these settings and statistical_methods to estimate the model_parameters and to select the relevant components results the new methodology has improved accuracy and avoids overestimating the transcription_rate due to finite measurement time by exploiting unobserved data and by accounting for the effects of discrete sampling first we use monte_carlo of models based on measurements to show that the methods are reliable and offer substantial improvements over previous methods next we apply the methods on measurements of transcription intervals of different promoters in live e coli and show that they produce significantly different results both in low and high noise settings and that in the latter case they even lead to qualitatively different results finally we demonstrate that the methods can be generalized for other similar purposes such as for estimating gene activation_kinetics in this case the new methods allow quantifying the inducer uptake dynamics as opposed to just comparing them between cases which was not previously possible we expect this new methodology to be a valuable_tool for functional analysis of cellular_processes using single_molecule or single_event microscopy measurements in live cells availability_and source_code is available under mozilla public license atin bacteria transcription is the main regulatory_mechanism of rna_numbers in the cell this conclusion is supported by the lack of correlation between rna_numbers and their degradation_rates and by the fact that most regulatory_molecules modulate the transcription_initiation process relevantly the regulatory_mechanisms of transcription allow wide adaptability as the kinetics of this process varies_widely between promoters and for the same promoter under different conditions live_cell measurements in escherichia_coli suggest that depending on the promoter and the conditions such as the presence absence of repressor activator molecules rna production can range from sub poissonian that is less uncertain than a poisson_process through poissonian to super poissonian such wide_dynamic is not likely achievable by a single mechanism and in agreement evidence suggests that this is a multi_step process currently the subprocesses that constitute transcription cannot be directly measured in live cells however it is possible to observe rna production of individual promoters with single_molecule resolution over time this information can be used to estimate the dynamical parameters of the subprocesses by the means of a stochastic_model the success of this strategy requires accurate and unbiased statistical_methods of data analysis as well as a model that can account for all possible dynamical regimes previously we made use of distributions of intervals between transcription events in various conditions in order to estimate in maximum_likelihood ml sense for each condition the number and duration of the rate_limiting steps in transcription relevantly unlike rna_numbers these intervals are not affected by rna degradation or dilution due to cell_division and consequently allow more accurate quantification of the transcription process however the previous model of transcription does not cover all potential cases e g super poissonian rna production here we first propose a model that by combining previous_models responsible for different dynamical behaviors is capable of exhibiting behaviors ranging from sub to super poissonian next we present methods to estimate its parameters in ml sense an advantage over previous methods is that the new methods also use information of the unobserved transcription events such additional information results in improved accuracy and can be used to correct the biases resulting from the limited the measurement time the methods can also account for the discrete sampling which is typical for a fluorescence_microscopy measurement the increased accuracy allows studying subprocesses with smaller time scales while the lack of bias is essential in order to correctly estimate the parameters of the more noisy models and to compare them in an unbiased manner the methods can also be used to provide features such as confidence in the estimated parameters and we use statistical_methods to select components of the model in out which can be used to determine if certain components are responsible for the observed dynamical_behavior we have proposed a model that combines a promoter onoff mechanism with a sequential_process of transcription_initiation which allows explaining recent measurements of transcription dynamics under a wide_range of conditions and established methods to estimate its parameters in maximum_likelihood sense using transcription interval data the methods enable more accurate quantification of the transcriptional dynamics both in theory and in practice as demonstrated by the monte_carlo as well as testing if particular components of the model are responsible for the observed dynamics in addition we compared the methods with previous methodsthe table shows the number of samples the selected model sel model the estimated parameters and estimates of their

coli and showed that the new methods produce significantly different results and can provide new biological_insight e g on the underlying sources of noise in transcription finally we demonstrated that the methods have a wider applicability on problems of similar nature such as estimating the kinetics of external activation of a promoter in its present form the proposed model should already be detailed enough to allow a genome_wide analysis of transcription and transcription_activation of individual genes under a wide_range of conditions in prokaryotes which is necessary to understand how inducers and repressors regulate the dynamics of gene_expression further we believe that our methods can be extended to enable future_studies of eukaryotic transcription dynamics and of translational dynamics at the single protein level
