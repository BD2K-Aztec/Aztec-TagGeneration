structural_bioinformatics measuring and comparing structural fluctuation patterns in large protein datasets motivation the function of a protein depends not only on its structure but also on its dynamics this is at the basis of a large body of experimental and theoretical work on protein dynamics further insight into the dynamicsfunction relationship can be gained by studying the evolutionary_divergence of protein_motions to investigate this we need appropriate comparative dynamics methods the most used dynamical similarity_score is the correlation between the root_mean fluctuations rmsf of aligned residues despite its usefulness rmsf is in general less evolutionarily_conserved than the native_structure a fundamental issue is whether rmsf is not as conserved as structure because dynamics is less conserved or because rmsf is not the best property to use to study its conservation results we performed a systematic_assessment of several scores that quantify the dis similarity between protein fluctuation patterns we show that the best scores perform as well as or better than structural dissimilarity as assessed by their consistency with the scop classification we conclude that to uncover the full extent of the evolutionary_conservation of protein fluctuation patterns it is important to measure the directions of fluctuations and their correlations between sites proteins like all molecules undergo structural fluctuations in physiological_conditions small and large structural changes directly related to protein functions occur at a wide_range of time scales relatively fast local fluctuations are for example involved in induced_fit ligand_binding slower and more global fluctuations are important in complex coherent transitions of allosteric proteins and molecular machines such dynamicsfunction relationships are at the basis of a large body of theoretical and experimental work on protein dynamics henzler concerted motions in protein_structures are conditioned by the lowest energy modes of fluctuations around their equilibrium conformation these modes can be obtained from simulation techniques such as molecular_dynamics md_simulations where the modes are extracted by principal_component of the covariance_matrix alternatively and to avoid high computational costs the normal_modes can be calculated from an equilibrium structure typically an experimental structure determined by x_ray scattering or nuclear_magnetic nmr using coarse_grained representations and elastic network models enms implying a harmonic approximation of the potential around the equilibrium structure several independent studies have shown that enm modes and principal_components obtained from md_simulations are in very good agreement see e g for these reasons enm normal_modes are commonly used to characterize protein dynamics and are convenient for studying large protein datasets in addition allosterism has been successfully studied using enms and it has been shown that functional conformational changes in general usually involve only a few normal_modes see for instance this has for example been exploited to investigate allosteric mechanisms and predict effector binding_sites in contrast with sequence or structure using dynamics in comparative computational studies has only recently started to emerge yet this is a field that has already contributed significantly to increasing our understanding of protein dynamics and in particular its conservation through evolution and relation to function in general it has been shown that backbone fluctuations are evolutionarily_conserved more detailed studies of particular folds or protein_families have found that the lowest energy normal_modes or equivalently the highest principal_components of the fluctuation covariance_matrix are conserved for homologous_proteins or even for non homologous_proteins with similar folds one obvious field of application is the adaptation of proteins to extreme temperatures and the associated changes in flexibilityseeand references therein among other applications reported are dynamics based alignments and detection of distant homologs to whom correspondence should be addressed and analysis of evolutionary_dynamics comparing protein dynamics implies the choice of one or more properties that characterize the dynamics of the proteins and measures of the dis similarity of such properties a number of properties and dis similarity_measures have so_far been reported to capture the conservation of protein dynamics the simplest and most used property is the atomic root_mean fluctuations rmsf which is comparable to x_ray b factors commonly interpretations are restricted to only the fluctuations of the proteins carbons c rmsfs can be readily calculated from any ensemble of protein conformations such as those obtained from md_simulations or monte_carlo mc simulations md and mc simulations are computationally_expensive and hard to parameterize it is therefore convenient that multiple studies have shown that protein_flexibility is well captured by the lowest energy normal_modes even when coarse_grained approaches are used several studies on comparative protein dynamics have taken advantage of this and are based on comparing protein_flexibility as it is described by the proteins normal_modes subspaces spanned by a few important normal_modes or equivalently principal_components of the fluctuation covariance_matrix have been compared using the root_mean inner product rmsip see for instanceor the related rwsip a dynamic fingerprint matrix has been used to compare the backbone dynamics between pdz_domains a dynamic fingerprint matrix is analogous to a distance_matrix for a single protein conformation measuring variability of inter residue distances in an ensemble of conformations actually all the methods described for comparing protein dynamics can be seen as ways of comparing the conformational_ensembles that characterise protein fluctuations each method focuses on some property such as the rmsf profile or the covariance_matrix and uses some measure of similarity or dissimilarity such as the spearman_correlation or the rmsip for comparing this property between different proteins because of the variation in the properties and dis similarity_measures that have been used on different sets of proteins it is difficult to compare the results of these studies yet there are fundamental_differences in the dynamical_properties and dis similarity_measures reported and there is a need for knowing which one s should be used for example systematic studies of the evolutionary_conservation of the fluctuation patterns are based largely on the similarity between rmsf profiles these studies have demonstrated the evolutionary_conservation of backbone fluctuations however rmsf profiles do not utilize the full extent of information available from computational_analysis of protein_flexibility either obtained by simulations or normal_mode in addition rmsf profiles have not been shown to be more conserved than protein_structure rather previous_studies thoroughly discuss the possibility that they are less conserved which we indeed find to be the case this may be a practical issue of rmsf not being the property that most adequately describes the fluctuation patterns or a fundamental one of protein dynamics being less evolutionarily_conserved than protein_structure the purpose of this work is also to address_this to tackle the question of whether the rather low conservation of rmsf profiles is a sign of low conservation of protein dynamics we performed an assessment of different ways of comparing protein fluctuations we consider protein_domains with well defined native structures for which the conformational_ensembles that result from fluctuations are adequately described by multidimensional gaussian_distributions such distributions around an equilibrium are completely characterized by the covariance_matrices the two most frequently used measures of dynamical similarity are the correlation between rmsf profiles and the rmsip between the principal_components of the full covariance_matrix these can be thought of as two limiting cases rmsf considers only the overall magnitude of the fluctuation of each c atom whereas the full covariance_matrix includes information on the anisotropy the directionality of such fluctuations and their correlations between sites to disentangle the different contributions to dynamical similarity we also study the correlation_matrix the isotropic covariance_matrix and the isotropic correlation_matrix these matrices are compared using different measures of dis similarity rmsip and rwsip have previously been used in the literature and although they are well motivated by physical arguments they are not rigorously derived for the comparison of multidimensional gaussian_distributions therefore we also introduce a new measure nd b based on the bhattacharyya distance between probability_density the performances of the properties and the dis similarity_measures are evaluated by investigating their consistency with the scop classification at the superfamily level we performed a comparative_assessment of different scores of dis similarity of protein fluctuation patterns to this end and as described in section we chose four datasets each of them including protein_domains from fold represented by two different scop superfamilies obtained a multiple structural_alignment of all proteins in each dataset from which we extract the conserved structural core produced pairwise superimpositions of all proteins within a dataset calculated properties that characterise the fluctuations of the aligned core of each protein quantified the similarity of such properties with different dis similarity_measures and calculated the consistency of each measure with the scop classification the aligned and superimposed structures of each of the four datasets are shown in stamp captures well representative residues in the conserved core of the structures for almost all superfamilies one exception is the a superfamily that is classified by scop in the all alpha class although it has several sheets in the regions corresponding to unstructured loops in domains of a this affects the arrangement of the adjacent helices causing some counterintuitive matching of helices in a with parts of loops and sheets in a even if a central helix is consistently captured across the fold the core for a covers of the smallest domain in the alignment for the barrel structures c the obtained conserved core is skewed to one side of the characteristic barrel but several spatially adjacent secondary_structure are well captured by the alignment procedure the core for c covers only of the smallest domain the core for b and d covers in excess of of the smallest domain there can certainly be relevant dynamics in the more peripheral_regions of the structures that can possibly be described by the enm approach but for comparing the conservation of dis similarity_measures we regard this very restrictive definition of the conserved core as suited for each pair of proteins in each dataset we calculated several similarity and dissimilarity scores thus structural dissimilarity was quantified using the rmsd of the coordinates of aligned c atoms in the native_structure the properties defined by equations through were used to characterize the pattern of fluctuations all these properties were obtained from the covariance_matrix which was calculated using a coarse_grained enm to quantify the dis similarity between the covariance and correlation matrices of different proteins we used the three measures defined in equations while the similarity of rmsf profiles was quantified using the spearmans correlation_coefficient each dis similarity_score is a combination of a dis similarity measure and a property compared so that the notation measure property will be used where needed e g rmsip c all dis similarity_scores were calculated using only the c atoms of sites that are aligned for all proteins of the same fold
