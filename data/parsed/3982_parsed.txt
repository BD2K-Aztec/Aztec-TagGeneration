repulsive parallel mcmc_algorithm for discovering diverse motifs from large sequence_sets motivation the motif_discovery problem consists of finding recurring patterns of short strings in a set of nucleotide_sequences this classical problem is receiving renewed attention as most early motif_discovery methods lack the ability to handle large data of recent genome_wide chip studies new chip tailored methods focus on reducing computation time and pay little regard to the accuracy of motif_detection unlike such methods our method focuses on increasing the detection_accuracy while maintaining the computation efficiency at an acceptable level the major advantage of our method is that it can mine diverse multiple motifs undetectable by current methods results the repulsive parallel markov_chain rpmcmc algorithm that we propose is a parallel version of the widely used gibbs motif sampler rpmcmc is run on parallel interacting motif samplers a repulsive force is generated when different motifs produced by different sam plers near each other thus different samplers explore different motifs in this way we can detect much more diverse motifs than conventional methods can through application to transcription_factor chip_seq of the encode_project we show that the rpmcmc algorithm can find many reliable cofactor interacting motifs that existing_methods are unable to discover availability_and a c implementation of rpmcmc and discovered cofactor motifs for the encode chip_seq are available fromthe motif_discovery problem has been receiving renewed attention since recent experimental_technologies such as chip_seq posed new challenges the problem is to identify recurring patterns of conserved short strings that appear in a large fraction of nucleotide_sequences a genome_wide chip study produces thousands or more dna_fragments consisting of several hundred base_pairs which cover the binding_sites of a transcription_factor tf by discovering motifs in the given sequences which are associated with known tf_binding in a database e g jaspar
