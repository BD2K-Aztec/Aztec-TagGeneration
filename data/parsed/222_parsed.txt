alloscore a method for predicting allosteric ligand protein interactions allosteric ligands have increasingly gained attention as potential therapeutic_agents due to their higher target selectivity and lower toxicity compared with classic orthosteric ligands despite the great interest in the development of allosteric drugs as a new tactic in drug_discovery the understanding of the ligandprotein interactions underlying allosteric binding represents a key challenge herein we introduce alloscore a web_server that predicts the binding_affinities of allo steric ligandprotein interactions this method exhibits prominent performance in describing allo steric binding and could be useful in allosteric virtual_screening and the structural optimization of allosteric agonists antagonists availability_and the alloscore server and tutorials are freely_available allostery as a major regulatory_mechanism is of fundamental_importance in a wide_variety of biological_phenomena including signal_transduction catalysis and metabolism the functionality of allosteric proteins consists of their ability to orchestrate the activity of orthosteric sites in response to a signal which is quintessentially fomented by effectors binding at distinct often distant functional sites which are also referred to as allosteric_sites compared with orthosteric ligands which target highly_conserved orthosteric sites allosteric ligands can bind to any evident suitable pockets on protein_surfaces thus allosteric ligands are capable of discriminating between closely_related e g receptors protein_kinases this specific mode of action endows allosteric ligands with unparalleled advantages compared with orthosteric ligands including higher specificity fewer side_effects and lower toxicity current drug_discovery under pharmaceutical regimes are increasingly investing in allosteric ligands and structure_based depends mainly on protein_ligand in this regard characterizing allosteric ligandprotein interactions contributes to allosteric drug_discovery despite the distinctive advantages shared by allosteric ligands the development of allosteric drugs remains daunting due to the special binding_modes of allosteric ligandprotein interactions compared with orthosteric ligandprotein interactions recent_studies have pinpointed conspicuous differences between the physicochemical_properties of allosteric and orthosteric ligands allosteric ligands are generally more lipophilic and more rigid compounds than orthosteric ligands which suggests that current universal computational algorithms are incapable of effectively portraying the associations of allosteric ligands with proteins thus there is a pressing need for the development of a novel method to assess the binding_affinities of unique allosteric ligandprotein interactions in this study we introduce alloscore a web_server that predicts the binding_affinities of allosteric ligandprotein interactions for the first time this method elaborately selects a subset of energy_terms that are best suited to delineate the characteristics of allosteric binding alloscore exhibits good performance in dissecting allosteric binding and could be useful in allosteric virtual_screening and structural optimization of allosteric agonists antagonists using six selected energy_terms van_de waals hydrogen_bond and hydrophobic_interactions between allosteric ligands and proteins rotatable bonds in allosteric ligands and the buried volume and polar surfaces of ligands when binding to allosteric_sites and the experimental pk i values of the training_set complexes alloscore was trained as an empirical linear_regression for evaluating allosteric protein ligand binding_affinities the regression resulted in a value of for pearsons_correlation r rp supplementary table s and which is superior to available popular binding prediction_methods for the training_set supplementary the interpretation of the alloscore model is straightforward based on coefficient signs and weights supplementary hydrophobicity the buried ligand volume and rotatable bonds represent the three most important energy term contributions for allosteric interactions in the model supplementary which is in good agreement with previous_analyses of allosteric ligands and sites to provide a more realistic estimate of the actual model performance alloscore was evaluated with an external test_set in comparison with other methods the result show that alloscore clearly outperforms other methods in the prediction of allosteric proteinligand binding_affinities resulting in values of and for rp and spearmans r rs respectively supplementary therefore the specific model of alloscore is expected to improve allosteric drug_design and optimization in real_world scenario applications the alloscore web_server conveniently provides a user_friendly interface to predict the binding_affinities of allosteric ligandprotein interactions furthermore critical energy contributions that contribute to allosteric binding are offered to the best of our knowledge this web_server is the first of its kind and will be of considerable value to scientists interested in allosteric drug_design and screening
