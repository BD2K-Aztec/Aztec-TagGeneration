fast snp a fast matrix pre_processing algo rithm for efficient loopless flux optimization of metabolic models_motivation computation of steady_state flux solutions in large metabolic_models is routinely performed using flux_balance based on a simple lp formulation a minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of the flux solution is the absence of internal loops which are enforced using loopless constraints the resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially harder milp problem which is computationally_expensive for large metabolic_models results we developed a pre_processing algorithm that significantly_reduces the size of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent milp problem the pre_processing employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm fast snp inspired by recent results on sparse null space pursuit snp by finding a reduced feasible loop law matrix subject to known directionalities fast snp considerably improves the computational_efficiency in several metabolic_models running different loopless optimization_problems furthermore analysis of the topology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key directional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible loops in the underlying model overall fast snp is an effective and simple_algorithm for efficient formulation of loop law constraints making loopless flux optimization feasible and numerically tractable at large_scale availability source_code for matlab including examples are freely_available for download atconstrained based_methods are the most popular_methods for exploring the capabilities of genome_scale gems gems have been reconstructed for many model_organisms enabling comprehensive study of the genotypephenotype relationship cellular_physiology metabolic_capabilities among others more recently these reconstructions have included larger and more complex_networks describing different cellular_interactions microbial_communities and multi tissue organisms the increased complexity of current metabolic_models demands efficient constrained based_methods to compute possible network states especially thermodynamically_feasible ones computation of thermodynamically_feasible states is computationally hard severely limiting its application to large_scale models efficient computational_methods are thus needed to interrogate the consequences of thermodynamic feasibility on these models the computational performance of our strategy was compared to the traditional approach in different metabolic_models covering a range of sizes the models considered include the toy model shown in an e coli core model and six gems namely iaf ijn iyl stm ijo and yeast we have assumed growth in minimal_medium and growth_rate maximization as the objective_function for each model in the case of the toy model the upper_bound of b was set to and reaction b was maximized see the characteristics of each model after removal of blocked reactions are shown in the models used in this study can be downloaded from the bigg models database at http bigg ucsd edu computation of loopless steady_state flux solutions is an np_hard milp problem recent_approaches such as fasttfva and cyclefreeflux have exploited particular features of the problem and used lp formulations following alternative_approaches to solve different loopless flux optimization_problems although these approaches enabled fast computation of feasible fluxes acceleration up to two orders_of they rely on post_processing methods for blocking unfeasible cycles after steady_state flux computation in the current study we developed a preprocessing strategy where the conventional milp problem is reformulated using a minimal set of loop law constraints enabling efficient computation of loopless flux solutions as well as topological_analysis of infeasible cycles in large metabolic_models all modern milp solvers use preprocessing to recast milp formulations into easier to solve yet equivalent representations it is often possible to develop superior preprocessing strategies using insights into the specific milp problem we have developed a fast preprocessing algorithm fast snp which finds a minimal set of feasible loop laws taking_into the directionalities of the model once the reduced loop law matrix is found a smaller loopless milp problem can be formulated and solved efficiently speedups up to fold were achieved with preprocessing across diverse types of loopless flux optimization_problems tables figs although the computational improvement of fast snp is more modest than previous_approaches supplementary tables s s it is the only strategy capable of efficiently solving loopless related problems i e ll fba ll fva ld and lr using a single optimization_problem based on suitable lp milp or miqp formulations subject to the loopless constraints eq importantly such constraints have recently been algebraically proven to always yield thermodynamically_feasible flux solutions noor et_al finally we highlight additional and distinctive_features of fast snp for the analysis of metabolic_models as shown in the previous section this approach_enables a priori assessment of model_complexity in the loop law sense as it explicitly computes a minimal basis describing all the potentially infeasible cycles in the studied model formally these loop laws represent elementary_flux that do not exchange mass with the surroundings these internal cycles have previously been studied in the context of oriented matroid theory and more recently infeasible cycles have been enumerated in gems using sampling approaches however efficient assessment of the impact of directionality constraints as well as topological_analysis of these loop laws for their potential removal has been lacking in the literature fast snp aids comprehensive assessment unravelling simple strategies for removing infeasible loops based on thermodynamic or practical_considerations see additionally we note that the proposed matrix sparsification algorithm in fast snp can also be employed for other useful analyses for example this algorithm can readily be modified to explore alternative solutions by incorporating suitable additional constraints e g vi z using an appropriate objective e g l norm minimization the resulting greedy_algorithm would generate a set of linearly independent solutions or pathways i e a basis consistent with the previous constraints by solving only lp problems this avoids the need of computing expensive milp formulations in conclusion fast snp complements existing_methods in the constrained based modelling toolbox for exploration and topological_analysis of infeasible cycles and metabolic_pathways
