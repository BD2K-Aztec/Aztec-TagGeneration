data_and ms pip a tool for ms_ms peak_intensity prediction motivation tandem_mass provides the means to match mass_spectrometry signal observations with the chemical_entities that generated them the technology produces signal spectra that contain information about the chemical dissociation pattern of a peptide that was forced to fragment using methods like collision induced dissoci ation the ability to predict these ms signals and to understand this fragmentation process is important for sensitive high_throughput research results we present a new tool called ms pip for predicting the intensity of the most important fragment_ion signal peaks from a peptide_sequence ms pip pre processes a large dataset with confident pep tide to spectrum matches to facilitate data_driven model induction using a random_forest regression learning algorithm the intensity predictions of ms pip were evaluated on several independent evaluation sets and found to correlate significantly better with the observed fragment_ion intensities as compared with the current state of the art peptideart tool availability ms pip code is available for both training and predicting atmass spectrometry ms allows for high_throughput protein_content measurements in samples by identifying and quantifying proteins in the form of digested peptide_sequences tandem_mass ms provides the means to match ms signal observations with the chemical_entities that generated them ms produces signal spectra that contain information about the chemical dissociation pattern of a peptide that was forced to fragment using methods like collision_induced cid the signal peaks in an ms spectrum indicate the presence of a peptide fragment_ion with a specific mass the intensity of a signal peak is dependent on a number of factors the abundance of the peptide in the sample the efficiency of the cleavage that generated the fragment the proteotypicity of the fragment_ion and other factors related to the peptide and the machine that generated the ms spectrum popular peptide_identification tools such as mascot omssa and x tandem assume that ms peaks for the most important fragment_ions have a high_intensity and that fragment_ions of different types have the same high_intensity without an accurate model of the relationship between the amino_acid of the peptide and the peak_intensities in the corresponding ms spectrum these ad_hoc approaches fail to match fragment_ions for which low_intensity peaks are expected to be observed it has been shown that incorporating knowledge about this relationship between peak_intensity and amino_acid significantly_improves peptide_identification rates despite the apparent need for accurate ms signal peak_intensity predictions from amino_acid only few attempts have been published a first approach the massanalyzer tool was a deductive physicochemical model of peptide fragmentation all parameters in the model were optimized on a dataset containing ms spectra with confident peptide match psm the authors showed that massanalyzer models ms peak_intensities more accurately as compared with ad_hoc methods at the same time an inductive bayesian decision_tree approach was introduced this research showed that a decision_tree model representation is highly suitable for learning the diverse set of rules that govern peptide fragmentation their data_driven approach was able to visualize from psms many of the known fragmentation rules and discovered several new ones however their approach does not model the peak_intensities directly rather it models the probability of observing a certain fragment_ion intensity a similar study based on bayesian neural_networks was presented inwith a dataset of psms another inductive approach_called peptideart is based on feed_forward neural_network representations it implements an ensemble of neural_networks that each models the most important fragment_ion peak_intensities in one multioutput feed_forward neural_network this method models the normalized peak_intensities directly the features used as input to the neural_network are similar to ones suggested by elias et_al the authors reported a systematic_assessment of the accuracy of the current peptide ms_ms spectrum predictors for the most commonly used collision_induced instruments they found that peptideart achieves generally higher accuracy on a wide_range of proteomic_datasets when trained on a dataset of psms we show here that ms signal peak_intensity prediction can be significantly_improved by exploiting the vast amount of psm data that have been collected over the recent_years we constructed a dataset of merged psms and present an to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for
