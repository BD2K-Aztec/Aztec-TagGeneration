data_and antigenmap d an online antigenic cartography resource antigenic cartography is a useful technique to visualize and minimize errors in immunological data by projecting antigens to d or d cartography however a d cartography may not be sufficient to capture the antigenic relationship from high_dimensional immunological data antigenmap d presents an online interactive and robust d antigenic cartography construction and visualization resource antigenmap d can be applied to identify antigenic variants and vaccine_strain candidates for pathogens with rapid antigenic variations such as influenza a virus availability and implementationantigenic variation is a common strategy for an infectious pathogen to evade its host immunological_response the infectious pathogen can alter its surface protein s so that it will not be recognized by specific host antibody as a result the pathogen can reinfect the same host antigenic_variation can be either antigenic_drift from accumulating mutations or antigenic shift from exchanging surface proteins from two different strains for influenza a virus antigenic_drift leads to seasonal epidemics and antigenic shift to pandemics rapid detection of antigenic variant events and accurate quantification of antigenic variant extent are essential for selection of an effective vaccine_strain and development of a prompt vaccination program this has been especially important for influenza a virus as vaccination is the primary option for reducing the impacts of influenza the antigenic characterization in influenza_virus are performed using immunological assays such as hemagglutinin inhibition microneutralization and enzyme labeled immunosorbent assays however analyses of these immunological data are not trivial for the following reasons i these assays are very crude and much noise is present in these datasets ii it is not uncommon that there are empty entries in the resulting immunological tables and iii the data distribution in these datasets is unique and unobserved values are not distributed randomly in the tables especially for datasets that contain viruses with large isolation time intervals antigenic cartography is an analog of geographic cartography in presenting the antigens as d or d maps antigenic cartography has been shown to effectively detect influenza antigenic_drift events to whom correspondence should be addressed therefore cartography is useful in antigenic characterization and vaccine_strain selection antigenic cartography has become a standard tool in influenza surveillance of the world_health influenza reference laboratories because d cartography may not be sufficient to capture the antigenic relationship from the high_dimensional immunological data we developed an antigenic cartography tool antigenmap d to construct d antigenic cartography
