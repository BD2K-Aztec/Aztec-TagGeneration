identification of short terminal motifs enriched by antibodies using peptide_mass motivation mass_spectrometry based protein_profiling has become a key_technology in biomedical_research and biomarker_discovery sample_preparation strategies that reduce the complexity of tryptic_digests by immunoaffinity substantially_increase throughput and sensitivity in proteomic mass_spectrometry the scarce availability of peptide specific capture antibodies limits these approaches recently antibodies_directed short terminal motifs were found to enrich subsets of peptides with identical terminal sequences this approach holds the promise of a significant gain in efficiency txp triple x proteomics and context independent motif specific global proteome survey binders are variants of this concept principally the binding_motifs of such antibodies have to be elucidated after generating these antibodies this entails a substantial effort in the lab as it requires synthetic peptide_libraries and numerous mass_spectrometry experiments results we present an algorithm for predicting the antibody binding_motif in a mass_spectrum obtained from a tryptic_digest of a common cell_line after immunoprecipitation the epitope_prediction based on peptide_mass reveals the most enriched terminal epitopes the tool provides a p value for each potential epitope estimated by sampling random spectra from a peptide database the second algorithm combines the predicted sequences to more complex binding_motifs a comparison with library screenings shows that the predictions made by the novel methods are reliable and reproducible indicators of the binding_properties of an antibody availability mass_spectrum data predictions sampling tables consensus peptide databases and the applied protocols are available as supplementary_material txp terminus enrichment_analysis tea and materics mass_spectrometric of terminal epitope enrichment in complex samples are available as web_services atimmunoaffinity enrichment combined with mass_spectrometry increases sample_throughput and sensitivity in proteomic research however the generation and detailed characterization of appropriate capture reagents act as a bottleneck and involve substantial lab resources this has led various groups to develop techniques enabling the enrichment of multiple_targets using generic binders showed that an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine can enrich tyrosin phosphorylated proteins the triple x proteomics txp technique and the global proteome survey gps methodology have extended this concept and are rational approaches aimed to achieving motif specific peptide enrichment in the txp approach antibodies bind to short_linear epitopes present in multiple peptides of complex samples after protein fragmentation by trypsin see in silico selection of antigens reduces to minimum the set of txp antibodies required to cover a pre defined protein target list search_space restriction gained from the revealed binding epitope could improve protein identification from ms and msms data however the enrichment of proteotypic peptides with txp antibodies leads to new challenges in the analysis of mass_spectrometric datasets results from immunoaffinity experiments using txp antibodies revealed the enrichment of peptides containing the targeted epitope some identified peptides also matched sequence_variants in that study it came clear that the terms specific and unspecific must be considered inappropriate in charcterizing these binders specificity generally refers to binding of one protein or peptide to an antibody other binding_events are deemed to be unspecific offtarget or cross_reactive in the txp strategy the binding of the antibody towards multiple peptides is inherent therefore novel concepts for epitope identification are needed which would enable properties of the antibody binding_domain to be distinguished from interactions_occurring elsewhere there are three main reasons why unexpected peptides can be detected in the immunoprecipitates first this could be due to epitope variations in the polyclonal_antibody second off target binding can occur due to sequence_similarity and unlike the immunized antigen this involves the apparent epitope or binding_motif of the antibody mixture third carry over peptides may remain detectable in the sample solely due to their persisting massive presence despite multiple washing steps and meticulous to whom correspondence should be addressed care on the part of the lab operator while carry over is merely noise it is worth quantifying the variation caused by polyclonality and the apparent epitope using recombinant motif specific_antibodies gps contextindependent motif specific binders which also enrich classes of peptides observed that these binders were markedly promiscuous they compared sequence_data obtained from tandem_mass lc esi ltq_orbitrap with structural_information their findings showed that the antibodies not only captured peptides containing the targeted epitope but also variations of it thus the enriched peptides revealed binding_motifs different amino_acid are known to interact with the antibody binding_site at individual positions however such in depth characterizations of epitope motifs analysis call for extensive experiments a common approach to elucidate a detailed linear epitope is to conduct an interaction analysis between an antibody and peptide_libraries these libraries comprise synthetic_peptides which have at least one modified position for instance if an antibody is raised against the c terminal sequence lgyr the peptide library for an epitope would consist of xgyr lxyr lgxr and lgyx peptides with the x representing all amino_acids instead of adding a single amino_acid at step n all are added in equal_amounts this leads to a library of different peptides for a four amino_acid epitope the synthesis and subsequent measurement of these peptides are significant cost drivers in this phase of antibody development moreover the quality_control for such a binder would be more expensive than its generation our study aimed at devising a simpler cost_effective method entailing less effort than that required in the labour_intensive peptide library approach we present an algorithm for calculating the detailed epitope using ms data from an immunoaffinity ms experiment peptide_mass is a well established method in proteomics on which we based the txp tea terminal sequence enrichment_analysis algorithm the original technique involves identifying an isolated and subsequently digested protein by the characteristic pattern in the peptide mass_spectrum txp tea performs searches for patterns related to sets of peptides sharing a specific terminal amino_acid instead of spectral_patterns associated with a specific protein the method compares the masses observed in the measurement with a theoretical spectrum from a database the materics algorithm we describe here merges the results of txp tea to the antibody binding_motif the predictions by materics closely reproduced the binding_motifs identified by the positional peptide library experiments indifferent cell_lines for the three antibodies however the comparison also revealed some discrepancies between the control experiment and the materics results the motif for the anti amtr antibody found by the library experiment is more complex than the motifs predicted by materics this could be a consequence of complexity restrictions by the algorithm the complexity scoring_function penalizes an additional amino_acid at the first position tr instead of a tr in terms of the degree of variability at the second position the motif exceeds the complexity bound and is therefore not considered the binding_property of the anti eier antibody was the most difficult to predict materics did not detect a significant_enrichment in the pre selection_step for most spectra instead of predicting a wrong motif it did not make any prediction at all and instead reported that no significant_enrichment was detectable if the input_data passed the pre selection_step the predicted motifs were observable close to the results of the peptide_libraries on only one occasion did materics see_supplementary anti amtr a biological replicate technical replicate make a wrong prediction a comparison to the other technical_replicates of the same immunoprecipitation ruled_out this result as shown in experiments for the anti eier antibody resulted in bad quality spectra for the hek cell_lysate whereas immunoprecitipations from hela and a digests enabled motif prediction in many technical_replicates on the whole the hela digest appears to be the most stable standard sample for motif prediction pertaining to the three observed binders although the results are obviously dependent on the observed epitope it must be noted that using hela cell_lysate does not always produce the best prediction results some terminal epitopes are more abundant in some cell_lines than others reports concluded that each cell_line leads to the best mcc score for a given binder results marked bold in there was adequate reproducibility within different immunoprecipitates and the technical_replicates at least for the stronger binders the results obtained from different cell_lines show a reasonable level of agreement apart from the minor variation described this novel approach appears to work independently of the chosen line this strengthens flexibility as cell_lines in stock at the lab can be used to perform materics experiments benchmark experiments using artificial data showed that materics can make reliable predictions even if only a minor fraction of the signals found in a peak list is related to the enriched epitope see_supplementary our experimental study shows that txp tea and materics are able to identify terminal binding_motifs in immunoaffinity ms experiments the motifs obtained closely_resemble patterns found by using a peptide library approach the described methods for motif elucidation lead to a substantial reduction in costs in addition the novel method enables the weighting of isobaric variations in the binding_motifs these techniques might well lead to improved peptide_identification algorithms which exploit the existing data on potentially enriched sequences during the search_process our findings are relevant to other fields of biomedical_research such as in the identification of the binding_properties of mhc_molecules future versions of the algorithms will include options to identify internal epitopes and binding_motifs as well as new ways to deal with post_translational
