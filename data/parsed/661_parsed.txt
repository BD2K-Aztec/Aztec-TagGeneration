structural_bioinformatics basin hopping graph a computational framework to characterize rna_folding landscapes motivation rna_folding is a complicated kinetic process the minimum_free provides only a static view of the most stable conformational_state of the system it is insufficient to give detailed insights into the dynamic_behavior of rnas a sufficiently sophisticated analysis of the folding free_energy however can provide the relevant_information results we introduce the basin hopping graph bhg as a novel coarse_grained model of folding landscapes each vertex of the bhg is a local minimum which represents the corresponding basin in the landscape its edges connect basins when the direct transitions between them are energetically_favorable edge_weights endcode the corresponding saddle heights and thus measure the difficulties of these favorable transitions bhgs can be approximated accurately and efficiently for rna_molecules well beyond the length range accessible to enumerative algorithms availability_and the algorithms described here are implemented in c as standalone programs its source_code and supplemental material can be freely downloaded from http www tbi much of rnas functional complexity is rooted not only in the details of its intricate d structure but also in its ability to adaptively acquire distinct conformations on its own or in response to specific cellular_signals including the recognition of proteins nucleic_acids metal_ions metabolites vitamins changes in temperature and even rna biosynthesis itself these conformational_transitions are spatially_and tuned to achieve a variety of functions the most obvious examples are riboswitches and rna thermometers the intricate structures of rnas are typically modeled to a reasonable approximation in terms of secondary_structures this is because the thermal melting data thermodynamic free energy_model of secondary_structures have been interpreted by a nearest_neighbor model and form the basis for widely used structure prediction_algorithms that predict secondary_structure with reasonable accuracy in particular the partition_function of the boltzmann ensemble of secondary_structures for a given rna_sequence can be computed in cubic time using a well known dynamic_programming thus a stochastic backtracking algorithm can be used to produce representative structures and to generate boltzmann weighted samples to assess complex structural_features like base_pair probabilities the inclusion of pseudoknots and other tertiary contacts into rna_structure remains time consuming and technically_challenging in its most general form the problem is np complete furthermore free_energy models for pseudoknots are based on sparse experimental_data and hence are crude at best nevertheless secondary_structures with pseudoknots can be important for the dynamics of folding owing to the journals length restrictions we focus on the boltzmann ensemble of secondary_structures in the main text and relegate the extension to structures with pseudoknots to supplementary_material part h for brevity we will speak of the energy instead of free_energy of a secondary_structure the kinetic process of rna_folding can be described as a dynamic process in the molecules energy_landscape the energy_landscape is a particular network whose vertices represent all the possible structures and whose edges connect structures that can be interconverted by elementary rearrangements typically the opening or closing of individual base_pairs for each structure as a vertex in the landscape its energy is evaluated based on the thermodynamic energy_model for characterizing its dynamical state to whom correspondence should be addressed thus the transition_rates between adjacent secondary_structures can be estimated by the metropolis rule in this setting the rna folding_process is viewed as a markov_chain and the transition_rates between two adjacent structures in the landscape are related with their energy differences typically different structural transitions are of different rates as observed by which is consistent with the thermodynamic picture the equilibrium distribution of this markov_process coincides with the boltzmann_distribution of the secondary_structures the number of different secondary_structures however makes it impossible to enumerate the entire landscape except for short_sequences so that one has to resort to coarse_grained approximations the barrier tree of the landscape encodes the local_minima and their connecting energy_barriers the idea to elucidate the basin structure of a landscape by means of a barrier tree has been developed independently in different contexts including potential_energy for protein_folding spin glasses and molecular clusters the exact computation of barrier trees in general requires the enumeration of the landscape for rna_secondary a modification of the backtracking step in the dynamic_programming folding algorithm can be used to enumerate only the lowest lying fraction of the landscapes however even within this favorable setting barrier trees are accessible only for rna_molecules with up to nt an alternative to the exact construction of barrier trees is the use of heuristic approaches for example adopted computational_techniques for motion planning in robotics to obtain an approximated representation of the rna_folding landscape a different type of coarse_graining can be obtained by conditioning the folding algorithms on the distances from two reference_points resulting in a kind of d projection of the landscape heuristic methods are also used to locally navigate the optimal folding path between two given structures for instance findpath is a fast algorithm that produces excellent_quality direct pathways based on the morganhiggs algorithm furthermore rnatabupath and its related web_server rnapathfinder used a tabu semi greedy heuristic to determine nearly optimal folding pathways between two given secondary_structures developed a heuristic_algorithm pathfinder based on their d projection of the landscape the difficult part in computing coarse_graining models such as barrier trees is to determine the saddle points the local_minima on the other hand can be obtained efficiently by means of modified dynamic_programming this was demonstrated first bywith respect to the nussinovjacobson energy_model and later extended to the turner energy_model by lorenz and clote their extension of mccaskills algorithm can be used to generate boltzmann weighted samples of local_minima empirically they find that the number of local_optima is roughly the square_root of the number of secondary_structures i e it grows exponentially with chain_length exact combinatorial results have been derived by fusy and clote for the base_stacking energy_model which is a variant of the nussinov model where each stacked base_pair contributes toward the energy of the structure hence for large rnas one still has to resort to sampling boltzmann weighted samples are not necessarily the most efficient way to explore the basin structure of the landscape because they are strongly biased toward usually small fraction of low_energy structures sahoo and albrecht thus considered a stochastic sampling method to obtain local_minima within a prescribed distance of a reference structure random structures are iteratively improved by gradient down hill walks until local_minima are reached such samples can be used to estimate the total number of local_minima following the arguments of garnier and kallel the remainder of this contribution is organized as follows in sections and we first introduce the basic_concepts and existing results in the field of rna_folding landscapes in section we introduce the basin hopping graph bhg as a new coarse_graining model of the energy_landscape and then describe algorithms for its construction in section we present and discuss our experimental_results section summarizes the article and suggests directions for future work
