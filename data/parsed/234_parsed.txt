structural_bioinformatics a machine_learning approach to predicting protein ligand binding_affinity with applications to molecular_docking motivation accurately predicting the binding_affinities of large sets of diverse proteinligand complexes is an extremely challenging_task the scoring_functions that attempt such computational_prediction are essential for analysing the outputs of molecular_docking which in turn is an important technique for drug_discovery chemical_biology and structural_biology each scoring_function assumes a predetermined theory inspired functional_form for the relationship between the variables that characterize the complex which also include parameters fitted to experimental or simulation_data and its predicted binding_affinity the inherent problem of this rigid approach is that it leads to poor predictivity for those complexes that do not conform to the modelling assumptions moreover resampling strategies such as cross_validation or bootstrapping are still not systematically used to guard against the overfitting of calibration data in parameter_estimation for scoring_functions results we propose a novel scoring_function rf score that circumvents the need for problematic modelling assumptions via non parametric machine_learning in particular random_forest was used to implicitly capture binding effects that are hard to model explicitly rf score is compared with the state of the art on the demanding pdbbind benchmark results show that rf score is a very competitive scoring_function importantly rf scores performance was shown to improve dramatically with training_set size and hence the future availability of more high_quality structural and interaction data is expected to lead to improved versions of rf score molecular_docking is a computational technique that aims to predict whether and how a particular small_molecule will stably bind to a target protein it is an important component of many drug_discovery projects when the structure of the protein is available although it is primarily used as a virtual screening_tool and subsequently for lead_optimization purposes there are also applications in target_identification beyond drug_discovery these bioactive_molecules can be used as chemical probes to study the biochemical role of a particular target furthermore this technique can also be applied to a range of structural_bioinformatics problems such as protein_function molecular_docking has two stages docking molecules into the targets binding_site pose identification and predicting how strongly the docked conformation binds to the target scoring whereas there are many relatively robust and accurate algorithms for pose identification the imperfections of current scoring_functions continue to be a major_limiting for the reliability of docking indeed accurately predicting the binding_affinities of large sets of diverse proteinligand complexes remains one of the most important and difficult unsolved_problems in computational biomolecular science scoring_functions are typically classified into three groups force_field knowledge based and empirical force_field scoring_functions parameterize the potential energy of a complex as a sum of energy_terms arising from bonded and non bonded interactions the functional_form of each of these terms is characteristic of the particular force_field which in turn contains a number of parameters that are estimated from experimental_data and computer simulations these force_fields were designed to model intermolecular potential energies and thus do not account for entropy knowledge based scoring_functions use the d co ordinates of a large set of proteinligand complexes as a knowledge_base in this way a putative proteinligand complex can be assessed on the basis of how similar its features are to those in the knowledge_base the features used are often the distributions of atomatom distances between protein and ligand in the complex features commonly observed in the knowledge_base score favourably whereas less frequently observed features score unfavourably when these contributions are summed over all pairs of atoms in the complex the resulting score is converted into a pseudo energy function typically through a reverse boltzmann procedure in order to provide an estimate of the binding_affinity e g some knowledgebased scoring_functions now include parameters that are fitted to experimental binding_affinities e g or introduce information_theory driven improvements as well as
