plncdb plant long_non database plant long_non database plncdb attempts to provide the following functions related to long_non lncrnas i genomic_information for a large number of lncrnas collected from various resources ii an online genome_browser for plant lncrnas based on a platform similar to that of the ucsc_genome iii integration of transcriptome datasets derived from various samples including different tissues developmental_stages mutants and stress treatments and iv a list of epigenetic_modification datasets and small_rna datasets currently our plncdb provides a comprehensive genomic view of arabidopsis lncrnas for the plant research_community this database will be regularly updated with new plant_genome when available so as to greatly_facilitate future_investigations on plant lncrnas availability plncdb is freely_accessible at http chualab rockefeller edu gbrowse homepage html and all results can be downloaded for free at the website non_coding ncrnas are a family of rnas that do not encode_proteins on the basis of their length and genomic_locations ncrnas can be further classified as i small ncrnas including mirnas and small_interfering sirnas ii natural antisense_transcripts nats iii long intronic non_coding incrnas and iv long intergenic non_coding lincrnas rnas in the last three categories are at least nt or longer and they are referred to as long_non lncrnas genomes of human mouse and fly have been shown to encode lncrnas that play_important in cell_differentiation immune_response imprinting tumor genesis and other important biological_processes besides genetic_mutations of human lncrnas have been shown to be associated with diseases and pathophysiological_conditions for plants genome_wide search for ncrnas has been previously_conducted in arabidopsis_thaliana medicago_truncatula zea_mays and tritucum aestivum the recent genome_wide study based on around arabidopsis tilling array datasets and rna_sequencing rna_seq has identified thousands of lncrnas in arabidopsis these lncrnas show tissue_specific expression and a large number of them are responsive to abiotic_stresses however the function of these lncrnas remains_largely genomic_loci of many lncrnas are associated with histone_modifications and dna methylations suggesting an epigenetic_regulation of these loci in addition biogenesis of a subgroup of lncrnas is co regulated by cbp cbp and serrate some sense and antisense double_stranded rnas involving lncrna partners are processed by the rna_interference machinery into sirnas although thousands of lncrnas have been identified in arabidopsis and other plants and their expression has been profiled on a genome_wide basis these rnas have not been fully recorded and annotated in public_databases as far as we know there are only seven databases and one server related to currently available lncrnas tair plantnatsdb lncrnadb nred ncrnaimprint noncode and ncfans among them only plantnatsdb is designed to query about nats pairs however this database just lists all nats pair and does not provide a genome view the other six databases are not specifically_designed for plant lncrnas therefore a database that contains comprehensive_information related to lncrnas such as genomic_information expression_profiles sirna information and associated epigenetic markers is warranted here we attempt to develop an online database for plant lncrnas named plncdb plant long_non database with the aim to provide comprehensive_information for plant lncrnas compares information content between our database and those of others
