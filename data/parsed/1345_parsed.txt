genome_analysis detecting differential peaks in chip_seq signals with odin motivation detection of changes in deoxyribonucleic_acid dna_protein from chip_seq is a crucial step in unraveling the regulatory_networks behind biological_processes the simplest variation of this problem is the differential peak_calling dpc problem here one has to find genomic_regions with chip_seq signal changes between two cellular conditions in the interaction of a protein with dna the great majority of peak_calling methods can only analyze one chip_seq signal at a time and are unable to perform dpc recently a few approaches based on the combination of these peak callers with statistical_tests for detecting differential digital expression have been proposed however these methods_fail to detect detailed changes of proteindna_interactions results we propose an one stage differential peak caller odin an hidden_markov based_approach to detect and analyze differential peaks dps in pairs of chip_seq odin performs genomic signal_processing peak_calling and p value calculation in an integrated framework we also propose an evaluation methodology to compare odin with competing_methods the evaluation method is based on the association of dps with expression changes in the same cellular conditions our empirical study based on several chip_seq from transcription_factors histone_modifications and simulated_data shows that odin outperforms considered competing_methods in most scenarios availability_and http costalab org wp odin transcriptional_regulation is dictated by a set of deoxyribonucleic_acid dna interacting_proteins such as histones which define the chromatin_structure and transcription_factors tfs these proteins are responsible for recruitment of ribonucleic_acid rna_polymerase and start of transcription detection of the changes in dnaprotein interactions under distinct_cellular conditions is a crucial step in unraveling the regulatory_networks behind biological_processes such as cell_differentiation the activation of signaling_pathways and the onset of diseases chromatin_immunoprecipitation followed by dna_sequencing chip_seq allows to study the interactions of proteins with dna regions in a genome_wide computational_methods identify dnaprotein interaction sites from chip_seq also called peak_detection by detecting regions with a higher number of reads than expected by chance using sophisticated statistical_models with a few exceptions widely used peak_calling methods are based on the analysis of individual chip_seq signals here we are interested in comparing chip_seq from distinct experiments we want to detect changes which we call differential peaks dps in protein_dna of a single protein in a pair of cellular conditions we will refer to this signal_detection challenge as differential peak_calling dpc seefor examples of putative dps after the induction of tlr_signaling initially dpc was performed by peak_calling on individual chip_seq signals peaks detected in only one of the conditions were then defined as cell specific peaks such methods are not able to detect cases where peaks were presented and called in both cell_types but exhibit a significant increase decrease of the dnaprotein signal in one of the cells in the example of based on peaks from peakseq only dp would be detected as cell specific moreover most of single signal peak callers spcs provide no functionality to normalize several chip_seq and are likely to show bias in experiments with higher number of reads a more sophisticated strategy to detect dps is the combination of peaks from spcs with statistical_tools these twostage differential peak callers dpc first combine peaks that are called on individual chip_seq conditions using spcs next they count the number of reads for each candidate peak perform signal normalization and apply statistical_tests assuming a differential count model like edger or deseq therefore they can detect to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com candidate peaks where the number of read_counts is significantly_higher lower in one of the chip_seq conditions while this approach allows the detection of significant changes in chipseq within candidate peaks it is highly dependent on the initial peak_calling step as well as the strategy used to create the set of candidate peaks for example histone_modifications associated to active regulatory_regions occur in domains spanning several hundreds of base_pairs and may have intricate patterns of gain loss of chip_seq signals within the same domain spcs tend to call the domains as single peaks and consequently the differential analysis is only able to evaluate the differential counts of the complete called peaks a more appropriate framework to analyze dps is the use of segmentation_methods like hidden_markov hmms which are able to analyze pairs of chip_seq signals and perform dpc in a single step
