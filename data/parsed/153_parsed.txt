a framework for oligonucleotide_microarray preprocessing motivation the availability of flexible open_source for the analysis of gene_expression raw level data has greatly_facilitated the development of widely used preprocessing methods for these technologies however the expansion of microarray applications has exposed the limitation of existing_tools results we developed the oligo package to provide a more general solution that supports a wide_range the package is based on the bioconductor principles of transparency reproducibility and efficiency of development it extends the existing_tools and leverages existing code for visualization accessing data and widely used preprocessing routines the oligo package implements a unified paradigm for preprocessing data and interfaces with other bioconductor tools for downstream_analysis our infrastructure is general and can be used by other bioconductor_packages availability the oligo package is freely_available through bioconductor http www bioconductor org contact open_source significantly simplified the development and distribution of preprocessing methods for gene_expression the bioconductor_project is one hub of tools for the analysis of genomic_data and distributes among others the affy package the most used tool for analysis of affymetrix gene_expression arrays in addition to affymetrix other manufacturers e g illumina nimblegen and agilent also commercialize microarray solutions increasing the number of applications of the technology with different microarray applications the investigator can analyze genomic_data from different perspectives use tiling arrays to identify at high_resolution regions of dna and histone_modifications the international hapmapuses genome_wide snp and copy_number variant cnv arrays to obtain i genotype_calls later used in association studies and ii extract copy_number estimates to assess chromosomal_aberrations use exon arrays to analyze alternative_splicing as new applications to whom correspondence should be addressed became available and designs by other manufacturers became more popular see_supplementary users developed suboptimal solutions to allow the use of the existing code in affy on these new arrays this strategy did not succeed because the new designs did not share the structure used by the affymetrix gene_expression arrays such as density and array annotation standards based on the bioconductor principles of transparency reproducibility and efficiency of development we developed the oligo package its infrastructure presented in section is general and can be used by other bioconductor_packages the package natively supports feature level data for different applications and manufacturers as shown in section it implements a unified_framework for preprocessing microarray_data and interfaces with other bioconductor tools for downstream_analysis the integration of data management visualization and analysis is essential in current research weaknesses in existing_tools are more evident today that more applications and array manufacturers are available to overcome the deficiencies introduced by suboptimal solutions and improve the delivery of original strategies we developed the oligo package it uses the commonalities of oligonucleotide_microarray designs and applications to provide an open_source solution that centralizes the preprocessing tasks under a solid framework that can be reused by other developers improving the consistency between packages within the bioconductor_project the structure used by oligo is flexible and its objects inherit the properties of biobase objects using the standards set by the bioconductor_project because it is implemented in r every feature of this statistical_software is at the researchers disposal this simplifies the interface with many other packages from both projects r and bioconductor widening the options during analysis classes used by its companion the pdinfobuilder package are based on a broader class offering inheritability properties and transparency to the user who benefits from the fact that annotation packages use sql databases to minimize their memory_footprint the oligo and affy packages are closely_related the former uses the knowledge_acquired by the latter to provide solutions for limitations found so_far the main improvements offered by oligo are i support to multiple vendors and platforms ii efficient storage and access schemes for annotation of current high_throughput arrays whose metadata have become significantly large and iii native support to manufacturer files using oligo one can handle data from different applications expression tiling snp cnv exon and gene of two manufacturers affymetrix and nimblegen using their native file schemes avoiding potential problems introduced by conversion tools we demonstrated how one can use our package to preprocess and visualize oligonucleotide microarray_data we show how the package can serve as an interface between the data_files and methodologies implemented by other bioconductor_packages these features define a unified_framework that allows the efficient use of the environment set by both r and bioconductor projects and increase the productivity of novel methods and algorithms
