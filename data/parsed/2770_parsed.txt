macoed a multi objective ant colony optimization_algorithm for snp epistasis detection in genome_wide the existing_methods for genetic_interaction detection in genome_wide are designed from different paradigms and their performances vary_considerably for different disease_models one important_reason for this variability is that their construction is based on a single correlation model between snps and disease due to potential model preference and disease complexity a single objective method will therefore not work well in general resulting in low power and a high false_positive method in this work we present a multi objective heuristic optimization methodology named macoed for detecting genetic_interactions in macoed we combine both logistical_regression and bayesian_network methods which are from opposing schools of statistics the combination of these two evaluation objectives proved to be complementary resulting in higher power with a lower false_positive than observed for optimizing either objective independently to solve the space and time complexity for high_dimension problems a memory based multi objective ant colony optimization_algorithm is designed in macoed that is able to retain non dominated solutions found in past iterations results we compared macoed with other recent algorithms using both simulated_and sets the experimental_results demonstrate that our method outperforms others in both detection_power and computational feasibility for large_datasets with the development of genome_wide high_density snp_genotyping technology genome_wide gwas that aim to explore associations between snps and disease in a population play_an in identifying the causes of disease although great success has been achieved in identifying single locus snps that are responsible for disease such as mendelian_diseases searching for susceptible loci for complex_diseases such as diabetes hypertension and some psychiatric_disorders has proven to be more problematic one reason for this is that many diseases are influenced by multi_locus snps that interact with each other in a process known as epistasis and thereby complicating matters epistasis plays_an in human complex disease and methods designed v c the author published_by all_rights for permissions please_e journals permissions_oup com for single locus detection do not work for epistasis detection due to these interactions that cannot be modeled recently a number of multi_locus approaches have been proposed to detect epistasis these approaches can generally be classified into three categories i exhaustive_search ii stochastic_search and iii machine_learning exhaustive_search enumerates all possible single locus and multilocus snp combinations to identify the causative snp or snps a representative method of exhaustive_search is the multifactordimensionality reduction algorithm in which multi_locus genotypes are partitioned into two groups termed high_risk and low_risk thereby reducing the original high_dimensional genotype prediction_problem to one dimension next an exhaustive_search is then conducted with these newly_formed one dimensional variables and the model that predicts disease status the best by cross_validation and permutation_testing will be selected proposed another exhaustive_search method_named boolean operation based screening and testing boost which screens data using an upper_bound of the likelihood followed by an exhaustive_search although exhaustive_search is the most straightforward idea that has been helpful in many complex_diseases the recent high_dimensional containing up to one million snps that lead to the so_called small_sample problem e g the small n number of samples large p number of snps problem prohibit its practical_application in the real_world gwas field because implementation requires tremendous computing_resources and takes an unusually long time stochastic_methods detect epistasis via random_sampling that can greatly speeds up the process bayesian epistasis association_mapping beam is one example this method detects suspected snps and their interactions via a bayesian partitioning model and computes the posterior_probabilities of the candidates belonging to true associated snps and epistasis via markov_chain beam significantly_outperformed existing_methods as tested on an age_related gwas dataset however stochastic_methods are criticized for using random elements in each iteration which results in a dramatic loss of power as the search_space expands exponentially with the development of machine_learning technologies an increasing number of statistical_learning methods have been used in the gwas field such as regression based_algorithms bayesian_networks bns and others the regression_based method is regarded as the most natural first line approach for modeling and testing genetic effects van steen north et_al applied the logistic regression_approach to casecontrol association studies involving two causative loci tried a different solution which constructed a bn to model the association between snps and disease that was subsequently evaluated by a series of scoring criteria however these traditional statistical machine_learning still suffer from the small_sample problem and generally perform poorly with realworld gwas datasets to solve this problem other machine_learning based_methods introduced heuristic information to speed up the process such as antepiseeker wang et_al developed the antepiseeker method using heuristic_search based on the ant colony optimization aco algorithm and performed better than other methods on the rheumatoid_arthritis dataset from the wellcome_trust machine_learning based_methods are generally acknowledged to have variable strengths and weakness due to their formation from different aspects a number of studies have revealed that these approaches perform inconsistently with different disease_models and that even the same approach will often vary when applied to different disease_models one important_reason is that existing_approaches were constructed based on a single correlation model or objective_function for snps and disease considering the potential preference of the correlation model and the complexity of different disease_models a single objective method will understandably not work well in general in this study we proposed a new multi objective heuristic_search approach based on the aco algorithm called macoed we conducted experiments on a wide_range of synthetic datasets and achieved good power and time performance we also compared macoed with the representative methods including antepiseeker beam and boost and found that our method showed improved power in detecting correct epistatic_interactions with different disease_models to the best of our knowledge we are the first to implement a multiobjective optimization framework based on swarm intelligence optimization in the gwas field the success of macoed is primarily due to its complementary multi objective and pareto optimization which increases sensitivity and minimizes false_positives on the other hand our new memory based strategy in the aco algorithm also helps to increase the final power although the results demonstrate that our method_performs on both simulated_datasets and a real gwas dataset some limitations remain the performance of logistic_regression a parametric method partly depends on the mathematical_model adopted in the association study based on the study by north et_al different logistic_models used in the first stage of macoed may partly affect the results of non dominated solutions another criticism of logistic_regression is that the number of parameters in models will increase exponentially when the number of locimodel is a locus multiplicative model model is a locus threshold model and model is a locus concrete model refer to supplementary_information for more results of different parameter_settings
