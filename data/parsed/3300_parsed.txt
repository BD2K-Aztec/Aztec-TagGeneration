sequence_analysis nsite nsiteh and nsitem computer tools for studying transcription regulatory_elements gene_transcription is mostly conducted through interactions of various transcription_factors and their binding_sites on dna regulatory_elements res today we are still far from understanding the real regulatory content of promoter_regions computer methods for identification of res remain a widely used tool for studying and understanding transcriptional_regulation mechanisms the nsite nsiteh and nsitem programs perform searches for statistically_significant non random motifs of known human animal and plant one box and composite res in a single genomic_sequence in a pair of aligned homologous_sequences and in a set of functionally_related sequences respectively availability_and pre compiled executables built under commonly used operating_systems are available for download by visitingtranscription regulatory_elements res bound by transcription_factors tfs are main players in gene_expression gr nberg and hahn although a large set of experimentally_identified res tfs has been collected in several databases the real re content of promoters of most genes remains unidentified established computational re identification algorithms are predominantly based on one of two approaches i the search for motifs of known res or ii the comparative_analysis of homologous_sequences aimed to discover new res the first type of methods uses regulatory_site and or iupac consensus_sequences or position_weight one of challenges in re detection is to estimate the statistical_significance of located motifs to distinguish them from random matches in addition in some cases tfs bind a composite re a pair of dna motifs with a spacer sequence of variable_length between them rather than a single short dna region here we present nsite nsiteh and nsitem a set of programs to predict both single and composite res in query_sequences and estimate their statistical_significance previously we proposed a probabilistic_model that computes the probability of observing given sequence_motifs or consensuses in random nucleotide_sequences of the same length and nucleotide frequencies as a query_sequence the model also estimates the expected number of such motifs in random_sequences in particular the model assumes that because res are small that numbers rather than frequencies of nucleotides should be used to describe re consensus_sequences see also supplementary_material s these statistical estimations provide the opportunity to find non random similarities unlikely to have occurred by chance between a set of functional_motifs and regions of an analyzed sequence by applying this approach we developed the nsite nsiteh and nsitem computer v c the author published_by
