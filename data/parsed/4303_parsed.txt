snipa an interactive genetic_variant centered annotation browser motivation linking genes and functional information to genetic_variants identified by association studies remains difficult resources containing extensive genomic_annotations are available but often not fully utilized due to heterogeneous data_formats to enhance their accessibility we integrated many annotation datasets into a user_friendly webserver availability_and http www snipa org genome_wide gwas and next_generation ngs are performed_routinely to identify genetic_variants and novel genes implicated in both common and rare human_diseases a key_step in translating results from such studies into a better understanding of molecular disease mechanisms and ultimately into clinical_applications is the prioritization of potentially functional_variants that may be active in vivo to this end comprehensive collection and evaluation of existing functional_annotation from genetic informatics and experimental resources is essential this comprises the integration of data and knowledge across multiple levels including the variant the gene and the chromatin level several large resources ensembl ucsc ncbi etc aim at providing genome_wide genome level annotation tracks from an extensive set of resources however retrieving statistical and functional_annotation relevant at the single nucleotide level remains difficult for instance common genome_browsers often display single_nucleotide snvs as thin bars that trail away in the wealth of other annotation tracks and are even less prepared to display statistics such as linkage_disequilibrium ld relationships between variants this limits visual distinction of relevant variants from those without relevant annotations and leaves the complex task of aggregating position based data to the researcher variantcentered resources on the other hand typically concentrate on specific types of data such as amino_acid changes expression_quantitative eqtls trait associations or regulatory effect predictions moreover these annotations are often presented in resource specific data_structures for individual inspection of single variants both resource types are extremely_valuable however for simultaneous processing of larger variant sets collection and examination of annotations from different data_sources quickly becomes cumbersome this presents a major_bottleneck in genome_wide of genetic_influences on human traits since the collection of such evidences is the key to understanding the effects of phenotype linked genetic_variants here we propose snipa a web_service offering variant centered genome browsing and interactive visualization_tools tailored for easy inspection of many variants in their locus context mechanistic characterization of variants identified by genetic_studies is the key to understanding molecular disease mechanisms snipa combines a comprehensive set of genomic_annotations with a genetic_variant based genome_browser to simplify the task of variant annotation snipa as well as all underlying data is freely_available to the scientific_community commercial use may be limited by third_party constraints and will be automatically updated following the ensembl releases a method and server for predicting damaging missense_mutations nat methods the snipa variant browser shows variants top genes center and regulatory_regions bottom top level information is available in mouse over tooltips for all plot elements as shown here for the query snp_rs the example highlights the value of variant centered accumulation of annotations rs is associated with the concentration of a lipid metabolite as well as with the expression levels of two genes_encoding involved in lipid_metabolism fads and the gene coding for ldl_receptor a major regulator of cholesterol_homeostasis furthermore the variant was linked to the response to lipid_lowering statins which target hmg_coa regulated by the ldl receptorsnipa an interactive genetic_variant centered annotation browser
