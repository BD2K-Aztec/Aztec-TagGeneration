protein contact_prediction by integrating joint evolutionary coupling analysis and supervised_learning motivation protein contact_prediction is important for protein_structure and functional study both evolutionary coupling ec analysis and supervised_machine have been developed making use of different information_sources however contact_prediction is still challenging especially for proteins without a large number of sequence homologs results this article_presents a group graphical lasso ggl method for contact_prediction that integrates joint multi family ec analysis and supervised_learning to improve accuracy on proteins without many sequence homologs different from existing single family ec analysis that uses residue coevolution information in only the target protein_family our joint ec analysis uses residue coevo lution in both the target family and its related families which may have divergent sequences but similar folds to implement this we model a set of related protein_families using gaussian graph ical models and then coestimate their parameters by maximum_likelihood subject to the constraint that these parameters shall be similar to some degree our ggl method can also integrate supervised_learning methods to further improve accuracy experiments show that our method outper forms existing_methods on proteins without thousands of sequence homologs and that our method performs better on both conserved and family specific_contacts availability_and see http raptorx uchicago edu contactmap for a web_server implementing the method protein contacts contain important information for protein_folding and recent works indicate that one correct long_range contact for every residues may allow accurate topology level modeling thanks to high_throughput and better statistical and optimization techniques evolutionary coupling ec analysis for contact_prediction has made good progress which makes de_novo prediction of some large proteins possible for example the baker group successfully predicted the fold of a casp target t with amino_acids using predicted contacts nevertheless contact prediction_accuracy is still low even if only the top l l is the sequence_length predicted contacts are evaluated existing contact prediction_methods belong to roughly two categories i ec analysis methods such as that make use of multiple_sequence and ii supervised_machine such as svmseq nncon svmcon cmappro that predict contacts from a variety of informationincluding mutual_information and sequence_profiles in addition a couple of methods also use physical constraints such as phycmap and astro fold metapsicov is a recent supervised_learning method that predicts contacts by integrating four ec analysis methods and lots of non coevolutionary information residue ec analysis is a pure sequence_based unsupervised method that predicts contacts by detecting coevolved residues from the multiple_sequence msa of a single protein_family this is based upon an observation that a pair of coevolved residues is often found to be spatially close in the three_dimensional structure mutual_information mi is a local statistical_method used to measure residue coevolution strength but it cannot tell apart direct and indirect residue interaction and thus has low prediction_accuracy along with many more sequences are available global statistical_methods such as maximum_entropy and probabilistic_graphical are developed to infer residue coevolution from msa these global methods can differentiate direct from indirect residue couplings and thus are more accurate than mi see for an excellent review of ec analysis representative tools of ec analysis include evfold psicov gremlin and plmdca supervised_machine make use of mi sequence_profile and other protein features as opposed to ec analysis that makes use of only residue co evolution experiments show that due to use of more information supervised_learning may outperform ec methods for proteins with few sequence homologs recently a few groups such as dncon cmappro and pconsc have applied deep_learning to contact_prediction and reported performance improvement in this article we present a new method coindca coestimation of inverse matrices for direct coupling analysis for contact_prediction that conducts joint multifamily ec analysis through group graphical lasso ggl which is an extension of the graphical lasso formulation employed by psicov the underlying intuition for joint ec analysis is that distantly_related families with divergent sequences may share similar contact_maps and we can leverage this by enforcing contact_map consistency to improve accuracy supervised_learning uses different information_sources than ec analysis so their combination should also lead to better prediction_accuracy the experiments presented here show that our method outperforms existing ec or supervised_machine regardless of the number of non redundant sequence homologs available for a target protein under prediction and that our method not only performs better on conserved contacts but also on family specific_contacts we also find out that contact_prediction may be worsened by merging multiple related families into a single one followed by single family ec analysis or by consensus of single family ec analysis results we use three datasets to evaluate the performance of our method one is a subset of the benchmark used in the psicov paper consisting of pfam families each of which has at least one auxiliary family as shown in when no auxiliary families are available our method becomes normal graphical lasso with supervised prediction as prior by considering only the pfam families with auxiliary families we can evaluate the impact of auxiliary families the casp and casp_targets form another two test_sets but many targets have no auxiliary families see the supplementary_material for more results this article has presented a ggl method to predict contacts by exploring joint multi family ec analysis and supervised machine_learning ec analysis and supervised_learning are currently two major methods for contact_prediction but they use different information_sources our joint ec analysis predicts contacts in a target family by analyzing residue co evolution information in a set of related protein_families which may share similar contact_maps in order to effectively integrate_information across multiple families we use ggl to estimate the joint probability_distribution of multiple related families by a set of correlated gaussian models experiments show that the combination of joint ec analysis with supervised machine_learning can significantly improve contact_prediction and that our method even outperforms single family ec analysis on protein_families with a large number of sequence homologs we have also shown that contact_prediction cannot be improved by a simple method such as family merging and majority_voting of single family ec analysis results these simple methods may improve_prediction for highly_conserved contacts at the cost of family specific_contacts our method can be further improved for example similar to gremlin and plmdca we may relax the gaussian assumption to improve prediction_accuracy this article uses an entry wise l norm to penalize contact_map inconsistency among related protein_families there may be other penalty functions that can more accurately quantify contact_map similarity between two families as a function of sequence_similarity and thus further improve contact_prediction it may further improve contact_prediction by integrating other supervised_learning methods such as cmappro nncon and dncon or even other ec methods into our ggl framework in this paper we use pfam to define a protein_family because it is manually_curated and very accurate there are also other criteria to define a protein_family for example scop defines a protein_family based upon structure information and thus classifies protein_domains into much fewer families than pfam in our experiment the average structure similarity measured by tmscore between a target pfam family and its auxiliary pfam families is only around that is many auxiliary families are not highly_similar to its target families even by the scop definition indeed some auxiliary families are only similar to the target family at the scop fold level that is even a remotely related protein_family may provide information useful for contact_prediction we can further extend our method to predict contacts of all the protein_families simultaneously instead of one by one by joint ec analysis across the whole protein_family universe first we can use a graph to model the whole pfam_database each vertex representing one pfam family and an edge indicating that two families may be related then we can use a graph of correlated ggms to model the whole pfam graph each ggm for one vertex the ggms of two vertices in an edge are correlated together through the alignment of their respective protein_families by this way the residue co evolution information in one family can be passed onto any family that is connected through a path as such we may predict the contacts of one family by making use of information in all the path connected families by enforcing this global consistency we should be able to further improve ec analysis for contact_prediction however to simultaneously estimate the parameters of all the ggms a large amount of computational power will be needed such an idea is similar in spirit to the global trace graph method described by
