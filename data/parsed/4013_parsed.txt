sequence_analysis rilogo visualizing rna_rna with the increasing amount of newly_discovered non_coding the interactions between rna_molecules become an increasingly important aspect for characterizing their functionality many computational_tools have been developed to predict the formation of duplexes between two rnas either based on single sequences or alignments of homologous_sequences here we present rilogo a program to visualize inter and intramolecular base_pairing between two rna_molecules the input for rilogo is a pair of structure annotated sequences or alignments in the latter case rilogo displays the alignments in the form of sequence_logos including the mutual_information of base_paired columns we also introduce two novel mutual_information based measures that weigh the covariance information by the evolutionary_distances of the aligned sequences we show that the new measures have an increased accuracy compared with previous mutual_information measures availability_and rilogo is freely_available as a stand alone program and is accessible via a web_server at http rth dk resources rilogo contact an increasing amount of functional non_coding ncrnas has been identified in recent_years and computational predictions of possibly functional structured rnas yield vast_amounts of candidate rna genes typically rna_molecules interact with proteins or with other rna_molecules including messenger_rnas by forming intermolecular duplexes computational predictions of rnarna_interactions usually follow the thermodynamic energy models for the secondary_structure of a single rna_sequence algorithms for the simultaneous prediction of intra and intermolecular structure between two given sequences have a higher prediction_accuracy but also have a high time complexity another class of algorithms only focuses on the prediction of intermolecular duplexes between two rna_sequences while neglecting possible intramolecular base_pairings and achieves linear time complexity in the best case when several homologous_sequences are available consensus structure_prediction can also be applied for predicting intermolecular base_pairs for example petcofold first predicts intra_molecular pairing and afterwards intermolecular pairing in the previously unpaired regions another approach also based on multiple_sequence is ripalign which computes inter and intramolecular base_pairs simultaneously using a partition_function algorithm the sequence pattern of a given multiple dna or protein alignment is easily visualized by sequence_logos each alignment column is represented by a stack of letters from the dna protein alphabets where the overall height of the stack denotes the shannon information content of that position and the size of a letter denotes its frequency in that column the most frequent letter is placed on top of the stack several programs were developed to automatically create sequence_logos from a given input alignment when studying rna alignments the secondary_structure of the rnas needs to be considered structure logos include the annotation of base_pairing and the mutual_information mi of two paired alignment positions in the logo itself single or consensus rna_structures are usually plotted in a circular planar graph e g varna or r r rnalogo combines a planar plot of the consensus secondary_structure with stacks of letters for each base and displays the mi of base_pairs d logos are plotted by correlogo however these programs do not include rnarna_interactions rna_structures and interactions can be visualized by arcs or lines connecting pairing bases in their primary sequences e g in here we introduce rilogo which combines sequence_logos with an arc representation of the secondary_structure of both intra and intermolecular base_pairs of two interacting rna genes additionally the mi of base_pairs is calculated and included in the logo by colouring the arcs or adding an m character on top of the letter stacks with a height corresponding to the mi it has been suggested that measures including phylogenetic_information are the most powerful however the widely used measures ignore information from the phylogenetic_relationships between the sequences thus we introduce two novel mutual_information based measures which use pairwise evolutionary_distances between sequences in order to give different weights to the to whom correspondence should be addressed the author published_by all_rights for permissions please email journals permissions_oup com covariance information contained in individual sequences from the alignment an early version of rilogo was previously used to display structure predictions in the petcofold web_server here we make the enhanced version of rilogo available both as a stand alone program and via a web_server it now includes our new evolutionary mutual_information measures customization options and is freely_available under the gnu lgpl rilogo visualizes two rna sequence_alignments by sequence_logos their intra and intermolecular base_pairing and the mutual_information of base_pairs it also introduces two novel mutual_information based measures treemi and treemi wp that perform better than previous measures by including additional information from evolutionary_distances rilogo is accessible via a web_server and its output can easily be customized we publish the stand alone version of rilogo under the gnu lgpl_license i e it is allowed to be explicitly integrated in other software servers to display rnarna_interactions and sequence_logos intramolecular arcs and intermolecular lines base_pairs are coloured by their mutual_information using treemi wp in log scale the yaxes show the summed information content in bits of
