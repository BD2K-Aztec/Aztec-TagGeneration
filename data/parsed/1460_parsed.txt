data_and domain adaptation for semantic role labeling in the biomedical_domain motivation semantic role labeling srl is a natural_language nlp task that extracts a shallow meaning representation from free_text sentences several efforts to create srl systems for the biomedical_domain have been made during the last few years however state of the art srl relies on manually_annotated training instances which are rare and expensive to prepare in this article we address srl for the biomedical_domain as a domain adaptation problem to leverage existing srl resources from the newswire domain results we evaluate the performance of three recently_proposed domain adaptation algorithms for srl our results show that by using domain adaptation the cost of developing an srl system for the biomedical_domain can be reduced significantly using domain adaptation our system can achieve of the performance with as little as annotated target_domain abstracts availability our biokit system that performs srl in the biomedical_domain as described in this article is implemented in python and c and operates under the linux operating system biokit can be downloaded at http nlp comp nus edu sg software the domain adaptation software is available for download atadvances in biology and life_sciences have led to an exponential_growth in the amount of biomedical_literature thus automatic information_retrieval ir and information_extraction ie methods become more and more important to help researchers to keep track of the latest_developments in their field current ir is still mostly limited to keyword_search and unable to infer the relationship between two entities in a text a system that is able to understand how words in a sentence are related could greatly_increase the quality of ie and would allow ir to handle more complex user queries semantic role labeling srl is a shallow semantic_processing task that has become increasingly popular in the natural_language nlp community over the last few years the task is to to whom correspondence should be addressed identify all parts of a sentence that represent arguments for a given predicate and subsequently label each argument with a semantic role roughly speaking srl can be thought of as the task of finding the words that answer simple questions of the form who did what to whom when and where the input to the srl system is a single sentence and a predicate in that sentence the output is the same sentence but with labeled semantic roles consider the following example input transcription_factor in this example the semantic role arg is the cause of stimulate and the semantic role arg is the thing stimulated see section for a detailed_description of semantic roles this information is most valuable for ie and other tasks such as question answering and summarization traditionally most work in srl has focused on documents from the newswire domain while srl works well on test sentences from the same domain the models show a sharp performance drop when they are tested on a different domain although there have been a number of efforts to apply srl to the biomedical_domain in recent_years the development of state of the art srl systems for the biomedical_domain is hampered by the lack of large biomedical corpora that are labeled with semantic roles the creation of such corpora is time consuming and expensive in this article we address srl on biomedical_text as a domain adaptation problem the goal is to adapt an srl system for the newswire domain where a large annotated corpus is available to the biomedical_domain where only a small amount of annotated text is available this way we can leverage existing corpora from the newswire domain and significantly reduce the cost of developing an srl system for the biomedical_domain the main contributions of this article are bullet it is the first work that performs a comparative_evaluation of the performance of three recently_proposed domain adaptation algorithms on the task of srl for biomedical_text bullet it is the first work that investigates the extent of manual_annotation needed to port an srl system trained on newswire text to biomedical_text by explicitly determining theto our knowledge this is the first detailed study of domain adaptation for srl in biomedical_text and our work demonstrates that domain adaptation can greatly reduce the cost of developing biomedical srl systems this section_presents the results of our experiments before we started experiments on the target_domain data we performed a test on the propbank corpus to ensure that our srl system represents a strong baseline we trained the classifier on sections and tested on section which is the standard evaluation setting the results are f measure for argument identification accuracy for argument classification and f measure for the combined srl task this confirms that our model performs comparably with other state of the art srl systems in this article we study the effect of domain adaptation for srl in the biomedical_domain we evaluate three different domain adaptation algorithms on the bioprop corpus using a competitive
