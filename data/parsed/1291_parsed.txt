deconvolving molecular_signatures of interactions between microbial colonies motivation the interactions between microbial colonies through chemical signaling are not well understood a microbial colony can use different molecules to inhibit or accelerate the growth of other colonies a better understanding of the molecules involved in these interactions could lead to advancements in health and medicine imaging mass_spectrometry ims applied to co cultured microbial_communities aims to capture the spatial characteristics of the colonies molecular fingerprints these data are high_dimensional and require computational_analysis methods to interpret results here we present a dictionary_learning method that deconvolves spectra of different molecules from ims data we call this method molecular dictionary_learning moldl unlike standard dictionary_learning methods which assume gaussian distributed data our method uses the poisson_distribution to capture the count nature of the mass_spectrometry data also our method incorporates universally_applicable information on common ion types of molecules in maldi_mass this greatly_reduces model parameterization and increases deconvolution accuracy by eliminating spurious solutions moreover our method leverages the spatial nature of ims data by assuming that nearby locations share similar abundances thus avoiding overfitting to noise tests on simulated_datasets show that this method has good performance in recovering molecule dictionaries we also tested our method on real_data measured on a microbial_community composed of two species we confirmed through follow_up validation experiments that our method recovered true and complete signatures of molecules these results indicate that our method can discover molecules in ims data reliably and hence can help advance the study of interaction of microbial colonies we ran our method on three synthetic datasets to show its performance moldl was then applied to two real_datasets and evaluated based on its ability to recover dictionary elements corresponding to known molecular_species in the sample in this article we present moldl a dictionary_learning method aimed at summarizing maldi_ims data this method deconvolves m z signals into components that belong to different molecular_species our method models the data as poisson distributed incorporates the possible ion types of maldi_mass leverages the spatial dependency of ims data and can learn the number of molecular_species present in the maldi_ims data automatically we implemented this method and develop a straightforward method for choosing its hyperparameters we tested it on three synthetic and two real experimental_datasets and showed that compared with prior approaches our method provides superior recovery of molecular_signatures
