systems_biology nozzle a report generation toolkit for data analysis_pipelines we have developed nozzle an r package that provides an application_programming to generate html reports with dynamic user_interface elements nozzle was designed to facilitate summarization and rapid browsing of complex results in data analysis_pipelines where multiple analyses are performed frequently on big datasets the package can be applied to any project where user_friendly reports need to be created availability the r package is available on cran at http cran r project org packagenozzle r examples and additional materials are available at http gdac broadinstitute org nozzle the source_code is also available atowing to the increasing size and complexity of biological data a considerable portion of bioinformatics analyses are implemented as semi_automated pipelines the main task of these pipelines is to control the flow of large_datasets through a series of analysis modules which are often independent applications these analyses typically need to be performed repeatedly over time as data are accumulated gradually genepattern galaxy and taverna are popular workflow management systems used to implement such pipelines for high_throughput analysis of genomics data another common approach is to use shell scripting to tie together different tools into an analysis_pipeline although pipelines greatly reduce the effort required to apply different algorithms to large_datasets they often result in a multitude of figures lists and tables at varying levels of detail this presents significant challenges for the biologists who must sift through a large amount of information to identify potentially interesting_findings in the use case we describe each run of the pipeline results in more than figures and tables in some cases this problem can be addressed by feeding these results into a database with a dynamic query interface although databases are capable of supporting powerful exploration tools and interactive_visualizations their development and maintenance require a significant investment of resources and their data model is less flexible than reports this is particularly problematic when the tools in the pipeline are replaced as requirements change alternatively the results can be summarized in reports several r libraries exist that can be used to generate reports for analysis_pipelines r html and hwriter http cran r project org packagehwriter are low_level libraries for writing html files sweave knitr and related tools for reproducible_research can be used to generate pdf or html documents from within r scripts however none of these tools provide support in generating reports with dynamic user_interface components for the presentation of extensive and complex analysis results to address these limitations we have developed the nozzle r package which supports pipeline developers in creating comprehensive and user_friendly html reports to describe the results of analysis_pipelines sections containing significant results by highlighting the corresponding section this is particularly useful in comprehensive reports with many sections or in situations when readers must frequently review large_numbers of reports and would like to focus first on significant findings results can also be linked to supplementary_information and d which may contain any report elements including sections figures and tables these are shown on demand using a split screen approach allowing the readers to view main results and supplementary_information side_by this is a powerful_tool for creating reports that focus on the key_findings while still providing access to more detailed information
