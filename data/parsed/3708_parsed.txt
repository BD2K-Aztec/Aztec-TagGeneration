gene_expression probabilistic analysis of gene_expression from heterogeneous tissues a web_application for motivation tissue_heterogeneity arising from multiple cell_types is a major confounding_factor in experiments that focus on studying cell_types e g their expression_profiles in isolation although sample_heterogeneity can be addressed by manual microdissection prior to conducting experiments computational treatment on heterogeneous measurements have become a reliable alternative to perform this microdissection in silico favoring computation over manual purification has its advantages such as time consumption measuring responses of multiple cell_types simultaneously keeping samples intact of external_perturbations and unaltered yield of molecular content results we formalize a probabilistic_model dsection and show with simulations as well as with real microarray_data that dsection attains increased modeling accuracy in terms of i estimating cell_type proportions of heterogeneous tissue_samples ii estimating replication variance and iii identifying differential_expression across cell_types under various experimental_conditions as our reference we use the corresponding linear_regression which mirrors the performance of the majority of current non probabilistic modeling_approaches availability and software all codes are written in matlab and are freely_available upon request as well as at the project web pagefor being able to fully utilize capabilities of high_throughput measurement techniques that often have to deal with physically small but also heterogeneous tissue_samples attention should be paid as to how heterogeneity the presence of multiple cell_types in tissue is addressed in many studies the focus of interest hovers around identifying behavioral_differences across cell_types and in such cases sample_heterogeneity clearly has a confounding_effect on downstream experiments and analysis to whom correspondence should be addressed although laser_capture lcm offers a direct way to address tissue_heterogeneity by allowing for isolation of morphologically distinguishable cell_types there are occasions when it is not feasible yield of biological content e g mrna for conducting experiments becomes consequently lowered which often needs to be compensated for with either more sensitive measurement devices or amplification of molecular quantities however amplification of mrna from small albeit pure cell samples has its shortcomings most notably nonlinearity obscuring the underlying profiles for distinct cell_types several authors have already studied performing computational microdissection for heterogeneous tissues and proposed promising methods for microarray_expression initial attempts stem from who proposed a linear_model for estimating both cell_type proportions and cell_type gene_expression the model assumes that as prior information there exist known exclusively_expressed genes for each cell_type subsequent studies have then demonstrated that the linearity assumption and prior information on either gene_expression cell_type proportions or both can yield meaningful interpretations for the constituents of heterogeneous tissues in real experiments conducted on the basis of heterogeneous tissue_samples having precise prior information is unrealistic even though current models consistently rely on such information we incorporate this missing functionality into the already familiar linear regression_framework through bayesian prior densities whose shapes reflect the uncertainties associated with the prior information such as cell_type proportions or cell_type expression_profiles for all model_parameters an efficient markov_chain mcmc sampler is proposed in addition to existing microdissection models we further assume that the heterogeneous tissues have been measured under various experimental_conditions having a possible impact on cell_type expression_profiles as cell_type profiles are assumed to be different across both cell_types and experimental_conditions assessment of statistically_significant differential_expression is performed with the two sample t test though other tests for differential_expression can be used we use simulated and real_gene for assessing the performance of the bayesian_model in contrast to a linearpage in computing the forthcoming results with dsection we used the following values for controlling parameters of our model namely we set peakedness around prior cell_type proportions to w peakedness of transition kernel to w burnin period to b iterations and chain_length to s iterations along sampling we also computed and visualized estimates of autocovariance functions of the sampled parameters which indicated that our choice for the chain_length was reasonable i e covariance diminished relatively rapidly as lag was increased data not shown
