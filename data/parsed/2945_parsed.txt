structural_bioinformatics metric learning for enzyme active_site search motivation finding functionally analogous enzymes based on the local structures of active_sites is an important problem conventional methods use templates of local structures to search for analogous sites but their performance depends on the selection of atoms for inclusion in the templates results the automatic selection of atoms so that site matches can be discriminated from mismatches the algorithm provides not only good predictions but also some insights into which atoms are important for the prediction our experimental_results suggest that the metric learning automatically provides more effective templates than those whose atoms are selected manually the influx of newly_sequenced has sparked the development of function prediction_methods that use global sequence structure comparison for the annotation of genes and proteins for enzyme proteins many such methods attempt to predict functions from protein_sequences and structures based on the enzyme commission ec classification_scheme the ec classification_scheme which has been used worldwide for many years is based mainly on the whole chemical_structures of substrates and products and on the cofactors involved however because the ec classification_scheme neglects protein_sequence and structure information it is sometimes difficult to detect a correlation between an enzyme sequence structure and functions based on it for instance some homologous enzymes that are a result of divergent_evolution from the same ancestral enzyme might catalyze different reactions whereas some non homologous enzymes from different superfamilies might catalyze the same reaction because of the convergent_evolution the enzyme pair trypsin and subtilisin which shares the ser his asp catalytic_triad is a typical example of analogous enzymes produced by convergent_evolution analyzed the catalytic to whom correspondence should be addressed mechanisms of enzymes mainly hydrolases and transferases from superfamilies which are manually compiled in the enzyme_reaction database ezcatdb analysis of the enzyme_reactions has revealed several analogous reactions that are observed in nonhomologous enzymes ezcatdb also provides a hierarchic classification of enzyme_reactions rlcp which clusters the same reaction types together based on basic reaction r ligand group involved in catalysis l type of catalytic_mechanism c and residue cofactors located on proteins p consequently both the homologous reaction and the analogous reaction can be clustered together in the rlcp classification if they share the same catalytic_mechanism and the same type of catalytic_site results of a recent study also suggest that such cases of active_sites shared by analogous enzymes are not rare consequently for enzyme_function prediction it is necessary to examine the specific local structures of the active_sites that might reflect enzyme functions rather than the global structures such as the domain level or the chain level regarding local structure comparison methods to detect similar active_sites several template based_methods have been reported those template based_methods search for the occurrence of a predefined template structure that consists of active_site residue atoms within target protein_structures however some questions and problems remain in relation to the templatebased methods i the prediction_accuracy might be dependent on the number and types of atoms in the templates because it is sometimes very difficult to determine which atoms in the catalytic_site should be included in the templates even experts on enzyme structure and function might have to create the best template through trial and error ii some atoms in the catalytic_site might be more important for the catalytic_reaction than other atoms are according to a previous_report the sidechain of catalytic_residues is used much more frequently than the mainchain only moreover charged and or polar_residues tend to be involved in catalysis are such catalytically necessary atoms also important for the templates iii these template based_methods also yield a huge number of mismatches along with site matches is it possible to reduce the number of mismatches in this study we developed a new metric learning algorithm to detect catalytic_sites effectively in terms of search accuracy of rlcp classification one famous template based method tess uses geometric hashing to
