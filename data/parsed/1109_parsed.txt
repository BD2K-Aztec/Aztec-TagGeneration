genome_analysis computational_identification of protein binding_sites on rnas using high_throughput rna_structure probing_data motivation high_throughput has been used to probe rna_structures by treating rnas with reagents that preferentially cleave or mark certain nucleotides according to their local structures followed by sequencing of the resulting fragments the data produced contain valuable information for studying various rna properties results we developed methods for statistically modeling these structure probing_data and extracting structural_features from them we show that the extracted_features can be used to predict rna zip codes in yeast regions bound by the she complex in asymmetric localization the prediction_accuracy was better than using raw rna probing_data or sequence_features we further demonstrate the use of the extracted_features in identifying binding_sites of rna_binding from whole transcriptome global photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced cross_linking and immunopurification gpar clip data availability the source_code of our implemented methods is available atnext generation sequencing_technologies have created opportunities for studying many diverse properties of nucleic_acids in a high_throughput manner recently it has been used to probe rna_structures which reveals interesting_properties of rna including the largely_unexplored mrna structures one method involves treating rnas with an enzyme that preferentially cleaves either double_stranded such as rnase v or single_stranded such as s nuclease and p nuclease nucleic_acids and sequencing the resulting fragments paired and unpaired nucleotides can then be deduced by comparing the distributions of read_counts under the two different enzymatic treatments or by comparing with a control another method is based on selective hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer_extension shape chemistry rnas are treated with a shape reagent which chemically modifies the hydroxyl_groups with reactivity at individual nucleotides depending on their local spatial disorder the treated rnas are then reverse_transcribed and subsequently sequenced because reverse transcription is blocked by the shape adducts the distribution of read_counts can serve as an indicator of local structures for both methods specialized algorithms have been proposed for processing the sequencing_reads and analyzing the read_counts these algorithms were designed to consider special_properties of the corresponding experiments for example in shape sequencing reverse transcription could be stopped either by a shape adduct or due to natural polymerase drop off different statistical_models were designed for these processes for estimating the reactivity of the shape reagent at each nucleotide in addition to these method specific factors read_counts may also be affected by biases common to many sequencing protocols for example gc_rich regions may have more reads than at rich regions primer binding and amplification efficiency also depend on local sequences here we show that statistical_models that explicitly consider potential sequence specific_biases can be used to fit these highthroughput structure probing_data the effectiveness of our models is demonstrated by a better goodness_of to the data than some other models based on a cross_validation procedure to further explore the utility of our models we show that features of structure probing_data extracted by our models can be used to locate zipcodes on yeast mrnas which are regions bound by the she complex in asymmetric localization previous_studies that localization activity depends on secondary_structure a short sequence_motif involving a to whom correspondence should be addressed cga triplet in a loop and a conserved cytosine six bases away in another loop has also been shown to be necessary for bud localization of several rnas nonetheless these criteria are not sufficient to identify all zipcodes it has been suggested that recognition and transport depend not only on the zipcodes but also on adjacent sequence and structural_features we show that our extracted_features could help distinguish zipcodes from other regions on the same mrnas with good accuracy there exist experimental methods for transcriptome_wide identification of rna regions bound by a specific rna_binding rbp the main idea is to crosslink rbps with rnas followed by immunoprecipitation clip and microarray_analysis or sequencing the latter includes methods known as hitsclip clip_seq par_clip and rip_seq as these large_scale datasets become available for more rbps it is interesting to ask whether different rbps recognize similar features at their binding_sites it has recently been shown that a common set of features can be used to identify rnas targeted by a group of different rbps although in the same study it is also shown that if the training_set lacks any known targets of an rbp the resulting statistical_model is less capable of identifying its targets indicating that the model may not have captured the binding_site signals recognized by all rbps here we use our extracted_features from rna_structure probing_data to study this question in a different way and ask if it is possible to build statistical_models that can distinguish general rbp binding_sites from other regions using a wholetranscriptome dataset of rbp binding_sites we show that such a model can be constructed with high distinguishing power using a small set of features which supports the idea that different rbps may share similar recognition signals of their targets
