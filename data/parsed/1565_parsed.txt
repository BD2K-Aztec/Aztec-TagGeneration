genome_analysis egob eukaryotic gene_order browser a large number of genomes have been sequenced allowing a range of comparative_studies here we present the eukaryotic gene_order browser with information on the order of protein and non coding rna ncrna genes of different eukaryotic_species the browser is able to display a gene of interest together with its genomic_context in all species where that gene is present thereby questions related to the evolution of gene organization and non random gene_order may be examined the browser also provides access to data collected on pairs of adjacent genes that are evolutionarily_conserved availability egob as well as underlying data are freely_available atthe large number of eukaryotic genome_sequences currently available has made extensive comparative_analysis possible for instance studies of the conservation of gene_order will help to understand genome_evolution in general and what factors restrict the shuffling of genes databases and genome_browsers have therefore emerged to compare genomes and gene_order in different species some focus on specific organelles such as the ogre and plastid gene_order database while others cover a specific phylogenetic_group like ygob and genomicus typically gene comparisons between species are possible we here present the eukaryotic gene_order browser egob which is useful for comparing and displaying genes with respect to their genomic environment there are features that distinguishes egob from previously available gene_order browsers first non coding rna ncrna genes are considered in addition to protein_coding secondly gene orthologs homologs are identified using both orthomcl and pfam thirdly we consider a wide_range of eukaryotic species_representing all important eukaryotic phylogenetic_groups metazoans the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis fungal_species viridiplantae alveolata heterokonts amoebozoans euglenozoans and the three deep branching organisms giardia_lamblia naegleria gruberi and trichomonas_vaginalis to whom correspondence should be addressed
