data_and on the discovery of hospital_admission patterns a clarification contact ognjen arandjelvoic gmail com this article concerns my publication discovering hospital_admission patterns using models learnt from electronic hospital_records which has recently appeared in bioinformatics arandjelovi c a and the comments regarding its contributions made thereafter by lopez campos et_al lopez campos et_al begin by observing a mismatch between the descriptions of certain icd_codes as stated in my article arandjelovi c a and those published by the world_health this observation is correct and needless to say while i greatly regret the error i am genuinely grateful for having this brought to my attention so that a timely erratum can be published it is important to stress that the mismatch in question in no way affects the main content of the article its contribution or any of the results the method described in the original publication does not use any semantic_information about the codes and their meanings are stated merely for the sake of illustration and context the unfortunate error in the description of the codes is likely to have taken place in the editing stages of the original article when the presentation and the content of the relevant table and the related information in the text underwent changes several times more pertinent to the actual methodological contribution of my work are the opinions of lopez campos et_al on the manner in which the aforesaid codes are used and in particular what lopez campos et_al refer to as the intended use and the spirit of the codes there are several arguments which speak against this stance first on the fundamental philosophical level the intention behind the design per se is inherently inconsequential rather the relevant question is whether the codes such as they are contain the structure and information which permit prediction the results i present which show that the proposed_method far better prediction than more primitive modelsadapted
